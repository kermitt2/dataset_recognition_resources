<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prototype of a systemic autoimmune disease, is characterized by the production of pathogenic autoantibodies that directly or indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE, resulting in cell destruction and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>NZB/W mice spontaneously develop a disease closely resembling human SLE.</s><s>We have shown before that these mice develop both long-lived and short-lived autoreactive plasma cells, and that long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) contribute significantly to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>These LLPCs are able to induce nephritis when transferred into immunodeficient mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>As they are refractory to immunosuppressive drugs (for example, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and a combination of the two) and B cell depletion, they represent a therapeutic challenge in the treatment of SLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Autoantibodies are detectable years before the clinical onset of SLE in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and by the age of only 4 weeks in NZB/W mice ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and unpublished data).</s><s>Some of these autoantibodies are produced by LLPCs since they do not disappear upon treatment of humans or mice with drugs like cyclophosphamide <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> or rituximab <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>However, it remains controversial when this population of refractory LLPCs is established in the course of the disease.</s><s>We have previously shown that a population of autoreactive LLPCs exists in the spleen and bone marrow by week 24 of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Whether such population is established early in disease pathogenesis and no longer formed later, when constant generation of short-lived plasma cells (SLPCs) may become a hallmark of pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, remain unclear.</s><s>Alternatively, it has been proposed that a constant generation and turnover of the LLPC pool may be sustained by B cell hyperreactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, but also this hypothesis remains to be elucidated.</s><s>This is valuable information in order not to miss an 'LLPC window of opportunity' at the beginning of the disease.</s><s>Moreover, although interesting studies showed that B cells are able to repopulate the plasma cell-deficient bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, it remains rather unclear whether in autoimmunity LLPCs may be replenished from autoreactive memory B cells after therapeutic depletion of these cells.</s></p><p><s>Here, we show that LLPC generation starts very early in NZB/W F1 mice, long before clinical onset of disease.</s><s>Then, LLPC counts in the spleen plateau after about 10 weeks, but those in the bone marrow and inflamed kidney increase over lifetime.</s><s>When PCs are eliminated by bortezomib <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, LLPC counts recover within 15 days in both the spleen and bone marrow.</s><s>Thus, for persistent elimination of autoreactive LLPCs, existing LLPCs must be depleted (for example, by a cycle of bortezomib), and their regeneration must be prevented by maintenance therapy.</s><s>Maintenance therapy could be directed at eliminating precursor cells or preventing their activation.</s><s>Here, we used a combination of bortezomib with cyclophosphamide as a model to demonstrate that, in contrast to bortezomib or cyclophosphamide alone, this combination therapy achieves sustained elimination of LLPCs.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mice</head><p><s>Female NZB/W F1 mice were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions at the mouse facility of German Rheumatism Research Centre, Berlin.</s><s>All experiments were performed according to German guidelines for the performance of animal experiments and approved by the according authority (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flow cytometry and ELISPOT</head><p><s>Flow cytometric analysis of spleen and bone marrow cells was performed after two weeks of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) feeding (see below).</s><s>Staining was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The following antibodies were used for the analysis: anti-CD138 (2-218, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-MHCII (clone M5/114, DRFZ, Berlin, Germany) and anti-kappa light chain (clone 187.1, BD Pharmingen).</s><s>Cells were acquired using a FACS BD LSR II or FACSCanto II or LSRFortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA, USA).</s><s>Debris and red blood cells (RBCs) were excluded by electronic gating.</s><s>As the ratio of kappa-to lambda-producing plasma cells is 20:1 in mice, we used single intracellular staining with anti-kappa light chain to determine the number of plasma cells.</s><s>Plasma cells were identified as CD138+ and intracellular anti-kappa light chain-positive cells.</s><s>The staining was initially validated using fluorescence-minusone (FMO) controls for the two markers.</s><s>This population presents a clear bimodal expression of the markers, with no overlap of positive and negative populations, not requiring any further control for determination of positive and negative populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Within the plasma cells population, plasmablasts and newly generated plasma cells were identified as cells with the higher expression of MHC-II.</s><s>Conversely MHC-II low plasma cells were regarded as LLPCs.</s><s>The expression of MHC-II on B220-positive cells was used to determine the cutoff between high (same MHC-II expression of B220+ cells) and low (lower MHC-II expression as compared to B220+ cells) MHC-II-expressing plasma cells.</s><s>BrdU staining was performed with anti-BrdU antibody using the BD Pharmingen BrdU FlowKit™ according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</s></p><p><s>Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) analysis to determine the absolute numbers of anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, ELISPOT plates (MultiScreen™ HTS Filter Plates; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) were pre-coated with methyl-BSA (10 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 2 h at 37°C and subsequently coated with calf thymus DNA (10 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight.</s><s>Spleen, bone marrow and kidney single-cell suspensions were filtered twice through a Falcon cell strainer (70 μm), washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).</s><s>After plate blocking, two different cell dilutions were pipetted onto the plates and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO 2 .</s><s>After extensive washing, plates were incubated with biotin-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) (1 μg/ml, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) for 1 h and followed by ExtrAvidin™-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min.</s><s>The spots were developed with NBT/BCIP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and enumerated using an automated ELISPOT reader and software (AID Diagnostika, Strassberg, Germany).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell count</head><p><s>Absolute cell numbers of spleen, bone marrow and kidneys were assessed by automatic cell counting either by Schaerfe CASY Cell Counter (Schaerfe System GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany) or by MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Cologne, Germany).</s><s>Absolute plasma cell numbers were calculated based on total cell numbers (by automatic cell counting) and frequencies of cell types in each organ measured by flow cytometry.</s><s>For ELISPOT assay, the absolute numbers of ASCs per organ were calculated by the number of spots/well multiplied by the dilution factor of the cell suspension used for the assay.</s><s>The total number of bone marrow cells was calculated based on the assumption that both femoral bones contain approximately 8% of total bone marrow cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LLPC generation BrdU pulse-chase experiments</head><p><s>In the experiments analysing the generation of LLPC over the lifetime mice of different ages (4 to 32 weeks) were given BrdU in their drinking water (protected from light, 1 mg/ml + 1% glucose) for two weeks in order to determine the time point of formation of the LLPC compartment.</s><s>This made it possible to discriminate between cells generated during and before the feeding period.</s><s>As shown previously, this two-week feeding interval is sufficient for discriminating between short-and long-lived plasma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the experiments dissecting the capacity to generate LLPC at different age, mice were continuously fed BrdU for six weeks from the ages of 4 to 10 weeks (young) and 20 to 26 weeks (old).</s><s>Six weeks after the end of the feeding period, the number of surviving BrdU-positive plasma cells was measured.</s><s>These cells are LLPCs that were generated during the feeding period and survived the next six weeks.</s></p></div>
