Online Methods).</s><s>The ROCKET contains a thermal chamber that surrounds the trunk and tail of the mouse.</s><s>The animal's body resides on a plastic grid suspended between the chamber's walls, which are heated by warm water circulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>This creates a heat transfer driven predominantly by convection and radiation.</s><s>An independent temperature management of the ROCKET's upper and lower sections creates a thermal equilibrium accompanied by uniform body surface temperatures.</s><s>An ambient air temperature of 36.0 °C (0.62 °C) produced a rectal temperature of 36.4 °C (0.08 °C), a ventral temperature of 36.6 °C (0.21 °C), and 36.1 °C (0.16 °C) for the dorsal trunk (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>ROCKET rectal temperatures were consistent with trunk temperatures (dorsal, Δ T = 0.20 °C ± 0.07 °C;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thermostimulation unit within the ROCKET.</head><p><s>To apply focal thermal stimulation in a controlled and reproducible way, we used ramped contact heat transfer based on a water-cooled, feedback-controlled Peltier element with a copper plate as a contact thermode.</s><s>The hindpaw was positioned between the thermode and a thermally insulating sheet that lay on an inflatable hydraulic balloon (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>The balloon was connected to a water-filled cylinder, whose filling level ensured a defined, even pressure between the uneven surface of the paw and the thermode (Online Methods).</s><s>This permits applications of thermal stimuli to the plantar surface of the animal's hindpaw (for dorsal stimulation see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6d online</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Prior to the experiments, we assessed the MRI compatibility of the thermostimulation device to rule out any potential influence of electric currents from the Peltier element on the magnetic field (B 0 ) homogeneity, which could lead to false BOLD activations.</s><s>In the "worst case scenario", when heating rose from baseline to maximum, the absolute signal change in MR image intensity (Δ I) was estimated at less than 0.1% for the region of interest: the location of the mouse brain in the apparatus during an fMRI study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>; Online Methods).</s><s>To put this into perspective, the typical temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) of the fMRI data in the cortex was 193, which corresponds to a level of noise in the fMRI signal-time courses of 0.58% (relative temporal standard deviation).</s></p><p><s>The stimulation paradigm was governed by the temperature of the contact thermode core (TC) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), which was used as a feedback temperature for the computer-driven Peltier element (Online Methods).</s><s>In contrast to the furry trunk and head, we observed that paw skin temperatures in awake mice adapt to their thermal environment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>We therefore set the baseline temperature to 35.5 °C, to match the thermal chamber temperature (see Discussion).</s><s>Baseline temperature oscillations at the paw did not exceed ± 0.2 °C.</s></p><p><s>Differences between temperatures at the TC site and at the target thermoreceptor level must be taken into consideration in a thermostimulation paradigm.</s><s>We also measured temperatures at the thermode's surface (TS) and at the thermode-skin-interface (TSI), which reflects actual stimulation temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>While TC and TS were almost identical (∆T max = 0.2 °C), comprising maximum 'plateau' temperatures of 48 °C (TC) and 47.8 °C (TS), the more relevant TSI revealed temperatures around 46 °C, without the initial overshoot observed in TC and TS.</s><s>TSI displayed a significantly lower ascending temperature slope (2.5 °C/s) than TC or TS (both 4.0 °C/s).</s></p><p><s>The drop in temperature from thermode-core to thermode-skin-interface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), more pronounced in the initial stimulation phase, may be attributed to the heat sink effect of the skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Skin thermal conductivity is low enough that peak temperature and transition rate might be further decreased at the thermoreceptor level <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>To avoid tissue damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , the total stimulus duration was limited to 20 s using a 14 s temperature plateau (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>);
