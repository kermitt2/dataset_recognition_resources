<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Grasses release the most widespread aeroallergens with considerable sensitization rates, while different species produce several pollen concentration peaks throughout the season.</s><s>This study analyzed the prevalence of grass species in three different European city areas and compared the flowering period of these species with daily pollen concentrations and the symptom loads of grass pollen allergy sufferers.</s><s>Methods: The most prevalent grass species in Vienna (Austria), Berlin (Germany) and Turku (Finland) were studied and examined by use of three different approaches: phenology, pollen monitoring and symptom load evaluation.</s><s>A mobile pollen exposure chamber was employed to observe reaction patterns of grass pollen allergy sufferers to three common grass species evaluated in this study versus placebo.</s><s>Results: Common meadow grass (Poa pratensis) and the fescue grass species (Festuca spp.) are important contributors within the grass pollen season.</s><s>The pollination period of orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) and false-oat grass (Arrhenatherum elatius) indicated a greater importance in Berlin and Vienna, whereas a broader spectrum of grass species contributed in Turku to the main pollen season.</s><s>The standardized provocation induced a nasal symptom load, reduction in nasal flow and increased secretion, in contrary to the placebo control group in grass pollen allergic subjects.</s></p></div>

50% sensitization rate) and minor allergens (&lt; 50% sensitization rate) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In Austria, grass pollen allergy is the most common pollen allergy and more than 50% of all pollen allergy sufferers are sensitized in the eastern part of the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, grass pollen is the most important allergen in the adult German population (sample = 7025 participants) with a sensitization prevalence of 18,1%.</s><s>In Finland, grasses are the second most important cause of pollen allergy after birch and the proportion of Finnish people with clinical symptoms from grass pollen is at least 10-12% <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>The considerable frequency of grass pollen allergy is owed to the nearly ubiquitous distribution of grasses.</s><s>Grasses (Poaceae) are one of the largest plant families in the world with more than 10.000 species <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Grass dominated habitats cover up to 40% of the earth's vegetation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and extensive cross-reactions among allergens of different grasses are documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the different biochemical attributes of component grass species are known <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Knowledge in the contribution of single grass species to allergic reactions and sensitization profiles is generally limited.</s><s>However, one rare study has shown a varying correlation of clinical symptoms to different pollen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>It remains unclear if and how those species are responsible for the progress of a pollen allergy under natural conditions.</s><s>A major problem in the aerobiological routines is the uniform morphology of grass pollen grains <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the identification of different grass species in pollen counting routines is hardly feasible and leads to subjective interpretations in species determination in the optical light microscope <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To overcome this problem, several southern European studies combined daily grass pollen concentrations with the approach of phenology: the visual observation of plant life cycles (including flowering conditions) in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and identification of the grass species that contribute the most to daily pollen concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>A recent pilot study evaluated, for the first time, the profile of a single grass pollen season in a central European city, by combining daily grass pollen concentrations, grass species observations in the field and crowd sourced symptom data from the Patient's Hayfever Diary <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The same approach was used in the study presented herein, comparing the progress of the grass pollen season in 2015 across three different European cities and thus to test its applicability in different regions: Vienna (Austria), Berlin (Germany) and Turku (Finland).</s><s>All locations are situated in the terrestrial "temperate broadleaf and mixed forest" biome according to the World Wildlife Fund's (WWF) classification of vegetation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Berlin is the largest city in this study with more than 3.5 Million inhabitants built on several small plateaus in the transition of the maritime to the continental climate (Cfb climate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</s><s>Vienna is situated along the Eastside of the Alps passing into the Pannonian plain in the transition of the oceanic to the continental climate (Cfb climate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>) and records more than 1.8 Million inhabitants.</s><s>Turku is the smallest city in this setting with less than 200.000 inhabitants, situated close to the Baltic Sea and in the influence of a cold-temperate climate (Dfb climate in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the three cities were chosen to evaluate the methodological approach in different settings and to assess the influence of biogeographical parameters.</s><s>In addition to grass species observations in the field, crowdsourced symptom data and daily pollen concentrations -a novel feature was introduced: three different grass species that were found to be highly relevant in their contribution to the grass seasons in this study (Dactylis glomerata, Festuca pratensis, Phleum pratense) were used in a mobile pollen exposure chamber to observe whether pollen allergy sufferers exhibit different reactivity profiles to pollen from each grass species.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenology</head><p><s>Phenological observations and identification of different grass species were performed once to twice a week in different locations of Vienna, Berlin and Turku.</s><s>Different urban habitats in extensive observation sites were chosen to cover a representative range of grass species.</s><s>In Vienna the location of "Steinhofgründe" (more natural) and the location of "Neue Donau/Wasserpark" (more urbanized) were selected since both locations performed well in the recently conducted pilot study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, a third location next to the pollen monitoring station in the phenological garden of the Vienna meteorological service was included.</s><s>The total area of all observation sites in Vienna was more than 80.000m 2 .</s><s>In Berlin four observation sites for phenological observations were chosen: "Nordbahnhof" (urban wilderness park), "Tempelhof Projekt" (city park), "Botanischer Garten" (meadows of the Botanical Garden Berlin-Dahlem) and "TU Berlin" (phenological garden).</s><s>The total area of all observation sites in Berlin amounts to approximately 7000m 2 .</s><s>In Turku three observation sites have been selected: "University area" (city center), "Skanssi" (5 km distance to the city center) and "Tuorla" (agricultural zone 15 km apart from Turku) with a total area of 60.000m 2 .</s><s>All observation areas are located in the city borders of the respective cities and are in close distance to the pollen monitoring stations.</s><s>In Vienna and Berlin random fields with a surface of approximately 4 m 2 were studied per location for the field observations.</s><s>However, it has to be mentioned that the location of the random fields could be set wider apart due to governmental lawn mowing activities (see limitations).</s><s>In Turku the observation areas were defined on an urban to agricultural gradient and inside each study area the observed sites were selected randomly (one site in University area and Skanssi, three sites in Tuorla).</s><s>Five different phenological phases have been defined to determine the pollination periods of each grass species (detailed definition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>).</s><s>These phases were translated into international BBCH phenological phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Only more than 25 individuals per grass species and defined area were examined to evade observing poorly distributed grasses at the respective surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pollen measurements</head><p><s>Daily pollen concentrations were assessed with volumetric pollen and spore traps of the Hirst design <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> in the three European cities.</s><s>The collected data were evaluated according to the minimum recommendations of the European Aeroallergen Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> to ensure high data quality.</s><s>The main pollination period of the grass pollen season 2015 was defined by applying the standardized season definition of the European Aeroallergen Network (EAN).</s><s>Therefore, the season starts at the day with 1% of the cumulative annual total grass pollen count and ends at the day of 95% of the total annual pollen count.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crowd sourced symptom data</head><p><s>Crowd sourced symptom data in all cities was used from the Patient's Hayfever Diary (https://www.pollendiary.com).</s><s>This pollen diary is a free web-based online diary and records symptoms of users suffering from pollen allergies.</s><s>Data from this diary is highly practicable and was used in several scientific studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>At the moment the Patient's Hayfever Diary is available in thirteen European countries.</s><s>Users fill in a validated questionnaire and indicate the symptom severity of eyes, nose and lungs including medication use.</s><s>A total symptom score can be calculated with this basic information.</s><s>For the purpose of this study, the data of all users from Berlin, Vienna and Turku exhibiting a positive background correlation to grasses during the grass pollen season in 2015 were included following the methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, only users with a minimum of 10 entries during the main grass pollen season were included into the evaluation.</s><s>Furthermore, users with a positive background correlation to birch pollen were excluded in Berlin and Vienna, thus to avoid unrealistic symptom loads in the beginning of the grass pollen season due to poly-sensitization and a short overlap of the birch and grass pollen season.</s><s>In Turku, the grass pollen season and the birch pollen season were not overlapping; hence users were only filtered for a minimum of 10 entries and a positive background correlation to grass pollen.</s><s>Daily symptom load indices were calculated as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> after user filtering.</s><s>Thus, the total symptom scores (including all organs, specific symptoms and medication use) of all user entries were normalized to attain daily mean values between 0 and 10 for the respective time period of the grass pollen season.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pollen exposure chamber and exposure tests</head><p><s>Exposure tests with pollen from three different grass species (Phleum pratense, Festuca pratensis and Dactylis glomerata; Pharmallerga, Czech Republic) were performed in the mobile GA2LEN chamber in Berlin, which is validated according to current needs and requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Eight non-smoking adults (6 female, 2 male; mean age 29 years) suffering from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis since more than two years (pos.</s><s>Skin prick test of 3 mm or greater and/or an ImmunoCAP score of 2 or greater, and FEV1 of 70% of predicted value or greater, typical hay-fever symptoms during grass pollen season) were exposed double-blinded 4 times (placebo run and pollen from 3 grass species, 4000 pollen/m 3 ) on 4 different days with at least 7 days interval for 120 min outside the pollen season.</s><s>Patients recorded eye and nose (itching, sneezing, running and blocked) symptoms.</s><s>For every symptom, a score of 0 to 3 was applied (none, mild, moderate, and severe).</s><s>The total nasal symptom score (TNSS) is the sum of the 4 nasal symptoms (minimum = 0 and maximum = 12).</s><s>Subjective parameters were recoded at time zero (0) and every 30 min during exposure.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The software R in version 3.3.1 was used for statistical analysis.</s><s>For the three locations a linear regression model was estimated for the symptom data with the square root of pollen concentration data as only independent variable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The residuals of these linear regression models were used in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the pollination periods of the most prevalent grass species in every location to assess the impact of single grass species on the symptom data.</s><s>Moreover, an additional analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied on the linear model of square root of pollen concentration data against the pollination periods of the prevalent grass species to examine the impact of single grass species on the grass pollen concentrations during the grass pollen season.</s></p></div>
