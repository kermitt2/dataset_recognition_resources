<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Meaning</head><p><s>It may be that between-sex differences in adolescents should be taken into consideration for recovery management; the derived recovery curves may be useful for evidence-based anticipatory guidance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p><s>The primary outcome was symptom change, defined as current rating minus preinjury rating (delta score), over time (at presentation and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injury), measured using the PCSI.</s><s>The secondary outcome was recovery; children were considered recovered if they had no change in symptoms relative to current preinjury PCSI ratings (delta score = 0).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>Natural Progression of Symptom Change Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient baseline characteristics for each age group.</s><s>The primary analysis focused on the natural course of symptom change over 12 weeks, stratified by age group, with adjustment for specific covariates associated with recovery.</s><s>Based on systematic reviews, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">28</ref> a priori selected variables determined to be associated with recovery included the following: age, 8,9,14,15 sex, 10,14-17 time, age by time interaction, sex by time interaction, personal migraine history, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> previous concussions with symptoms lasting longer than 1 week, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17</ref> learning disability, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 29 anxiety, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> depression, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref> sleep disorders, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18,</ref><ref type="bibr">30</ref> loss of consciousness and duration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18</ref> cognitive scores from the Child SCAT3 (immediate and delayed memory, concentration), <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> BESS tandem stance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> and baseline subscale symptom scores (parent reported). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18</ref></s><s>For the group aged 5 to 7 years, the variables depression (no participants had a prior depression diagnosis) and BESS tandem stance (this was not validated in that age group) were not predictors.</s><s>Three linear mixed-effects models (1 model per age group) were fitted, with the total PCSI delta score as the dependent variable (measured at presentation and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks).</s><s>Random effects for model intercept and time were specified under the assumption of a continuous autoregressive (AR) process, namely, AR(1) process for a continuous time covariate, based on a patient nested in site (9-level correlation structure). <ref type="bibr">31,</ref><ref type="bibr">32</ref></s><s>o allow for nonlinearity of effects in the mixed models, fractional polynomial transformations were applied to continuous covariates using an initial exploratory modeling procedure that systematically searches for a suitable transformation for each continuous covariate, combined with a backward elimination procedure to limit overfitting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34</ref></s><s>Because the "shape" of concussion symptom change was of primary interest, a maximum of 4 df was afforded to the transformation of the time covariate, while 2 df was afforded to all other continuous covariates.</s><s>Graphical assessment of residuals (quantile-quantile plots and plots of standardized residuals against fitted values) revealed neither significant deviations from normality nor strong evidence of heteroscedasticity.</s></p><p><s>Model contrasts were specified to estimate rate of symptom change over time, continuous age by time interaction, and sex by time interaction and to estimate the PCSI delta score difference between sex and the 75th and 25th quantiles of the continuous age variable.</s><s>Analyses were performed adjusting covariates at either their median or mode, with the 95% CI adjusted for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni correction.</s><s>Twosided P &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</s></p></div>
