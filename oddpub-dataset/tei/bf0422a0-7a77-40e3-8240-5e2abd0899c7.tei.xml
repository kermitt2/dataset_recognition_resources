<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">| RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Patient disposition and demographics</head><p><s>Of 133 screened patients, 86 (65%) were eligible and enrolled, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>.</s><s>Demographic and baseline voiding characteristics of patients are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics amongst the groups.</s><s>Of the 86 patients enrolled, 80 (93%) completed 14 treatment days.</s><s>All patients were analyzed based on an intention-to-treat basis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Efficacy</head><p><s>Reductions in NV were seen on the first day of treatment and were maintained throughout the treatment period in all four groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), with average reductions of −0.3, −1.1, −1.4,</s><s>−1.3 voids per night for placebo, and low, mid, and high doses of Paxerol, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Paxerol patients averaged a 6% improvement in NV during the second week beyond the first week's improvement.</s><s>The reductions in NV during treatment in all three Paxerol groups were significantly greater than the placebo group.</s><s>These results indicated that the three dose levels of Paxerol were equi-effective in reducing NV.</s><s>An average of ∼80% of patients at the three dose groups of Paxerol had reduction to ≤1 void/night and ∼100% had reduction to ≤2 void/night.</s><s>There were no obvious improvements in NQOL scores between baseline versus treatment in all groups or differences among the four groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>There was an increase in DFUS during treatment compared to baselines in all four groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The high-dose Paxerol group was, although not statistical significantly, larger compared to placebo (mean values of 1.2 vs 0.4 h, P = 0.057).</s><s>There were no significant differences in THNS between baselines versus during treatment in all groups, or differences among the four groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| Short-term safety and tolerability</head><p><s>Of 86 enrolled patients, 9 had 15 adverse events (3 placebo patients and 2 in each Paxerol group, 10.5%) (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>The events included UTI, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, glycosuria, hematuria, pain, and increased glycosylated hemoglobin.</s><s>The most common event was UTI (1 in placebo, 3 in mid-dose group, and 1 in high-dose group, or 6% incidence).</s><s>None of the events was severe or considered treatment-related.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 4-arm Phase 2 clinical trial evaluated three doses of Paxerol in patients with nocturia associated with OAB.</s><s>The objectives were to evaluate short-term efficacy in reducing NV, as well as safety and tolerability, of different doses of Paxerol when compared to placebo.</s><s>The exploratory objectives included assessing effects of different doses of Paxerol on NQOL, DFUS, and THNS compared to placebo.</s><s>The results suggest that Paxerol may be an efficacious and safe short-term therapy for nocturia.</s><s>The long-term efficacy and safety of Paxerol remain to be investigated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">| Paxerol designed specifically for nocturia</head><p><s>Paxerol is a novel proprietary IR/SR (50%:50%) formulation of PG inhibitors (acetaminophen and ibuprofen).</s><s>Inhibition of the PG pathway is expected to alleviate nocturia because PGs are local modulators of reflex micturition, increase detrusor muscle tone, enhance micturition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and inhibit antidiuretic hormone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>One-half of the drugs is released via IR during the first hour to provide "loading dose" effect.</s><s>The other half is released via SR for up to 6 h to coincide with the normal 6-8 h of sleep.</s><s>This low-dose IR/SR dosage form is unlike the modified-release formulations of acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen, which are high-dose prolonged release formulations.</s><s>The acetaminophen-containing modified release for-mulations were suspended from marketing by the European Union regulatory agencies in 2017 due to safety concerns for providing uninterrupted steady presence of high dose of acetaminophen in the body for a very prolonged time period.</s></p><p><s>Patients could take Over-the-Counter (OTC) products (eg, Tylenol and an Advil) at bedtime to have initial attenuation of nocturia during early bedtime.</s><s>However, due to the short half-life of approximately 2 h, these agents are not able to provide benefit for 6-8 h of normal sleep duration.</s><s>Furthermore, OTC drugs are packaged at doses suitable for analgesia and anti-inflammation, which are beyond the dose for nocturia (∼3× and ∼4×, respectively, higher than Paxerol).</s><s>Long-term exposure to OTC dose levels increase risks of cardiovascular and GI toxicities with ibuprofen, and hepatotoxicity secondary to inadvertent overdose with acetaminophen.</s><s>They are not suitable for treatment of a chronic condition like nocturia, which is consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines of not recommending NSAIDs for nocturia.</s><s>The toxicity risks with chronic use may be one of the reasons that the work of NSAIDs on nocturia did not result in NSAID products for nocturia.</s><s>Paxerol is different from OTC products for analgesia or anti-inflammation.</s><s>Paxerol contains only ∼6% and ∼8%, respectively, of maximum OTC doses, and release from Paxerol tablets lasts over 6 h.</s><s>Toxicity risks associated with chronic use should be minimal.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">| Efficacy parameters assessed</head><p><s>In this study, NV decreased during treatment in all groups compared to baselines.</s><s>The decrease in the placebo group was small, and the decrease was significantly greater in the Paxerol groups versus placebo.</s><s>Patients might have been cognizant of their fluid intake before bed during the study period, leading to lower nocturia.</s><s>Exploratory endpoints included NQOL, DFUS, and THNS.</s><s>There were no obvious changes in these endpoints except for possible improvement in DFUS in the high dose group.</s><s>A lack of statistical improvement in these exploratory endpoints may be because this was a short-term study with a small sample size.</s><s>Whether these efficacy parameters will improve in larger long-term studies remains to be investigated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">| Patient population characteristics</head><p><s>The current study used OAB patients with nocturia.</s><s>Some of these patients also had BPH, as OAB and BPH are not exclusive etiologies.</s><s>Approximately 35% of those in this trial had BPH.</s><s>Based on subgroup analysis, Paxerol appears to be effective for those with and without BPH.</s></p><p><s>Recent ICS Nocturia Guidelines White Paper does not distinguish nocturnal voiding from nocturia, as it is difficult to discern "reason for waking" and to confirm that waking was for "passing urine."</s><s>Hence, nocturia and nocturnal voiding are referenced as the same in this study, as we did not attempt to determine whether sleep interruption was due to bladder filling sensation or involuntary contractions sufficient to awaken a sleeping person. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">| Safety and tolerability</head><p><s>Paxerol at all dose levels was safe and well-tolerated.</s><s>There were only limited number of adverse events and all were of mild to moderate severity, incidental and unrelated to Paxerol, and occurred in both placebo and Paxerol groups.</s><s>There was no adverse renal effect, a side effect associated with NSAIDs.</s><s>These results suggest that Paxerol has great short-term safety</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">| Current nocturia therapies unsatisfactory</head><p><s>Current therapies for nocturia, especially severe nocturia, are limited and unsatisfactory.</s><s>The first approach is lifestyle and behavioral modifications, including elimination of evening fluid intake and reducing alcohol and caffeine.</s><s>However, these initial measures are rarely completely effective, especially for severe nocturia.</s><s>First-line medical therapies are use of antidiuretic agents, which can cause complications such as hyponatremia, especially in older persons who constitute the larger portion of nocturia patients.</s><s>The presence of common comorbidities associated with nocturia can be associated with adverse interactions with these agents.</s><s>Second-line medical therapies include potent diuretics such as furosemide, COX-2 inhibitors, as well as botulinum toxin injected directly into the detrusor muscle for OAB.</s><s>Alpha-blockers and 5-alphareductase inhibitors are used for men with BPH, the improvement of which can alleviate nocturia somewhat.</s></p><p><s>The only FDA approved nocturia drugs are Desmopressin nasal spray (Noctiva) and sublingual tablet (Nocdurna).</s><s>Unfortunately, Desmopressin has limited efficacy, with approximately 0.2 and 0.3-0.4</s><s>NV reduction compared to placebo for the nasal spray and sublingual tablet, respectively.</s><s>NV reduction by Paxerol was ∼1 void/night compared to placebo.</s><s>Desmopressin's modest efficacy comes with substantial risks, as indicated by black-box warning for potentially life-threatening hyponatremia.</s><s>For a higher desmopressin dosage form for a different indication, there were 61 cases of hyponatremia-related seizures reported, 2 of which resulted in death.</s><s>In nocturia treatment, although the lower dose versions had lower hyponatremia incidence, it remains the most frequent adverse event and led to treatment discontinuation in some cases.</s></p><p><s>Nocturia is frequently associated with BPH and OAB.</s><s>Reduction in symptoms by OAB drugs, which can alleviate nocturia slightly, occurs only in 25-39% of patients.</s><s>Low response rates and significant side effects cause most OAB drug users to abandon them within 2-3 months.</s></p><p><s>Due to limited effectiveness of current nocturia therapies, a safe and effective therapy, especially for severe nocturia, is of great medical need.</s><s>Paxerol may potentially be a safe and effective alternative to current therapies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">| CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>This Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that the proprietary novel IR/SR (50%:50%) formulation of ibuprofen/acetaminophen, Paxerol, is effective compared to placebo as a shortterm therapy in reducing NV in patients with severe nocturia associated with OAB.</s><s>Paxerol at all tested doses was safe and well-tolerated when used short-term.</s><s>These results warrant further studies with larger sample size and for longer treatment duration to validate the efficacy and safety of Paxerol as a potential treatment option for nocturia.</s></p></div>
