Improvements were also sustained, with 18-24% of patients receiving ABT-494 meeting the ACR20 response criteria at all visits from week 2 through week 12.</s><s>Likewise, looking at measures of a greater magnitude of response, such as the ACR50 and ACR70, significant differences for most doses of ABT-494 versus placebo were observed early during the study, with maximum improvement achieved between weeks 6 and 12. Low levels of disease activity as measured by the DAS28-CRP were achieved in nearly half of the patients receiving ABT-494 by week 12.</s><s>For all efficacy measures, a clear doseresponse relationship was observed across the tested doses, with maximum efficacy reached at doses of 6 or 12 mg.</s><s>The underreporting of a minority of hsCRP values was predicted to have no significant impact on efficacy parameters and the overall conclusions from the study.</s></p><p><s>Similar to findings with biologic therapies currently used for the treatment of RA, infections were the most common AEs.</s><s>Three nonserious events of herpes zoster were reported with ABT-494 (1 at 3 mg and 2 at 24 mg), each involving a single dermatome.</s><s>There were no reports of opportunistic infection, nonmelanoma skin cancer, or GI perforation.</s><s>No deaths occurred during the study.</s><s>There were no unexpected AE trends based on the known safety of drugs from the same class.</s><s>Safety observations from this phase IIb study support proceeding to larger phase III trials in which the safety profile will be further characterized and confirmed.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with observations for other JAK inhibitors and drugs that inhibit IL-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">23)</ref>, certain effects on laboratory parameters were also observed with ABT-494 and are likely to be attributable to potent JAK-1 inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">24)</ref>.</s><s>Treatment with ABT-494 was associated with elevations in liver enzymes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and CPK, with no apparent dose relationship.</s><s>Although increases in LDL and HDL cholesterol were observed across all tested doses, the LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratios remained consistent throughout.</s><s>Liver enzyme elevations were infrequent and usually transient, while CPK elevations were asymptomatic and returned to normal levels with continued treatment.</s></p><p><s>Inhibition of IL-6 signaling activity has previously been shown to be associated with decreased levels of the iron-sequestering hormone, hepcidin, and CRP, and with increased levels of hemoglobin <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">26)</ref>.</s><s>In the subgroup of patients with elevated hsCRP at baseline, mean hemoglobin values increased over time for the 3 mg and 6 mg groups, while decreases in hemoglobin were observed at doses of $12 mg, with limited clinical impact.</s><s>This observation is possibly due to higher selectivity of ABT-494 for JAK-1 over JAK-2 at lower doses combined with reduced systemic inflammation, leading to an improvement in hemoglobin levels.</s><s>These findings suggest that ABT-494 is selective for JAK-1 at lower doses and less selective at higher doses.</s><s>This was taken into consideration in the analysis of the efficacy and safety data to determine the optimal doses to take forward into phase III studies.</s></p><p><s>Reductions in lymphocytes and neutrophils were observed during treatment with ABT-494, with higher incidences of grade 3 or 4 reductions in lymphocytes reported at higher doses;
