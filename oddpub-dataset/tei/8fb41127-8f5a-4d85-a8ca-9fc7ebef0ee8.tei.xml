<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The state of pregnancy is associated with many complex metabolic alterations in order to meet not only the energetic demands of the developing fetus but also ensure deposition of adequate energy substrate stores to contribute to neonatal nutritional requirements following birth.</s><s>Glucose, amino acids (AA) and lipids are all utilized by the fetoplacental unit, and thus maternal metabolism must adapt, in both the fasting and fed state, to ensure the fetal demands are met while also ensuring an adequate maternal nutrient supply to cope with the increased physiological demands of pregnancy and of labor and lactation.</s><s>For instance, enhanced ketogenesis during fasting serves to meet energy demands while minimizing protein catabolism.</s><s>Maternal plasma AA levels are noted to fall during pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, related to increased placental uptake, increased insulin levels, hepatic diversion for gluconeogenesis and uptake by the fetus for use in protein synthesis and oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date, our knowledge of alterations in these metabolic processes during pregnancy is generated from experimental studies in small populations that have relied on specific nutritional biomarkers to gain an understanding of individual nutrient metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Although there is general consensus that the normal progressive insulin resistance of pregnancy is an underlying driver for many of the observed metabolic adaptations, our understanding remains incomplete regarding the specific nutrients, mechanisms and hormonal processes involved.</s></p><p><s>Metabolomics technology offers enormous potential to increase our knowledge of subtle changes in maternal metabolism in pregnancy and their relation to maternal nutritional status and diet in a comprehensive manner.</s><s>Two recent cross-sectional studies have reported on the plasma metabolomic profiles of healthy pregnant women <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> while a further study examined urinary metabolomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, each using an untargeted analytical approach.</s><s>While this method offers potential for a broad range of metabolites to be explored, meaningful interpretation of the data may be limited by non-specificity for any given metabolite class, and thus it only serves non-hypothesis driven studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, targeted metabolomic techniques facilitate the profiling of specific metabolites of interest in a given population, to aid in-depth analysis of metabolic processes in the context of a pre-formed hypothesis.</s><s>A further limitation of the recent metabolomic studies in healthy pregnant cohorts was that each employed a cross-sectional design and therefore had different subjects representing each stage of pregnancy.</s><s>This precludes reliable assessment of longitudinal changes in metabolism throughout gestation, as individual genetic or phenotypic characteristics between the subgroups across gestational windows may have influenced metabolite concentrations.</s><s>For example, significant differences in metabolomics profiles have been reported between non-pregnant populations from different geographical locations, which may be attributed to genetic, dietary or gut microbial variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, there remains a need to utilize the recent advancements in metabolomics technology to characterize maternal metabolism across normal, healthy pregnancy while also considering the influence of inter-individual variations.</s><s>Increased knowledge in this field would aid our understanding of the many complex metabolic changes that occur across gestation, paving the way for future studies to relate such changes and trajectories to various maternal, fetal and infant factors.</s><s>The present study aims to fill this gap through the use of targeted metabolomic technology and a longitudinal design throughout gestation in a relatively large cohort of healthy, non-diabetic women.</s><s>The targeted approach facilitates a specific focus on nutritional metabolites of interest, namely proteins and lipids, as we hypothesize that distinct changes in concentrations will occur as gestation advances to reflect the shift from the early pregnancy anabolic phase to later pregnancy fatty acid catabolism.</s><s>The present analysis also quantifies intermediary metabolites generated through carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism in order to deepen our understanding of which nutrients serve as important energy substrates across gestation.</s><s>Furthermore, the potential influence of maternal ethnicity on metabolomic profiles was considered in this sample which predominantly consisted of Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White pregnant women.</s></p></div>
