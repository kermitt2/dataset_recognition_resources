<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leaf damage</head><p><s>The mean leaf damage, i.e. loss of leaf area, per tree was 5.7% (s.d.</s><s>4.8%) based on mean values from each tree.</s><s>But there was large variation in leaf damage between different trees.</s><s>There was no tree without any damage: the lowest recorded damage per tree was 0.2% and the highest value was 22.2%.</s><s>In 78% (n = 28) of the experimental trees the damage was below 8% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>In our analyses, we express the leaf damage as the mean percentage (or proportion) of leaf area missing in each tree.</s><s>However, there was a significant positive correlation between leaf damage (mean percentage per tree) and area missing (mean value per tree) estimated in mm 2 per leaf (Spearman rank correlation r s = 0.925, P &lt; 0.001, n = 36).</s><s>This means that a leaf damage measured as a high percentage of missing leaf area corresponds to a large area of missing leaf surface.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Caterpillar survival in relation to leaf damage</head><p><s>We analysed the relationship between probability of caterpillar survival and estimates of leaf damage for each oak tree.</s><s>In addition to the covariate leaf damage, we also measured canopy cover, effective leaf area index (L e ) and abundance of birds.</s><s>We omitted including the covariate "canopy cover" in the analysis given that the covariate had a strong correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.49) with the leaf damage, and thus we would not be able to separate the effect between leaf damage or "canopy cover".</s><s>We estimated the remaining models using Akaike information criteria (AIC).</s><s>We only used the model that had leaf damage as it had the lowest AIC (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Although AIC is not ideal for mixed effect models, it was used here since the standard deviation (σ sites ) of the random effect (site) basically did not change between models (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), and therefore it was considered an adequate model selector in the present situation.</s><s>Moreover, the small σ gives an indication that the spatial dependence is not very strong in our data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The code for AIC comparison is included in ESM Appendix 2.</s></p><p><s>There was a significant negative relationship between leaf damage and survival of caterpillars recorded after 48 h exposure to predation by birds (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The 95% confidence bounds for the survival probability function (with "leaf damage" as argument) were estimated by the parametric bootstrap method <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Efron and Tibshirani 1994)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The same method was also used to generate the 95% predictive interval for a tree with thirteen caterpillars (median number) on it.</s><s>The maximum likelihood estimate of the coefficient β 1 , the effect of leaf damage (in %) on survival probability, was − 7.5.</s><s>The P value for the coefficient was 0.0075.</s><s>Data used for the analysis are included in Electronic Supplemental Material (caterpillarTree.csv).</s><s>Consequently, our findings can be summarized as: avian insectivores foraging in the canopy of English oak had highest impact on caterpillars (i.e.</s><s>lowest survival probability of caterpillars) in trees with the highest levels of leaf damage.</s><s>The artificial caterpillars were exposed to the highest risk of predation by birds in oak trees with extensive leaf damage.</s></p></div>

possibilities to control the prey populations, at least in Scandinavian forests at high latitudes (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hogstad 2005</ref>).</s><s>This also have implications for the outcome of trophic cascades, i.e. indirect effects of predators that are spreading downward through food webs <ref type="bibr">(Ripple et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Studies on the indirect effects of bird predation on leaf damage of English oak in central Europe showed large local variations due to, e.g.</s><s>tree age and forest composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Böhm et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Our approach in the present study can help in assessing the importance of bird predation in different sites.</s><s>Reduction of leaf mass in deciduous trees by caterpillars´ consumption may elicit visual signals from trees to insect predators, e.g.</s><s>avian insectivores (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Koski et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, the The outcome of our experiment is congruent with the hypothesis that the bird predators increase their foraging efforts in trees that have leaves with high levels of damage.</s><s>Birds are generally considered to be visually hunting predators (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Holmes 1990</ref>).</s><s>Studies of the insectivorous black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus showed that individuals can quickly learn to use leaf damage as a cue for finding prey <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Heinrich and Collins 1983)</ref>.</s><s>There were also distinct differences in behaviour between morphologically closely related species of avian insectivores foraging in various types of foliage structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Whelan 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, vegetation structure affected the bird predation pressure on arthropods living on branches of coniferous trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gunnarsson 1996)</ref>.</s><s>These examples of experimental studies show that insectivorous birds use their sight when foraging and that structural variation in the foliage guide them.</s><s>Consequently, in the present study, it seems reasonable to suggest that damaged oak foliage with missing leaf areas is a strong cue for birds to locate abundant insect prey.</s><s>But recent studies show that also volatile organic compounds from damaged trees can be used by birds to find foliage with high abundance of insect herbivores (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mäntylä et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mäntylä et al. , 2008;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amo et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Avian insectivores are likely to use both visual and olfactory cues to identify tree individuals with high abundance of insects in the foliage, but the exact mechanisms are still largely unknown (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Koski et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Koski et al. , 2017))</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our data suggest a large decrease in the survival probability of caterpillars when there is a 15-20% reduction of the leaf area (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>If birds are using visual cues in combination with volatile organic compounds, such a decrease in survival probability might suggest that the signals from the trees are increasing rapidly within this interval of leaf damages.</s><s>However, this tentative interpretation is based on probability of survival of caterpillars in a limited number of trees, which means that this suggestion needs to be confirmed by other studies.</s></p><p><s>There are multiple studies on the effects of bird predation on leaf-chewing insects in the foliage of various tree species, including oaks.</s><s>Many of those investigations are experimental studies that focus on leaf damage, particularly missing leaf area, in relation to manipulated predation rate by avian insectivores on herbivorous insects (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Marquis and Whelan 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lichtenberg and Lichtenberg 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barber and Marquis 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bridgeland et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Böhm et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Typically, they use exclosures that make bird foraging on oak branches, or saplings, impossible and "control branches" with natural bird predation rates.</s><s>A problem with the experimental design using exclosures is that the predation rate inside the exclosures decreases to zero, or close to zero.</s><s>Moreover, the predation rate may vary greatly in the trees that are exposed to natural conditions.</s><s>Thus, the expected variation in predation rate under natural conditions might be overlooked in these experiments.</s><s>We, therefore, used artificial caterpillars as a means to estimate the effects of variation in predation rate.</s><s>To our knowledge, the present study is the first experimental evidence of a quantified negative relationship between caterpillar survival and leaf damages in lower part of tree canopies.</s></p><p><s>Artificial caterpillars have been used in multiple studies to quantify predation pressure in testing a multitude of hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lövei and Ferrante 2017)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, in a study of avian predation rate on artificial caterpillars together with experimental damages that were simulating insect herbivores in Papua New Guinea, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sam et al. (2015)</ref> showed that both birds and ants were attracted by mechanically damaged trees.</s><s>This suggests that multiple predators can identify signals from trees with foliage damage caused by insect herbivores.</s><s>They also showed that the predation rate by birds varied along an elevation gradient with the highest predation rate at a rather low elevation (700 m a.s.l.).</s><s>The universal applicability of this result was highlighted by the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Roslin et al. (2017)</ref>.</s><s>In a worldwide field experiment, artificial caterpillars were used to measure predation risk across different forest and shrubland habitats.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the experimental results supported the theory that predation (including both invertebrate and vertebrate predators) increases toward the equator (MacArthur 1969; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schemske et al. 2009)</ref>, and also at lower elevations.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Roslin et al. (2017)</ref> suggested that investigations using standardized comparisons of species interactions should be stimulated to reveal general patterns, e.g.</s><s>geographical variations in predation pressure.</s><s>Our findings in the present study add credence to the idea of using artificial caterpillars as a means to obtain standardized estimates of predation rates, at least in woodland habitats.</s><s>The relationship between survival probabilities of caterpillars in relation to leaf damages might provide an opportunity to pinpoint context-dependent variations that could be used in applied science.</s></p><p><s>Management may affect bird predation pressure on canopy-living arthropods.</s><s>But in the present study, variables that could be influenced by management (vegetation density, number bird individuals) were not included in the final model (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In a previous study, we found that clearance of understory may cause reduction in predation pressure on arthropod abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Heyman and Gunnarsson 2011)</ref>.</s><s>This was likely due to a decrease in bird abundance by, on average, 37% in cleared plots <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Heyman 2010)</ref>.</s><s>But a review of experimental studies on management effects showed that clearance gave mixed results and suggested that bird communities' responses were highly species specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Heyman et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>A positive relationship between bird abundance and predation rate on caterpillars is theoretically expected and has been observed in other studies that employed the method of estimating bird predation rate using plasticine larvae (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barbaro et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barbaro et al. , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bereczki et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sam et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>We could not find any significant influence of the abundance of avian insectivores on the relationship between caterpillar survival and leaf damage at our experimental sites.</s><s>The reason might be that we included all insectivorous species in the point counts at our sites and this might be misleading.</s><s>Studies in tropical agroforestry systems have indicated that a single species can be the main driver of predation on caterpillars <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Maas et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>We have no data indicating which species attacked the caterpillars in our study sites.</s><s>But the variation in beak and hack marks on the larvae suggested that multiple species of birds caused the injuries.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the evidence that avian insectivores can help to protect plants is well supported by multiple studies (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Van Bael et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mooney et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mäntylä et al. 2011)</ref> and the results in the present study add further credence to this idea by showing a negative relationship between survival probability of caterpillars and leaf damage.</s><s>Our findings on oak trees suggest that the survival probability of caterpillars decreases rapidly at 15-20% leaf damage.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sam et al. (2015)</ref> removed ca 5% leaf area in their experiment and recorded a significant effect on predation rate, which suggests that mechanically damaged leaves might attract more birds to manipulated trees.</s><s>This could be a useful strategy to control insect herbivores.</s><s>Manipulation of leaf damages could increase the yield in various crop systems through increasing predation pressure by avian insectivores on insects, especially in tropical agroforestry systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Van Bael et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Karp et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Maas et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Maas et al. , 2015))</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Bird predation on artificial caterpillars.</s><s>a Beak and b hack marks on plasticine larvae on oak branches.</s><s>Colour version is available online.</s><s>Photo: Sara Elg (colour figure online)</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,204.17,477.74,340.08,237.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
