<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>on February 10 and 11, 2016, to examine techniques for and applications of robotic surgery to thoracic oncology.</s><s>The main topics of presentation and discussion were robotic surgery for lung resection; robot-assisted thymectomy; minimally invasive surgery for esophageal cancer; new developments in computer-assisted surgery and medical applications of robots; the challenge of costs; and future clinical research in robotic thoracic surgery.</s><s>The following article summarizes the main contributions to the workshop.</s><s>The Workshop consensus was that since video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is becoming the mainstream approach to resectable lung cancer in North America and Europe, robotic surgery for thoracic oncology is likely to be embraced by an increasing numbers of thoracic surgeons, since it has technical advantages over VATS, including intuitive movements, tremor filtration, more degrees of manipulative freedom, motion scaling, and high-definition stereoscopic vision.</s><s>These advantages may make robotic surgery more accessible than VATS to trainees and experienced surgeons and also lead to expanded indications.</s><s>However, the high costs of robotic surgery and absence of tactile feedback remain obstacles to widespread dissemination.</s><s>A prospective multicentric randomized trial (NCT02804893) to compare robotic and VATS approaches to stages I and II lung cancer will start shortly.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MiNiMALLY iNvAsive esOPHAGectOMY FOr cANcer</head><p><s>Radical esophagectomy for cancer carries high risks of postoperative morbidity and mortality, since it requires violating both the abdominal and thoracic cavities.</s><s>Recent case series, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(21)</ref> clearly indicate that minimally invasive approaches to esophagectomy for cancer are associated with reduced in-hospital mortality, reduced incidence of pulmonary complications, lower intensive care requirements, shorter duration of hospital stay, reduced pain, and at least similar oncological outcomes to open surgery.</s></p><p><s>A randomized trial comparing quality of life and late complications in minimally invasive esophagectomy and open esophagectomy groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(22)</ref> showed, a year after surgery, that the physical health composite of the SF36 instrument, global health of the EORTC C30 questionnaire, and pain in the OES 18 questionnaire were significantly better in the minimally invasive group, while there were no differences in 1-year survival or complications.</s><s>On the negative side, surgeons needed to be highly experienced in both esophageal surgery and minimally invasive techniques in order to obtain good results, and operating times were longer for minimally invasive than open surgery.</s><s>Notwithstanding this, 30% of esophageal resections were recently reported a being performed using a minimally invasive approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(23)</ref> These findings are in line with those of a 2015 paper from the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(25)</ref>, which used multivariate analysis to compare 83 patients given open esophagectomy, 187 patients given hybrid esophagectomy, and 64 patients given minimally invasive esophagectomy.</s><s>Factors that correlated independently and significantly with survival were stage, nodal status, and type of operation (with minimally invasive patients surviving longer).</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these data suggest that totally minimally invasive esophagectomy is superior in several respects to open and hybrid techniques.</s><s>However, even in many high volume centers, minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy does not appear to be the technique of choice, perhaps because of difficulties with the anastomoses.</s><s>For two-hole minimally invasive esophagectomy, several anastomotic techniques have been described including semi-mechanical anastomosis with a linear stapler and mechanical anastomosis with a circular stapler and a double-stapling technique.</s><s>No technique appears superior, but good results have also been reported for anastomoses performed robotically, suggesting that availability of a robot might encourage more widespread use of minimally invasive esophagectomy.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>tHe cOsts OF rOBOtic sUrGerY</head><p><s>Experience of robotic surgery at the Pisa Multidisciplinary Robotic Center was analyzed.</s><s>The Center was set up in 2009 and by 2015 had 36 surgeons performing 38 types of surgical procedure, using three da Vinci robots.</s><s>A thousand robotic surgical procedures were performed in 2015.</s><s>Management's aim was to achieve sustainability based on high surgical volumes, the performance of complex procedures, and standardization.</s><s>To identify ways of achieving greater efficiency, intensive monitoring of activity was undertaken which resulted in major modifications to working practice.</s><s>A Bill of Materials (BoM) was generated for every surgical procedure performed by each surgeon so as to identify all items of cost and also variations in behavior.</s><s>Implementation of protocols helped to effectively contrast unnecessary variations in practice and achieve standardization.</s></p><p><s>After 6 years of experience, positive effects of standardization and monitoring using the BoM system had become evident, and for some robotic surgical procedures (including lung lobectomy) analyses that considered revenues from disease-related groups (DRGs) and total activities-based costs, indicated that the Center was making a profit.</s></p><p><s>It was found that savings were not obtained directly from innovation but by using innovation as a starting point to stimulate more efficient organization.</s><s>As a university and academic hospital, there was a natural propensity to innovate, which helped the hospital to better meet the needs of the public.</s><s>The Center was also using surgical robotic as an integral part of its surgeon training programs.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MeDicAL APPLicAtiONs OF rOBOts</head><p><s>The humanoid robot called Icube was developed at the Robotics Department of the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT).</s><s>The development of Icube and its sub-systems has driven, and continues to drive, advances in medical prosthetics and medical robotics.</s><s>The robot is comparable in height to a 6-year-old child, which however would run all day on a bar of chocolate, while Icube would only last 10 min on that amount of energy.</s><s>Furthermore, Icube only has a 2D brain; nonetheless, it is impressive.</s><s>Its skin has over 4,000 contact points and sensors, so it can sense contact and contact forces and hence "understand" if it is being pulled or pushed and respond accordingly to maintain equilibrium.</s><s>This haptic feedback system allows Icube to adapt and interact, allowing it to be a social humanoid.</s><s>In fact, it has a vestibular system incorporating gyroscopes and sensors.</s><s>The sensors are copied from nature.</s><s>In nature, hair cells transform sounds (or mechanical vibrations in fish) into electric fields.</s><s>The robot has the equivalent: Icube's skin is made of a high technology plastic that is sensitive to tactile stimuli.</s><s>For example, the skin is sensitive to being blown on, but it also transforms that "wind" energy -15 μW -into an electric current whose energy can be used.</s><s>This secret of the plastic skin is that it incorporates conductive circuits made of graphene, which are printed onto the plastic using a 3D printer and graphene ink.</s><s>Graphene is a Nobel-prize-winning 2D material that is cheap, ultra-light, 200 times stronger than steel, flexible, thin, transparent, and a superb conductor.</s><s>Graphene ink is incorporated into sophisticated prostheses for amputees.</s></p><p><s>One example of such a prosthesis is a completely 3D-printed prosthetic hand with a single 9-W motor and a triple tendon system able to make 85% of the "grasps" of a human hand.</s><s>It receives signals from muscle movement sensors on the patient's arm and has an artificial intelligence system to translate signals into prosthetic hand movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(31)</ref>.</s><s>After only 2 months of rehabilitation and training, a patient can use the hand to perform manual work and execute fine movements.</s><s>The hand currently costs 10,000 euro and is being tested on hundreds of patients.</s></p><p><s>Microtechnology and Systems for Robot-Assisted Laser Phonomicrosurgery is a European project coordinated by the IIT, which is enabling surgeons to better manipulate the cutting instrument (laser scalpel) when performing vocal cord surgery.</s><s>The fully integrated robot has a laser head and periscope controlled by high precision piezoelectric stage, with illumination.</s><s>The surgeon wears an oculus to visualize the operating field from a laryngeal surgery endoscope.</s><s>Magnification can be changed at will.</s><s>Virtual reality is also projected by the oculus onto the surgeon's field of view.</s><s>Operating in virtual reality connected to a graph-pad with a pen, the surgeon uses the pen of the graph-pad to do what would normally be done with the scalpel.</s><s>The real laser scalpel can then be instructed to automatically make the cut planned by the surgeon on the graph-pad, with very high precision laterally (4 μm) and in depth (120 μm).</s><s>Protected areas (blood vessels, nerves) can be defined.</s><s>The latest robot for laryngeal microsurgery is called μRALP or micro-RALP (http://www.microralp.eu/).</s></p><p><s>The micro-robot called Plantoid is a novel robotic system that can "grow" into the body to reach a predetermined objective (like a root grows out from a plant into the soil) carrying with it sensors, biomarkers, or therapeutic agents.</s><s>Plantoid grows in the "right" direction (avoiding critical structures) because it has sensors that allow it to avoid obstacles, hard surfaces, and high temperatures, etc.</s><s>The tip is able to grow into the body to the desired target while remaining connected to its source outside the body, because the materials for growth are provided continuously as in 3D printing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>cONcLUsiON</head><p><s>Minimally invasive approaches to thoracic oncologic surgery are fast becoming mainstream.</s><s>Large proportions of lobectomies in the United States and Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(27)</ref>, and increasing proportions of esophagectomies and thymectomies, are now being performed using these techniques.</s><s>This contrasts with the situation in 2008 when a survey of European surgeons found that nearly 60% of responders used VATS for lobectomy in less than 5% of cases (32) Thus, it would appear that the established advantages of minimally invasive over open surgery -particularly shorter hospital stay, reduced long-and short-term morbidity, and at least equivalent oncological outcomes -are prompting the switch to VATS, notwithstanding its inherent difficulties for the surgeon.</s></p><p><s>Robotic thoracic surgery is also gaining in popularity.</s><s>Surgeons who presented their experience at this Workshop were enthusiastic about robots and unanimous in their opinion that the robotic approach to the thorax was easier for the surgeon than VATS.</s><s>The Workshop also highlighted current problems with robotic surgery, in particular high capital and running costs, and lack of high quality evidence that robotic surgery is superior to VATS in terms complications, conversion rates, and oncological radicality [although recent data suggest that robotic surgery is superior to VATS for mediastinal lymph node dissection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(13)</ref>].</s><s>It is encouraging therefore that a multicentric randomized trial comparing robotic and VATS approaches to stages I and II lung cancer is about to start.</s><s>Robotic surgery is a fast-developing field, and numerous innovations and improvements can be expected in the near future.</s><s>Perhaps the most exciting of these is the use of modern imaging technology to produce augmented reality representations of the patient's anatomy, which can be superimposed onto the intraoperative view of the patient provided by the robotic visual system, to improve lesion targeting and identification of critical structures.</s></p></div>
