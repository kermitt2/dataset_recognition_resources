<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The existing literature on the treatment of ABMR is characterized by a marked heterogeneity concerning the definition of ABMR as well as the applied treatment protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, a considerable number of the available studies was performed before the introduction of a pathology-based definition for ABMR in 2003 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</s><s>At that time, various and nowadays outdated criteria to diagnose ABMR were oftentimes used.</s></p><p><s>In addition, new therapeutics more specifically targeting B cell-mediated immune response have become available.</s><s>The efficacy of these substances as well as their combination with established treatment protocols has not yet been studied sufficiently.</s><s>A recent randomized study could not demonstrate a benefit of rituximab compared to placebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, current evidence for the treatment of ABMR is anything else but satisfactory.</s></p><p><s>To date, IVIG preparations are widely used for treatment of ABMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Yet, it is not known, whether high-dose IVIG treatment is advisable in combination with modern antihumoral therapeutics such as bortezomib.</s><s>Here, we addressed this important question by comparing the efficacy and safety of high-dose IVIG treatment in combination with bortezomib and PPH in 11 consecutive patients with biopsyproven ABMR (group BHP) with a group of 12 patients treated with low-dose IVIG together with a fixed dose of rituximab and PPH (group RLP) and with a group of 11 patients treated with low-dose IVIG together bortezomib and PPH (group BLP).</s><s>Group RLP and group BLP have already been partially described in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Extending the results of this study group RLP now comprises three additional patients, that is, altogether 12 patients, and the median observation time of the present study has been markedly prolonged as compared to our previous study (group RLP: 101 versus 18 months, group BLP: 88 versus 18 months).</s><s>Notably, the median observation time exceeded five years in all groups.</s><s>The three groups presented here were comparable regarding the underlying patient characteristics, renal function, and renal pathology at diagnosis except for the transplant glomerulopathy (cg) score, which was significantly higher in group BLP as compared to group BHP.</s></p><p><s>Our results indicate that treatment with bortezomib in combination with high-dose IVIG and PPH (group BHP) is statistically superior as compared to treatment with rituximab, low-dose IVIG, and PPH (group RLP).</s><s>In addition, high-dose IVIG with bortezomib and PPH seemed to be advantageous as compared to low-dose IVIG with an identical regimen comprising bortezomib and PPH.</s><s>Both the change from rituximab-based treatment to bortezomibbased treatment and the increase of the IVIG dose from a lowdose to a high-dose regimen resulted in a stepwise improvement of graft survival and graft function.</s><s>The observed reduction of DSA following treatment in the BHP group but to a lower extent in both other groups reflects the clinical course and is in concordance with the literature.</s><s>Terasaki and colleagues demonstrated that a decrease in HLA antibody levels can be used as a surrogate marker for the efficacy of an antirejection treatment and directly correlates with superior allograft survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, our results confirm and extend our previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> inasmuch as bortezomib-based treatment proved to be superior to rituximab-based treatment and that the addition of high-dose IVIG further increased graft survival.</s><s>Our findings are in line with the results from the randomized RITUX-ERAH trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>, which demonstrated no statistically significant effects of rituximab for the treatment of ABMR.</s><s>Our results also suggest that high-dose IVIG seems to be advisable in the presence of modern antihumoral therapeutics such as bortezomib.</s><s>This conclusion is supported by experimental data showing that only a small proportion of IgG in the available IVIG preparations is responsible for the immunosuppressive effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the amount of applied IVIG seems to be crucial for the success of treatment.</s></p><p><s>Theoretically, it would have been interesting to investigate a group of patients treated with rituximab, PPH, and highdose IVIG, in order to further elucidate the efficacy of rituximab and high-dose IVIG treatment.</s><s>However, in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> we observed a clear trend towards an improved graft survival in patients, who received a bortezomib-based treatment over a rituximab-based treatment, so that we deliberately decided to treat all upcoming patients with a bortezomib-based protocol and refrained from further trials on rituximab-based treatment in order not to expose patients to a (in our opinion) potentially higher risk of graft loss.</s></p><p><s>First reports on the effects of IVIG in the context of renal transplantation have been published 20-30 years ago.</s><s>In 1984, Steiner et al. investigated the impact of prophylactic IVIG administration on the rate of infection in a prospective randomized trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Because the proportion of patients discharged with a functioning graft was lower in the treatment group, the authors concluded that prophylactic administration of IVIG is "not only useless but probably dangerous."</s><s>About one decade later, Peraldi et al. showed that early high-dose IVIG treatment (2 g/kg) following renal retransplantation improved 5-year graft survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s>One of the first reports demonstrating that high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) may be effective in the treatment of ABMR following kidney transplantation was published by <ref type="bibr">Jordan et al. in 1998 [19]</ref>.</s><s>In 2001, Casadei and colleagues observed that high-dose IVIG treatment (3.5 g/kg) was equally effective in the treatment of steroid-resistant rejection as OKT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, Luke and colleagues also found that high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) was effective to reverse steroid-or antilymphocyte antibody-resistant rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, a consistent definition of ABMR based on pathological findings and the presence of circulating DSA was not introduced into the Banff classification until 2003 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, studies performed before 2003 must be regarded with caution.</s><s>In the more recent era, Lefaucheur et al. reported that treatment of ABMR with high-dose IVIG alone (2 g/kg ×4) was inferior to a combination of high-dose IVIG, PPH, and rituximab, indicating that IVIG alone, even if applied in very high doses, is not sufficient to treat ABMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In 2014, Cooper et al. showed that high-dose IVIG alone (5 g/kg) caused a modest DSA reduction, especially concerning class I DSA in patients with previous acute ABMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The effectiveness of IVIG therapy on circulating HLAab has also been investigated in various studies on pretransplant desensitization.</s><s>In 1993, Glotz et al. described that pretransplant administration of high-dose IVIG (1.6 g/kg) suppresses HLAab formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>More than ten years later, Jordan et al. showed that high-dose IVIG treatment (2 g/kg ×4) reduced PRA levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In 2006, Stegall et al. observed that high-dose IVIG treatment (2 g/kg) decreased DSA titers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Vo and colleagues reported in 2008 that treatment with high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg ×2) and rituximab (375 mg/m 2 ×2) reduced PRA levels from 77% to 44% <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, the same group compared desensitization with high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg ×2) plus rituximab (1 g) to high-dose IVIG (2 g/kg ×2) plus placebo in a randomized clinical study <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Patients received an additional dose of IVIG at transplantation plus an additional dose of rituximab or placebo at six months after transplant.</s><s>Following transplantation of 13 patients, the study was halted and unblinded because of three episodes of ABMR.</s><s>All episodes had occurred in the placebo group (3/7) indicating that high-dose IVIG alone did not sufficiently prevent ABMR.</s><s>Notably, 1/6 patients in the rituximab group died at 12 months after transplantation from a Nocardia brain abscess.</s></p><p><s>In group BLP, two patients received maintenance immunosuppression including everolimus following diagnosis.</s><s>One of these patients returned to maintenance hemodialysis at 6 months after diagnosis; in the other patient serum creatinine at 88 months after diagnosis is stable at 2.4 mg/dL.</s><s>In this patient we did not reinitiate calcineurin-inhibitor treatment because of a history of cyclosporine A-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome soon after transplantation.</s><s>Notably, we</s></p><p><s>were not yet aware of the fact that everolimus-based immunosuppression is associated with an increased risk for the development of DSA and ABMR in 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, a higher cg score was observed in patients of group BLP as compared to group BHP.</s><s>This might be important, as Billing et al. showed that the degree of transplant glomerulopathy is associated with the response to treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we included maintenance immunosuppression and cg scores at the time of ABMR diagnosis as covariates in our Cox proportional hazard analysis but could not find a statistically significant impact on allograft outcome.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results demonstrate that graft survival of patients with a diagnosis of ABMR following renal transplantation improved during the past years along with the introduction of bortezomib and high-dose IVIG treatment resulting in a 5-year graft survival of about 50% following diagnosis.</s><s>In conclusion, the use of high-dose IVIG in combination with a bortezomib-based treatment regimen seems to be useful, especially when compared to a historical group of patients treated with low-dose IVIG, PPH, and rituximab.</s><s>The degree of DSA reduction in group BHP supports this conclusion and may be used as biomarker for the efficacy of treatment.</s><s>In our view, stepwise controlled modifications of the established treatment protocols are helpful to gradually improve the prognosis following a diagnosis of ABMR.</s><s>The main limitation of our study is the fact that it is a retrospective study with a limited number of patients comprising episodes of early and late ABMR and comparing cohorts treated at different time periods that differ in some important variables.</s><s>Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution, and further studies are necessary to confirm our findings.</s><s>In future, IVIG preparations containing a higher proportion of Fc fragments with terminal sialic acid residues may be even more effective.</s><s>Until such preparations will be available, the amount of applied IVIG seems to be crucial for the success of treatment.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1
