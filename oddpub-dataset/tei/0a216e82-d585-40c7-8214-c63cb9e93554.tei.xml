<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a well-established surgical treatment for radiculopathy and myelopathy.</s><s>Previous studies showed that empty PEEK cages have lower radiographic fusion rates, but the clinical relevance remains unclear.</s><s>This paper's aim is to provide high-quality evidence on the outcomes of ACDF with empty PEEK cages and on the relevance of radiographic fusion for clinical outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Methods: This large prospective multicenter clinical trial performed single-level ACDF with empty PEEK cages on patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy.</s><s>The main clinical outcomes were VAS (0-10) for pain and NDI (0-100) for functioning.</s><s>Radiographic fusion was evaluated by two investigators for three different aspects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>The median (range) improvement of the VAS pain score was: 3 (1-6) at 6 months, 3 (2-8) at 12 months, and 4 (2-8) at 18 months.</s><s>The median (range) improvement of the NDI score was: 12 (2-34) at 6 months, 18 (4-46) at 12 months, and 22 (2-44) at 18 months.</s><s>Complete radiographic fusion was reached by 126 patients (43%) at 6 months, 214 patients (73%) at 12 months, and 241 patients (83%) at 18 months.</s><s>Radiographic fusion was a highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) predictor of the improvement of VAS and NDI scores.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>This study provides strong evidence that ACDF is effective treatment, but the overall rate of radiographic fusion with empty PEEK cages is slow and insufficient.</s><s>Lack of complete radiographic fusion leads to less improvement of pain and disability.</s><s>We recommend against using empty uncoated pure PEEK cages in ACDF.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) is an established standard surgical treatment for radiculopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and myelopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> attributed to degenerative changes of the cervical spine.</s><s>A recent large metaanalysis of four FDA IDE trials reported an overall 2-year success rate of 70.8% for the ACDF control groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Although in the past it was not uncommon to perform only ACD with bone graft or even no replacement of the removed tissue at all, this is rarely done anymore; the standard today is to replace the removed disk with a spacer with or without additional bone graft or other materials, in order to achieve bony fusion of the adjoining two vertebral bodies.</s><s>The purpose of inserting the spacer is to maintain disk height and lordosis, and provide stability, until bony fusion of the two vertebrae can occur to eliminate potentially painful segmental motion.</s><s>A large metaanalysis has reported that the rate of radiographic fusion for single-level ACDF at an average follow-up of 12 or more months is 92.1% <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The implants used in ACDF can be made of several different types of material, including among others: titanium, carbon fiber, stainless steel, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), carbonium, or polyetheretherketone (PEEK).</s></p><p><s>PEEK implants have become a popular choice during the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>PEEK has several advantageous properties that explain its popularity.</s><s>First, PEEK is radiolucent, so x-rays of the spine remain clearly visible <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Second, PEEK has an elastic modulus similar to that of human bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, which may reduce the likelihood of implant subsidence into the vertebrae <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Third, PEEK is highly biocompatible and durable, making it suitable as a long-term implant <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Fourth, PEEK is highly resistant to gamma and electron beam radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, making it safe to sterilize before surgery and to image postoperatively.</s><s>However, all these material advantages of PEEK would be worthless if the surgery did not help the patient clinically because bony fusion was not achieved.</s></p><p><s>Several, mostly small, clinical studies reporting on PEEK cages filled with a variety of materials (iliac bone, allograft, DBM, etc.) have reported high rates (90-100%) of radiographic fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, while a few have reported slightly lower rates (75-89%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or remain unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Yet in the four previous studies reporting on ACDF with empty PEEK cages, the rates of radiographic fusion have generally been noticeably lower: 88% <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, "30% obvious fusion, 46% probable fusion" at 6 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, 72% of levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and 65% of levels or 62% of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>All four of these studies on empty PEEK cages claimed that there was no correlation between clinical outcomes and fusion status, but all of them were probably too small and underpowered to actually determine this.</s><s>A larger but retrospective study reported an 85% rate of fusion in single-level cases and 95% in multi-level, but did not comment on the clinical relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>So although it seems clear that empty PEEK cages have suboptimal rates of fusion, the clinical relevance has not yet been elucidated, and empty PEEK cages remain widely in use.</s></p><p><s>The "PIERCE-PEEK" study-"Prospective International multicenter Evaluation of Radiological and Clinical Effects of stand-alone Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) Intervertebral Spacers for Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and Fusion"-was a large clinical trial designed to assess the clinical effectiveness of a first-generation PEEK cage, within the standard ACDF procedure, without additional instrumentation or substances, as treatment for singlelevel cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy.</s><s>The current purpose of this paper is to report those main clinical outcomes, as well as some unexpected and concerning radiographic findings, which we believe are attributable to the PEEK material itself.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics</head><p><s>The study was approved by the Ethics commission of the Charité University Hospital on <ref type="bibr">May 22, 2006</ref>.</s><s>Patients were permitted to join the study only if they provided written informed consent and were considered competent to do so.</s><s>Trial registry was uncommon at that time, but the "PIERCE-PEEK" trial was entered into the ISRCTN registry on April 14, 2009 with ID# 42774128.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design &amp; setting</head><p><s>The research was designed as a prospective, international, multicenter, single-arm, clinical trial.</s><s>Enrollment and surgeries took place at a large university hospital and two teaching hospitals in a major European city (Berlin, Germany) and one private hospital in a small city in another European country (Limassol, Cyprus).</s><s>Enrollment started in September 2006.</s><s>Followup was scheduled for 6, 12, and 18 months post-op.</s><s>All radiographs were digitalized and analyzed centrally, as described in more detail below.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were age 18+, had a degenerative condition between C3 and T1 with clinical signs of radiculopathy or myelopathy, and were otherwise indicated for a single-level ACDF.</s><s>Patients were excluded if they had: pronounced osteoporosis, fracture of any cervical vertebra, tumor in the cervical spine, previous cervical operations, acute spinal infections, systemic infections, known allergy or intolerance of PEEK, or kyphosis or instability / hypermobility of the cervical spine on functional x-rays.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgery</head><p><s>All patients received a standard anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF), using the Smith-Robinson technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> with implantation of a cage (described in detail below) by one of two surgeons at each of the four hospitals.</s><s>The cages were not filled with any kind of material.</s><s>Additional instrumentation was not used.</s><s>Post-operative neck collars were not prescribed.</s><s>Further details of the surgical procedure can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implant</head><p><s>All patients in this study were implanted with a "Shell" cage (Advanced Medical Technologies (AMT); Nonnweiler, Germany).</s><s>These cages were made entirely from pure PEEK, except for four vertical pins embedded in the four corners to enable visualization of the cage on x-rays.</s><s>The cages were available in the following sizes: 4x16, 5x16, 6x16, 7x16, 5x18, 6x18, 7x18 mm.</s><s>The top and bottom of the cages had a "toothed" form to reduce the chance of expulsion, but otherwise all surfaces were smooth and uncoated.</s><s>Further description and illustrations have been provided previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical measures</head><p><s>Pain was measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS).</s><s>The VAS used took the form of a 10 cm ruler, with numbers marked from 0 to 10, "no pain" written to the left of 0 and "maximum worst pain" to the right of 10, with the question "how strong is your pain right now" above the scale.</s><s>Patients were asked to mark the number 0 to 10 on the VAS, and answers were recorded in the databank as whole numbers.</s></p><p><s>Patient functioning was assessed with a German translation of the Neck Disability Index (NDI), based upon one we had seen at the German Spine Society annual meeting and which we believe was from the same research group that just recently published a validated German translation of the NDI <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>(Patients at the one center outside of Germany completed all questionnaires in English.)</s><s>The 10 NDI questions were scored on their scales of 0-5, summed together, and then doubled, to yield a total score on a 0-100 scale.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the raw scores for VAS and NDI, the improvement (aka "change scores") on each of these measures at each study follow-up was calculated by subtracting the follow-up score from the pre-op score.</s><s>Two recent but small studies indicate that a change of 2.9 points or more on the 0-10 VAS scale would be clinically important in the ACDF population <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s>Based on several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, the minimum clinically important improvement of the NDI appears to be about 20 points on a 0-100 scale, a value that has the advantage over other numerical thresholds of meaning that the patient improved on average by one response level on each of the 10 items of the NDI.</s></p><p><s>The overall outcome at 18 months post-op was assessed by the surgeon using Odom's criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Radiological assessment</head><p><s>Anterior/posterior, lateral, and functional x-rays were taken at each study visit and digitalized.</s><s>Radiographic fusion on these x-rays was assessed at all follow-up timepoints at the main study center independently by two people: a radiologist and either the lead surgeon or one specific medical research fellow.</s><s>In cases where the scoring differed between the radiologist and the other evaluator (&lt;10% of all cases), a third assessment was made by the lead surgeon at the study center outside of Germany.</s></p><p><s>Drawing on previous guidance from the US FDA and the Surgical Interbody Research Group <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, fusion was evaluated by considering three criteria: bony bridging, radiolucency at the juncture of the implant and vertebra, and the amount of motion on dynamic x-rays.</s><s>For the criteria of bony bridging, 0 to 3 points were given, depending on how many of the five sides of the implant (anterior, posterior, lateral left, lateral right, and the central interior space through the empty cage) showed bridging bone all the way from one vertebra to the other on the x-rays: 0 points for none, 1 point for 1 or 2 sides, 2 points for 3 or 4 sides, or 3 points for all 5 sides.</s><s>For the criteria of radiolucency, 0 to 2 points were given, depending inversely on the number of implant/vertebra junctures affected.</s><s>For the criteria of stability / motion, 0 points were given if the range of motion was &gt; 3°on flexion / extension x-rays, and 2 points were given otherwise.</s><s>The subscores from these three criteria were then summed, yielding a total fusion score of 0 to 7.</s></p><p><s>For further interpretation and analysis, the raw fusion scores were grouped into four grades of fusion: grade 1 (0-2 points) was considered "no fusion", grade 2 (3-4 points) was considered "instable ankylosis", grade 3 (5 points) was considered "questionably stable fusion", and grade 4 (6-7 points) was considered "complete fusion".</s><s>When subsequently describing patients dichotomously as either "fused" or "not fused", only grade 4 ("complete fusion") was viewed as "fused".</s></p><p><s>In the following passages of this report, the "fusion score" refers to the 0-7 raw score; the "fusion grade" refers to the set of four categories, and "complete fusion" or "fused" refers to patients with the grade 4 of fusion (i.e.</s><s>raw fusion scores 6 and 7), while all other patients have "incomplete fusion" or are "not fused".</s><s>Examples of a good and bad fusion are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As will be briefly discussed below, the present report provides good evidence that this system of scoring radiographic fusion is clinically relevant and methodologically appropriate.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The study sample was characterized and the radiographic and clinical outcomes were reported using descriptive summary statistics and data visualization.</s><s>The correlation between the improvement in VAS and the improvement in NDI at each of the three follow-up timepoints was calculated using Pearson's product moment.</s><s>The correlation between the Odom's criteria on the one hand and the final VAS score, the final NDI score, or the fusion grade at each of the three follow-up timepoints on the other hand was calculated with Spearman's rank order, because the Odom's criteria is an ordinal variable.</s><s>Forward stepwise regression analysis was used to determine if the improvements in VAS or NDI at each of the three follow-up timepoints were dependent upon patient sex, age, operated spinal level, or the fusion score at either the same or a prior followup timepoint, with the F-to-enter set at 4.0 and F-toremove set at 3.9.</s><s>After seeing the results of these regression analyses, we decided to compare the improvements in VAS and NDI at all follow-up timepoints (as well as the pre-operative VAS and NDI scores) for patients who had versus had not reached complete radiographic fusion at the same or prior follow-up timepoints, using the Mann-Whitney rank sum test, because the data was not normally distributed.</s><s>To reduce the chance of emphasizing spurious results, we considered results to be statistically significant only at p ≤ 0.01 and highly significant at p ≤ 0.001, while results were only dismissed as "not significant" if p &gt; 0.1.</s><s>All statistical analysis and graphing was performed in SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software; San Jose, CA, USA).</s></p></div>

whereas, if none of those 64 patients achieved fusion, then the fusion rate would have been 68% (241 of 356).</s><s>But if the lossto-follow-up was completely at random, then a complete-case analysis is valid <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> and there is probably no relevant effect on the results reported here.</s><s>An interesting study on a lumbar degenerative surgery registry found that drop-outs were younger, had a shorter hospital stay, and had a lower rate of surgical complications than completers, but after tracking down nearly all the drop-outs, they also found that there were no significant differences between drop-outs and completers in any of the 2year clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</s><s>The second limitation is that the exact forms of the VAS and NDI used were not quite the ideal versions we would select if designing a similar trial today, though they seemed the best available to us at the time.</s><s>An unnumbered 0-100 VAS scale and a previously validated NDI Table <ref type="table">4</ref> Pairwise comparisons of the improvements of NDI functioning scores at the follow-up timepoints between patients who were (Y) versus were not (N) completely fused at various follow-up timepoints.</s><s>There was no statistically significant or clinically meaningful difference of the pre-op NDI functioning score when comparing the patients who were versus were not completely fused at each of the three followup timepoints (details not shown), meaning that the groups were comparable at baseline.</s><s>By contrast, all six pairs of comparisons listed in the table were statistically highly significant (all p &lt; 0.001, except the comparison of Δ NDI 18 M according to 6 M fusion status was merely significant at p = 0.006) translation would have been even better, but we do not believe these subtle differences would have changed the results noticeably.</s><s>Moreover, the VAS and NDI are still the best instruments for assessing pain and disability in this patient population.</s><s>Third, our clinical trial did not have a comparison group receiving ACDF with an implant made from a different material, so in all scientific stringency, it is not entirely clear how much the inadequate radiographic fusion is due to the PEEK material itself rather than to something else.</s><s>It is entirely possible that the inadequate fusion is due in part to other factors, such as smoking or osteopenia, (which could also explain lower improvements in VAS and NDI respectively).</s><s>Nonetheless, our rates of radiographic fusion are lower than what we expected from the literature, and several basic science studies show that PEEK does not favor bony ongrowth, so we believe it is reasonable to conclude that the use of PEEK was the main reason for the disappointing fusion rates.</s><s>This study also has several strengths that should be kept in mind.</s><s>First, this study was a prospective multicenter trial, and thus it provides somewhat higher quality of evidence than most other studies on ACDF.</s><s>Second, this study had a large sample size, (again much larger than most studies on ACDF in the literature).</s><s>Despite the removal of patients discussed above, the remaining study sample size was still far above the original target enrollment of N = 200 called for in the protocol, based on a power calculation performed by a statistician at our university.</s><s>The consistent pattern of statistically highly significant results confirms that the study was sufficient powered to provide statistically reliable results.</s><s>Third, again unlike most studies on ACDF, we used a well-designed and clearly reported system for assessing radiographic fusion, and had two independent researchers assess all radiographs.</s><s>Indeed, the fact that we found a clear pattern of clinical consequences from incomplete fusion provides strong evidence that the system we used to score the radiographic fusion is clinically relevant and methodologically appropriate: neither too strict, nor too lax, nor likely to be overlooking other relevant aspects of radiographic fusion.</s><s>We would recommend that other clinicians and researchers also adopt this system of scoring radiographic fusion.</s><s>A fourth strength of our study is that we found a consistent pattern of results, with high statistical significance and a convincing explanation of the underlying biomedical reasons.</s><s>We did not need to dredge the data, selectively emphasize cherry-picked results that happened to be marginally significant, and/or engage in speculation about the meaning of the results.</s><s>The results of our study are clear and coherent, thus implying that they refer to a real clinical issue.</s></p></div>
