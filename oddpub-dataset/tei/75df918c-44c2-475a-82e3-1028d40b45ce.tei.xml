<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion and conclusions</head><p><s>The current urticaria guideline clearly recommends that the aim of treatment should be to achieve complete control of symptoms.</s><s>However, none of the previously available patient reported outcome tools are designed to detect disease control in patients with CU <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>This fact was one major reason why the UCT has been developed.</s></p><p><s>In addition, the UCT was designed to be (i) a patientreported outcome (PRO), (ii) independent of any previous patient presentations, (iii) easy to administer and fast to complete, and (iv) easy to score and interpret <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The validity, reliability, screening accuracy and feasibility of the original version has been proved for the original German version <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The reduction of the Long Form to  the Short Form was not found to affect the performance of the UCT.</s><s>Thus, the authors of the German version recommend to use the Short Form in routine clinical practice and the Long Form in case of additional information is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The German versions were also translated and linguistically validated for American English <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our study demonstrated positive strong correlations of both forms of the Thai UCT with PatGA-LS and PhyGA-VAS.</s><s>Notably, both forms of the Thai UCT correlated more strongly with PatGA-LS than PhyGA-VAS, probably because PatGA-LS was a self-assessment of the patients as is the UCT.</s><s>In addition, strong negative correlations were found between the Thai UCT and UAS28, PatGA-VAS, and the validated version of Thai CU-Q 2 oL because higher scores of the UCT (wellcontrolled disease) indicates lower disease severity and lower negative impact on HRQoL of patients.</s><s>Cronbach's α and ICC values of the Thai and German versions of the UCT were comparable which indicated excellent reproducibility of both versions of the UCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>For screening accuracy, the cutoff values we obtained were very close to those of the original study.</s><s>In order to facilitate the use of UCT, we propose that the  same cutoff values for well controlled-and poorly controlled disease of ≥ 24 and &lt; 24 for Long Form UCT and ≥ 12 and &lt; 12 for Short Form UCT, respectively should be used for the Thai version as those recommended in the original German version <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The sum of weighted scores for the use of antihistamines, oral glucocorticoids, ciclosporin, hydroxychloroquine and montelukast has been used to determine disease severity and treatment outcome of CU patients in several studies.</s><s>However, its sensitivity to change and MCID have never been defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Both sensitivity to change and MCID are important measurement properties that can be used to objectively determine treatment outcomes.</s><s>Moreover, it is generally accepted that anchor-based methods have higher clinical relevance and should be preferred to define MCID rather than statistical distribution-based analysis.</s><s>For practical use, we therefore propose that score increments of 6 and 3 for the Long and Short Forms of Thai UCT, respectively can be regarded as the smallest increases that identify "minimal responders" well.</s><s>Scores increments  The differences of mean scores 2.8 5.8</s></p><p><s>Abbreviation: SD standard deviation of ≥10 and ≥ 6 for Long Form and Short Form Thai UCT, respectively may be used to identify "marked responders".</s></p></div>
