<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>History</head><p><s>A commercial emu flock in central North Carolina was evaluated because of a sporadic, progressive, fatal neurologic disease that had occurred during the previous 2 years.</s><s>Five to 10 young birds either had died or were euthanized annually resulting in economic losses.</s><s>Ages at the onset of clinical signs ranged from 30 days to 1 year.</s><s>Clinical signs began as head tremors and retrograde walking, and progressed to ataxia and recumbency over ~2 weeks.</s><s>Adult breeding emus and other young birds were not affected.</s><s>There was no response to empirical antimicrobial and antiparasitic treatments, and no infectious disease was identified.</s><s>No cause for the neurologic disease had been identified prior to submission of two affected emu siblings to the NCSU CVM for diagnosis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flock</head><p><s>The flock of ~230 emus was comprised of 78 adult breeders with the remaining young birds (&lt;18 months) being raised for meat and oil production.</s><s>Colony breeders were kept on pastures in groups of ~30 emus with a 1:1 male to female ratio.</s><s>Additionally, 13 breeder pairs were maintained separately in individual pens.</s><s>Young emus intended for oil and other markets were kept in three groups of 70 -100 birds.</s><s>A commercial diet formulated for emus and water were provided ad libitum, and there was continuous access to grazing and sandy soil.</s><s>Emus were not vaccinated, but were regularly treated for parasites with 1% levamisole via water.</s><s>Investigation of the flock was done as a clinical service provided by the Poultry Health Management Team, North Carolina State University, College of Veterinary Medicine with consent by the producer.</s><s>Specific animal research study permissions were not required for herd management.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emus</head><p><s>The index case (Case 1) was an 8-month old male referred for clinical evaluation and necropsy due to worsening neurologic disease like that seen in previously affected emus on the farm.</s><s>Physical and neurologic examinations, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and upper neck were performed.</s><s>A female sibling (Case 2) showing the same neurologic signs as the index case was subsequently submitted for euthanasia and necropsy.</s><s>Additionally, a juvenile emu found recumbent in the field was submitted for euthanasia and necropsy (Case 3).</s><s>Clinical neurological signs in this emu resulted from traumatic spinal injury without any evidence of storage disease.</s><s>Tissues from this bird served as normal histologic controls.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p><s>Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated blood samples and fresh splenic tissue were obtained from the index case, sibling, and traumatically injured emu from the same farm for MPS IIIB genotyping.</s><s>Subsequently, approximately 1-2 ml EDTA blood samples were collected from the right external jugular vein of 78 breeders and shipped chilled to PennGen at the University of Pennsylvania for genetic screening.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pathology</head><p><s>Both the index case and sibling were necropsied immediately after euthanasia.</s><s>Following gross evaluation, the entire brain and samples of spinal cord and visceral organs were placed into 10% neutral buffered formalin, fixed for 72 hours, trimmed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin.</s><s>Selected tissues were stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS with and without diastase) and Luxol fast blue (LFB).</s></p></div>

Minnaar, 1992)</ref>.</s><s>MPS IIIB has not been described from emu populations in other countries or in free-living emus in Australia.</s><s>There is also no recognized advantage of being heterozygous for the NAGLU mutation, as was suspected for the common CD18 variant in Holstein cattle or RYR1 variant in pigs.</s></p><p><s>DNA screening of the commercial flock in this study showed a high prevalence of the mutant NAGLU allele (.09) with nearly 20% of breeders being carriers.</s><s>The frequency of the MPS IIIB mutation in the emu population is unknown, but MPS IIIB has been described in different parts of the USA.</s><s>For this farm, a 'test and cull male carriers' program was proposed in an attempt to preserve the gene pool and breeders and eliminate the disease from the flock over two or more generations.</s><s>All heterozygous carrier males were to be culled, while carrier females would be paired with males tested clear for the mutant allele.</s><s>Removing only the males and keeping the females would maintain the breeding potential of the flock and maintain most of the genetic diversity.</s><s>It was further recommended to do the same testing of offspring retained as potential breeders in future years and then to select the clear males and females in future breeding, but there is no follow up at this time.</s><s>Lack of follow up may be related to an unawareness of the power of genetic screening and economic losses by the MPS IIIB disease.</s><s>Currently, there are no large surveys like the farm described here; however, it seems ethical, prudent, and economical to screen emus for the NAGLU to avoid animal suffering and financial losses.</s><s>Therefore, genetic screening is recommended for any emu flock with affected birds and/or carriers in North America to assure no affected progeny are produced and young emus are not lost.</s><s>Combining MPS IIIB testing with screening to determine gender in young emus or even for quality trait loci may be possible in the future.</s></p><p><s>While blood samples from the breeders and tissues from necropsied birds were used as DNA sources for screening emus for the NAGLU mutation in this study, immature feathers containing pulp or dried blood spots might be simpler to collect and yet serve as well.</s><s>Dried blood spots have been used for economical diagnostic screening of people in developing countries to identify a variety of lysosomal diseases including MPS IIIB <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Verma et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Cheek swabs or cytobrushes and dried blood spot samples are used routinely for genetic screening of dogs, cats, and people and could work in emus.</s></p><p><s>Screening samples from this flock for the MPS IIIB NAGLU mutation using a simple realtime PCR assay developed in this study identified two carrier emus with an abnormal TaqMan pattern for the wild-type/normal allele.</s><s>DNA sequencing revealed the presence of a SNP very close to the position of the 2-base deletion affecting the PCR product.</s><s>Indeed, while real-time PCR is a quick and accurate test, it is not rare to have additional DNA changes in the amplified DNA as described in the instructions for Applied Biosytem TaqMan ® SNP Genotyping Assays.</s><s>Finding the SNP is of interest but did not affect the genotyping.</s><s>Its biological importance is presently unknown but predicted to be insignificant based on in vitro model analysis of the NAGLU variant.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, a method of genetic testing to accurately and quickly test many birds and identify carriers of the NAGLU mutation that causes MPS IIIB was developed in response to the disease in this emu flock.</s><s>DNA screening should be considered for all commercial emu flocks in North America, especially if they have juvenile emus that die following clinical signs of progressive neurologic disease or evidence of substantial haemorrhage.</s><s>Bu instituting a DNA screening and 'test and cull male carriers' breeding program, it should possible to eliminate MPS IIIB from any captive emu population.</s><s>Genomic DNA sequencing chromatograms of a small region surrounding the known two base deletion (c.1098_1099delGG) in a heterozygous bird also having a missense polymorphism (c.1100A&gt;G).</s><s>A single nucleotide substitution (arrow) adjacent to the known mutation site (dotted line) is predicted to change the amino acid from aspartic acid (Asp, D) to glycine (Gly, G).</s><s>Serum biochemistry panel on admission of an emu (index case) with progressive neurologic disease due to mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB.</s><s>Creatine kinase (CK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) are elevated.</s><s>Bold results are out of range.</s><s>Reference ranges adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fudge, 1996 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Costa et al., 1993</ref>.</s></p></div>
