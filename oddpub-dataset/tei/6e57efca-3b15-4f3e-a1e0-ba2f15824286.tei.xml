<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>General anesthetics are commonly used in animal models to study how sensory signals are represented in the brain.</s><s>Here, we used two-photon (2P) calcium activity imaging with cellular resolution to investigate how neuronal activity in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex is modified under the influence of different concentrations of chemically distinct general anesthetics.</s><s>Our results show that a high isoflurane dose induces synchrony in local neuronal networks and these cortical activity patterns closely resemble those observed in EEG recordings under deep anesthesia.</s><s>Moreover, ketamine and urethane also induced similar activity patterns.</s><s>While investigating the effects of deep isoflurane anesthesia on whisker and auditory evoked responses in the barrel cortex, we found that dedicated spatial regions for sensory signal processing become disrupted.</s><s>We propose that our isoflurane-2P imaging paradigm can serve as an attractive model system to dissect cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce the anesthetic state, and it might also provide important insight into sleep-like brain states and consciousness.</s></p></div>

auditory, tactile, and noxious stimuli.</s><s>Moreover, anesthesia appears to disrupt sensory boundaries because in a previously reported study tone-evoked neural responses were detected in the visual cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Land et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>How neurons in microcircuits change their activity patterns under the influence of different general anesthetics is still not

target="#b55">Sitdikova et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Although pharmacological studies suggest the dependence of the observed activity patterns on specific receptor activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Steriade et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lukatch et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kroeger and Amzica, 2007)</ref>, it is still unclear which cell types and specific mechanism(s) are involved in the emergence of these activity patterns.</s><s>Moreover, GABA A R agonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lukatch et al., 2005)</ref> as well as suppression of inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ferron et al., 2009)</ref> produced similar activity patterns in response to anesthetic agents.</s><s>We propose that cellular resolution 2P in vivo Ca 2+ imaging together with the ability to target specific cell types via GECIs such as YC2.60 can greatly advance our understanding of the emergence of BS and slow wave patterns in cortical networks under anesthesia and in other conditions like sleep and coma.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the role of synchrony in conscious perception has long been debated, but it is important to distinguish between different spatial scales of synchrony, ranging from correlated activity of different brain regions on one side to synchrony in highly localized neuronal networks on the other side.</s><s>It has been proposed that certain forms of long-range synchronization between different brain regions might bind various sensory responses to a coherent perceptual experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Engel and Singer, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>It was also proposed that certain forms of excessive interregional neuronal synchronization under anesthesia disrupt meaningful information processing and to induce unconsciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Supp et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Our results provide further evidence for the commonness of local, short-range synchrony during most anesthetic treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Erchova et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>However, we also note that animals showed decreased spontaneous movements under certain anesthetic treatments, which did not induce neural synchrony (i.e., ketamine/xylazine and 1% isoflurane).</s><s>This indicates that the increase in correlation observed in our experiments and previous studies might not be necessary for the loss of consciousness.</s></p><p><s>One caveat is that different anesthetics in our study might have influenced Ca 2+ signaling and thus GECI signals that are independent of neuronal spiking activity.</s><s>However, a previous study has shown that Ca 2+ transients measured by GECIs correlate to action potentials under deep anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lütcke et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>We also think it is unlikely that the correlated Ca 2+ transients under deep anesthesia are caused by simple changes in Ca 2+ signaling efficiency, as the transients retain the characteristic shape of fast rise and slow-exponential decay times indicative of Ca 2+ transients caused by neuronal spiking.</s><s>The considerations on Ca 2+ signaling efficiency might be most relevant to evaluation of transient amplitudes in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</s><s>However, our Ca 2+ imaging data is in line with previous findings that used purely electrophysiological recordings, which further supports that changes in Ca 2+ signals in our study are due to changes in neuronal spiking.</s></p><p><s>In addition to its effects on synchrony, we found that high dose isoflurane profoundly increased the fraction of whisker-responsive neurons in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex, possibly rendering previously unresponsive neurons sensitive to sensory stimuli.</s><s>Moreover, we show that this process is reversible, since lowering the isoflurane concentration decreased the fraction of whisker responsive cells back to initial values.</s><s>It is unclear which network mechanisms underlie the observed effects.</s><s>One possible explanation is that the altered network response is caused by a breakdown of local inhibition, which would normally confine the neuronal responses to individual neurons, thereby favoring sparse firing patterns over the synchronized responses in local neuronal networks.</s><s>We cannot exclude, however, that the anesthesia-induced changes in network wide synchrony are caused by a downstream network.</s><s>Indeed our results bear similarity to the broadening of thalamic receptive fields under anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Friedberg et al., 1999)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The above results are also interesting in light of previous work reporting a contraction of cortical whisker fields under urethane anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Erchova et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>This report found that barrel cortex neurons become less responsive to whisker deflections in adjacent barrels which was interpreted as a decrease in overall barrel cortex responsiveness thereby contradicting our results.</s><s>However, one discrepancy lies in the anesthetic used.</s><s>Here, we use isoflurane while Erchova et al. used urethane which might explain differences in experimental observations because different anesthetics, although both enhancing neuronal synchrony, might affect sensory responses in distinct manners.</s><s>Also, our field of view is smaller (max.</s><s>200 µm) than the cell pairs recorded in the aforementioned study (400 µm interelectrode distance) and it might be that neurons in the immediate vicinity of the barrel center might become more responsive while neurons further away become less responsive (i.e., the whisker territory retracts, but neurons within the now smaller area become more responsive to sensory stimuli).</s><s>Also, in the previous report, recordings were performed in infragranular layers whereas we record in supragranular layer 2/3 and it might thus be possible that different neuronal subtypes respond differently to anesthetic treatment.</s><s>In support of our findings of increased and unspecific neuronal responses, a previous report has shown that neurons in adjacent barrel columns become more responsive under urethane anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Simons et al., 1992)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Not only did whisker-evoked neuronal responses in the layer 2/3 barrel cortex in our study become more diffuse under anesthesia, but neurons also responded to a tone stimulus.</s><s>Similar to our observation of sound-evoked responses in the barrel cortex, previous studies reported sensory stimulus evoked neuronal responses under deep anesthesia in cortical areas other than those directly linked to the processing of the specific stimulus quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Land et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Together these results provide strong evidence for the distortion of dedicated sensory boundaries in the cortex under anesthesia.</s><s>In contrast to the fraction of layer 2/3 neurons that responded to whisker stimulation, tone-induced neuronal responses in the barrel cortex were not completely reversible within a recovery period of about 1 h, which hints toward a slow reconstitution of these boundaries after deep anesthesia.</s></p><p><s>It is tempting to speculate that a breakdown in the multimodal sensory signal transduction in the anesthetized cortex is physiologically related to the pathophysiological state as described in synesthesia, a condition where stimulation of one sense leads to an involuntary and simultaneous perception within another sense, for example, auditory stimulus evoked visual responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Harvey, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Anesthesia and synesthesia might share certain cellular mechanisms, such as increased synchrony <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Harvey, 2013)</ref> or modulation of inhibitory neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Terhune et al., 2014)</ref> that lead to a breakdown of sensory boundaries.</s><s>Therefore, two-photon Ca 2+ imaging of sensory circuits under anesthesia might also provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of synesthesia.</s></p><p><s>Notably, in the barrel cortex, astrocytic activity response shows the opposite effect in deeply anesthetized mice to those reported here.</s><s>Synchronous activity of the glia network is disrupted under deep anesthesia and astrocytic Ca 2+ responses are reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Thrane et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Considering the delayed, but well defined timing of the glia response to whisker induced activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wang et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Thrane et al., 2012)</ref>, it seems quite unlikely that the glia network is simply responding to local neuronal action potentials.</s><s>It is possible that the astrocytes are integrating and responding to multiple local and global neuronal activities.</s><s>However, currently we cannot exclude that the described glial responses to different anesthetic drugs may constitute a non-neuronal mechanism for sedation and unconsciousness.</s></p><p><s>We propose that our findings can guide the selection of anesthetic treatments for future studies.</s><s>We noted that an isoflurane dose of 1.0% (which completely immobilized the animal) did not change network parameters compared to the sedated state (0.5% isoflurane) and might therefore be suited for studies in which mice have to be immobilized during the investigation of brain activity.</s><s>Taken together with the quick reversibility of its effects on neuronal activity as shown in our study, we therefore recommend low dose isoflurane (0.5-1.0%) as the anesthetic of choice for the investigation of neuronal sensory processing in living mice.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we propose that in vivo two-photon Ca 2+ imaging of animals under different anesthetic conditions is an attractive method for dissecting molecular and cellular mechanisms surrounding anesthetic action and consciousness.</s><s>Studies examining anesthetic effects on neural networks can provide important insight into the operation of circuit function when consciousness is lost and regained.</s><s>To identify molecular targets and signaling pathways orchestrating the effects of general anesthesia, it will be imperative to apply advanced genetic tools for manipulating candidate gene(s) in local and distributed brain circuits for future studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hasan et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dogbevia et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Optogenetic manipulation of specific neuron classes in the cortex and/or projections from other brain regions during two-photon activity imaging will further help to dissect cellular and circuit dynamics of general anesthesia.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 |
