<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This work confirms our hypothesis that a single BH4 supplementation to the donor immediately before organ procurement prevents TV in a fully mismatched, murine allogeneic aorta transplantation model.</s><s>Additional major findings of this study are (1) the observation that in non-treated allogeneic aortic grafts prolonged CIT is crucial for occurrence of severe TV, and (2) the identification of two non-alloimmune key events happening already during organ procurement, and which seem to trigger severe TV development: BH4 depletion and increased occurrence of inactive eNOS monomers in the graft.</s></p><p><s>Our results fit very well with the clinical observation that the degree of IRI drastically influences TV development, and are in line with the injury hypothesis where nonantigen-dependent pathways play a pivotal role in graft deterioration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>These data confirm our hypothesis that there exists a crucial initial event triggering alloatherogenesis.</s><s>Living kidney transplantation represents an ideal example for the importance of IRI.</s><s>Despite similar alloimmune prerequisites graft survival is significantly better in living kidney compared to cadaveric kidney recipients <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>One critical difference between these two transplantation strategies is the extremely short cold ischemia time.</s><s>Also the degree of IRI-associated early microcirculatory disruption in kidney grafts has been shown to be predictive for occurrence of TV and interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, in liver transplantation IRI is a major source of long-term morbidity and mortality, significantly influencing the development of microangiopathic ischemia type biliary lesions occurring months or even years after transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Recently, a linear correlation between duration of CIT and the extent of TV has also been shown in a rat cardiac transplant model <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, severity of IRI crucially determines further graft development.</s><s>However, there is ongoing controversy whether prolonged CIT per se induces neointima formation (also in a syngeneic setting) or whether the allogeneic response is mandatory for neointima formation, and which are the triggering events initiating TV development <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In a murine pancreas transplantation model we showed in a syngeneic setting that long CIT leads to lethal graft injury in the recipients.</s><s>This could only be prevented by BH4 pretreatment of the donor.</s><s>However, due to the high amount of active proteases in the pancreas a further dissection of the underlying mechanism was not possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In the current study, we analysed in an aortic transplantation model the influence of CIT on TV development.</s><s>The novelty consists on the one hand in the better suited model for analysing the hypothesised protective effect of BH4 in the early stages of the organ transplantation process, and on the other hand, in the allogeneic setting, allowing to analyse the impact of BH4 treatment in the presence of the alloimmune response.</s></p><p><s>Aortic interpositioning models represent together with heterotopic heart transplantation models accepted mouse models for studying TV <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>Despite the advantage of transplanting a vascularised organ, heart transplantation models have several drawbacks compared to aortic transplantation models: (i) the heterogeneity of TV in the transplanted heart that results in the need for larger numbers of grafts per group 44 , (ii) the necessity of immunosuppressive treatment of the recipient animals that may modify TV dynamics and (iii) also the likelihood of chronic ischemia in models using the carotid artery due to the inadequacy of the arterial pressure to enable normal coronary perfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, a major drawback described in the aortic interpositioning model is the replacement of donor endothelial and smooth muscle cells by host cells after several weeks following severe rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>Acting on the assumption that in this study key events happen already during organ procurement we opted for the aortic interpositioning model because of the above mentioned advantages.</s><s>Results achieved in this study have to be interpreted on the basis of the used aortic interpositioning model.</s></p><p><s>Four weeks post transplantation we observed dramatically lower P-selectin expression and lower α -SMA expression within neointimal lesions in the allogeneic, treated group compared to the allogeneic, non-treated group.</s><s>P-selectin and α -SMA are two hallmarks of TV.</s><s>Vascular wall remodelling in TV is characterized by accumulation of α -SMA positive cells within the intima instead of the medial muscle layer, where, as a consequence of medial degradation, α -SMA positive cells are replaced by scar tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>In addition, P-selectin is known to promote smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration into the vascular wall, thereby, supporting neointima formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in contrast to these two endothelial cell activation and TV markers, BH4 pretreatment of the donor did not influence the infiltration of CD4 and CD8 positive inflammatory cells as well as of CD68 positive macrophages, all cells described to be involved in TV <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>This points to the importance of early nonantigen-dependent events on top of antigen-dependent reactions for the development of TV.</s><s>In fact, neither CIT alone, as shown in the syngeneic control group, nor the mere alloimmune cell infiltration observed in the allogeneic grafts without CIT triggered severe TV.</s><s>Hence, IRI seems to be as mandatory as the alloimmune reaction for TV occurrence initiating probably a vascular damage as triggering event, which is then sustained by the allogeneic response on top.</s><s>However, we cannot exclude development of TV in an allogeneic setting without CIT later on after the selected endpoint of 4 weeks used in this study.</s><s>In this regard, it has been shown that late after transplantation alloimmune factors gain more importance for TV development <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The observation that BH4 treatment of the donor prevents TV development 4 weeks following transplantation supports the hypothesis that the trigger event takes place on a very early stage of the transplant procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>BH4 is a powerful naturally occurring antioxidative agent and an essential co-factor of the NOS.</s><s>BH4 availability is crucial for formation and stabilisation of active NOS homodimers.</s><s>Decreased BH4 levels have been associated with increased occurrence of inactive eNOS monomers, consistent with NOS uncoupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>This refers  to the generation of superoxide rather than nitric oxide (NO) by the NOS enzyme due to the electron transfer being uncoupled during the enzymatic reaction.</s><s>NOS uncoupling results in endothelial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , a pathomechanism which is linked to numerous

target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> .</s><s>Previous studies showed that prevention of IRI by BH4 is specific for this compound and related to its NOS co-factor activity rather than to its antioxidant capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Analyses of intragraft protein oxidation and BH4 levels clearly show a high degree of deleterious oxidative damage and BH4 depletion at the time of graft recovery.</s><s>Both, however, are significantly attenuated by BH4 treatment of donor.</s><s>Interestingly, this happens even though BH4 is applied only 2 minutes before organ procurement.</s><s>The depletion of BH4 is likely to result from direct oxidative degradation as a consequence of the oxidative stress during graft procurement.</s><s>In fact, under an altered redox state, BH4 availability is impaired as BH4 biosynthesis is crucially dependent from a normal cellular redox state <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In parallel, at the time of graft recovery, retrieved aortic grafts of non-treated donors had a higher amount of inactive eNOS monomers compared to grafts from treated animals, in which active eNOS dimers were predominant.</s><s>This suggests that intragraft depletion of BH4 which is demonstrated by a reduced BH4-to-BH2 ratio within aortic grafts results in increased occurrence of inactive eNOS monomers, a mechanism known to be at the basis of endothelial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>In fact, a reduced BH4-to-BH2 ratio, rather than absolute concentrations of BH4, is accountable for normal eNOS function <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>So, single administration of BH4 to the donor prevented decreased BH4-to-BH2 and as a consequence eNOS dysfunction, which in our opinion is of crucial importance for TV occurrence.</s><s>These results are also in line with the disappointing results of oral BH4 treatment in patients suffering from coronary artery disease.</s><s>Despite elevated BH4 levels BH4-to BH2 ratio did not increase.</s><s>Therefore, no effects were seen on endothelial function, vascular superoxide production and eNOS coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The proposed pathomechanism based on BH4 depletion and increased occurrence of inactive eNOS monomers is also in line with the knowledge that NO inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> , and with the observation that in a balloon angioplasty model with prominent endothelial injury increased generation of NO prevented intimal thickening and restenosis of the vessel by inhibiting SMC proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>BH4 and NO homeostasis have also been shown to play a crucial role in Cyclosporine A (CyA) induced vasomotor dysfunction proposing this pathway as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent CyA induced vascular injury in transplant recipients <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> .</s><s>However, the crucial difference between our study and the previously published models is the alloimmune response.</s><s>Here, prevention of the non-alloimmune, early oxidative endothelial injury in the graft prevented also the development of alloimmune, chronic rejection.</s><s>So, destabilisation of the active eNOS homodimer, consistent with endothelial dysfunction, appears to be crucial for triggering TV development.</s></p><p><s>Pretreatment of the donor before organ procurement is not new to the organ transplantation field.</s><s>Recently, therapeutic hypothermia of the donor has been proposed as a promising strategy to protect recipients from delayed graft function following kidney transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</s><s>Hence, from a clinical point of view, pretreatment of the donor with BH4 would be definitely feasible, and application of BH4 minutes before starting organ procurement would even ease logistical requirements.</s><s>In our previous work comparing different BH4 administration strategies like supplementation of the perfusion/storage solution, recipient or donor treatment, only donor treatment showed significant protection from IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>This is in line with the current results showing crucial events occurring already during organ procurement (treatment of the recipient "misses the target") and also with observation that the equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT1, which is responsible for BH4 uptake, is temperature-dependent.</s><s>The lower the temperature the lower the intracellular BH4 uptake (currently, organs are perfused and stored under hypothermic conditions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> .</s><s>Donor pretreatment seems, therefore, to be currently the only option to prevent IRI and, as a consequence, TV by BH4.</s><s>Whether the emergence of normothermic perfusion strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> offers new treatment opportunities for BH4 has to be further analysed.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we observed a direct correlation between increased eNOS monomer amounts due to BH4 depletion at the time of graft procurement and severe TV development later on.</s><s>This represents a plausible mechanistic explanation of the clinical observation, that severity of IRI crucially influences TV occurrence and graft deterioration.</s><s>These results open new therapeutic scenarios in the prevention of TV, currently a major challenge in solid organ transplantation.</s><s>Pretreatment of the donor with exogenous BH4 or other agents targeting eNOS in the graft might represent in this regard a promising future strategy.</s></p></div>
