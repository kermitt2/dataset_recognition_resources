<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective Because cystic fibrosis (CF) can be difficult to diagnose, and because information about the genetic complexities and pathologic basis of the disease has grown so rapidly over the decades, several consensus conferences have been held by the US CF Foundation, and a variety of other efforts to improve diagnostic practices have been organized by the European CF Society.</s><s>Despite these efforts, the application of diagnostic criteria has been variable and caused confusion.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>To improve diagnosis and achieve standardization in terms and definitions worldwide, the CF Foundation in 2015 convened a committee of 32 experts in the diagnosis of CF from 9 countries.</s><s>As part of the process, all previous consensus-seeking exercises sponsored by the CF Foundation, along with the important efforts of the European CF Society, were comprehensively and critically reviewed.</s><s>The goal was to better understand why consensus conferences and their publications have not led to the desired results.</s></p><p><s>Results Lessons learned from previous diagnosis consensus processes and products were identified.</s><s>It was decided that participation in developing a consensus was generally not inclusive enough for global impact.</s><s>It was also found that many efforts to address sweat test issues were valuable but did not always improve clinical practices as CF diagnostic testing evolved.</s><s>It also became clear from this review that premature applications of potential diagnostic tests such as nasal potential difference and intestinal current measurement should be avoided until validation and standardization occur.</s><s>Finally, we have learned that due to the significant and growing number of cases that are challenging to diagnose, an associated continuing medical education program is both desirable and necessary.</s></p></div>

monitoring practices seem essential.</s><s>(J Pediatr 2017;181S: S16-26).</s></p><p><s>"E very physician's first duty is to diagnose-accurately and promptly.</s><s>Diagnosis is the first step of treatment." <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Although this principle of medical practice applies well to cystic fibrosis (CF), this relatively common genetic disease has presented diagnostic challenges ever since autopsy-based diagnosis was first reported by <ref type="bibr">Andersen 2</ref> in 1938, leading to the recognition and naming of the disease.</s><s>In fact, there has been a surprising degree of difficulty encountered worldwide in establishing the diagnosis unequivocally.</s><s>The advent of sweat electrolyte testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> provided considerable clarity over diagnosis based on demonstration of pancreatic insufficiency after duodenal intubation, but healthcare providers continued to be faced with uncertain cases and challenging diagnostic dilemmas.</s><s>And, although the 5-decade-long quest to diagnose CF "accurately and promptly" became more feasible with the advent of newborn screening (NBS), <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> when evidence was published on how benefits of NBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> outweighed the manageable risks (as affirmed by both the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and the US CF Foundation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> ), NBS expanded, and new diagnostic challenges ensued.</s></p><p><s>A diagnosis of CF has traditionally relied on recognition of characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, but the increased use of NBS and prenatal screening has resulted in diagnosis often before symptoms are recognized, with a consequent opportunity to foster normal growth and development.</s></p><p><s>For example, in the US, approximately 64% of new CF diagnoses now follow a positive newborn screen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>According to consensus  <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> individuals identified by NBS can be diagnosed with CF by a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L, by the identification of 2 CF-causing mutations, or by the presence of 1 CF-causing mutation plus a clinical finding in infants with an intermediate (30-59 mmol/L) sweat test result.</s><s>Although the vast majority of screened infants can be unequivocally diagnosed with CF after a positive newborn screen and sweat test, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> the decision is not clearcut in a significant number of individuals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> leading to persistent challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and stress and confusion for both families <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and clinicians. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> In addition, there has been a lack of international harmony regarding terminology, leading to confusion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>nother recently recognized problem is that, despite the carefully developed CF Foundation consensus guidelines published in 1998 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and 2008, 9 CF centers have not been applying them consistently.</s><s>For instance, in the US, approximately 20% of new diagnoses in 2010-2012 were made after NBS but without a confirmatory sweat test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>ecause of these issues, the US CF Foundation decided to convene a CF diagnosis consensus conference in 2015, bringing together CF specialists from around the world in an effort to bring clarity to diagnostic algorithms, paying special attention to the diagnostic challenges presented subsequent to the widespread implementation of NBS in the US and other countries.</s><s>During the planning phase of the 2015 CF Diagnosis Consensus Conference, it was decided that a detailed historical review would be performed to assess previous consensusproducing conferences with a goal of identifying reasons why published guidelines have been misunderstood and/or implemented inconsistently.</s><s>The review focused on the processes and products of efforts organized by the US CF Foundation and generally published in The Journal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>In addition, the important contributions of the European CF Society (ECFS) were examined, especially the activities of their Diagnostic Network Working Group (DNWG) and the Neonatal Screening Working Group (NSWG).</s><s>Thus, proceeding under the assumption that knowledge of history is a precondition for better outcomes, we reviewed and critiqued 3 previous CF Foundation diagnostic consensus conferences and current European practices and identified the lessons learned.</s></p><p><s>Initial Efforts of the CF Foundation to Establish Diagnostic Criteria for US CF Centers (1963-1976)   In 1963, a committee of 6 US experts was commissioned by the US CF Foundation to write a "Guide to Diagnosis and Management of Cystic Fibrosis" for use by a growing network of CF centers in the US. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>The timing of this 1963 publication was related to the widespread introduction of routine sweat testing using the method of Gibson and Cooke <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> that was published in 1959.</s><s>During the ensuing years, a number of issues developed about the safety and reliability of the sweat test.</s><s>In addition, novel, intriguing research appeared in the literature on "CF factors" <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and their applicability to diagnosis, as well as potential opportunities for screening.</s><s>This led to a large multiworkshop conference <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> organized in 1974 by the National Institutes of Health and the US CF Foundation with an American committee of 16 broad "experts" and 69 others participating as "consultants."</s><s>Thus, the impetus for the consensus conference in 1974 was a growing body of knowledge about CF combined with difficulties encountered in applying the sweat test.</s><s>Even as the workshops proceeded, preliminary data were appearing in the literature on an entirely new laboratory method of facilitating the early diagnosis of CF through NBS using meconium albumin analyses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lessons Learned</head><p><s>The landmark 1974 conference led to a number of recommendations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">I</ref>) that still apply today, although some IRT was reported as a valid NBS test applicable to dried blood specimens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>) 12 "Neonates produce insufficient sweat to permit screening" by the sweat test before. .</s><s>.about 4-6 wk." (This conclusion was subsequently disproven. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>) 13 "Research to develop a reliable and safe neonatal screening test and. .</s><s>.antenatal test for CF is essential."</s><s>14 "A screening test for the CF heterozygote is needed so that carriers can benefit from family-planning counseling."</s></p><p><s>have been superseded by new knowledge, especially in our understanding of CFTR genetics.</s><s>Clearly, the major conclusions and recommendations at that time centered on sweat test confirmation of the diagnosis after symptoms had appeared.</s><s>However, limitations of sweat testing were acknowledged; as the well-known CF physician-researcher Dr Paul di Sant'Agnese stated, "the sweat test is only as good as the physician ordering it." <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>In addition, based on a study of outcomes following diagnostic delays, 32 some authorities such as Dr Harry Shwachman early on felt NBS was essential to achieving a diagnosis in time to improve outcomes.</s><s>Other lessons learned from this conference included the conclusion that it was not appropriate to apply "CF factor" analyses or any other incompletely developed tests to make a CF diagnosis.</s><s>Indeed, premature applications of potential diagnostic tests before validation and standardization should never be recommended.</s></p><p><s>Discovery of the CFTR Gene Leads to New Recommendations (1989-2000)   With the crucially important identification of the CFTR gene in 1989, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> genetic analysis began to play an increasingly significant role in diagnosis.</s><s>There was recognition of an expanded CFTR-associated phenotype (represented at that time mostly by congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens), and development of new diagnostic techniques, such as nasal potential difference (NPD) measurement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>Attempts to categorize patients led to a number of imprecise or inadequately defined terms (such as classic/nonclassic CF, typical/atypical CF, mild CF, and delayed CF).</s><s>Although genetic knowledge about CF and its epidemiology increased dramatically during the decade after the CFTR discovery, there was uncertainty in CF centers about: (1) how to apply genetic testing for diagnosis; (2) the disease-causing role of some mutations in the rapidly growing list of mutations being identified; and (3) whether or not prognosis could be predicted from genetic profiles.</s><s>Faced with these new challenges, the US CF Foundation convened another consensus conference in 1996 that focused on assessing practical aspects of applying knowledge about CFTR genetics and that produced a helpful set of revised conclusions, recommendations, and criteria.</s><s>This effort involved 10 experts, all from North America, who based their recommendations on updated genetic and NPD data.</s><s>Published in The Journal in 1998, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> the recommendations from this important consensus conference attempted to bring order to the diagnostic landscape.</s><s>The consensus at that time was that the diagnosis of CF should be based on the presence of 1 or more characteristic clinical features (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>), a history of CF in a sibling, or a positive NBS test result, plus laboratory evidence of an abnormality in the CFTR gene or protein.</s></p><p><s>The overall conclusion was that acceptable evidence of a CFTR abnormality included biological evidence of chloride channel dysfunction (such as abnormal sweat chloride concentration, defined as sweat chloride &gt;60 mmol/L; or abnormal NPD) or identification of a CF disease-causing mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> in each copy of the CFTR gene.</s><s>It was emphasized that "The diagnosis of CF should be made only if there is an elevated sweat chloride concentration (&gt;60 mmol/L) on 2 separate occasions in a patient with 1 or more clinical features consistent with the CF phenotype or a history of CF in a sibling."</s><s>However, it was also stated that:</s></p><p><s>The diagnostic criteria proposed here are not likely to cover every possible clinical scenario, and there will be clinical dilemmas. .</s><s>.Clinical judgment will continue to be essential in patients who have typical or "atypical" clinical features but who lack conclusive evidence of CFTR dysfunction.</s><s>Such patients will require close clinical follow-up along with laboratory reevaluation as appropriate.</s></p><p><s>Although NPD testing was not considered ready for routine use, it was concluded that "For patients in whom sweat chloride concentrations are normal or borderline and in whom 2 CF mutations are not identified, an abnormal NPD measurement recorded on 2 separate days can be used as evidence of CFTR dysfunction."</s><s>Brief comments were also included on NBS, which by 1991 had become valid and feasible based on the immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) test combined with DNA analysis in some regions for CFTR mutations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref></s><s>lso at this time, the American College of Medical Genetics, in conjunction with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institutes of Health, developed a panel of mutations for use in population screening for CF carriers, based on allele frequencies of CF mutations in the US CF population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s>Even though the American College of Medical Genetics guidelines were prepared for population CF carrier screening, and not for the identification of mutations in patients, genetic screening for carriers recognized the growing importance of CFTR genetic analysis in the CF diagnostic process.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lessons Learned</head><p><s>This conference and the ensuing publication were timely, valuable contributions to medical practice in CF centers.</s><s>However, it soon became recognized that many CFTR mutations thought to be CF-causing, were not associated with disease.</s><s>Thus, the recommendations from this conference and the American College of Medical Genetics/American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> would need to be modified.</s><s>Another problem, which was recognized more slowly, was that the lack of participation by European experts in the consensus process contributed to a division on some issues such as terminology.</s><s>For instance, use of the term atypical has been, and remains, integral in European CF practice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Advent of NBS Changes the Diagnostic Strategy and Criteria (2001-2015)</head><p><s>In 1998, CF NBS was available in only 6 US states <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> and certain regional programs worldwide (such as Austria, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Australia), and a CF diagnosis was suggested by a positive NBS test result in fewer than 6% of new cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s>owever, this was soon to change.</s><s>Data were published from a randomized clinical trial in Wisconsin showing the benefits of early diagnosis through NBS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and the CDC had become interested in the evidence and special opportunity to capitalize on the network of 114 CF centers for confirmatory diagnostic testing and follow-up care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref></s><s>At that time, approximately 500 CFTR mutations had been identified, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> with only 24 mutations classified as "CF-causing." <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>By 2007, CF NBS was available in 34 states in the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and a growing number of European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> and mandatory screening in every state was imminent because of CDC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and CF Foundation 7 recommendations.</s><s>More than 1500 CFTR mutations had been identified, and there was greater awareness of the spectrum of mutations in specific population groups as well as an increased understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships.</s><s>The dramatic, and in fact unprecedented, implementation of a NBS test that yielded genetic data led to more questions and challenges related to diagnostic criteria.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, the US CF Foundation convened another CF diagnosis consensus conference in 2007 and invited 18 participants, including 4 of the 10 from the 1996-1998 conference.</s><s>Although predominately from the US, there were 2 Canadians, an Australian, and a European CF geneticist with NBS expertise.</s><s>This group generated the US diagnostic guidelines in use before this publication (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>) and recommended the process summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Significant differences from the 1998 recommendations included a decrease in the level of sweat chloride recognized as suggestive of CF in infants (from 40 mmol/L in 1998 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> to 30 mmol/L in 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> ) and the requirement in 1998 for a sweat chloride test result &gt;60 mmol/L on at least 2 occasions plus symptoms of the disease, or history in a sibling.</s><s>In 2008, a second sweat test was not required for diagnosis if 2 CF-causing mutations were identified, demonstrating the importance that genetic analysis was having on diagnostic algorithms.</s></p><p><s>During the process of developing the 2008 guidelines, it was recognized that NBS introduced a new complexity and diagnostic dilemma, namely infants with abnormal screening tests because of elevated IRT levels but inconclusive sweat test and/ or DNA results.</s><s>Rather than address this complex situation in the diagnostic guidelines, it was decided that this issue of a "gray zone," affecting perhaps approximately 10% of infants with high IRT levels and a single CFTR mutation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref>  conference.</s><s>An expert panel convened and, using a Delphi method, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> recommended a new diagnostic term (CRMS for CFTR-related metabolic syndrome) and management guidelines, published subsequently in The Journal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>CRMS is the diagnosis used in the US to describe infants with elevated levels of IRT, but with sweat chloride levels below CF diagnostic levels, and fewer than 2 CF-causing mutations.</s><s>Although this condition is not a metabolic disorder, the designation "metabolic syndrome" was established in part to have an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), Ninth Revisions (ICD-9) medical code (277.9) for US healthcare delivery system follow-up and billing purposes.</s><s>In fact, this consensus-producing effort led to the general recognition that ICD coding was not included as part of the diagnosis considerations in previous CF Foundation-sponsored consensus conferences.</s><s>Despite the efforts to explain and apply CRMS as a diagnosis, this term has not been well accepted in Europe and some other countries because of concern about its appropriateness and a feeling that it was difficult for families to understand this "syndrome label" as a descriptive term for a temporary diagnosis in an asymptomatic child requiring a further diagnostic step (which is yet to be decided).</s><s>Thus, a different term, CFSPID, for CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> was developed in a Delphi process by the ECFS NSWG and introduced recently in Europe as an alternative to CRMS.</s></p><p><s>During the planning phase of the 2015 CF Diagnosis Consensus Conference, it was concluded that both CRMS and CFSPID must be considered diagnoses that should be accompanied by a clinical management plan.</s><s>Indeed, the original consensus articles describing CRMS and CFSPID included action plans for follow-up care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>In addition, the CF Foundation organized a separate consensus conference that was focused on developing comprehensive care guidelines for infants diagnosed through NBS, extending to 2 years of age. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lessons Learned</head><p><s>The guidelines published in 2008 had significant impact as NBS programs proliferated in the US (extending nationwide by 2010) and also in other countries.</s><s>However, the complexity of the recommendations and the failure to incorporate the CRMS consensus statements into the general diagnostic guidelines resulted in 2 unlinked sets of recommendations and caused confusion.</s><s>An additional diagnostic term, CFTRrelated disorder, introduced by US authors in 2008, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> contributed to the confusion, as it was used in a variety of ways by different authors before being precisely defined as a monosymptomatic entity by mainly European authors in 2011 after 2 consensus conferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref></s><s>Once again, the very limited representation of Europeans during the development of the 2008 CF Foundation guidelines led to less than anticipated.</s><s>Another lesson learned was that the genetic data used for diagnostic purposes must be defined more precisely, as the explosion of information coming from the NBS programs demonstrated the wide array of phenotypic impacts of different CFTR mutations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref></s><s>Finally, as these guidelines were disseminated and explained, it became clear that some confusion was attributable to the complexity and ambiguity of cases arising from NBS programs; in retrospect, it would have been wise to include case studies as examples of diagnostic challenges.</s></p></div>

Examples of this would be certain monosymptomatic individuals with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, diffuse bronchiectasis, or recurrent pancreatitis.</s><s>Diagnostic algorithms for these groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>. NPD and ICM values are not clear-cut in these individuals.</s><s>The ECFS recommends that individuals who cannot be diagnosed with CF but are thought to be at risk of monosymptomatic disease because of CFTR dysfunction (suggested by symptoms or laboratory findings) should be categorized as having a "CFTRrelated disorder."</s></p><p><s>The ECFS also has been responsible for 2 visionary "Garda conferences" that have contributed significantly to the application of CFTR genetic data in diagnostic processes and to the use of "best practices" in NBS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref></s><s>In 2007, following the growing number of CFTR sequence variations detected by molecular assays and difficulties in understanding their actual significance, ECFS convened a consensus conference aimed at suggesting how to use and interpret mutation analysis in clinical practice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref></s><s>An international group of CF clinicians and geneticists gave an account of the distribution of mutations and methods of analysis, addressed the role of genetic testing for establishing the diagnosis of CF and for outcome prediction, and provided recommendations on the bidirectional information flow between clinicians and molecular analysis laboratories.</s><s>The resulting 2008 state-of-the-art publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> is now partially outdated in the sections on mutation distribution, which is better understood today, and on genetic analysis, which is going through a radical change thanks to nextgeneration sequencing technologies.</s><s>Conversely, discussions February 2017 SUPPLEMENT S21 contained in other chapters retain their validity.</s><s>The prominence of sweat chloride testing as a diagnostic tool, the limited role of mutation classes in predicting phenotype, and the shortcomings in reliably predicting the severity of pulmonary disease based only on CFTR genotype had been suggested before but reached a wider audience through the consensus publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref></s><s>s an outcome of the 2007 Garda Conference, CFTR mutations were clustered into 4 groups according to their predicted diagnostic significance: (1) mutations that cause CF disease;</s></p><p><s>(2) mutations that result in a CFTR-related disorder (with a partial overlap of groups and 2); (3) mutations with no known clinical consequence; and (4) mutations of unproven or uncertain clinical relevance.</s><s>In addition, suggestions were given on criteria to use to assess the probability that a given sequence variation might be CF-causing.</s><s>These definitions were later adopted and adapted by the CFTR2 project. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref></s><s> One year later, a second ECFS Consensus Conference, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> this time prompted by the proliferation of CF NBS programs and the heterogeneity of protocols and performances, outlined benefits, by-products and costs of NBS, examined advantages and disadvantages of different protocols, and suggested strategies to inform families.</s><s>Problems and uncertainties connected with the identification of inconclusive cases elicited by NBS were also discussed and later further elaborated on by the ECFS NSWG.</s><s>This in turn led to the use of the term CFSPID for asymptomatic infants with an inconclusive diagnosis after positive NBS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> There is ongoing ECFS activity on how, and for how long, to follow up infants with CFSPID.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lessons Learned</head><p><s>Investment by the ECFS to organize a combination of consensus conferences and working groups on NBS and diagnosis has paid dividends worldwide.</s><s>However, despite very impressive data on the potential value of new, very sensitive methods such as NPD and ICM, their dissemination has been limited.</s><s>It is especially surprising that the US has lagged behind in the emerging field of evaluating CFTR functioning in situ with NPD and ICM methods for improving our diagnostic capability in certain cases such as infants with intermediate sweat chloride levels and inconclusive genetic data.</s><s>Another lesson learned is that the Delphi consensus process, although considered fairly robust, is quite time consuming.</s><s>Finally, it appears that ECFS-generated products that we regard as "European" may not apply to some aspects of diagnosis and terminology (ie, atypical is not used throughout Europe even though it is favored in many countries).</s></p></div>
