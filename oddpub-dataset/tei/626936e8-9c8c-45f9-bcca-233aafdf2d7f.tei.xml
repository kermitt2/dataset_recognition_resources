<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of UNICORN</head><p><s>The steps involved in building our version of UNICORN (henceforth simply UNICORN) and performing an association study are now outlined (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Existing publicly available collections of control data determine a common genetic ancestry space onto which case and control subjects can be projected independently.</s><s>GemTools <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> constructs ancestry spaces and performs such projections.</s><s>The projected controls are then used to estimate the control minor allele frequency distribution (MAFD) over the ancestry space.</s><s>For efficiency of computations, the MAFD would be precomputed and stored for application whenever users request control information.</s><s>To query the repository, researchers project their case subjects onto the public control ancestry space and submit the locations to UNICORN.</s><s>Based on the pre-computed surface, the system will infer allele frequencies as well as the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimates at all relevant locations and return the results to the users, who can then proceed with an association test, such as the one we describe in the next section.</s></p><p><s>To estimate the MAFD, UNICORN employs a combination of empirical Bayesian analysis across a hierarchical clustering of the control subjects and, for localized ancestry regions, a Gaussian process model of the minor allele frequency (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>To visualize the algorithm in action, we utilize the Europeans in the Population Reference Sample (POPRES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (dbGaP: phs000145.v4.p2), which yields an ancestry map that approximates the geographic map of Europe. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Two SNPs in LCT (lactase persistence) and OCA2 (hair, skin, and eye color) provide examples of UNICORN's MAFD for SNPs under selection and provide an illustration of clines in allele frequency across Europe.</s><s>Intensity of color displays allele frequency estimates that vary smoothly across the map (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Conceptually, UNICORN aims to use as many control samples as justifiable, based on ancestry, to estimate the MAFD associated with each case sample.</s><s>To motivate this model, consider two different matched case-control studies: one with equal numbers of case and control subjects and the other with ten control subjects for each case subject.</s><s>In the first instance, the statistical power is driven equally by case and control subjects; for the latter, the number of case subjects is the key determinant for power.</s><s>For UNICORN, the matching of control to case subjects is determined by how many control subjects are located near each case subject in ancestry space.</s><s>Regardless of the number of case and control subjects, if there were very few control subjects similar in ancestry to case subjects, any test will have a large variance and little power.</s><s>Alternatively, if there are many control subjects that are close in ancestry space to each case subject, then the variance of the test will be dominated by the case sample size.</s><s>UNICORN seeks to achieve power by using information on allele frequencies from a very large sample of control subjects.</s></p></div>

indeed, this is the basis of DNA forensics.</s><s>Protected repositories such as dbGaP exist so that genome-wide data can be shared among responsible parties without exposing subjects to a loss of privacy.</s><s>But a second level of privacy loss is also of concern.</s><s>1]<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> By restricting the exchange of genetic data to ancestry coordinates, UNICORN could overcome both of these challenges.</s><s>Additionally, our grid-based approach, where we return frequency estimates from the pre-computed grid point closest to the case subject instead of the actual case location, provides another layer of security for the control identities by adding a small degree of randomness to our predictions.</s></p><p><s>Results from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) motivate this work.</s><s>ExAC has made substantial progress toward the goal of assembling exome sequencing data from a variety of large-scale sequencing projects to make summary data widely available, with more than 60,000 individuals' worth of data available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref></s><s>Currently, ExAC provides allele frequency information for these samples.</s><s>Through UNICORN, we aim to enhance this concept by generating ancestry-matched MAFD estimates for additional subjects.</s><s>Although there are more technical challenges involved with sequence data than genotyping arrays, the ExAC project provides support to the belief that these data can be successfully aggregated and harmonized for use in UNICORN.</s><s>We are thus currently in the process of extending the UNICORN framework, which will require further development and refinement for rare variation.</s></p><p><s>The UNICORN database and web server are in preparation and a limited version focusing on populations of European descent is slated for release late in 2016.</s><s>If successful, UNICORN will dramatically improve access to the control resources stored in repositories such as dbGaP and can also make use of control samples from the same study as well as from other studies.</s><s>We predict that UNICORN will hasten the discovery of genetic variation conferring risk for disease in three ways: by providing ancestrally matched allele frequencies, by its careful integration of datasets, and by making genetic association analysis simpler.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Overview of the UNICORN ModelThe UNICORN pipeline starts with a public base set of control subjects and constructs the corresponding base control ancestry space.</s><s>All subsequent case and control subjects can be projected independently via GemTools onto this space.</s><s>This approach ensures that, having only knowledge of the base set, new individuals can be compared to existing ancestries.</s><s>An extended set of control subjects is then projected onto the base control ancestry space, which is used to estimate the minor allele frequency distribution (MAFD) over the ancestry space.</s><s>To query the repository, researchers project their case subjects onto the base control ancestry space and submit the resulting coordinates to the UNICORN server.</s><s>Users then receive control allele frequencies as well as the degree of uncertainty associated with these estimates for all relevant locations, based on the pre-computed MAFD.</s><s>Users can then proceed with an association test.</s><s>Users need to submit only ancestry coordinates and the system returns only frequency inferences for the corresponding locations (red arrows).</s><s>No other information is exchanged.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,74.27,36.79,295.99,114.43" type="bitmap" /></figure>
