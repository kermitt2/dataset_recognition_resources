<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) remains a major public health concern in China, where over two million children are affected annually <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Guangdong is one of the most affected provinces in China where the incidence of HFMD exceeds 30 cases per 10,000 annually, and in recent years accounted for approximately 15% of total cases in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Even though vaccines have entered the market substantially reducing Enterovirus 71 (EV71), which is one of the major causative pathogens of HFMD, in certain areas of China the epidemic remains.</s><s>Pathogens other than EV71 have been confirmed to be causative for HFMD, such as Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and CVA6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>HFMD caused by these pathogens have become increasingly dominant.</s><s>While pathogen characteristics such as the activity and type of pathogens at the point of infection are more likely directly related to HFMD onsets, environmental factors are potentially associated with HFMD infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Among various environmental factors, weather variables are investigated more for their effect on HFMD hazards.</s><s>A nationwide study in China suggested that the seasonal patterns of HFMD were associated with precipitations, sunshine, temperature, and air pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>However, previous climatic variables do not explain the complexity of HFMD seasonality across China <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Zhao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> and Gou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> reported that high temperature could increase the risk of HFMD in Huainan and Gansu, China.</s><s>In our previous study, we observed a higher risk of HFMD when temperatures were greater than 24.85 °C and relative humidity within 80.59-82.55% <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref></s><s>.</s></p><p><s>Nonetheless, the relationship between disease and environmental factors are complex and other environmental factors besides climate factors may contribute to the HFMD epidemics.</s><s>Modifiable environmental factors were reported to be a reason for approximately 23% of global disease burden, where over one-third are among children <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> .</s><s>Climatic factors primarily contribute to temporal variation for a relatively small geographic area, while other environmental factors would explain more the spatial variation.</s><s>However, a question arises whether environmental factors besides climate factors have been investigated on human health, especially infectious diseases?</s></p><p><s>Multiple factors including ecological, environmental, agricultural, industrial, and many others could precipitate disease emergence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</s><s>A spatial analysis by Wayant et al. showed that malaria rates were associated with the changing land cover, particularly due to deforestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> .</s><s>However, reforestation which could be reflected by vegetation index and land cover was found to be a probable reason for the emergence of Lyme disease in the United States and Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s><s>Occasionally, an infection is brought to a new place through travel and commerce <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, rural urbanization would allow infections arising in isolated rural areas to reach larger populations.</s><s>For this reason, a question emerges on whether these factors are attributed to HFMD transmission.</s></p><p><s>Currently, limited studies have examined other environmental factors.</s><s>A recent publication concluded that the normalized difference in vegetation index (NDVI) has an important role as a predictor to HFMD incidence in Shandong, China <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> .</s><s>However, they reported the contribution to psudo R 2 of NDVI rather than an unambiguous statistics such as the relative risk (RR) or the solpe (β).</s><s>Therefore, we can not conclude a total positive or negative effect of NDVI on HFMD.</s><s>A study by Cao and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> checked the relationship between HFMD epidemics in Shenzhen and road density, aerosol optical depth, and NDVI.</s><s>However, none of the above factors remained in the final linear regression.</s><s>The simple linear model most likely did not have enough statistical power to observe an association.</s></p><p><s>To provide a more comprehensive understanding of HFMD associated environmental factors, we applied a Bayesian spatiotemporal model to identify and develop a prediction model based on available vital factors including temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), NDVI, land cover (proportion of artificial surface, AS), and road capacity (RC).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Descriptive analysis.</s><s>The median monthly HFMD incidence and environmental factors (T, RH, NDVI, RC) by county were 1.51 (per 10,000 persons), 233.68 (0.1 °C), 79.19 (%), 6053.13,</s><s>3.77 (%), and 57.01, respectively.</s><s>The highest incidence during the study period was 22.84 per 10,000 persons.</s><s>Generally, monthly incidence for counties showed similar trend with a major peak in May and a smaller peak in September (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crude correlation.</head><p><s>The absolute value of correlation coefficients from the spearman test between HFMD incidence and environmental factors ranged from 0.056 to 0.36 (all P &lt; 0.05).</s><s>Of the 8 types of land cover, artificial surfaces received the maximum correlation coefficient (Results for other types of land cover are not shown).</s><s>The maps for the median value of HFMD incidence and environmental factors in May also suggested an association between them (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>The varied seasonal variations were observed from the temporal distributions for the median value of HFMD incidence and environmental factors (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study of more than 0.33 million cases of HFMD reported to the national surveillance system during 2012 in Guangdong, China provides a comprehensive association for environmental factors on HFMD epidemics.</s><s>The highest monthly incidence during the study period was 22.84 per 10,000 persons.</s><s>We observed the crude correlation coefficients, spatial distribution (maps), and temporal distribution (time-series plots) between environmental factors and HFMD incidence.</s><s>All environmental factors indicated a potential association for disease transmission with statistically significant coefficients.</s><s>The seasonal autocorrelation and spatial autocorrelation were shown and validated in the time series plots and the Moran's I statistic.</s><s>A Bayesian spatiotemporal model was used to fit these two autocorrelations.</s><s>We estimated the contribution (i.e., the explained variation of DIC) of each environmental factor.</s><s>All environmental factors in the final Bayesian spatiotemporal models gained statistical association, indicating a relatively comprehensive association for HFMD with environmental factors was established.</s></p><p><s>The association between environmental factors used in the present study with infectious diseases were widely studied.</s><s>For HFMD, the relative humidity and temperature were considered in prior studies and in the present <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> .</s><s>Most of these studies quantitative evidence that the number of HFMD cases increased significantly with rising average temperature and relative humidity.</s><s>Satellite data (e.g., land-use, NDVI, and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)) has also been used to explain the transmission of other infectious diseases, such as malaria in Thailand, Afghanistan, and Korea; dengue in Indonesia; avian influenza in Indonesia; and seasonal influenza in New York, Arizona, and Hong Kong <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> .</s><s>This suggest that land-use and NDVI affect the risk of disease via vector breeding habitat.</s><s>By contrast, negative association (RR &lt; 1) between NDVI and HFMD risk was observed in our study.</s><s>Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> and Cao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> concluded a negative correlation as well between NDVI and HFMD risk.</s><s>Environmental factors that potentially affect disease include virus survivorship, transmission efficiency, host susceptibility.</s><s>In the present study, higher levels of relative humidity and temperature were positively associated with HFMD epidemics, potentially enhancing virus activity of the disease.</s><s>The higher level of road capacity might improve transmission efficiency by increasing the interaction among susceptible individuals.</s><s>Rather than the spatiotemporal model, similar crude relationship was observed using the Spearman's correlation coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> .</s><s>We also observed that HFMD epidemics were positively linked to the proportion of artificial surface.</s><s>Curran et al. also suggested links between land cover and the disease carried by vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</s><s>Higher levels of artificial surface indicates that elevated degree of urbanization resulted in weakness to health services among immigrant workers.</s><s>A potential mediated factor for environmental factors is environmental pollution.</s><s>Environmental pollution, particularly air pollution was impacted by road capacity (positive), artificial surface (positive), and vegetation index (negative) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, these pollutions improve transmission efficiency of the virus and increases host susceptibility to disease.</s></p><p><s>The spatial and temporal autocorrelation of HFMD epidemics shown in our results were also validated previously.</s><s>Ma et al. revealed the spatiotemporal pattern of HFMD by reviewing 73 relevant studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>In our prior study on the national level in China also observed the spatial and temporal autocorrelation patterns of HFMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> .</s><s>Overall, the methods and results for detecting spatial and temporal autocorrelation used in this study were consistent with previous studies.</s></p><p><s>The present study stood out from prior studies by its strengths.</s><s>First, we included more aspects of environmental factors than previous studies that considered only climate factors.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish this type of comprehensive model for HFMD.</s><s>Second, because environmental factors were collected from government sectors (e.g., NASA) and recognized programs (e.g., OpenStreetMap), we can be assured of data reliability.</s><s>Moreover, the Bayesian spatiotemporal model has been widely used with an acceptable goodness of fit with a low sMAPE in the fitting and testing datasets (13.853% and 19.774%), and a considerable convergence diagnostic for MCMC algorithms.</s></p><p><s>We must also note a few limitations.</s><s>First, although we observed a comprehensive association between HFMD and environmental factors, the detailed mechanism is not well understood.</s><s>Second, some environmental factors were collected at periods different from the disease, potentially resulting in statistical analyses uncertainty.</s><s>However, environmental factors would change in a slow where the relative level of environmental factors among counties might be consistent over years.</s><s>For this reason, the current available information on environmental factors is most likely a reasonable representation.</s><s>In addition, there might be a complicated association (e.g., non-linear or interactive) between HFMD risk and environmental factors.</s><s>We applied the 'Log' link function to handle part of the non-linear relationship, and the Bayesian spatiotemporal model used in our study is currently an available model to cope with both spatial and temporal effects.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study area.</head><p><s>Guangdong Province, situated north latitude 20°21′ N to 25°51′ N and east longitude 109°65′ E to E, has a population of 104 million as reported in the 2010 census.</s><s>According to the Annual Statistical Report of Guangdong Province (http://www.gdstats.gov.cn/tjsj/gdtjnj/),</s><s>123 counties can largely be divided into four parts, (i.e., Pearl River Delta Region [around the center of the province], Eastern Region, Western Region and Mountainous Region).</s><s>These four regions are in different stages of social and economic transition.</s><s>The Pearl River Delta Region is the most industrialized area of Guangdong, where region has a higher HFMD burden compared to the other three areas.</s><s>For example, the accumulative incidence from 2009 to 2012 in Pearl River Delta Region was 39 per 10,000, much greater than the other regions in Guangdong during the same period (Eastern Region: 7/10,000; Western Region: 12/10,000; Mountainous Region: 14/10,000).</s></p></div>

manual backward selection process was used to determine the final multivariable model to fit the HFMD epidemic.</s><s>In this procedure, environmental factors with 95% credible interval (CI) covering the null hypothesis would be excluded.</s><s>Additionally, we calculated the deviance information criterion (DIC) and the proportion of variation explained (Contribution) for the estimation of model and factors.</s><s>The differences in information criterion versus the null model are very important and useful to the model selection and multi-model inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Trace plots were used to assess the convergence of markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) simulation in the Bayesian model fitting (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, we validated the final model by comparing the predicted and observed value.</s><s>The symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) was used to assess the fitting performance.</s></p><p><s>As we used aggregated data, interaction analysis was not applicable.</s><s>All data analysis was conducted in R version 3.4.3</s><s>(R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), using the 'base' , 'GISTools' , 'gstat' , 'maptools' , 'RColorBrewer' , 'psych' , 'spdep' , and 'CARBayesST' packages.</s></p><p><s>Bayesian spatiotemporal model.</s><s>As reported by the previous studies 4 , a spatiotemporal model would be suitable to the HFMD epidemics with spatial autocorrelation and seasonality.</s><s>We applied a Bayesian spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed model with a spatiotemporal autoregressive process that has an adaptive autocorrelation structure.</s><s>This model was proposed by Rushworth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , and is an extension of the Bayesian spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed model with a spatiotemporal autoregressive process to allow for local spatial heterogeneity (adaptive smoothing) rather than global smoothing.</s><s>Bayesian spatiotemporal model can be represented in a hierarchical structure as specified in the equation below.</s><s>Lt Y and O denote the observed and expected number of HFMD cases, k and t denote the units of county and month.</s><s>For each k = 1, …, 123 and t = 1, …, 12.</s><s>The regression parameters of the vector of covariate X are denoted by β.</s><s>The relative risk (RR) of X can be calculated as e β .</s><s>The ψ kt term is a latent component for county unit k and time period t encompassing one or more sets of spatiotemporally auto correlated random effects.</s><s>Practically, the temporal variation can be extracted from ψ kt by computing the temporal marginal effect.</s><s>The autoregressive random effects structure of the model is specified by " ψ kt = Φ kt , Φ t |Φ t−1 ~ N(ρ T * Φ t−1 , τ 2 * Q(W, ρ S ) −1 ) for t = 2,…,12, Φ 1 ~ N(0, τ 2 * Q(W, ρ S ) −1 ), τ 2 ~ Inverse-Gamma(a, b), ρ S , ρ T ~ Uniform(0,1)".</s><s>Φ t is the vector of random effects for time period t, which evolve over time through a multivariate first order autoregressive process with temporal autoregressive parameter ρ T .</s><s>The temporal autocorrelation is thus induced by the mean ρ T * Φ t-1 , while spatial autocorrelation is induced by the variance τ 2 * Q(W, ρ S ) −1 .</s><s>The corresponding precision matrix Q(W, ρ S ) was proposed by Leroux et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>W is the symmetric nonnegative 123 × 123 neighborhood matrix, controlling the spatial autocorrelation.</s><s>Different from the simple conditional autoregressive (CAR) model, this model allows for localized spatial autocorrelation by allowing spatially neighboring random effects (τ w 2 ~ Inverse-Gamma(a, b)) to be correlated (inducing smoothness) or conditionally independent (no smoothing).</s><s>The default values for the inverse-gamma prior for τ 2 and τ w 2 are a = 1, b = 0.01.</s><s>The package 'CARBayesST' allows for estimating the unknown parameters including τ 2 , ρ S , ρ T , and τ w 2 using MCMC method with Gibbs sampling.</s><s>A single Markov chain was run for 110,000 iterations with a 10,000 burn-in period and subsequently thinned by 10 to reduce the autocorrelation in this study.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2
