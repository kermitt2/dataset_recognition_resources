<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>TCF3-HLF−positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is currently incurable.</s><s>Using an integrated approach, we uncovered distinct mutation, gene expression and drug response profiles in TCF3-HLF−positive and treatment-responsive TCF3-PBX1−positive ALL.</s><s>We identified recurrent intragenic deletions of PAX5 or VPREB1 in constellation with the fusion of TCF3 and HLF.</s><s>Moreover somatic mutations in the non-translocated allele of TCF3 and a reduction of PAX5 gene dosage in TCF3-HLF ALL suggest cooperation within a restricted genetic context.</s><s>The enrichment for stem cell and myeloid features in the TCF3-HLF signature may reflect reprogramming by TCF3-HLF of a lymphoid-committed cell of origin toward a hybrid, drug-resistant hematopoietic state.</s><s>Drug response profiling of matched patient-derived xenografts revealed a distinct profile for TCF3-HLF ALL with resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics but sensitivity to glucocorticoids, anthracyclines and agents in clinical development.</s><s>Striking on-target sensitivity was achieved with the BCL2-specific inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199).</s><s>This integrated approach thus provides alternative treatment options for this deadly disease.</s></p><p><s>Genomics and drug profiling of fatal TCF3-HLF−positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia identifies recurrent mutation patterns and therapeutic options One of the hallmarks of pediatric ALL is the presence of subtypedefining chromosomal translocations that cause gene fusions involving master regulators of hematopoietic development.</s><s>These initiating lesions often cooperate with specific somatic aberrations, including monoallelic deletions of B cell developmental genes, such as PAX5, IKZF1 and EBF1 (ref.</s><s>1).</s><s>Other cooperative liaisons are represented by trisomy 21q22 with CRLF2 activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or near-haploid ALL with activation of receptor tyrosine kinase or RAS signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>RAS pathway mutations appear in high-risk ALL but are often lost with disease progression, which suggests involvement of additional tumorigenic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>The patterns of recurrent genomic alterations need to be better understood, because apart from tyrosine kinase inhibitor−supplemented treatment of BCR-ABL1−positive ALL, the only proven successful first-line treatment strategies for high-risk ALL are chemotherapy intensification and early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The translocation t(1;19) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> that results in a fusion of the transcriptional activation domain of the B cell developmental transcription factor TCF3 to the DNA-binding domain of PBX1 occurs in about 5-10% of precursor B cell (pre-B cell) ALL patients and is associated with a median five-year event-free survival probability of 78-85% <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, the translocation t(17;19)(q22;p13), resulting in the fusion gene TCF3-HLF, defines a rare subtype of ALL (&lt;1% of pediatric ALL) that is typically associated with relapse and death within two years from diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Both translocations disrupt one allele of TCF3, which drives the B cell differentiation program upstream of the transcription factor PAX5 (ref.</s><s>13).</s><s>As an initiating event, expression of TCF3-HLF leads to transcriptional reprogramming in pre-leukemic cells.</s><s>Possible direct targets of TCF3-HLF include the transcription factor gene LMO2, which is implicated in initiation of T cell ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and the transcriptional repressor SNAI1 (SLUG), which regulates embryonic development and apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Further targets have been proposed, including BCL2 (ref.</s><s>14).</s><s>The TCF3-HLF fusion likely requires additional events to cause leukemia, because TCF3-HLF transgenic and knock-in mice did not recapitulate the human phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here we report that the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of TCF3-HLF−positive ALL differs markedly from TCF3-PBX1− positive ALL.</s><s>The TCF3-HLF fusion likely occurs in B lymphoid progenitors in the context of PAX5 haploinsufficiency and is associated with transcriptional reprogramming toward an immature, hybrid hematopoietic state.</s><s>Drug response profiling in patient-derived xenografts, which maintained the genomic and global transcriptome landscapes of the corresponding primary leukemic samples, identified resistance patterns to drugs commonly used for the treatment of TCF3-HLF−positive patients.</s><s>A general trait of TCF3-HLF−positive ALL in our study is extreme sensitivity toward the BCL2-specific inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax), indicating new therapeutic options for this fatal ALL subtype.</s><s>1b-9b and 11b; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>For validation, we used additional DNA samples from seven TCF3-HLF-positive cases (diagnostic samples 10a, 12a, 13a, 14a, 15a, 16a, 17a, remission samples 10b, 12b, 13b) and 24 TCF3-PBX1-positive cases (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">2 and 3</ref>).</s><s>In most cases TCF3-HLF-positive ALL responded to induction chemotherapy but remained MRDpositive.</s><s>Nine children included in this study died owing to disease progression and treatment-related toxicities within 2 years on average, and only one patient is in remission after a short follow-up time, reflecting the dismal prognosis of TCF3-HLF-positive ALL.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TCF3-HLF ALL and impaired pro-to pre-B cell transition</head><p><s>Pre-B cell ALL is frequently associated with somatic copy number alterations affecting B cell developmental genes.</s><s>PAX5 deletions are generally observed in 13% of ALL cases and in up to 28% of high-risk ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>We observed enrichment for monoallelic PAX5 deletions in TCF3-HLF-positive ALL, identifying such events in 67% of the cases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Illegitimate RAG-mediated recombination appears to be implicated in the generation of such events in TCF3-HLF-positive ALL, given the close proximity to RSS motifs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s><s>In most samples without PAX5 deletion, we identified hemi-and homozygous deletions of VPREB1, which encodes a component of the surrogate light chain of the pre-B cell receptor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>), independent of the lambda light chain locus.</s><s>VPREB1 deletions in pediatric ALL result in failure to form a viable surrogate light chain in the pre-B cell receptor, an event associated with lower overall survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>In addition, we detected BTG1 gene deletions in three of eight TCF3-HLF-positive cases without PAX5 deletions (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a,b</ref>).</s><s>BTG1 deletions occur frequently in ALL positive for ETV6-RUNX1 (19%) or BCR-ABL1 (26%) and may confer a proliferative advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, we detected no deletion, but only a single PAX5 nonsense mutation in 29 TCF3-PBX1-positive cases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Our results indicate that cooperative genetic events affecting genes regulating the pro-to pre-B cell transition, in particular PAX5, BTG1 and VPREB1, but not IKZF1, are selected in TCF3-HLF-translocated cells.</s><s>Other deleted genes associated with pre-B cell ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> were JAK2 and CDKN2A/B (patient 7a and 11a) and transcriptional regulators such as ERG, NCOR1, TOX, BACH2, BCL7C, MLLT3, SMARCA2 and MAFK (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s><ref type="table">6 and 7</ref>), involving among others, genes associated with pre-B cell ALL 26 (TCF3, PAX5 and LEF1) and transcriptional and chromatin regulation (ZNF263, MLL2, HIST1H3A and C6orf89).</s><s>We observed a prominent association of TCF3-HLFpositive ALL with activating mutations in RAS signaling pathway genes (NRAS, KRAS and PTPN11), detectable in four of five discovery cases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) and in three of five additional TCF3-HLF-positive validation samples (PTPN11 and SPHK1) (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>We identified no RAS pathway mutations in the TCF3-PBX1-positive discovery cohort and only one oncogenic NRAS mutation in the 24 TCF3-PBX1positive validation cases (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>NRAS and KRAS mutations were generally detected in subclones (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).</s><s>We discovered a new fusion gene, KHDRBS1-LCK, due to an interstitial chromosomal deletion in one TCF3-HLF-positive sample (6a), triggering the overexpression of the LCK tyrosine kinase (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>This was also present in three of 74 randomly selected ALL samples, demonstrating that KHDRBS1-LCK fusion is recurrent in ALL (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>LCK is a drug target in RAS-dependent cancer cells that have higher LCK expression 27 , suggesting a possible interplay with RAS-related signaling networks in TCF3-HLF-positive ALL.</s><s>Oncogenic activation of LCK associated with t(1;7)(p34;q34) translocation had been reported in the T cell leukemia cell line HSB2 (ref.</s><s>28).</s><s>Our data indicate a frequent association of proliferation-driving mutations in TCF3-HLF-positive ALL in the context of stalled B cell differentiation.</s></p></div>
