<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The role of "context" has been the subject of ongoing debates among management scholars, especially because the increasing role of emerging economies in international business (IB) has led researchers to focus on less traditional settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kriauciunas, Parmigiani, &amp; Rivera-Santos, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Discussions have typically revolved around whether management theories are context-specific or context-free, around the extent to which studying non-traditional contexts can help refine current theories, and whether new theories need to be developed to understand these different settings.</s><s>In Tsui's influential categorization, there are three main approaches to integrating context into management research: context-free models or knowledgetheories and empirical insights that are designed to be universal; contextbound models or knowledge-theories and empirical insights that highlight the differences across contexts; and context-specific models or knowledgetheories and empirical insights that only apply to a given context <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Tsui, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Tsui, , 2007))</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although these debates can be found in studies of Central and Eastern European economies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Meyer, 2007b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Shinkle, Kriauciunas, &amp; Hundley, 2013)</ref> and of Latin American countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nicholls-Nixon, Castilla, Garcia, &amp; Pesquera, 2011)</ref>, most of this discussion has focused on the extent to which research in Asian contexts can contribute to the general management literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bruton &amp; Lau, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Whetten, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Complementing Tsui's emphasis on the importance of studying Asian contexts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Meyer (2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Meyer ( , 2007a) )</ref> has argued that Asian management research needs "more self-confidence" about its contributions to the literature and has called for more indigenous and innovative research highlighting the specificities of Asian contexts.</s></p><p><s>By contrast, in-depth investigations of African contexts have been less visible in the broader literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Egri &amp; Ralston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kolk &amp; Lenfant, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kolk &amp; Van Tulder, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Visser, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zoogah &amp; Nkomo, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zoogah, Peng, &amp; Woldu, 2015)</ref>, and we are only beginning to understand the contributions that studies of this continent can bring to general management research and the impact of business on society.</s><s>As a result, several scholars have called for a better integration of research on Africa into mainstream research (most recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">George, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Walsh, 2015)</ref>, justified by two main ideas.</s><s>First, the growth of African economies has been consistent over the last few years and is expected to continue, with a 5% gross domestic product (GDP) continentwide growth expected in 2016 (African Development Bank, Organisation for Economic <ref type="bibr">Co-Operation and Development, &amp; United Nations Development Programme, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>According to claims in an increasing number of business magazines, Africa is the next frontier for growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Berman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">"The Hopeful Continent;</ref><ref type="bibr">Africa Rising," 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">"The Hottest Frontier;</ref><ref type="bibr">Investing in Africa," 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Similar to how the growing importance of China, India, or Brazil spurred research on these emerging economies, African countries also deserve a careful study, accounting for diversity across contexts and thus avoiding "broad brushstrokes" <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Wainaina, 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Second, the African continent with its large number of countries and local variations exhibits particular characteristics that are of interest for scholars.</s><s>For example, widespread poverty, with 22 African countries ranked among the 25 poorest countries in the world in GDP (purchasing power parity; World Bank, 2015), ongoing wars and post-conflict tensions, and a confluence of social and environmental issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Darkoh, 2009)</ref> unfortunately provide an important setting for research on business and poverty, sustainability, or corporate social responsibility (CSR).</s><s>Potential contributions go beyond these issues, however.</s><s>For instance, the typically complex institutional environment, with strong local, informal institutions co-existing and potentially conflicting with more recent national, formal institutions (Rivera-Santos, Holt, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Littlewood, &amp; Kolk, 2015)</ref>, provides a particularly apt context to study the impact of institutional environments on business <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Peng, Wang, &amp; Jiang, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In turn, our limited understanding of the extent to which African contexts can contribute to the broader literature also has important implications for the extent to which the broader literature can help understand the specificities of business in Africa.</s></p><p><s>This article aims to bring research on Africa into the broader discussion on context-free, context-bound, and context-specific models and knowledge, with an emphasis on business and society issues.</s><s>To do so, the authors present the results of a systematic literature review of research on Africa in 63 top business journals and their related (sub)disciplines from 2010 onwards.</s><s>Focusing on the articles' types of contribution, research gaps, and empirical approaches, the study is much more recent and comprehensive in coverage and inclusion of journals than earlier review articles considering Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Egri &amp; Ralston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kolk &amp; Lenfant, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Visser, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Zoogah &amp; Nkomo, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zoogah et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Building on the results of the systematic review (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Tranfield, Denyer, &amp; Smart, 2003)</ref>, the authors propose avenues for future research and describe successful empirical strategies in the African context, including countries or databases often overlooked by business scholars.</s><s>In other terms, the goal in this study is to both spur interest in the African context and give suggestions on how to overcome some of the difficulties typically associated with research on the continent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and Period</head><p><s>To better understand the current state of research on Africa in business and management, the authors conducted a systematic search of 63 top business journals and their related (sub)disciplines.</s><s>The sample included all journals belonging to the University of Texas (UT) Dallas and Financial Times (FT) research rankings as well as the main IB and business and society outlets.</s><s>Both the FT Research Ranking (45 journals) and the UT Dallas Business School Research Ranking (24 journals) are used by a substantial number of business schools for promotion and tenure decisions and for awarding research time and/or incentives.</s><s>A substantial overlap exists between the two rankings, so the number of journals adds up to 47 in total (all UT Dallas journals are in the FT list except for Journal on Computing and Manufacturing and Service Operations Management).</s><s>Following previous literature reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lockett, Moon, &amp; Visser, 2006)</ref>, the authors additionally considered Journal of Management, also regarded as a top journal in many universities.</s></p><p><s>To this set, the authors added the main journals in IB, where discussions of context are prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Peng, Sun, Pinkham, &amp; Chen, 2009</ref>).</s><s>In addition to Journal of International Business Studies (included in both the FT and UT Dallas lists), most IB review studies have included Journal of World Business and Management International Review <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kumar &amp; Kundu, 2004)</ref> as well as International Business Review <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chan, Fung, &amp; Leung, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kolk &amp; Van Tulder, 2010)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">DuBois and Reeb (2000)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Xu, Yalcinkaya, and Seggie (2008)</ref> added International Marketing Review and Journal of International Marketing, resulting in six leading IB journals, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Treviño, Mixon, Funk, and Inkpen (2010)</ref> added Journal of International Management to the list.</s><s>The authors chose to consider also a recently redesigned journal focused on multinational firms, Multinational Business Review, and the latest addition to the publication field, Global Strategy Journal.</s><s>These choices bring the total to nine IB journals, eight of which are not included in the FT and UT Dallas lists.</s></p><p><s>A final set of journals that the authors included focuses on business and society themes broadly defined, covering ethics, sustainability, corporate governance, and social responsibility.</s><s>Literature reviews in this realm most often take Journal of Business Ethics (part of the FT list), Business Ethics Quarterly, and Business &amp; Society as "a limited list of recognized top-tier journals" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aguinis &amp; Glavas, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beets, Lewis, &amp; Brower, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kolk &amp; Van Tulder, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Considering the lists of potential specialized journals, almost all mentioned by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Beets et al. (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Egri and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ralston (2008), and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lockett et al. (2006)</ref>, we selected those journals both relevant to business and management and included in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI).</s><s>This approach resulted in the retention of five additional journals: Business Ethics: A European Review; Business, Strategy and the Environment; Corporate Governance: An International Review; Corporate Social <ref type="bibr">Responsibility and Environmental Management; and Organization &amp; Environment.</ref></s><s>The authors subjected the resulting set of 63 journals to a primary search through the Ebscohost database for articles published between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2014.</s><s>This Ebscohost-based search was complemented by an additional search for forthcoming articles on the websites of the 63 journals as of December 31, 2014.</s><s>The time frame stems from the fact that earlier overviews that considered Africa (or, more specifically, CSR in Africa) in mainstream outlets have not covered the most recent years, the latest reviews going up to 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Zoogah &amp; Nkomo, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zoogah et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Although the inclusion of forthcoming articles helps to capture a more complete picture as of December 31, 2014, it also has limitations, as some journals have a more up-to-date pipeline online than others.</s><s>For example, of the four articles published in the Academy of Management Perspectives February 2015 special symposium on Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Michalopoulos &amp; Papaioannou, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rivera-Santos et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Walsh, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Zoogah et al., 2015)</ref>, only two could be found on the website at the end of 2014.</s></p></div>
