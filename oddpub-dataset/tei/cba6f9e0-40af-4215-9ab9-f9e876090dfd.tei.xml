<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: A phase II study was performed to investigate the safety and efficacy of weekly doses of combined paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with concurrent radiation therapy, followed by 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy to treat patients with advanced oesophageal carcinoma.</s><s>Methods: The eligibility criteria included local, advanced, newly diagnosed and postoperative local regional lymph node metastasis; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of ≤ 2; and adequate organ function.</s><s>Patients received chemoradiotherapy consisting of radiotherapy (50.4 Gy/28 Fx or 61.2 Gy/34 Fx) and concurrent paclitaxel (50 mg/m 2 ) and 5-FU (300 mg/m 2 ) for 96 h on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29.</s><s>The two-cycle consolidation chemotherapy protocol included paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 ) plus continuously infused 5-FU (1800 mg/m 2 ) for 72 h administered on days 57 and 85, after concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</s><s>Results: Between February 2012 and August 2013, 53 patients with oesophageal carcinoma were enrolled in the study.</s><s>Among these patients, 33 (62.2%) were newly diagnosed and 20 (37.7%) had postoperative local regional lymph node metastasis.</s><s>The median overall survival (OS) time was 17.9 months (95% CIs = 11.9-23.9),</s><s>and the median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 12.4 months (95% CIs = 8.6-16.1).</s><s>Approximately 84.9% (45/53) and 50.9% (27/53) of the patients completed ≥ 5 cycles and all 7 cycles of chemotherapy, respectively.</s><s>Approximately 86.7% (46/53) of patients completed radiation therapy.</s><s>The 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 66.0%, 37.7%, and 35.8%, respectively.</s><s>The 1-, 2-, and 3-year local control rates were 76.9%, 66.4%, and 66.4%, respectively.</s><s>Seventeen patients (32%) experienced grade 3 or higher toxicity.</s><s>Grade 3 to 5 toxicity during chemoradiotherapy included neutropaenia (7.5%), thrombocytopaenia (1.8%), fatigue (7.5%), anaemia (1.8%), dermatitis radiation (1.8%), pneumonitis (5.6%), oesophagitis (9.4%) and vomiting (3.7%).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>The combination of weekly doses of paclitaxel and 5-FU was well tolerated and produced comparable results among patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer.</s><s>A randomised phase III trial (NCT01591135) comparing paclitaxel plus 5-FU with cisplatin plus 5-FU is on-going at our hospital.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Oesophageal cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer and fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in China.</s><s>This cancer is highly malignant because of high rates of local recurrence and metastasis.</s><s>Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for non-surgery patients with oesophageal cancer, and the use of cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil (PF) is the most common chemotherapy regimen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>However, 5year survival rates are poor (26%) following definitive chemoradiation therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, more sensitive, less toxic chemotherapy regimens are urgently needed.</s></p><p><s>Paclitaxel is a promising agent with regard to oesophageal cancer, with response rates of approximately 32% via single-drug treatment in locally advanced and metastatic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor that blocks cells during the G2M-phase of the cell cycle (i.e., the most radiosensitive phase), with a sensitising enhancement ratio of 1.48 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin (TP) is the most commonly used regimen, and the response rates among advanced and metastatic patients with oesophageal cancer are approximately 46%-59% <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, with a median survival of 6.9 to 13 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Radiotherapy concurrent with a monthly schedule of TP resulted in 3-year overall survival (OS) and local failure rates of 41% and 27.6% but a relatively higher haematological toxicity, resulting in neutropaenia grades 3 and 4 in 30.3% and 31.6% of cases, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Increased toxicity with no improvement in OS compared with the PF regimen was associated with the TP regimen for advanced oesophageal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The investigation of a new paclitaxel-based regimen and administration route is important for improving survival and reducing side effects.</s><s>Effective and welltolerated chemotherapy can prolong OS and improve quality of life.</s><s>A pilot study of concurrent paclitaxel and 5-FU plus radiotherapy was developed for patients with localised oesophageal cancer at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In that study, the continuous infusion of 5-FU and paclitaxel combined with radiotherapy 5 times was well tolerated; toxicities included mild vomiting, nausea, oesophagitis, and abdominal pain.</s><s>The combination of paclitaxel and 5-FU was tolerated and effective.</s><s>Based on these data, we began a phase II feasibility study to evaluate the failurefree local control rate, OS, and toxicities in patients with advanced oesophageal cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel and 5-FU.</s></p></div>
