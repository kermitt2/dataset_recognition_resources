<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background.</s><s>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are transmitted via saliva, but factors associated with salivary shedding are unknown.</s></p><p><s>Methods.</s><s>We measured the DNA load of both viruses in saliva specimens collected from approximately 500 Ugandan mothers and their 6-year-old children, testing all participants for EBV and KSHV-seropositive individuals for KSHV.</s></p><p><s>Results.</s><s>EBV and KSHV were shed by 72% and 22% of mothers, respectively, and by 85% and 40% of children, respectively; boys were more likely than girls to shed KSHV (48% vs 30%) but were equally likely to shed EBV.</s><s>Children shed more KSHV and EBV than mothers, but salivary loads of EBV and KSHV were similar.</s><s>KSHV shedding increased with increasing anti-KSHV (K8.1) antibodies in mothers and with decreasing antimalarial antibodies both in mothers and children.</s><s>Among mothers, 40% of KSHV shedders also shed EBV, compared with 75% of KSHV nonshedders; among children, EBV was shed by 65% and 83%, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions.</s><s>In summary, in this population, individuals were more likely to shed EBV than KSHV in saliva.</s><s>We identified several factors, including child's sex, that influence KSHV shedding, and we detected an inverse relationship between EBV and KSHV shedding, suggesting a direct or indirect interaction between the two viruses.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study of factors associated with shedding of KSHV and EBV in saliva-a mechanism for viral transmission-in a sample of apparently healthy, HIVuninfected people from a population in which both viruses are very prevalent and in which the tumors they cause, Kaposi sarcoma and Burkitt lymphoma, are endemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The prevalence of KSHV shedding was similar between mothers and girls, but it tended to be higher in boys.</s><s>Examination of the KSHV load in individuals who shed revealed that it was higher in children than in mothers but was similar in boys and girls.</s><s>The reasons for the greater prevalence and, presumably, frequency of shedding among boys, compared with that among mothers and girls, are not clear.</s><s>In 2 other studies of adults and children from Uganda that examined the prevalence of KSHV in blood, Mbulaiteye and colleagues showed that males were twice as likely to have detectable virus in blood than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>.</s><s>One of these studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> found no difference in the prevalence of detectable virus in saliva between boys and girls.</s><s>However, in combination with the fact that, among people without HIV infection, Kaposi sarcoma shows a marked excess incidence among men as compared to women <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>, this might suggest that males are less able to control KSHV replication than females.</s><s>Our results further suggest that such differential control may be established at an early age, suggesting that nonreproductive factors might be at play, whether genetic or environmental, due to early sex-or gender-specific exposures/behaviors.</s><s>That many more children than mothers shed also suggests that children may be an important source of KSHV transmission both within the family and in the wider community.</s><s>Further studies of KSHV transmission between children are warranted.</s></p><p><s>In mothers, we detected strong associations between KSHV shedding and anti-KSHV K8.1 antibody levels; this is consistent with the hypothesis that antibodies against the K8.1 antigen reflect lytic viral replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Such an association in children was not significant.</s><s>While children shed more frequently, it is conceivable that the shorter time since KSHV acquisition did not yet result in levels of KSHV-specific antibodies that were greater than those in nonshedders; alternatively, or additionally, in the course of recent infection in children, the antibody response profile might be different than during established infection in adults.</s><s>The viral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is more likely to be relevant to KSHV pathogenesis than the viral load in saliva, and the correlation between the load in PBMCs and anti-KSHV antibody levels will need to be investigated directly.</s><s>However, we can now confirm a previously observed association between anti-K8.1 antibody levels and KSHV reactivation, resulting in salivary shedding <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This further validates our previous observations on the possible role of the anti-K8.1 antibody level as a prognostic marker in the natural history of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In previous work within this cohort, we identified associations between KSHV prevalence and malaria parasitemia in both mothers and children <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, we found that the KSHV prevalence was also associated with antibodies against P. falciparum malaria (both AMA-1 and MSP-1) in both mothers and children <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we found an association between AMA-1 levels and KSHV shedding in mothers and between MSP-1 levels and KSHV shedding in children, but we found no association between these anti-P.</s><s>falciparum antibodies and the KSHV load in shedders, either mothers or children.</s><s>Further prospective research on the role of malaria in the natural history of KSHV infection is justified.</s><s>In keeping with our previous findings, we also observed a sizable association between fecal detection of helminths in children and both KSHV shedding and viral load, although for the former finding, the small number of affected children did not allow the association to reach significance.</s><s>This also deserves further study in larger cohorts, especially in light of the recent observations that murine gammaherpesvirus 68 undergoes reactivation in latently infected mice with acute with intestinal helminth infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with earlier reports, a large majority of participants (adults and children of both sexes) were shedding EBV <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Such a high proportion of shedders explains to some extent why, contrary to KSHV, EBV is ubiquitous in this population from a very early age.</s><s>A child presumably had a higher likelihood of exposure to EBV than to KSHV at any given time, even though we detected similar virus loads in shedders: in children, the median KSHV load was 4.4 log copies (IQR, 3.5-4.7 log copies), and the EBV load was 4.7 log copies (IQR, 3.6-5.4</s><s>log copies); in mothers, viral loads were 3.6 log copies (IQR, 2.3-4.6 log copies) and 3.9 log copies (IQR, 2.4-4.7 log copies), respectively.</s><s>Susceptibility to acquisition of either viral infection might also differ in the same individuals, in part because of the different role of exposure cofactors.</s></p><p><s>In mothers, no factor was associated with EBV shedding or viral load.</s><s>In children, however, some maternal factors were significant.</s><s>Children of older mothers tended to shed less, emphasizing the possible role of environmental exposures unmeasured in our study.</s><s>Likewise, children of mothers with a high EBV load tended to shed more themselves, again suggesting a common exposure or perhaps a genetic factor, also worthy of further examination.</s><s>We have recently performed a genome-wide association study in a population-based rural Ugandan cohort, and we have identified an association between 5 novel loci and anti-EBV antibody levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, we have identified negative associations between anti-MSP-1 (but not anti-AMA-1) antibody levels and EBV load in shedding children (but not mothers).</s><s>The relationship between EBV and malaria has been investigated since the discovery of the virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, and very recent data provide interesting insight on the role of malaria in EBV-associated lymphomagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>However, as with KSHV, the contribution of malaria to EBV pathogenesis and natural history must be further investigated throughout the life-span.</s></p><p><s>For the first time, we also present data on the relationship between KSHV and EBV shedding in saliva.</s><s>It is notable that individuals shedding KSHV tend to shed less EBV, while individuals shedding EBV tend to shed more KSHV.</s><s>This suggests that there may be direct or indirect interaction between EBV and KSHV oropharyngeal replication, but the mechanisms controlling replication and shedding in saliva have not yet been investigated.</s><s>Sparse in vitro data are available on dually infected primary effusion lymphoma lines, showing KSHV inhibition by EBV <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, mutual inhibition by the 2 viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, differential transactivation of the 2 viruses by host immune factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, and even synergistic in vivo tumorigenicity in animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Further investigation of the interactions between the 2 human gammaherpesviruses and their host is warranted.</s><s>Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval;
