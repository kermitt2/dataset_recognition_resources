<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Purpose The present study compared the effects of mandibular advancement therapy (MAD) with continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) on daytime cardiac autonomic modulation in a wide range of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients under controlled conditions in a randomized, twoperiod crossover trial.</s><s>Methods Forty OSA patients underwent treatment with MAD and with CPAP for 12 weeks each.</s><s>At baseline and after each treatment period, patients were assessed by polysomnography as well as by a daytime cardiac autonomic function test that measured heart rate variability (HRV), continuous blood pressure (BP), and baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) under conditions of spontaneous breathing, with breathing at 6, 12, and 15/min.</s><s>Results Both CPAP and MAD therapy substantially eliminated apneas and hypopneas.</s><s>CPAP had a greater effect.</s><s>During daytime with all four conditions of controlled breathing, threeminute mean values of continuous diastolic BP were significantly reduced for both MAD and CPAP therapy.</s><s>At the same time, selective increases due to therapy with MAD were found for HRV high frequency (HF) values.</s><s>No changes were observed for BRS in either therapy mode.</s><s>Conclusions These findings indicate that both MAD and CPAP result in similar beneficial changes in cardiac autonomic function during daytime, especially in blood pressure.</s><s>CPAP is more effective than MAD in eliminating respiratory events.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing and affects about 5-7 % of the adult population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Repetitive collapses of the upper airways during sleep lead to hypoxic phases with associated sleep fragmentation and sympathetic activation, the latter of which also persists during daytime with the resultant consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>OSA has accordingly been confirmed as an independent cardiovascular risk factor that may increase mortality if left untreated <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is manifestly an effective therapeutic approach.</s><s>Many studies have demonstrated that CPAP therapy reduces cardiovascular risk and overall mortality rate if regularly employed by OSA patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>CPAP therapy is accordingly recommended as the standard therapy in moderate to severe OSA.</s><s>The CPAP effect can partly be explained by its reduction of sympathetic tone not only during the night but also during daytime <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to investigation of blood pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and heart rate variability (HRV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, measurements of baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) and of systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) represent non-invasive methods of assessing autonomic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Regular CPAP therapy improves these parameters during the night and daytime as evidence of reduction of sympathetic hyperactivation in OSA patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Many trials have dealt with the effect of CPAP on HRV <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and others have likewise reported the positive effect of CPAP on BRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Unfortunately, many patients demonstrate limited adherence to CPAP therapy, and some patients decline this form of treatment.</s><s>There is accordingly a need for alternative therapeutic approaches that are as effective as CPAP therapy-not only with respect to symptoms but also to the cardiovascular consequences of OSA.</s></p><p><s>Intraoral mandibular advancement devices (MAD) protrude the mandible during sleep to maintain upper airway patency <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>A number of trials have shown comparable effects of MAD and CPAP in OSA patients with regard to symptoms such as daytime sleepiness and driving performance-but have also covered side effects, withdrawal rates, and usage time <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>Although MAD evidently does not reduce apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by the same amount as CPAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, more favorable side effects, withdrawal rates, and usage time may be explained by better compliance and quality of life in patients who employ MAD compared with those who use CPAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>This was also confirmed by other randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of both therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>MAD has thus been proposed as alternative therapeutic approach for mild to moderate OSA, in accordance with existing guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>Some investigators have demonstrated subjective benefits of MAD for patients classified with severe OSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Studies of MAD therapy, however, are often not comparable.</s><s>Furthermore, the few studies that until now have examined the effects of MAD therapy on cardiovascular parameters have arrived at contradictory findings.</s><s>Gotsopoulus et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> found a small reduction in diastolic blood pressure during daytime, whereas Andren et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> reported improvement in systolic blood pressure.</s><s>Phillips et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> showed that regular use of neither CPAP nor MAD for 1 month can improve 24-h ambulatory mean blood pressure, whereas they are comparably effective with respect to daytime sleepiness and quality of life.</s></p><p><s>Little is known about the effect of MAD therapy on autonomic activity parameters.</s><s>One study investigating daytime HRV parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> found that 3 months of MAD therapy improved cardiac autonomic modulation.</s><s>Dal-Fabbro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> investigated effects of 1-month MAD and CPAP therapy on HRV during sleep and found a number of beneficial changes for both therapies.</s></p><p><s>To date, none of the previous studies has specifically explored in parallel the effect of MAD on daytime blood pressure, HRV, BRS, and SBPV.</s><s>There are likewise no systematic comparisons between MAD and CPAP for these parameters in the same patients.</s></p><p><s>The present study therefore aimed to evaluate the effect of MAD and CPAP with regard to cardiovascular parameters and autonomic activity in a two-period crossover design in which the patients were either randomized to the sequence MAD-CPAP (12 weeks of MAD followed by 12 weeks of CPAP) or the sequence CPAP-MAD (3 months of CPAP followed by 3 months of MAD).</s></p></div>
