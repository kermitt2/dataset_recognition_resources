<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case Report</head><p><s>A 52-year-old female presented to a nonaffiliated hospital with a myasthenic syndrome including exercise-dependent muscle weakness, double-vision and dysphagia.</s><s>Her medical history was remarkable for a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed at the age of 17 that led to an acute attack of lupus nephritis at the age of 36.</s><s>Maintenance treatment with oral steroids was initiated, tapered to 4 mg prednisolone and continued up to the day of her current presentation.</s></p><p><s>Electrophysiological examinations revealed a decrement in repetitive nerve stimulation.</s><s>CSF examination showed mild protein elevation (506 mg/L, normal range: 150-450 mg/L); white cell count, lactate, glucose and intrathecal immunoglobulin levels were normal.</s><s>Antibody tests were positive for cardiolipin IgG/IgM and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK; 0.3 nmol/L, normal range: &lt;0.05 nmol/L).</s><s>Importantly, tests were negative for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and titin.</s><s>The patient was eventually diagnosed with MuSK-Ab-positive generalized myasthenia gravis (MG).</s><s>Accordingly, computed tomography (CT)-imaging of the chest did not reveal evidence for a thymoma or thymus hyperplasia.</s><s>About 3 weeks after admission, the patient developed progressive renal failure that was attributed to lupus nephritis and treated with 1000 mg intravenous methylprednisolone over 3 days.</s><s>Her myasthenic symptoms gradually worsened and she developed respiratory failure.</s><s>Despite subsequent treatment with oral pyridostigmine, steroids (70 mg oral methylprednisolone/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg; 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) there was a persistent need for ventilatory support at the time the patient was referred to our intensive care unit.</s></p><p><s>On admission, neurologic examination revealed a symmetric proximal tetraparesis (2/5 on the MRC scale) and the need for mechanical ventilation.</s><s>Plasmapheresis along with 250 mg intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days with a subsequent maintenance dose of 70 mg oral prednisolone was initiated.</s><s>CSF examination was repeated as the patient developed hyperactive delirium suggesting central nervous system (CNS) disease; it showed resolution of protein elevation but revealed an intrathecal synthesis of IgG, IgA, and IgM as well as oligoclonal bands.</s><s>Autoimmune encephalitis was excluded by antibody testing (NMDA-, AMPA-, GABAb-, and Glycin-receptor) in CSF and serum.</s><s>Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed contrast-enhancing lesions compatible with CNS affection of SLE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Consistent with this finding, repeated antibody tests were positive for ANA (titer: 1:1280, normal range: &lt;1:320), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (39.8 U/mL, normal range: &lt;20 U/mL), cardiolipin IgG/IgM (11.9 and 38.4 U/mL, normal range: &lt;10 and &lt;7 U/mL, respectively), beta2-glycoprotein IgG/IgM (18.5 and 55.1 U/mL, normal range: both &lt;8 U/mL), phosphatidylserine (referred to as APSA; 12 and 37 U/mL, normal range: both &lt;10 U/mL), N-type (ratio of 17.6, normal ratio: &lt;10) and PQ-type (35.8, normal range: &lt;25 pmol/L) voltage gated-calcium channels (VGCC), MuSK (0.3 mol/L, normal range: &lt;0.05 nmol/L), thyroglobuline (1400 U/ mL, normal range: 115 U/mL).</s><s>Antibodies against AChR, titin and dsDNA (Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test, CLIFT) were negative.</s><s>Results were interpreted as indicative of low lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) activity, as the CLIFT for dsDNA was negative and APS-associated antibodies were predominantly of IgMsubtype without clinical signs of venous thrombosis.</s><s>The significance of the VGCC-antibodies remained unclear but was ultimately regarded as insignificant as there were no electrophysiologic signs of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a whole-body positron emission tomography of fluorodeoxyglucose distribution showed no evidence of malignant lesions except for pathological uptake in right axillary lymph nodes but histopathologic evaluation excluded malignancy.</s></p><p><s>Two months after admission, we observed moderate clinical improvement as a response to immunosuppressive treatment.</s><s>Proximal weakness had improved by 1-2 points on the MRC scale, the delirium had resolved and a cerebral MRI showed resolution of contrast-enhancing lesions.</s><s>We considered a maintenance immunosuppressive regime with azathioprine, rituximab, or belimumab for an overlap syndrome of MuSK-Ab-positive MG and SLE.</s><s>However, initiation of this maintenance treatment was hindered by a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and progressive hepatic insufficiency.</s><s>Seroconversion suggested an associated hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, but PCR for HEV from different specimens (serum, feces, liver biopsy) was negative.</s><s>The patient was treated with ribavirin as ultrasound and biopsy confirmed hepatitis could at that point not be attributed to any other autoimmune or infectious etiology.</s><s>Although VAP was successfully treated with antibiotics, ribavirin caused agranulocytosis which was effectively reversed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.</s></p><p><s>After clinical stabilization about 8 weeks later, the patient developed severe pneumonia with septic shock caused by a pneumothorax.</s><s>Despite appropriate treatment for microbiologically confirmed multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis there was only transient decline of inflammation markers and demand of circulatory support.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the course of clinical and laboratory markers of inflammation and treatment.</s><s>Due to the development of a DIC, we extended our search for infectious foci by repeated wholebody CT-imaging, white blood cell scan, extensive microbiological testing including repeated blood cultures and serology for viral and fungal infections.</s><s>Results were negative except for high levels of EBV-copies (15,000/mL) which were considered a reactivation during the course of sepsis, aggravated by SLE-associated poor EBV-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, CT-imaging showed resolution of prior lung infiltrate.</s><s>We therefore considered noninfectious inflammatory disorders instead with features resembling sepsis.</s><s>Initially, eosinophilia of 75% gave rise to the suspicion of drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>We changed the antibiotic regimen from vancomycin, which was the most likely drug to cause DIHS, to linezolid and initiated immunosuppressive treatment (0.4 g/kg/day IVIg for 5 days and 50 mg intravenous prednisolone followed by 20 mg daily over 7 days).</s><s>Further differential diagnostic evaluation revealed high ferritin (11,599 lg/L) and soluble Il-2 receptor (4586 lg/mL) levels.</s><s>Splenomegaly, fever, anemia, thombo-/leukocytopenia and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow biopsy suggested HLH, possibly associated with EBV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Typical histologic changes (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) gave rise to the alternative term macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is preferentially used in the context of autoimmune disorders such as SLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The patient was therefore treated with another course of IVIg (0.4 g/ kg/day) and high-dose intravenous steroids (500 mg methylprednisolone over 2 days with a consecutive taper to a daily maintenance dose of 7.5 mg).</s><s>Additional treatment with cyclophosphamide (600/800 mg per induction dose) was administered for a combined syndrome of HLH, SLE, and MG.</s><s>The patient's condition improved substantially (moderate tetraparesis of 4/5 on the MRC scale, no persistent need for mechanical ventilation) and she was eventually scheduled for rehabilitation.</s></p><p><s>Before discharge, however, she unexpectedly died of a fulminant subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a ruptured 4 mm right middle cerebral artery aneurysm.</s><s>Autopsy revealed diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of parenchymal organs, notably of liver, spleen, and bone marrow.</s><s>Some macrophages revealed signs of erythrophagocytic activity (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In our patient, multiple possible HLH triggers were present; notably an infection with K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis as well as EBV-viremia, possibly related to poor EBV-control in SLE aggravated by infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, and active SLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Treating trigger factors such as infection or autoimmune disease activity in MAS, that is an autoimmune-associated HLH variant, may suffice and allow deferring HLH-specific treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>.</s><s>There are no randomized, controlled clinical trials investigating potential HLH treatment regimens in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In children, different protocols, that is HLH-94 and HLH-2004, have been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref>; HLH-2004 trial data, however, is not yet fully evaluated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Available results suggest efficacy of an induction treatment with dexamethasone and etoposide, and in case of nonresponding CNS involvement addition of intrathecal treatment with methotrexate and hydrocortisone.</s><s>The role of ciclosporin A remains a matter of debate that might be resolved with the results of the HLH-2004 trial.</s><s>Noncontrolled and retrospective studies in adults have tested several combinations of corticosteroids, IVIg, etoposide, ciclosporin A, and alemtuzumab (for review see Ramos-Casals et al., 2014) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The literature in both adults and children seems to justify an individual approach in all patients depending on trigger factors as well as organ manifestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, choosing an appropriate treatment can be challenging and requires due consideration.</s><s>We eventually treated our patient with corticosteroids, IVIg and cyclophosphamide as (1) EBV-associated HLH has been shown to respond to corticosteroids and IVIg <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> cyclophosphamide is reported to improve SLE-associated MAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, and (3) cyclophosphamide is a well-established escalation and maintenance treatment for MG albeit rarely reported in MuSK-positive variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>;
