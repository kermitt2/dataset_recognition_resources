dexmedetomidine treatment showed a profound decrease of degenerating cells in all analysed brain regions of rats exposed to hyperoxia (Figure <ref type="figure"

showed significant decreased GSH and increased GSSG levels at 24 h of hyperoxia.</s><s>In addition, a decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio and an increase in MDA level in the developing brain indicate neuronal damage due to oxidative stress, but there was a modulation of the levels of all parameters Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: (a) Quantitative analysis of mRNA expression by real-time PCR showed a

infants are often exposed to a longer period of supraphysiological oxygen concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, and we have not determined the plasma levels of dexmedetomidine.</s><s>Further details of dexmedetomidine-induced side effects remain to be elucidated.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating that dexmedetomidine mediates a decrease of neurodegeneration and oxidative stress and affects the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 in the hyperoxia-exposed neonatal brain.</s><s>Since oxidative stress and
