<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Imatinib is the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that directly targeted an oncogenic driver mutant.</s><s>This drug showed unprecedented success in the treatment of chronic myleogenous leukemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Since then, many kinase inhibitors targeting different oncogenic kinases were developed.</s><s>A few of these drugs showed equally impressive efficacy, for instance, crizotinib for the non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that harbored the EML4-ALK translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, vemurafenib for the BRAF V600E mutated melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, erlotinib for the NSCLC that harbored activating EGFR kinase mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> or vandetanib for the hereditary medullary thyroid cancer with underlying RET mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Like imatinib, the common theme around these success stories is that the TKIs specifically targeted the oncogenic mutants that drive the underlying cancers.</s><s>Thus, recent effort has been focused on profiling the genetic landscape of tumors to identify potential druggable targets, thereby increasing the efficacy of kinase inhibitor therapies.</s></p><p><s>With the rapid advance in sequencing technologies, high throughput screening of mutation drivers by next generation sequencing (NGS) is now a commercially available service for personalized cancer therapy.</s><s>There are many anecdotal cases that utilized the NGS platform to identify driver mutations in cancer patients for novel TKI therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>In some cases, the diagnostic was successful in personalizing the right TKIs for the right patients.</s><s>For instance, when a 41 year old woman with refractory, progressive sarcoma ran out of therapeutic options, NGS identified a novel TRK receptor fusion product, LMNA-NTRK1, in her original tumor.</s><s>She was subsequently enrolled in a phase I trial of a new pan-TRK inhibitor, LOXO-101.</s><s>After five cycles of LOXO-101, there was complete resolution of her metastatic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, after MET exon 14 mutations were identified in 0.6% of lung adenocarcinoma by NGS, three patients with tumors harboring these MET mutants were treated with MET directed therapies via clinical trials.</s><s>All three demonstrated partial responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>Despite these success stories, the NGS platform has limitations as a personalized diagnostic.</s><s>First, it might reveal many passenger mutations that are not drivers of the tumor.</s><s>Second, bearing driver mutants does not necessarily translate into response to the corresponding TKIs.</s><s>For instance, vemurafenib did not produce a dramatic response in the treatment of BRAF V600E mutated colorectal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Third, low mutation rates in some cancers like pediatric tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> might limit the usefulness of NGS as a personalized diagnostic.</s><s>Fourth, there might not be mutation drivers of a known target in the tumor.</s><s>For example, EGFR is a known target for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), but HNSCC rarely carried activating EGFR kinase mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, there might be other mechanisms of altering oncoprotein function/activity that NGS diagnostic is not able to identify.</s><s>Such mechanisms might include overexpression, impaired degradation, defective negative feedback loop or constitutive activation.</s><s>To improve the genotype approach, we hypothesized that a diagnostic that examine the activity of multiple kinases simultaneously might complement the NGS platform for better selection of the right patient for the right TKI.</s></p><p><s>Phosphoarray is a high throughput screening tool that examines the activities of multiple kinases simultaneously.</s><s>One commonly used array is called the human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array.</s><s>Capture and control antibodies were spotted in duplicate on nitrocellulose membranes.</s><s>When cell/tumor lysates were incubated with this array, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated RTKs would bind.</s><s>The active receptors would then be detected by chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.</s><s>The phospho-RTK array can examine the phosphorylation status of 49 RTKs in the lysates simultaneously.</s><s>While this array has been used in the laboratory setting to identify molecular pathway changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, it has not been tested as a diagnostic to predict tumor response to TKI therapy.</s><s>However, when it was used retrospectively to identify pathway changes in primary tumors, the array results seem to correlate with patient's response to the TKI, sunitinib <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>.</s><s>In the four refractory thymic carcinoma patients who demonstrated response to sunitinib, the phospho-RTK array identified KIT, a target of sunitinib, as active in their tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, the two patients with progressive metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma who showed partial responses to sunitinib had active PDGFR on the array <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>These findings implied that the phospho-RTK array might be useful as a diagnostic to predict individual tumor response to TKI therapy.</s><s>In this report, we demonstrated that the phospho-RTK array can inform the TKI response profile of head and neck cancer cell line and patient derived xenograft (PDX) model.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RTK phosphoarray predicts head and neck cancer cell response to kinase inhibitors</head><p><s>Using the phospho-RTK array, we determined that the HNSCC cell line, MDA1386, had activated EGFR and MET (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>We also noticed intermediate phosphorylation signals from IGF-1R and Axl, but no PDGFR activity in this cell line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Based on the array result, we treated the MDA1386 cells with the corresponding TKI.</s><s>As expected, imatinib had no inhibitory effect on MDA1386 at all concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, MET TKI treatment resulted in significant cell growth inhibition at 5 and 10 uM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>While IGF-1R TKI also had a significant inhibitory effect on cell growth at 10 uM, it had no effect at 5 uM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>This was predicted given the weak IGF-1R phosphorylation signal detected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Even though EGFR was highly phosphorylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), erlotinib had limited inhibitory effect on MDA1386 cell growth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>This was also predicted because MET signaling is known to mediate EGFR TKI resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>To determine if dual EGFR and MET inhibition resulted in a greater therapeutic effect than MET TKI alone, we treated the MDA1386 cells with increasing concentrations of both inhibitors.</s><s>As shown, the therapeutic effect of dual inhibition was significantly greater than that of either inhibitor alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>This implied a synergism between the two TKIs.</s><s>In summary, the phospho-RTK array accurately informed the TKI response profile of the MDA1386 cell line.</s></p><p><s>Next, we determined the RTK phosphorylation profiles of four additional HNSCC cell lines.</s><s>Surprisingly, all of the cell lines had similar profiles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A and S2</ref>).</s><s>Since SCC25 had a weaker MET phosphorylation signal than MDA1386 (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A and 2A</ref>), we decided to compare SCC25 response to MET TKI with that of MDA1386.</s><s>While MET TKI inhibited the cell proliferation of both cell lines at 10 uM, its effect on MDA1386 was significantly stronger than that on SCC25 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>We also tested SCC25 response to EGFR TKI.</s><s>Based on the array result, we speculated that SCC25 would be more responsive to EGFR TKI than MDA1386 because MET activation was weaker in this cell line.</s><s>Indeed, erlotinib resulted in a significantly greater growth inhibition in SCC25 than MDA1386 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, we anticipated a greater effect of IGF-1R TKI on SCC25 than MDA1386 as SCC25 had a stronger IGF-1R phosphorylation signal.</s><s>As anticipated, IGF-1R TKI resulted in a higher percentage of growth inhibition in SCC25 than MDA1386 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>In summary, the phospho-RTK array informed the differential response of two HNSCC cell lines to kinase inhibitor therapies.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Advancing precision medicine has become a national priority.</s><s>Oncology is at the forefront of this initiative.</s><s>The advance of genomic technology has made it possible to sequence tumor genome in real time to inform treatment decision and bring personalized medicine to cancer patients.</s><s>While NGS is a promising platform, the limitation is its dependence on driver mutations as predictors of response to novel therapy.</s><s>In this report, we tested the phosphoarray as a new platform for personalizing kinase inhibitor therapy.</s><s>In both in vitro and in vivo model, the phospho-RTK array was able to inform the kinase inhibitor response of HNSCC cell lines and PDX.</s><s>During the course of the study, we made several interesting observations.</s><s>First, the result that 66.7% of primary HNSCC did not have detectable pEGFR signal is similar to our prior finding in a larger cohort using a different detection method (60.7%, 34/56) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>This is in sharp contrast to the much lower percentage of HNSCC PDX with undetectable pEGFR signal (10.3%).</s><s>Since negative pEGFR predicted primary cetuximab resistance in the PDX model, the high percentage of pEGFR − primary tumor might explain the low cetuximab response rate in HNSCC clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Second, while the signaling profiles of HNSCC PDX bore close resemblance to that of the primary tumor, there were subtle differences.</s><s>These differences might have been acquired during PDX passages.</s><s>Thus, PDX response to targeted therapy should be carefully interpreted.</s><s>Third, we noticed signaling and treatment response differences between PDX from different disease sites of the same patient (i.e.</s><s>11857A: primary tumor vs. 11857B: metastatic site) and PDX from disease at different time point of the same patient (i.e.</s><s>13194: primary tumor vs. 10913: recurrent tumor) (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>).</s><s>This finding supports assessing the molecular profile of not only tumors at different time points, but also tumors at different sites.</s><s>Taken together, this study supports further development of the phosphoarray platform as a personalized diagnostic.</s><s>Despite these promising results, there are several limitations with this platform.</s><s>First, the TKI might not be potent enough to shut down the signaling of the target even when the right target was identified by the array.</s><s>This could be secondary to a mutated target.</s><s>Thus, the phosphoarray platform should be used in conjunction with the NGS platform to personalize TKI therapy.</s><s>Second, there might be unknown compensatory mechanism(s) that conferred TKI resistance to the target identified.</s><s>The phospho-RTK array does not include signaling pathways downstream of the RTK.</s><s>Third, the array results can only be interpreted subjectively and do not take into account the differences in signaling strength.</s><s>To improve on the currently available array, the next step will be to design and develop a quantitative array with expanded coverage of all potential druggable targets and resistant pathways.</s><s>In conclusion, the phosphoarray technology and concept might be broadly applied to all cancer types and impact the field of personalized medicine.</s></p><p><s>This work was supported in part by research grants from the National Cancer Institute (1R21CA187554) (M.J.H. &amp; E.L.C.) and the Sunrise Fund (E.L.C.).</s></p><p><s>Frozen primary tumors were provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, which is funded by the National Cancer Institute.</s><s>We thank Dr. Anjaruwee S.
