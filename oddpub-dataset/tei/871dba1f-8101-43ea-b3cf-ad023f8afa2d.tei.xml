<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">Performance of the classification</head><p><s>The performance of the random forest classification was evaluated using the following metrics: overall accuracy, precision, recall (also known as sensitivity), F-score and specificity, which can be computed as follows: where TP (true positives) is the number of instances where the behaviour of interest (walking, standing or lying) was correctly classified by the algorithm and visually observed.</s><s>FN (false negatives) is the number of instances where the behaviour of interest was visually observed but was incorrectly classified as some other behaviour by the algorithm.</s><s>FP (false positives) is the number of instances the behaviour of interest was incorrectly classified by the algorithm but not observed.</s><s>TN (true negative) is the number of instances where the behaviour of interest was correctly classified as not being observed.</s></p></div>

shorter windows are generally considered better, as they are less likely to have variability or transition in behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, longer windows tend to be better for more complex behaviours as they are more likely to contain more information and thus result in better classification accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, in this study the shortest window size (3 s) showed the worst performance for walking and standing behaviours.</s><s>However, classification performance for lying did not vary much between 3 and 7 s, perhaps due to lying being a comparatively less complex behaviour, thus needing less information for accurate classification.</s><s>Overall, 7 s window size was also most energy efficient despite the difference in algorithm performance between 7 and 5 s being small.</s><s>Hence, the trade-off between classification performance and energy consumption is important in the choice of a window size for implementation purposes.</s></p><p><s>When comparing across the different sampling frequencies for both ear and collar data, there was a general increase in all the performance measures for the sampling frequencies of 16 and 32 Hz.</s><s>The difference in accuracy between 16 and 32 Hz was small (5% for ear data and 3.33% for collar data, on average).</s><s>However, increasing the sampling frequency from 16 to 32 Hz can reduce the battery life by up to a half <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In other words, an increase up to 5% in classification performance may come at the cost of reducing battery life by up to half.</s><s>Therefore, the selection of the sampling frequency has to be carefully considered in the configuration of an automated monitoring system as it has a large impact on energy, transmission bandwidth and storage capacity requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The classification algorithm in the current study was highly accurate and precise for each of the behaviours as illustrated in tables 5 and 7.</s><s>The performance results scored much higher than previously reported by other studies on sheep for similar behaviours (e.g.</s><s>85.5% accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> and 87.1% to 89.7% overall accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>).</s><s>This could be because in the current study we used features extracted from both accelerometer and gyroscope data for classification unlike previous studies.</s><s>Lying was the behaviour with the highest precision (95.05% average) and recall (95.94% average) for both ear and collar data when comparing with walking (precision 88.27% and recall 86.72%) and standing (precision 87.94% and recall 88%).</s><s>Lying can be more easily classified as sheep move significantly less than when standing and walking.</s><s>The highest misclassification was observed between walking and standing (see confusion matrices in the electronic supplementary material).</s><s>This is probably due to the grazing activity (which is most likely to occur when sheep are standing) causing accelerations similar to walking, leading to misclassifications.</s><s>In the current study, grazing activity was not separately recorded and further work is needed to investigate grazing and non-grazing activities.</s></p><p><s>The computational cost of the algorithm and its feasibility to be implemented on the device is another factor that has to be considered when developing a behavioural monitoring system.</s><s>We chose a random forest algorithm to implement the classifier in the current study as random forest has low computational costs.</s><s>Previous studies have used complex methods such as hidden Markov models (HMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, support vector machines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and generalized mixed linear models (GMLM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> or simple methods such as decision trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for the classification of behaviours in farm animals.</s><s>HMM, SVM and GMLM can have high computational cost and hence they are typically less appealing for automated, real-time monitoring devices.</s><s>Decision trees can offer a low computational cost;
