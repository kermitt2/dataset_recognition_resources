<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms preceding the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events is crucial for development of preventive strategies and treatment options.</s><s>Thereby, particularly early metabolic alterations that already occur in healthy individuals may be identified as targets for measures to delay or prevent disease onset.</s><s>Metabolomic approaches that simultaneously measure substrates, intermediate-and endproducts of metabolism offer a unique snapshot of metabolic perturbations that may be involved in the development of CVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, circulating metabolite concentrations may be altered years before the onset of CVD events.</s></p><p><s>Previous prospective metabolomic studies have identified a number of metabolites linked to risk of CVD recurrence or death in patient cohorts, as well as CVD risk in high-risk populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>They reported an altered metabolism of acylcarnitines, ketone-related metabolites, fatty acids, choline and its phospholipids in CVD patients and high-risk individuals.</s><s>One recent prospective study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> reported phenylalanine and fatty acids, and another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> found other lipid species to be linked to CVD risk in population-based cohorts.</s><s>Ganna et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> recently found four lipid metabolites that could be useful to predict coronary heart disease.</s><s>These previous studies, however, also had some limitations, e.g. they investigated few metabolite classes or a composite CVD endpoint.</s><s>Thus, there is an urgent need for large metabolomic studies covering a wide range of metabolites that are conducted in healthy adult cohorts, which are followed over long for incidence of a first CVD event.</s><s>In addition, it is of great importance to address different CVD endpoints separately, so as to better understand their individual pathophysiological mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>The present study aimed to identify metabolites, which are linked to higher incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke in initially healthy adults.</s><s>Therefore, we conducted targeted metabolomic measurements, including in total 105 metabolites among amino acids, acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and hexose, in serum samples from two large prospective cohorts comprising middle-aged adults from Germany that were healthy at the time of the blood sample collection and followed for development of a prime CVD event.</s><s>To better understand the biological mechanisms, in addition, we studied associations between metabolites and established biomarkers of CVD risk.</s><s>To evaluate their usefulness for clinical practice we also calculated measures of risk prediction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>The present study is based on data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Germany study, a prospective cohort study which includes 27,548 adults in Potsdam and 25,540 adults in Heidelberg aged mainly between 35 and 65 years at time of recruitment, when also the blood sample was collected <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>These people are prospectively followed for incidence of chronic diseases including CVD.</s><s>More general details about the cohorts are provided in the Supplementary Methods.</s></p><p><s>We constructed two case-cohort studies, one in EPIC-Potsdam and another in EPIC-Heidelberg, including all incident cases of MI (n = 274 and n = 290; respectively) and stroke (n = 260 and n = 220; respectively) that occurred in the full cohorts until December 2006, after mean follow-up time of 7.8 years (Potsdam) and 7.3 years (Heidelberg), and two randomly drawn subcohorts (Potsdam n = 2500, Heidelberg n = 843) from all participants who had provided blood samples in the full cohorts.</s><s>The selection of the subcohorts has been described in detail previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>For the present analysis, the following additional exclusion criteria were applied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): history of CVD or diabetes mellitus at the time of blood donation (to ensure that initially healthy adults were included), nonverified incident CVD, non-ischemic incident stroke, missing biomarker data or missing covariates.</s><s>Thus, the final study sample in EPIC-Potsdam consisted of 204 incident cases of MI and 147 incident cases of stroke, and a random subcohort of n = 2214.</s><s>From EPIC-Heidelberg, 228 incident cases of MI and 121 incident cases of stroke were considered, in addition to a random subcohort of n = 770.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ascertainment of incident MI and stroke during follow-up</head><p><s>Potential incident cases of MI and stroke were identified based on self-reports of a new diagnosis of disease, disease relevant medication or change in diet due to disease, which were collected every 2-3 years after baseline in follow-up questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, information from death certificates or linkage to a hospital information system of the major hospital in the area was considered.</s><s>Follow-up rounds resulted in response rates of about 95% of participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>Self-reported cases were further verified by actively contacting the treating physician or hospital who filled in a standard inquiry form that included information on the exact type and date of diagnosis, the method of confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment information.</s><s>We used the international classification of diseases (ICD)-10 system to classify incident cases: I21 for MI, I60 and I61 for haemorrhagic stroke, I63 for ischemic stroke and I64 for undetermined stroke.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolomic measurements</head><p><s>Metabolite concentrations were determined in baseline serum samples of the EPIC-Potsdam and EPIC-Heidelberg case-cohort studies using two commercial kits (BIO-CRATES Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria).</s><s>Blood samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis.</s><s>Sample preparation was done according to standardized protocols and the metabolomic methods have been described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>.</s><s>Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.</s></p><p><s>The p150 metabolomic kit used in EPIC-Potsdam initially contained 163 metabolites, of them 14 amino acids, 41 acylcarnitines, 1 hexose, 92 glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholines and lyso-phosphatidylcholines) and 15 sphingomyelins; a detailed list has been published earlier by the authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>A new version of the kit including 188 metabolites (similar metabolites but additionally including biogenic amines) was used for measurement of EPIC-Heidelberg samples.</s><s>For the present analysis we considered only metabolites that were measured in both studies (n = 161).</s><s>Data pre-processing was done as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In brief, we excluded metabolite species with more than 25% values below limit of detection, with more than 25% missing values, and with batch variation of more than 25%.</s><s>All metabolite values were log2 transformed and normalized by metabolite wide batch standardization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Robust principal component analysis was used to identify multivariable outliers, which were excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s>This led to inclusion of a total of 105 metabolites, of them 13 amino acids, 2 acylcarnitines, 1 hexose, 77 glycerophospholipids and 12 sphingomyelins into the present analysis.</s></p></div>
