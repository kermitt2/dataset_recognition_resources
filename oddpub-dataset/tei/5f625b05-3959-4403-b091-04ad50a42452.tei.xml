might be responsible for no changes in PS postoperatively.</s><s>However, not all patients with restored DCA had clinical improvement when assessing functional results with mRs in a remote period after surgical treatment (from 6 months to 1 year after operation).</s></p><p><s>Along with that it should also be noted that in some patients with symptomatic/asymptomatic severe ICA stenosis DCA was not impaired at all before planning surgery.</s><s>None of these patients in the study showed reliable changes of PS, BFV, or BP, and their clinical condition according to mRs remained unaffected in both early and remote postoperative period.</s><s>Such "a good behavior" of DCA despite the severity of stenosis which is apparently associated with sufficient quality of collateral circulation and microcirculatory vasodilation capacity was also mentioned by other researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hartl et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Marshall et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Reinhard et al., 2003a)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it may be concluded that high-grade ICA stenosis in case of unimpaired DCA on ipsilateral side should not be absolutely considered as a risk-factor that fatefully can lead to cerebral infarction.</s><s>In this regard, we suppose that the dynamic follow-up with assignment of optimal medical therapy would be more preferable for this category of patients.</s><s>This is of particular concern for individuals with asymptomatic severe ICA stenosis as the indications for surgical treatment of them are still controversial and require further in-depth study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Halliday et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Paraskevas et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The 2 year risk of ipsilateral stroke events in the natural history of the disease in cohort of asymptomatic patients who are receiving optimal medical therapy (&lt;1%) is quite lower than the procedural (30day) risk of probable postoperative complications for CEA (1.4%) and CAS (2.5%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Spence et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hart and Ng, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The lack of clinical improvement in 12 patients with postoperative restored DCA may be due to the fact that the initial functional state in these patients before surgery did not substantially affect their everyday social activity.</s><s>In symptomatic patients slight limitation of regular life activity From left to right: carotid angiogram, multichannel monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and blood flow velocity in middle cerebral arteries over 5 min during compulsory breathing at a rate 6/min, phase shift (PS) and BP-amplitude spectra within the range of Mayer waves.</s><s>From top to bottom: before and 7 days after carotid balloon angioplasty with stenting.</s><s>The selected in-box area in spectral analysis comprises the significant harmonic components of PS to determine its average value.</s></p><p><s>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) could be due to persistent local structural changes in an infarction zone, which despite the restoration of perfusion and DCA in the region of the basal intracranial artery on affected side, nevertheless have appeared to be irreversible (paresis, a dysphasia) after surgery.</s><s>In this regard, it is the DCA index that could be a decisive predictive factor when choosing surgical treatment modality.</s><s>Another reason can be the presence of concomitant cardiovascular pathology (ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia), which determined moderate impairment of the patient's functional activity before and after the surgery.</s></p><p><s>It should be noted that the control group was somewhat younger than the group of patients with ICA stenosis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>At the same time, as it follows from Table 2, even in older patients from subgroup with unimpaired DCA on affected side, mean values of PS did not differ from the normal values of subjects from the control group.</s><s>In this regard, we believe that if the control group was adjusted according to age with a group of patients, it would not change the findings we obtained.</s><s>In addition, a similar difference of the age between the control group and the group of patients is found in other works <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Diehl et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hu et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Haubrich et al., 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As for the cases of high-grade ICA stenosis manifesting only with cognitive disorders, the choice of treatment strategy is conventionally based on additional prognostic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nicolaides et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Therein, some authors pay great attention to characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque, and first of all its embologenicity, while others emphasize the importance of cognitive disorders' severity, as well as the presence of co-morbidity risk factors and historic ischemic events in other vascular regions (contralateral carotid artery, vertebral arteries; <ref type="bibr"

al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>According to our results we suggest that the baseline state of DCA in this group of patients is equally important factor and in some cases it may play the key role in choice of treatment.</s><s>From this point of view, patients with impaired DCA are likely to have the highest risk of stroke, thus, they ought to be considered as the first candidates for surgery.</s></p><p><s>The last statement is certainly true for the patients with symptomatic severe ICA stenosis, since according to literature data a disturbance of cerebrovascular reserve is revealed in most cases of ipsilateral stroke.</s><s>Undoubtedly, they have to be subjected to the surgical treatment as soon as possible after onset of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Vandamme and Limet, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>It is noteworthy, that 4 out of 11 patients from the same cohort in our study had normal indices of DCA on admission and were characterized with mild neurological deficit after acute event and early regression of the symptoms (minor stroke) despite the severity of stenosis.</s><s>At the same time, other seven patients had persistent neurologic disorders after stroke and DCA on ipsilateral side was in poor condition prior to surgery.</s></p><p><s>The question remains open about atherosclerotic plaque's instability, which increases the risk of stroke due to microembolia.</s><s>But its identification often has some difficulties.</s><s>Besides, detection of microembolia based on TCD monitoring does not allow reliably to specify the source of these emboli and the etiology of the stroke <ref type="bibr">(atherotrombotic, cardioembolic, etc.)</ref>.</s><s>This may complicate predicting stroke due to the plaque instability and determining treatment strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gupta et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, some data suggest that the use of optimal medical therapy reduces the verified microemboli on TCD from 12.6 to 3.7% <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nicolaides et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gupta et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Patients with asymptomatic clinical course or microembolia that are not related to carotid stenosis therefore require conservative rather than surgical treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Spence et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, a majority of patients had stable homo-, hyperechogenic plaques of type I-II by the Gray-Weale scale (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Apparently, that is why we did not find any significant differences of PS in both clinical groups of ICA stenosis in dependence with plaque type.</s><s>It may be assumed that DCA in patients with unstable heterogeneous plaque (type III-IV) will be impaired to a greater degree, since in addition to hemodynamic factors (decrease of perfusion pressure distal to ICA stenosis), the role of thrombembolic factors in stroke development significantly increases.</s><s>But this assumption does not contradict our conclusions, as patients with symptomatic stenosis and disturbed DCA are considered by us as the first candidates for surgical intervention.</s><s>The study of this hypothesis is undoubtedly of scientific and practical interest, and is the subject of a separate research study.</s></p><p><s>We did not also find reliable differences of PS and clinical type of disease with respect to gender, comorbid factors, type of surgical intervention, initial functional state of patients in accordance with the mRs.</s><s>Talking about the functional state, it should be added that patients with symptomatic stenosis were examined and operated in the early recovery period −81 ± 51 (M ± m) after stroke onset.</s><s>In this regard, the functional state of these patients in a majority of cases was satisfactory in (1.2 ± 0.8 mRs) at the time of admission for surgical treatment.</s><s>Moreover, in some cases it did not differ from the functional state of the patients with asymptomatic ICA stenosis.</s><s>Petersen et al. demonstrated the restoration of impaired DCA within 1 week after large-vessel acute ischemic stroke in middle cerebral artery territory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Petersen et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The study included 28 patients (NIHSS −12 ± 6.5), among which in nine cases the etiology of stroke was large-vessel atherosclerosis (ICA stenosis), but the percentage of ICA narrowing was &lt;70%.</s><s>Our data show that even in 11 patients with critical symptomatic ICA stenosis DCA can also be restored to normal values, but month later after onset.</s><s>Also noteworthy that severity of stroke (NIHSS −5.7 ± 2.7) was quite lower than in Petersen study and only in four cases we found normal values of DCA on affected side at the time of admission.</s><s>No doubt, further larger prospective study is needed to analyze the changes in DCA depending on the severity of stroke and its etiology, as well as the functional ability of the patients with high-grade ICA stenosis at different periods of the stroke.</s></p><p><s>The absence of reliable differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic groups with respect to the variables mentioned above allows us to conclude that the functional outcome and clinical type of ICA stenosis is mainly determined by compensatory capacity of collateral circulation.</s><s>Its effective functioning can able to provide adequate cerebral perfusion pressure in the compromised vascular region, despite significant reduction of arterial pressure distal to precerebral artery stenosis and prevent ischemia.</s><s>In such cases, one can speak of asymptomatic cerebral hemodynamic model, which is often found in ICA thrombosis due to various etiologies.</s><s>Moreover, such a high degree of collateralization of cerebral circulation allows in a number of cases to safely perform deconstructive interventions for giant ICA aneurysms, carotid cavernous fistula, resections of basal tumors incorporating ICA, without the necessity to use extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lawton and Spetzler,

communicating arteries, cortical-cortical, naso-orbital, and other anastomoses.</s><s>But its assessment would be inadequate without measuring the velocity characteristics of cerebral blood flow and evaluating DCA.</s><s>Thus, in our study, discussing the results of DCA assessment based on TCD, we certainly estimate the degree of collateral circulation compensation.</s><s>And, proceeding from the received data, regardless of clinical type of stenosis, we distinguish two subgroups of patients with undisturbed and disturbed DCA, which, respectively, characterizes at least two types of functional state of collateral circulation: compensated and decompensated.</s><s>It should be added that Reinhard et al. have recently studied interrelation between DCA and anatomical types of collateral circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Reinhard et al., 2003a)</ref>.</s><s>But the issue of choosing treatment modality depending on the state of DCA, and hence, collateral circulation capacity has not been discussed so far.</s><s>This is the main problem raised in the present study.</s></p><p><s>There are several limitations that should be mentioned in interpreting these results.</s><s>First of all, the sample size of the patients is relatively small, particular for symptomatic ICA stenosis.</s><s>However, similarity of the clinical groups according to inclusion criteria presented in our study allows us to be sure in reliability of the obtained results and provides a rationale for further studies to address this question finally on a more representative
