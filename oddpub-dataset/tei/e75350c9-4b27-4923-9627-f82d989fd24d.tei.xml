order to clarify these uncertainties and answer new research questions for a better understanding of PLD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> Previously, only one small cohort study surveying 19 ADPLD and 34 ADPKD patients, explored differences in PLD between the two diseases.</s><s>This study focused on symptoms, complications and treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Its main finding was that the proportion of patients &gt;15 liver cysts is higher in ADPLD population.</s><s>This is in contrast with our study, where the proportion of patients with less than 20 cysts (Qian grade 2) is higher in ADPLD.</s><s>These conflicting results may be subject to differences in patient selection and differences in counselling of ADPKD or ADPLD patients.</s><s>Comparing symptoms between ADPKD and ADPLD shows the burden of underlying disease; however, it does not give a clear picture of PLD severity as patients with ADPKD might also suffer from enlarged kidneys leading to pressure-related symptoms.</s><s>Our study provides to a more reliable comparison in PLD severity as our endpoint hTLV is focused on PLD only.</s></p><p><s>An important finding is that in female patients, liver volume is 6.9% smaller per decade of age.</s><s>This contrasts with a recent study that suggested that hTLV increased with 10.0% per decade in female APDKD patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>These conflicting conclusions can be attributed to differences in disease populations.</s><s>Our study is enriched with both ADPKD and ADPLD patients and covers a broad range of disease severity, whereas the study by Chebib studied mild ADPKD patients with index CT made at an earlier age.</s><s>We hypothesize that age is associated with hTLV, though

in this cohort corresponds with the mean age at natural menopause based on literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> suggesting that these finding and the differences with males may be explained by female hormonal status.</s><s>In a controlled trial with 19 post-menopausal patients, exogenous use of oestrogen led to enlargement of the liver (+9%) whereas liver size decreased in the control group (−2%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>The association between oestrogen use and liver growth has not been confirmed in two recent cohort studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> possibly because of dose reduction in oestrogen in oral contraceptives in the last decades. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Following the oestrogen hypothesis, liver volume would increase until the menopause and stabilize/decrease thereafter as oestrogen levels drop.</s></p><p><s>As this cross-sectional study provides no individual data on natural growth, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis and to elucidate the association between oestrogen levels, menopause and liver growth.</s></p><p><s>The difference between older and younger females is only significant in ADPKD patients, possibly because of a lack of power in the ADPLD group.</s><s>One could also speculate that the effect of oestrogen on cyst proliferation is different in ADPKD than in ADPLD.</s><s>A previous study showed that oestrogens stimulate the proliferation of liver cyst derived epithelium by acting on specific oestrogen receptors in ADPKD patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>This interaction between oestrogens and other growth factors is presumed to play a key role in the PLD phenotype and its natural course in ADPKD.</s></p><p><s>A strength of our study is that we took hTLV as outcome to compare ADPKD and ADPLD.</s><s>The size of the liver correlates with disease severity as patients with moderate to severe hepatomegaly have a 5-fold higher risk of pressure-related complications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Quality of life decreases with severity of hepatomegaly, particularly in patients with hTLV ≥1600 mL/m. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>Therefore, hTLV serves as a reliable surrogate marker for PLD severity.</s></p><p><s>Another strength is that we draw conclusions in a homogenous cohort from tertiary centres.</s><s>In our population, the proportion of patients who are symptomatic (Qian Grade 4) is equal between ADPKD and ADPLD, even as the distribution between mild, moderate and severe disease which supports the homogeneous composition of this cohort.</s><s>Compared with other ADPKD cohorts in which the appearance of PLD is no inclusion criteria, the proportion of females in our ADPKD population is higher. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>This corresponds with the results of our study and previous literature as females are more at risk to develop severe hepatomegaly and therefore are more often tertiary referred because of symptomatic PLD compared with males.</s></p><p><s>This study comes with limitations.</s><s>Only 49% of all patients in the registry could be included because they met the inclusion criteria of the present analyses.</s><s>Excluded patients did not differ in gender and height compared with the included population (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>The proportion of ADPLD was lower in the included group (33.1%) compared with patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria (41.9%,</s><s>P = 0.015) which suggest that radiological imaging (CT or MRI) is less performed in ADPLD.</s><s>In the non-selected population, the proportion of ADPLD in Qian Grade 2 is 79.1% whereas the proportion in symptomatic patients (Grade 4) is higher in APDKD (58.5%).</s><s>Furthermore, we hypothesize that in mild ADPLD patients (hTLV &lt;1600 mL/m), ultrasound is sufficient for diagnosis and further imaging is waived.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, we hypothesize that if hTLV would have been available</s></p><p><s>for these patients, it probably would have further bolstered our findings that hTLV in ADPKD is larger.</s><s>On the contrary, it is possible that mild ADPKD patients are managed by their nephrologist instead of referred to a tertiary centre which might lead to overestimation of liver volume in ADPKD.</s><s>The main reason for imaging was unavailable for the majority of patients (57%).</s><s>In most cases, imaging was performed because of abdominal symptoms related to PLD, familial screening or incidental finding as imaging was performed for other purposes.</s><s>Another limitation is that we were not able to analyze the role of exogenous oestrogen use and parity because of significant amount of missing data, and
