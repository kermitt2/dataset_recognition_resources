associations were likely to be spurious since both SNPs are in repeat regions and have no evidence of being regulatory variants in B-cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>here are several limitations of this study.</s><s>First, sulfasalazineinduced agranulocytosis is a rare event, and it is difficult to identify a large enough number of cases.</s><s>For the present study, cases were collected over a period of 20 years, which resulted in a total of 76 cases.</s><s>Second, HLA sequencing could not be performed in the discovery phase since we did not have access to DNA from the controls.</s><s>In the replication phase all cases and controls were HLA-sequenced, thus making the results more reliable.</s><s>Third, several polymorphisms in the HLA loci are known to confer genetic susceptibility to inflammatory arthritis or bowel disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>ue to the small sample size we did not stratify by disease; however, the distribution of diseases was similar among cases and matched controls.</s><s>We therefore believe that there was no confounding by indication.</s><s>Fourth, the most frequent disease in our cohort, rheumatoid arthritis, is strongly associated with a subgroup of HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, and to a lesser extent seronegative rheumatoid arthritis is associated with HLA-B*08. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>We did not discriminate between seropositive and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, and could not test whether serotype influenced the detected association with

traits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>There are several reasons.</s><s>First, genetic variants associated with drug-related phenotypes usually have larger effect sizes than those associated with complex disease risk.</s><s>Second, pharmacogenomic variants tend to have higher allele frequencies than variants associated with complex traits.</s><s>This is possibly due to the fact that complex traits have been subject to negative selection over the course of human evolution, while pharmacogenomic variants only are deleterious in the presence of a certain drug, and drug treatment is a relatively new intervention.</s><s>Third, pharmacogenomic variants are more likely to be actionable, since it is easier to select an alternative drug than to modify risk factors for complex disease, such as lifestyle.</s><s>Fourth, it has been predicted that before long patients will have their pharmacogenome readily available in their medical records, thus removing the necessity to order the test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s>n conclusion, we have confirmed that sulfasalazine-induced agranulocytosis is associated with HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-A*31:01 in Europeans.</s><s>The association was stronger for the HLA-DQB1*02:01-DRB1*03:01-B*08:01-C*07:01 haplotype than for HLA-B*08:01 alone, but the NNG did not change when using the full haplotype.</s><s>Whether to use genetics in translational medicine to adapt drug treatment depends on the severity of the expected adverse drug reaction (ADR) and the existence of other treatment options. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>We believe that the drug sulfasalazine fulfils these criteria, although the high NNG makes testing challenging.</s><s>The solution could be to include HLA-B*08:01 and HLA-A*31:01 into preemptive screening programs, where multiple tests are performed at a low cost.</s><s>Known carriers of HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-A*31:01 starting sulfasalazine
