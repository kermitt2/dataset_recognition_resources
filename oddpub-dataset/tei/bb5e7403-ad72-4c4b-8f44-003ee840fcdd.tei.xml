target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Imagine driving your car on a rainy day and reading a street sign to decide whether to turn left or right.</s><s>Since the "sensory evidence" you are trying to interpret is noisy (i.e., it fluctuates randomly), you can improve your judgment by integrating evidence over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The timescale of this integration process is a key psychophysical parameter quantifying perceptual decision-making as it reflects the network mechanisms underlying the accumulation of sensory information in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>While many studies of non-sensory (top-down) effects in perceptual decision-making have focused on strategic adjustments of the decision threshold that terminates the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Only two of these studies were conducted in human observers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> whose integration mechanisms may differ from those of other species <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we examined the effect of one important top-down factor that has not been previously examined: knowledge of sensory-motor contingencies.</s></p><p><s>In the above example, the integrated evidence is continuously mapped onto a plan to select and execute a motor movement.</s><s>The same holds for most previous neurophysiological laboratory studies of perceptual decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Under such conditions, build-up signatures of evidence integration are found in brain regions involved in action planning.</s><s>In particular, when perceptual choices are reported as saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> or hand movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> choice-specific activity ramps up in the corresponding (pre-)motor brain regions.</s><s>These premotor build-up signatures are not evident if the sensory-motor contingencies are broken up by instructing the mapping between perceptual choice and motor response only after stimulus presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, or by eliminating the motor response altogether (in a covert counting task) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>This raises the question whether knowledge about sensory-motor contingencies might also improve (i.e., prolong) integration timescales observed behaviorally.</s><s>Further, it has been shown that learning of fixed sensory-motor contingencies (over hundreds of trials or more) improves the selectivity of the read-out of sensory information by the association cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>But it remains unknown whether such learning also improves the integration timescale.</s></p><p><s>We addressed these questions in six human observers performing the same motion discrimination task under three different sensory-motor mapping conditions.</s><s>In one experiment, the mapping between decision outcome and motor response varied on a trial-by-trial basis.</s><s>In different conditions, this mapping was instructed before or after stimulus presentation.</s><s>While the first condition allowed the integration of evidence directly towards action plans, the second did not.</s><s>We found that integration timescales were generally shorter than the maximum stimulus duration, and thus shorter than the timescale required to maximize the fraction of correct choices in the task.</s><s>But integration timescales were indistinguishable between conditions.</s><s>We then reasoned that sensory-motor mapping might only improve integration timescales if fixed over many trials, due to a slow learning process.</s><s>Thus, we asked the same observers to perform the task under fixed mapping in another experiment.</s><s>Again, despite extensive practice, integration timescales were indistinguishable from the other two conditions.</s><s>We conclude that the integration of perceptual evidence does not depend on sensory-motor contingencies.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task and procedure</head><p><s>Throughout all experimental conditions, subjects were required to fixate the red cross in the center of the screen and classify the net motion in a stimulus as upward (50% of trials) or downward motion by pressing one of two buttons (left or the right index finger) when a response prompt was provided.</s><s>The RDK presentation was followed by a variable delay interval, after which the response was prompted.</s><s>Observers were under no time pressure to respond.</s><s>Auditory feedback of 100 ms duration (a 1000 Hz tone) was provided for incorrect responses.</s></p><p><s>Variable DR-mapping experiment.</s><s>The decision-response mapping (e.g., left-hand button press for indicating "upward" choice) varied randomly from trial to trial.</s><s>We will henceforth abbreviate this as "DR-mapping".</s><s>The experiment consisted of two conditions, which differed only in the timing of the cue instructing observers about the DR-mapping, relative to presentation of the RDK stimuli (Fig 1A <ref type="figure">and 1B</ref>).</s><s>The cue indicated the motion direction corresponding to each response button in terms of two white arrows (one upward, one downward pointing) presented on the left and right half of the screen (11°from fixation).</s></p><p><s>In the pre-cueing ("Pre") condition (Fig 1A <ref type="figure">)</ref>, the arrows were presented after a variable period of fixation for 1000 ms, and were followed by a second random delay (200-400 ms) and the onset of the motion stimulus (150-4800 ms).</s><s>After stimulus offset and another random delay (200-400 ms) the fixation cross turned green, which prompted the subject to report their choice.</s></p><p><s>The post-cueing ("Post") condition was identical, except that DR-mapping cue was presented after the motion stimulus and second delay (Fig <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</s><s>In both conditions, the inter-trial intervals were 900 ms.</s><s>"Pre"and "Post"-conditions were conducted in alternating blocks of 144 trials (see General design below).</s></p><p><s>Fixed DR-mapping experiment.</s><s>This experiment consisted of a single condition, which was identical to the "Pre"-condition, with the exception that the DR-mapping was kept constant across all trials (Fig <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>Although the DR-mapping was instructed at the start of the experiment and remained constant thereafter, the DR-cue was shown at the beginning of each trial to keep the visual input and trial duration identical to the "Pre"from the variable DRmapping experiment.</s><s>Each subject was first trained on the task for a minimum of 432 trials and then completed between 2448 and 7632 trials (distributed over 3-9 experimental sessions), which were used for the analyses reported in this paper.</s></p><p><s>General design.</s><s>All statistical analyses reported in this paper were performed within individual observers.</s><s>Given the large number of trials required from each observer per condition (minimum: 2016) and the clear effect evident in Subjects 1-3 who participated in all conditions (see Results), the remaining three observers were asked to only participate in a subset of conditions.</s><s>Subjects 4 and 5 were used to replicate the comparison between "Pre" and "Post".</s><s>Subject 6 was used to replicate the comparison between the variable and "Fixed" mappings.</s></p><p><s>The experimental conditions were arranged as follows.</s><s>Subjects 1-5 first performed the Variable DR-mapping experiment, in which they alternated between "Pre" and "Post" conditions in a pseudorandom order.</s><s>Each experimental session consisted of 6 blocks: 3 blocks of each condition ("Pre" and "Post").</s><s>Subjects 1-3 then performed the Fixed DR-mapping experiment.</s><s>General order effects would have (if anything) predicted an improvement (prolongation) of integration timescales in the "Fixed" condition, due to the extensive practice of the task (under variable and fixed mapping).</s><s>By contrast, we found no change of integration timescale in these subjects.</s><s>Nonetheless, to rule out any order effects, we flipped the order in one additional observer (subject 6), who started with "Fixed", followed by "Post".</s><s>Each subject was first trained on the task for a minimum of 432 trials per condition.</s><s>Subjects then completed between 2110 and 5760 trials of each condition (distributed over 3-7 experimental sessions in total).</s></p></div>
