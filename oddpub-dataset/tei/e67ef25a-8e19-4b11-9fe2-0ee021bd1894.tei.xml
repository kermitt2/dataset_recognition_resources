<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The rapid improvements observed over the first 24 weeks of the RAPID-axSpA trial in clinical measures of efficacy and patient-reported outcomes were maintained in both CZP dosing regimens and in both AS and nonradiographic axial SpA patients throughout the dose-blind treatment period (in which patients and investigators were blinded with regard to CZP dosing regimen to week 48) and the open-label extension period (week 48 to week 96).</s><s>Indeed, for some outcome measures, slight improvements were observed between week 24 and week 96.</s></p><p><s>RAPID-axSpA is the first study to investigate the efficacy of an anti-TNF agent in the broad population of patients with axial SpA, including both those with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA.</s><s>Baseline disease activity, as measured by BASDAI and ASDAS, was similar in the AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations.</s><s>The similarities between these subpopulations in terms of disease characteristics and burden <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">25)</ref> underline the need for more treatment options to be available across the broader population of patients with axial SpA.</s><s>The similarity in improvements observed across both patients with AS and those with nonradiographic axial SpA indicates that CZP is efficacious for the treatment of patients with axial SpA with objective signs of inflammation, independently of whether the patient has sufficient structural damage in the SI joints to meet the modified New York classification criteria for AS.</s></p><p><s>RAPID-axSpA is also the first study to report long-term efficacy data for patients with axial SpA, who were required to have CRP levels and/or evidence on MRI indicative of SpA for inclusion in the trial; these characteristics have been associated with a good response to anti-TNF treatment.</s><s>The maintenance of response seen with continued CZP treatment to week 96 confirms its long-term efficacy in axial SpA patients with objective signs of inflammation.</s><s>Additionally, the similar long-term reduction in disease activity for both CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks and CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks is important, since this may offer the treating physician more freedom to switch between the dosing regimens.</s><s>The ASAS20 scores observed over the first 96 weeks of the RAPID-axSpA trial were comparable to those observed over a similar time period with adalimumab treatment of patients with nonradiographic axial SpA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(26)</ref> and with etanercept <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>, adalimumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>, infliximab <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>, and golimumab (9) treatment of AS patients.</s><s>However, care must be taken when interpreting intertrial comparisons, since different studies use different patient populations, trial designs, and data analysis methods.</s><s>Here we reported ASAS20 response rates conservatively using NRI as well as observed data, according to recommendations for reporting long-term results <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(27)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with previous reports of CZP in axial SpA <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, AEs were predominantly mild to moderate in nature, with 9.8% of AEs considered to be severe and with a serious AE event rate of 10.9/100 patient-years.</s><s>There were no malignancies or deaths observed over the 96-week trial period and no new safety signals identified compared with previous reports of CZP.</s></p><p><s>The presence of anti-CZP antibodies was low in this trial, with only 9 of 215 patients testing positive at week 96 (4.2%).</s><s>Due to the low numbers of anti-CZPpositive patients, an investigation into the impact of antibody levels on treatment efficacy was not carried out.</s></p><p><s>This study has a number of limitations, including the lack of a placebo arm beyond week 24, and limitations inherent to the unblinded nature of the open-label study period.</s><s>Furthermore, no radiographic data are presented here, precluding any analysis of disease progression from nonradiographic axial SpA to AS.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the rapid improvements in clinical outcomes observed in axial SpA patients treated with CZP over 24 weeks were maintained through the doseblind phase to week 48 and the open-label extension to week 96 in both the AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations.</s><s>This maintenance of efficacy was observed when CZP was administered as either 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks.</s><s>The safety profile of CZP in patients with axial SpA over a period of 96 weeks was comparable with that reported over shorter time periods and in other indications, with no new previously unreported safety signals occurring over the 96-week trial period.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>A, RAPID-axSpA trial design: certolizumab pegol (CZP) in active axial spondyloarthritis.</s><s>B, Patient disposition in the RAPID-axSpA trial to week 96.</s><s>* All patients received allocated treatment.</s><s>† One patient did not enroll in the dose-blind trial period.</s><s>Values are the number (%) of patients.</s><s>Q2W ϭ every 2 weeks;
