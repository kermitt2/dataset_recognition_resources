<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In our prospective PRESENT cohort, pain response rates were 61% in the total treated population and 67% in the assessable patients.</s><s>Given the median time to response, it is important to inform patients that pain response may still occur after 4 weeks.</s><s>In line with the literature, pain response for patients with spinal metastases was comparable to pain response in the entire cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, and the best responders were patients with metastases from breast or prostate cancer and patients in good physical condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As long course radiotherapy is, in our department, reserved for patients in a (relatively) good physical condition, it was not surprising that significantly more patients experienced pain relief after long course radiotherapy.</s><s>Retreatment rates our cohort were similar between a single dose and long course radiotherapy.</s><s>This is, however, not in line with randomized trials, as in the Cochrane analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> retreatment rates were consequently higher after single fraction radiotherapy.</s><s>Additionally, in the Dutch Bone Metastases study, time to retreatment was also shorter with a mean time to retreatment of 13 weeks after single fraction and 21 weeks after multiple fractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Irrespective of response to initial treatment, physicians are more willing to retreat after a single fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Our retreatment rates, therefore, also reflect the selection of patients in (relatively) good physical condition when making a choice for the dose schedule.</s></p><p><s>The pattern of pain response in this unselected cohort of patients with bone metastases is comparable with response rates reported in randomized trials over the past decades.</s><s>The pooled estimate of the response rates from 29 randomized controlled trials is approximately 60% <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Of these randomized controlled trials-including at least 100 patients-just two randomized trials adhered to the international consensus guidelines for reporting outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref>.</s><s>Pain response rates from these trials were slightly higher compared to pain response in the PRESENT cohort.</s><s>Looking at the intention-to-treat population in the Dutch Bone Metastases Study, an overall response rate of 68-69% in more than 1100 patients was found <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Foro Arnalot et al. found response rates of 76-87% in a study population of 160 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In this trial, patients with more than one painful site, and patients with spinal cord compression were excluded, as were patients who received prior radiotherapy or patients in an overall poor state of health.</s><s>Potentially, these patients have more often progressive disease and are therefore less likely to respond to radiotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>This patient category is included in the PRESENT cohort, which may help explain the somewhat lower response rate in the current study.</s><s>Another factor that could have contributed to some extent to the lower rate is the introduction of stereotactic radiotherapy in our department in November 2014.</s><s>Patients eligible for stereotactic radiotherapy are recruited in the PRESENT cohort but were excluded from the current analysis.</s><s>Almost 80% of the patients in our department who underwent stereotactic radiotherapy had oligometastatic disease, and more than 80% had a WHO performance status of 0 or 1.</s><s>In contrast, only 53% of the patients in the cohort under study had a good performance status.</s><s>As stereotactically treated patients represent a healthier subgroup, their expected response rates are higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Hypothetically, adding these patients to this analysis, assuming these patients would all respond to radiotherapy, the response rate would have been near 70%.</s></p><p><s>The Dutch Bone Metastases Study is considered a landmark project since it is one of the largest studies assessing the response of patients with painful bone metastases after palliative radiotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, patients who needed treatment of more than one lesion were excluded, as were patients who were irradiated previously and had spinal cord compression, metastases in the cervical spine, or metastases from malignant melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.</s><s>Patients with these characteristics were included in the PRESENT cohort and may explain the somewhat lower response rates.</s><s>Furthermore, up to 3 months, pain response of the patients in the Dutch Bone Metastases Study was measured every week.</s><s>Patients in the PRESENT cohort are asked to fill out questionnaires every other week, thereby increasing the chance of not recording a perceived pain response.</s></p><p><s>For PRESENT, we systematically approach all patients with bone metastases inviting them to participate.</s><s>Patients are followed prospectively with extensive measures including patient-reported outcomes and clinical data for a long(er) period of time.</s><s>Lost-to-follow-up rates are very low in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Pain scores during the first 12 weeks after treatment for all patients, patients with spinal metastases, patients with breast or prostate cancer, and patients in good clinical condition (i.e., WHO score 0-1).</s><s>Pain was scored on a 11-point pain scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain).</s><s>The numbers below the graph indicate the number of patients that provided pain scores at specific time points PRESENT (10%) compared to cohorts from other hospitals (19-78%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Response rates palliative radiotherapy bone metastases very much depend on how the outcome is reported, with substantial differences between response rates based on the total treated population and those calculated in assessable patients.</s><s>In addition, the follow-up period in which response is measured is of major influence with a difference in response rate of 10% between shorter and longer follow-up periods.</s><s>Due to the natural course of the disease, lost-to-follow-up is very common in this study population.</s><s>Patients are often admitted to the hospital or deteriorate at home, the result of which hampers the return of questionnaires leading to missing data.</s><s>These missing outcomes are not likely missing at random, and simply removing patients who are lost to follow-up will most likely overestimate the proportion of patients who experienced a pain response.</s><s>Accordingly, researchers should report both the response rates of their total treated population and the results of assessable patients to show the effects of this potential bias.</s></p><p><s>In 2012, the international consensus guideline was updated to include the NPR in addition to other assessments of pain response.</s><s>In the PRESENT cohort, the NPR is 64% indicating that responsive patients spent around two third of their remaining life with less pain and without the need for retreatment.</s><s>Probably, this is an underestimation as there are PRESENT patients who are still alive without reported pain recurrence.</s><s>It is important to realize that in the last weeks before death, pain intensifies in patients with bone metastases, which has a negative impact on quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Although the use of the NPR is recommended for several years now, this measure is rarely reported.</s><s>Only the group of Foro et al. reported the NPR, which was slightly higher compared to the NPR we have found (68-71%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In the DBMS, NPR was 70% (data not published).</s><s>As the NPR includes the period of pain relief, one might argue that this outcome measure is more relevant to patients than the binary statement of response.</s><s>Indeed, patients with a short period of relief do count as responders but contribute little time to the (numerator of the) NPR making this more relevant to patients.</s></p><p><s>Follow-up in our cohort included data on pain scores and analgesic use, allowing us to report our outcomes according to the international consensus guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, the recommendation is to only account for opioid use when calculating response rates.</s><s>In our cohort, we found that more than 30% of patients used corticosteroids during radiotherapy treatment.</s><s>Corticosteroids could also have a beneficial effect on relieving pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, patients also use tricyclic antidepressants or antiepileptic drugs for neuropathic pain.</s><s>When calculating response rates, changes in the use of corticosteroids, tricyclic antidepressants, or antiepileptic drugs were not taken into account.</s><s>In line with the consensus guidelines, patients with 25% decreased opioid use were counted as responders in our analyses.</s><s>It is possible that patients using corticosteroids or neuropathic pain medication also had reduced intake of these analgesics as result of response after radiotherapy but were not regarded as responders.</s></p><p><s>We acknowledge that this study has some limitations.</s><s>As radiotherapy is a local treatment, ideally, the response just to the index lesion is measured.</s><s>However, it is difficult for patients with multiple lesions to distinguish between painful lesions at relatively small distances and give separate pain scores.</s><s>As we asked patients to indicate their worst pain score, it might be that radiotherapy was successful for one lesion, but not for another.</s><s>In fact, treatment to the index lesion might have unmasked other lesions appearing more symptomatic.</s><s>Furthermore, taking analgesic use into account when calculating response is challenging because often other metastatic lesions become (more) symptomatic after the response of the irradiated metastases.</s><s>In the PRESENT cohort, we enroll all patients with bone metastases, including those patients with multiple painful lesions, possibly lowering the pain response rate.</s><s>However, the majority of the PRESENT patients (80%) had bone metastases treatable in one target volume.</s><s>Another limitation might be our time frame of response since we calculated response up to 3 months after radiotherapy.</s><s>It might be that patients who did not experience pain relief from radiotherapy started with systemic anticancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or even radiopharmaceuticals.</s><s>It might be that these systemic treatments induced a pain response which was (mistakenly) attributed to radiotherapy and pain response might thus be overestimated.</s><s>However, as some patients might experience a response even after 12 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, we decided to include all responses up to 12 weeks.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In our cohort, the majority of patients with painful bone metastases treated with palliative radiotherapy experienced pain relief.</s><s>However, a large proportion of patients did not respond to radiotherapy.</s><s>New interventions or combination of conventional treatments including radiotherapy, surgery, and systemic treatments for patients with symptomatic bone metastases should aim at improving pain relief.</s><s>Before implementation in routine clinical care, these interventions are all ideally evaluated in randomized trials.</s><s>The PRESENT cohort provides an infrastructure aiming at a more efficient evaluation of new (combinations of) treatments.</s><s>Furthermore, it is important to identify the non-responding patients as they might benefit more from early and proactive palliative care management.</s></p></div>
