<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Developing new cytostatic drugs with enhanced anticancer effectiveness but reduced side effects in non-cancerous tissues is still the central goal of cancer research.</s><s>One strategy to achieve this goal is to modulate the biodistribution of active drugs by reducing their accumulation in critical organ tissues sensitive to side effects while enhancing their uptake into malignant tumors.</s><s>This can be accomplished by enhancing the hydrophilic properties through coupling of polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the active agent in order to reduce the unspecific uptake by normal tissues, which additionally can increase the circulation time in blood and the interval between drug applications.</s><s>Furthermore, uptake of PEGylated substances into tumors is promoted by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) of tumors resulting from leaky tumor blood vessels and altered lymphatic vessels.</s><s>This so-called EPR effect facilitates the transport and retention of macromolecules (larger than 40 kDa) in tumor tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and has been reported to reduce side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>A clinical example is a PEGylated liposome-encapsulated form of doxorubicin (Doxil), which has lower cardiac toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>However, even though immunogenicity of PEGylated drugs is considered to be very low, repeated treatment can result in induction of antibodies against PEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, antibodies against PEG were found in 22-25% of healthy blood donors up from 0.2% two decades ago, which could be the consequence of increasing use of PEG in cosmetics, therapeutics, and processed food <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Another way to reduce side effects is to develop inactive prodrugs that are specifically activated in the tumor area.</s><s>The inclusion of cleavage sites of proteases that are highly expressed in tumors, e.g.</s><s>matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, provides an option for building activatable drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>For example, doxorubicin was coupled to a MMP 2/9-cleavable peptide resulting in a therapeutically inactive prodrug.</s><s>When injected, this prodrug could be activated by the increased MMP activity in the tumor, whereas the toxicity to other tissues, particularly the heart, was reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To achieve substantial tumor uptake of drugs that do not penetrate plasma membranes themselves, so-called cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, also known as protein transduction domains (PTDs), have been developed.</s><s>Such peptides, derived from proteins (penetratin, Tat peptide), as well as synthetic polyarginines have been shown to efficiently deliver biologically active molecules into the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to develop a fusion protein that combines the aforementioned features in a way that allows complete synthesis in E. coli.</s></p><p><s>The key to accomplishing this goal was to replace PEG by the unstructured hydrophilic polypeptide XTEN, which combines the desirable properties of PEG such as longer blood halflife and stabilization of proteins with several additional decisive advantages: it is biodegradable, less immunogenic than PEG, it has defined masses and does not need to be chemically coupled, but instead, can be expressed together with the effector protein and used as purification tag <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Besides prolonging the blood half-life of exenatide with XTEN, other examples are XTEN versions of glucagon <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and XTEN-annexin A5 developed by us for imaging apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>For finding an expressible cytostatic fusion protein and keeping the costs for DNA syntheses low we chose an XTEN variant of 288 amino acids.</s><s>When a suitable fusion protein variant is found the short XTEN can be exchanged with a longer XTEN for in vivo application, e.g.</s><s>864 amino acids for longer blood circulation times <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As the cytostatic (cell division stopping) and cytotoxic (apoptosis inducing) component, we chose a partial sequence of Killin (KLLN), which was recently discovered and is regulated by PTEN (phosphate and tensin homologue).</s><s>PTEN is a very well characterized tumor suppressor gene that is regulated by p53 and reduces the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) level, thus inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Mutations of this gene are associated in most cases with Cowden syndrome (CS) and hence with a high risk of developing breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Killin, which shares the transcription start site with PTEN, is regulated by the same promoter, but, surprisingly, is transcribed in opposite direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>It has been reported that Killin, as DNA-binding protein and tumor suppressor, is involved in S-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis of many cancer cell types and may be regulated by p53 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, according to Bennett et al. 2011, about 30% of CS patients without PTEN mutations had hypermethylation and downregulation of the Killin gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In prostate cancer, Killin was shown to decrease prostate-specific antigen levels and design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</s></p><p><s>Competing Interests: Apart from the fact that Volker Schellenberger, the inventor of the XTEN technology and the CEO of Amunix, is ES's cousin, the authors have no financial benefit or share of profits of Amunix.</s><s>na-noPET Pharma is the current employer of FA.</s><s>FA contributed to this manuscript during her PhD program when she was employed in our group at the Charité -University Medicine Berlin.</s><s>nano-PET Pharma did not support this project, was not involved, and has no rights to any of the results.</s><s>This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.</s><s>The German Research Foundation DFG provided financial for the salaries of FA and AH.</s><s>DFG did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</s><s>This does not alter the authors' adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.</s></p><p><s>suppress androgen-mediated cell growth by inhibiting androgen receptor (AR) transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Killin was suggested as an anticancer drug but expression as recombinant protein in E. coli and purification were considered to be virtually impossible <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus the recombinant therapeutic fusion protein included (1) Killin as cytostatic/cytotoxic component, (2) XTEN for long blood circulation time, deactivation of Killin and passive targeting of the tumor by exploiting the EPR effect, (3) an MMP2/9 cleavage site for specific activation in the tumor, and (4) a CPP to transfer Killin into the cells.</s><s>Deactivation was fundamentally important not only for function, but also for the expression in E. coli, since active Killin is too toxic for E. coli cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> to be produced in significant amounts.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The goal of the project was to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a cytostatic, activatable prodrug, including a macromolecule for long blood circulation, that can be completely produced in E. coli.</s><s>For that purpose we designed a fusion protein comprising a natural cytostatic/cytotoxic element, a protease-deactivation/activation feature, a cell-penetrating peptide, and XTEN for long circulation, tumor accumulation, and additional attenuation of CPP.</s></p><p><s>Two steps were crucial in designing this fusion protein: incorporation of the XTEN polypeptide as expressible variant of PEG and deactivation of Killin, which is otherwise difficult to express in E. coli.</s><s>Cho et al. have reported, that Killin expression (tagged with 6 histidines) in E. coli is very poor due to direct binding of the protein to the host DNA and inhibition of bacterial growth already within 30 min of induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, subsequent purification was almost impossible, since the His-tagged Killin appeared not to bind to Ni-NTA columns.</s><s>Here we could demonstrate,that fusion of Killin with the XTEN polypeptide together with a CPP and an MMP-2 cleavage site enables expression and purification of the recombinant construct as a prodrug in E. coli.</s></p><p><s>Thus our hypothesis (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) that the good shielding properties of XTEN <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> together with the CPP would at least partially shut off the cytotoxicity of Killin is supported by our results.</s><s>While the variant of XTEN-Killin carrying XTEN at the N-terminus was successfully expressed, there was no expression of two constructs with XTEN at the C-terminus, possibly because synthesized Killin fragments without protection by XTEN broke down during synthesis (data not shown, sequence given in Supplements).</s><s>Contrary to the reported difficulty in purifying XTEN with a His-tag <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the XTEN polypeptide synthesized here could be prepurified by a heat step, which already removed a large part of impurities by precipitation, followed by purification of XTEN-Killin with anion exchange chromatography using the high content of 17% glutamic acid of XTEN as purification tag.</s><s>Possible XTEN fragments from incomplete synthesis or partial degradation were removed by a hydrophobic interaction column (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>Of particular importance is the activation of XTEN-Killin by MMP-2 expressing tumor or tumor stromal cells.</s><s>Using protein gel electrophoresis, we confirmed the intact cleavage motive for MMP-2, which retained its function despite shielding by XTEN (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>).</s><s>As cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) for uptake of the Killin fragment into tumor cells we added a polyarginine chain in conjunction with a glutamic acid chain.</s><s>Activatable CPPs have been shown to be effective in enzyme-specific in vivo imaging of tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Indeed, fluorescent XTEN-Killin-6S-IDCC was rapidly taken up into endosomal structures of cells with high MMP-2 expression, while uptake into cells with low MMP-2 low expression was substantially delayed (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Unfortunately, very few cells showed good intranuclear enrichment and were apoptotic.</s><s>After repeating the experiments under various conditions, we reasoned that the poor effectiveness might be attributable to the 6 sulfonic acid groups of the 6S-IDCC dye (IC Discovery GmbH).</s><s>The negative charges of the dye that is coupled near the C-terminal end of the Killin and arginine chain possibly hinder binding of the activated Killin fragment to the DNA and also reduce the CPP effect of the arginines resulting in only moderate cell growth inhibition.</s><s>Therefore, we coupled a fluorescein to XTEN-Killin, which is smaller and has only one negative charge.</s><s>However, cells treated with XTEN-Killin-FITC construct have not shown any reduction of the growth rate either.</s></p><p><s>Ultimately, XTEN-Killin without coupled dye has demonstrated strong cell growth inhibition and massive apoptosis induction in a concentration-dependent manner 24-96 h after treatment, which is consistent with the results obtained by Cho et al. using a Killin peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, the cytostatic and cytotoxic function of the activated Killin fragment appears to be highly susceptible to modifications at C-terminus, which likely affect binding to its DNA binding site.</s></p><p><s>Recently, studies analyzing neoplastic tissues of patients with prostate cancer emphasized the importance of nuclear Killin expression for reduced tumor progression and disease outcome.</s><s>In addition, Killin, acting as a tumor suppressor, is down-regulated in various malignant breast carcinomas, especially in late stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, alterations in Killin genome, especially through methylation, are associated with endometrial, thyroid, and breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Killin is a known p53 downstream target gene, inducing S-phase cell cycle arrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, the pathway of Killin-induced apoptosis seems to be independent of p53: although overexpression of Killin leads to elevated levels of p53 and p73, cell cycle arrest occurs before, and p53-negative cells also undergo S-phase arrest and apoptosis after Killin overexpression <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, we believe that Killin has strong potential to be used for the design of cytostatic agents.</s><s>Our results with the XTEN-fused Killin fragment presented in this study, which bears a cell-penetrating peptide and enzyme-specific cleavage site, is able to arrest cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis in vitro, while normal liver cells and cells without MMP-2 expression are almost unaffected.</s><s>Further investigations are required to evaluate XTEN-Killin in vivo.</s><s>Aspects that should be optimized are the coupling strategy of dyes or nuclear labels for in vivo tracking and in histology.</s><s>Furthermore, the optimal XTEN length for expression yield and cancer treatment, which is likely a longer variant, e.g., of 864 amino acids, needs to be investigated in terms of kinetics, biodistribution, and accumulation in tumors.</s></p></div>
