<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Cardiovascular complications are common in kidney transplant patients and calcification propensity of blood, measured as T 50 , is associated with cardiovascular outcomes.</s><s>Paricalcitol supplementation affects calcium/ phosphate homeostasis and may affect calcification propensity.</s><s>To assess this hypothesis we measured T 50 in kidney transplant recipients participating in a randomized study comparing paricalcitol versus no treatment during the first year after kidney transplantation.</s><s>Methods: Stored serum samples from 76 kidney transplant recipients (paricalcitol n = 37, no treatment n = 39) were analyzed.</s><s>Analyses were performed at inclusion (8 weeks after transplantation) and repeated one year after transplantation.</s><s>Results: There were no statistically significant differences in T 50 between the paricalcitol and placebo groups, neither at baseline (p = 0.56) nor at 1 year (p = 0.61).</s><s>Also, there were no significant changes in T 50 over time in either group or when pooling all data (p &lt; 0.20).</s><s>In multivariate regression analysis, out of 16 potentially relevant covariates, comprising clinical and biochemical parameters, only plasma PTH and T 50 at baseline were significantly correlated to T 50 after one year.</s><s>(p &lt; 0.03 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively).</s></p><p><s>Conclusions: Calcium propensity measured as T 50 score remained unchanged with paricalcitol treatment in kidney transplant recipients, and was not changed over time during the study period of one year.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We studied the potential effects of paricalcitol supplementation during the first year after kidney transplantation on calcification propensity score in his paper.</s><s>Available data show that treatment with paricalcitol did not significantly affect T 50 .</s><s>Calcification propensity measured as serum T 50 scores at baseline and after one year of treatment with paricalcitol in a RCT was analyzed in the present study.</s><s>The novel finding in the present analysis was that all analyses demonstrated that paricalcitol treatment during the first year after transplantation did not influence T 50 score.</s><s>In addition to this important but negative finding, our qualitative analysis shows a flat trend in the T 50 score, which is similar to earlier results reported for T 50 in kidney transplant recipients <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In another study, assessing the effect of ibandronate over time, T 50 scores increased substantially during the first few weeks after transplantation, but then remained unchanged over the first year regardless of treatment allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present original study, paricalcitol treatment was significant associated with a reduction in serum PTH <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>However, the reduction in plasma PTH in the treatment arm did not associate with a change in T 50 score.</s><s>On the contrary, plasma PTH at baseline was the only clinical covariate showing independent associations with T 50 score at one year.</s><s>This may indicate that elevated PTH early after transplantation reflects long standing effects associated with hyperparathyroidism that may be more important than changes following normalization of kidney function during the first posttransplant year.</s><s>There are several factors that influence T50 scores that are not account for in this post-hoc study.</s><s>Plasma magnesium and bicarbonate are significant contributors to factors influencing T 50 scores, unfortunately, these were not measured.</s><s>Magnesium levels are generally low in kidney transplant recipients, especially in the early phase after transplantation.</s><s>The bicarbonate concentration is first of all dependent on kidney function.</s><s>Plasma magnesium may normalize within the first year whereas bicarbonate usually remains within normal values as long as the kidney function remains stable.</s><s>We did not find any change in T 50 over the first year that could beexplained by variations in these parameters.</s><s>In any case there is no reason to believe that magnesium and bicarbonate concentrations would change differently with or without paricalcitol treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>The current investigation is a post-hoc analysis that was not predetermined, which is an obvious weakness and it should be interpreted accordingly.</s><s>Also the lack of effect of paricalcitol beyond lowering of PTH in the primary study may be considered a downside for effect studies on other parameters like T 50 .</s><s>However, the study was indeed a properly performed RCT.</s></p></div>
