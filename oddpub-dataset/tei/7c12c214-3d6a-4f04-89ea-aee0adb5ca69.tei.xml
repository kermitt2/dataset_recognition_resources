<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>▼</head><p><s>Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 completed gestational weeks, is the most important cause for perinatal mortality and morbidity.</s><s>Worldwide, approximately 15 million babies are born preterm, and 1 million children die each year due to preterm birth complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Due to advances in medicine, most newborns affected by preterm birth are more likely to survive nowadays.</s><s>However, up to 75 % of health issues that occur in childhood such as cerebral palsy, cognitive and speech delays, motor and visual deficits, and learning difficulties, are a result of preterm birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, preterm birth is a global problem not only for health care providers and affected families, but also for healthcare systems in general.</s></p><p><s>Women at risk for preterm birth are usually identified by their obstetrical history, demographic factors, or classic symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, as it allows the initiation of risk-specific treatment such as tocolysis or administration of antenatal corticosteroids.</s><s>For example, women that are extremely underweight or overweight are more likely to be at risk for preterm birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>However, maternal weight can be influenced by various factors such us low socioeconomic status or ethnicity, and is therefore not an independent variable.</s><s>In our study, women who delivered preterm had a significantly higher BMI compared to women that delivered at term.</s><s>Interestingly, women from the preterm group were found to be enrolled 3 weeks earlier than the term group.</s><s>Despite the introduction of several public health interventions such as promoting awareness of preterm birth and centralization of perinatal care, or medical interventions such as prophylactic intrapartum antibiotics, progesterone or cerclage, the preterm birth rate has not decreased significantly over the last decades.</s><s>In addition to the development of innovative interventions, the most favorable approach for reducing the global incidence of preterm birth lies in the introduction of perinatal care programs in low-income countries due to the high preterm birth rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The primary problem is the identification of women who actually deliver preterm.</s><s>This is attributed to a number of diagnostic dilemmas.</s><s>Preterm contractions are rather inaccurate in identifying women with threatened preterm labor.</s><s>In addition, a short cervix alone delivers vague results.</s><s>Approximately 70 % of women with a singleton gestation and a cervical length of 10 mm have been found to deliver their children at term <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The goal of our study was to examine a cohort of patients admitted to our department with signs of threatened preterm birth by Tab. 2 ROC curve from cervical length measurements, sonoelastography, and combined methods.</s><s>3 methods in order to assess potential combinations that may improve the identification of women at risk for preterm birth.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cervical</head><p><s>The value of cervical length measurements alone to predict preterm birth has been the focus of numerous studies.</s><s>However, a systematic Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend cervical length screening in both asymptomatic and symptomatic women <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>This highlights the need for additional tests.</s><s>Fetal fibronectin (fFN) is the most evaluated biochemical marker used to predict preterm delivery.</s></p><p><s>Women with a cervical length above 30 mm, or between 15 and 30 mm in combination with a negative fFN test, have been found to have a risk of less than 5 % for spontaneous preterm delivery within 7 days after testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, the cervical length was found to be significantly shorter in women affected by preterm birth than in term deliveries (17.8 mm vs. 22.0 mm, respectively).</s><s>The sensitivity and specificity to predict preterm birth were 70 % and 80 %, respectively.</s><s>Biochemical markers and cytokines for the prediction of preterm birth have been the subject of previous studies, given that the inflammatory response plays a major role in preterm birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>There have been contradictory results concerning IL-6 levels as an indicator of preterm birth.</s><s>IL-6 concentrations in cervicovaginal secretions have been observed to be significantly higher in women with preterm birth and in women with visible fetal membranes compared with women with a closed external os <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, high levels of IL-6 have been reported in cervicovaginal fluid which was found to have a reverse correlation with the cervical length <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, higher cytokine concentrations, such as IL-6, IL-1b and IL-8, were found in all study participants, including controls, in a study by Chandiramani and colleagues, who concluded that these cytokines play a minimal role in cervical shortening <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>The findings of our study are in accordance with these findings.</s><s>The AUC was 0.51 ± 0.1155.</s><s>No significant difference was observed between women that had a preterm delivery compared with women that delivered at term.</s><s>The uterine closure mechanism was evaluated in the standard way by digital palpation.</s><s>Nowadays, sonoelastography is used to visualize tissue stiffness and elasticity by superimposing a colorcoded image, which is similar to color Doppler imaging.</s><s>Cervical sonoelastography has been widely employed to evaluate cervical lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and preterm birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, or prior to the induction of labor <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, while some authors have reported advantageous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, others have found contradictory results <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Other authors even concluded that it is too early to use elastographic tissue displacement as a reflection of histological changes in cervical ripening <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This is mainly owed to physics such as the limited penetration depth of sonoelastography.</s><s>For instance, if there is amniotic fluid in the cervix -regardless of the cause, short cervix or funneling -the posterior lip cannot be evaluated.</s><s>Physically this is caused by the absence of compressibility in water, which leads to inhomogeneous pressure distribution.</s><s>Therefore, we chose to measure the tissue stiffness in the anterior cervical lip and internal os.</s><s>Our method was described in previous studies of our group <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>We investigated a moment not a time interval.</s><s>Therefore, intra-rater reliability is not available.</s><s>However, the inter-rater reliability was high (Alpha = 0.996).</s></p><p><s>In our cohort, sonoelastography performed comparably to cervical length measurement, with a sensitivity and specificity of 66.7 % and 82.4 %, respectively.</s><s>However, in combination with cervical length measurement, the sensitivity was found to be 0.9 with a specificity of 0.7.</s></p><p><s>In light of recent studies and the availability of other technologies that aid in detecting women at risk for preterm birth such as fetal fibronectin, we propose a step-wise diagnostic approach to evaluate both sonography and sonoelastography, in addition to biochemical aspects, in the identification of women at risk for preterm birth ( • ▶ Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>If a patient with signs of preterm birth is referred, cervical length measurement in combination with cervical sonoelastography should be performed.</s><s>In patients with "soft" cervices identified by sonoelastography, fFN should be carried out.</s><s>Following identification of a "soft" cervix and positive fFN results, the patient should be admitted to the hospital.</s></p><p><s>We recommend that all other cases be monitored with regular outpatient checkups.</s></p><p><s>By implementing these criteria, the rate of unnecessary hospital admission can be reduced with a consequent significant decrease in expenses.</s><s>Furthermore, exposure to potential side effects of tocolytic drugs, as well as corticosteroids, may possibly be reduced for low-risk patients.</s></p><p><s>Our study had several limitations.</s><s>First, the study was comprised of a relatively small number of participants.</s><s>Approximately 20 % of participants were excluded from further analysis.</s><s>Second, there was a selection bias in the cohort, and our clinic is a tertiary care referral center specialized in high-risk obstetrics and neonatology.</s><s>"Late preterms", born between 34 and 36 weeks + 6 days of gestation, account for approximately 80 % of all preterm births and 8 % of total births <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>This cohort is underrepresented in our study.</s><s>All of the enrolled patients were referred to our department prior to 30 gestational weeks.</s><s>This may be explained by the fact that several nearby hospitals accept pregnant Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Proposed clinical algorithm to identify women at a high risk for preterm birth using a step-wise approach.</s></p><p><s>Step I shows the conventional

preterm birth.</s></p><p><s>The results of our study are in accordance with our clinical experience and support our proposal of the implementation of a combination of markers for the identification of
