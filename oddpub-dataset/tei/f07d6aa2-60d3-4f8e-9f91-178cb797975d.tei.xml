transport of PK, which is carried through the liver by triacylglycerol-rich VLDL <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Because MK-7 highly accumulated in the liver and was more difficult to transport from the liver to peripheral tissues than PK (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), it may be less susceptible to interference by a-tocopherol.</s><s>Much of MK-4 in the tissues of PK-fed or MK-7-fed rats may be derived from MD synthesized probably in the intestine and transported to the tissues without passing through the liver, so the MK-4 concentration is likely to be less susceptible to a-tocopherol.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we found that MK-7 was more liable to accumulate in the liver than PK and MK-4, and was difficult to transport to the other tissues except for the spleen and adrenal gland.</s><s>In addition, a-tocopherol did not affect MK-7 or MK-4 concentrations in rats fed MK-7.</s><s>To clarify the details of MK-7 metabolism, further studies on the mechanisms of absorption of MK-7 in the intestine, secretion of MK-7 from the liver, and catabolism of MK-7 into metabolites in the liver are necessary.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>PK, MK-4, and MK-7 concentrations in serum and
