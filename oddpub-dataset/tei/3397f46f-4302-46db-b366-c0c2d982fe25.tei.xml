<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Actuation of biologic-free ferrogels resulted in mechanical compressions that affected the host inflammatory response toward the gel and led to a reduction in fibrous capsule thickness after 2 wk of implantation.</s><s>Strikingly, mechanical stimulation led to a significant reduction in fibrosis and inflammation of the injured muscle, demonstrating a potential immunomodulatory role for ferrogeldriven cyclic compressions.</s><s>As assessed histologically, severe muscle injury resulting from myotoxin injection and hind limb ischemia led to subsequent active muscle regeneration that was enhanced by stimulated biphasic ferrogels.</s><s>In addition, mechanical stimulation led to a temporary increase in oxygen concentration at the site of injury.</s><s>Biologic-free ferrogel and pressure cuff-driven mechanical compressions led to enhanced muscle regeneration and muscle function compared with no-treatment controls, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of these mechanical interventions.</s></p><p><s>Actuation of both the biphasic ferrogel and the pressure cuff results in uniform cyclic compressions of the severely injured muscle tissue.</s><s>The pressure cuff was roughly tuned so that the peak pressure values achieved by each system were comparable.</s><s>However, the peak pressure value achieved by the pressure cuff remained slightly larger than that achieved by the biphasic ferrogel because of limitations associated with control of the pressure cuff air valves.</s><s>The kinetics of the pressure profile also varied, as the rate at which the pressure cuff air valves opened and shut was not finely controlled with this system.</s><s>Nevertheless, both systems were able to apply a similar force (normalized to tibialis anterior wet weight) of ∼2 N/g, a value similar to that used previously for massage-like compressive loading of rabbit tibialis anterior muscles injured with eccentric exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>Although stimulation parameters were chosen to yield mechanical compressions that approximate those achieved with massage, future studies are needed to optimize the frequency, amplitude, and duration of the stimulations.</s></p><p><s>Biphasic ferrogel stimulation leads to a reduction in fibrous capsule thickness and inflammatory cells present in the surrounding muscle after 2 wk of implantation, and this may relate to expulsion of inflammatory cells as a result of cyclic compression of the ferrogels.</s><s>A key event leading to fibrous capsule formation is the adhesion of profibrotic macrophages, foreign body giant cells, and fibroblasts to the implant surface, as these cells secrete proteins that modulate fibrosis and increase collagen deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>.</s><s>Previous in vitro experiments have demonstrated significant fibroblast and myoblast cell expulsion from RGD peptide-containing ferrogels in vitro, even with stimulation patterns shorter and less frequent than used here <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that invading cells near the scaffold edges were expelled from the ferrogel system upon stimulation, because of fluid convection resulting from large gel deformations, leading to an overall diminished cell presence within the scaffold.</s><s>The decrease in M1 macrophage presence with ferrogel stimulation further suggests a potent immunomodulatory role for cyclic mechanical compressions.</s><s>These results are perhaps not surprising, as a beneficial role for massage-like compressive loading after exercise-induced muscle damage has recently been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, massage and massage mimics have been previously hypothesized to moderate the inflammatory response <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s><s>The beneficial effects of massage-like loading were found to be dose-dependent and more potent when administered immediately after injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, a role for massage therapy as a potent immunomodulator after exerciseinduced muscle damage in humans has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>A similar reduction in fibrosis and inflammation was demonstrated with pressure cuff controls, although the effect was not always significant.</s><s>Taken together, these studies provide evidence that ferrogel-driven cyclic compressions may be useful to alleviate inflammation in certain muscle injuries.</s><s>Further, this ability to inhibit fibrous capsule formation with cyclic compressions has potential utility for implantable drug delivery devices and sensors that require unobstructed diffusion around the implant for proper function.</s></p><p><s>Severe muscle injury resulting from myotoxin injection and hind limb ischemia leads to active muscle regeneration that can be enhanced with stimulated biphasic ferrogels.</s><s>Although centrally located nuclei were observed in all conditions, significant increases in the mean muscle fiber size of regenerating fibers over time were only observed in muscles treated with stimulated biphasic ferrogels.</s><s>Past reports suggest increased mean fiber diameter is indicative of tissues that have progressed further in the regenerative process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>.</s><s>Although pressure cuff-treated muscles were not harvested at 3 d, mean muscle fiber size values remained remarkably consistent among all treatment groups at this time.</s><s>At 2 wk, pressure cuff controls exhibited a smaller mean fiber size than stimulated ferrogels, suggesting ferrogel-driven cyclic mechanical compressions provide an additional, likely convectionbased benefit.</s><s>Specifically, enhanced fluid transportation around the implant site may accelerate immune cell and/or metabolic waste product removal.</s><s>Interestingly, ferrogel-driven mechanical stimulation produces a therapeutic effect on muscle fiber size of the same order of magnitude as that achieved by previous approaches that delivered cells and drugs to severely injured muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Cyclic mechanical compressions do not lead to an enhancement in hind limb reperfusion and angiogenesis, but may instead lead to temporary increases in convection through the tissue or blood flow to the injured limb.</s><s>This is perhaps not surprising, as ferrogels in this study did not deliver any proangiogenic growth factors or cells, such as VEGF and endothelial progenitor cells, that specifically target and support new blood vessel growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>.</s><s>Although small differences in perfusion were present 9 d postinjury, they did not persist to the end of the study, suggesting that growth factor or cell support may be required to maintain any increases in perfusion that appear as a result of cyclic mechanical compressions alone.</s><s>However, longer-duration studies would be useful to confirm that no differences in angiogenesis or perfusion result from the ferrogel treatment.</s><s>Strikingly, although steady-state hind limb perfusion and capillary density were not significantly affected, oxygen probe experiments demonstrated an increase in oxygen concentration during the time in which biphasic ferrogel-driven cyclic mechanical compressions were being generated in the muscle.</s><s>Massage has previously been shown to temporarily increase intramuscular temperature, which may lead to enhanced nutrient transport throughout the injured tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, and a similar phenomenon could have occurred here.</s><s>More likely, enhanced intramuscular convection driven by tissue compressions may have led to increased oxygen levels and expedited removal of metabolic byproducts that inhibit regeneration.</s><s>Alternatively, cyclic compressions may increase oxygen concentration by locally and temporarily increasing blood flow to the injured muscle.</s><s>A parallel to this situation may occur in massage therapy, as controlled clinical trials aimed at identifying a physiological mechanism for massage have often implicated, although not proven, transient increases in blood flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>.</s><s>Strikingly, biphasic ferrogel and pressure cuff-driven cyclic mechanical compressions of injured muscle led to significant functional muscle regeneration.</s><s>After 2 wk of treatment, biphasic ferrogel and pressure cuff treatment conditions showed 2.6-and 2.2-fold increases, respectively, in peak tetanic force over notreatment conditions.</s><s>Previous studies using mouse models of severe muscle injury report comparable enhancements of muscle contractile force at 2 wk after delivery of proregenerative growth factors and/or myogenic cells to the injured muscle.</s><s>In these studies, scaffold delivery of VEGF and IGF resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in peak tetanic force over blank scaffolds, whereas scaffold delivery of VEGF, IGF, and myoblasts resulted in 1.5-6.0-fold</s><s>increases in peak tetanic force over control conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>.</s><s>Although additional biomaterial-based approaches have induced similar improvements in muscle function through the codelivery of myogenic bioagents with endothelial cells to enhance vascularization (5.5-fold increase in active stress over
