<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Here we identified EFhd2 as a common genetic determinator for high-risk personality traits sensation-seeking/low anxiety and the escalation of alcohol drinking.</s><s>We show that the absence of EFhd2 leads to a higher preference for alcohol in mice, which then facilitates the spontaneous escalation of consumption.</s><s>The lack of EFhd2 also reduces the sedative effects of alcohol, which may contribute to an enhanced consumption by diminished aversive effects.</s><s>Reduced aversive effects of alcohol intake in association with low sedation and other aversive effects have so far mainly been examined with respect to serotoninergic neurotransmission, in which indeed low aversive effects correlate with high alcohol intake. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83</ref></s><s>EFhd2 does not affect taste preference or alcohol  bioavailability in mice.</s><s>These findings translate to the human condition, where we found an association of SNP rs112146896 in the EFhd2-coding region with the amount of alcohol drinking in non-addicted adolescents.</s><s>The emotional behaviour of mice lacking EFhd2 is characterized by enhanced sensation-seeking and reduced anxiety in several tests.</s><s>However, the consumption of a hedonic stimulus was not altered.</s><s>This is in line with animal models of sensation-seeking showing a positive relationship between the response to a novel environment and operant alcohol self-administration in rats. <ref type="bibr"

EFhd2 KO mice not only showed an enhanced response to a novel environment but also enhanced brain tissue NA levels, which suggests a higher baseline arousal level in EFhd2 KO mice.</s><s>Our findings are paralleled in a human sample, which also shows an association of EFhd2 SNP rs112146896 with anxiety traits.</s><s>Abbreviations: ANOVA, analysis of variance; FDR, false discovery rate; GO, gene

sensation-seeking/low anxiety is associated with reduced impulse control and engagement in dangerous behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref></s><s>It is also uniquely associated with alcohol consumption through its tendency to expose individuals more frequently to alcohol as an 'enhancement' or as a 'stress-coping strategy'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref></s><s> limitation of this approach is that it cannot predict how rs112146896 affects the expression of EFhd2 in the human brain during development and adulthood.</s><s>As behavioural associations and cortical morphology show a comparable pattern between EFhd2 KO mice and the human rs112146896 haplotype, it is likely that this haplotype is associated with reduced EFhd2 expression during development.</s><s>Altogether, our findings suggest that the long-known association of high sensation-seeking/low-anxiety phenotype with enhanced alcohol drinking could be causally mediated by EFhd2.</s><s>The analysis of downstream consequences of reduced EFhd2 function in mice showed altered activity in monoaminergic systems.</s><s>There was a reduced dopaminergic and enhanced noradrenergic tone in the Nac and enhanced noradrenergic activity in the Nac and PFC.</s><s>Serotonin activity did not depend on EFhd2.</s><s>Furthermore, EFhd2 appears to limit the DA response to an alcohol challenge in the Nac, but not in the PFC.</s><s>This points to a dissociation of EFhd2 involvement in DA neurons of the mesolimbic vs the mesocortical system.</s><s>Reduced basal DA level and enhanced Nac DA response to alcohol implies that the delta in DA activity after drug treatment, which determines the reward magnitude, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85</ref> is much enhanced when EFhd2 is lacking.</s><s>This is consistent with the sensation-seeking phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> and with the enhanced consumption of alcohol in EFhd2 KO mice.</s><s>It further supports the view that a common end path leading to enhanced drug preference in sensation-seeking individuals is the enhanced sensitivity of the dopaminergic system to pharmacological reward. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88</ref></s><s>Altogether, the neurochemical endophenotype suggests that EFhd2 provides resilience to alcohol consumption by reducing DA activation-mediated reward magnitude of alcohol.</s></p><p><s>The establishment of drug-seeking and consumption involves numerous active learning processes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89</ref> which require synaptic plasticity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90</ref></s><s>In line, both downregulation as well as overexpression of EFhd2 in primary CNs increased dendrite and spine formation.</s><s>The lack of EFhd2 may therefore contribute to a hyperplasticity at cellular level, which favours the fast establishment of those alcohol-related memories that are mediated by mesocortical monoamine systems as it was observed for other addictive drugs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref></s><s>Accordingly, upstream from altered function of monoaminergic systems appeared a considerable number of genes that are differentially expressed in the PFC of EFhd2 KO mice.</s><s>They included genes involved in developmental processes, cell surface receptor signalling pathways, DA biosynthetic processes and forebrain neuronal differentiation.</s><s>These findings appear in line with altered basal DA levels on the one hand and reduced cortical development on the other hand.</s><s>The latter was confirmed by the finding that EFhd2 is required for full cortical, but not hippocampal maturation, in mice.</s><s>A reduced cortical volume was shown to be a strong predictor of future alcohol misuse in adolescents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> and, thus, adds to the risk profile induced by reduced EFhd2 activity.</s><s>This is most likely mediated by reduced cognitive impact on impulse control and drug-taking behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>In how far an EFhd2 dysfunction and resulting cortical deficits contribute to symptoms of other psychiatric disorders such as, for example, schizophrenia has to be determined in future studies.</s></p><p><s>The mesocorticolimbic system constitutes a regulatory circuit involving the PFC, the Nac and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), whereby the PFC projects to the Nac and the VTA to control mesolimbic DA projections that modulate rewarding behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91</ref></s><s>n support of a role of the PFC in the EFhd2-controlled rewarding response, EFhd2 was more expressed in the PFC than in Nac or VTA (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We found that a loss of EFhd2 can control transcriptional changes in the PFC, thereby controlling mesocorticolimbic projections.</s><s>Alcohol consumption was associated with differential expression of several gene expression modules that include genes known to be crucial for the establishment of alcohol consumption, including genes involved in long-term potentiation and glutamatergic synapses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92</ref></s><s>However, there was very little interaction between EFhd2 and alcohol on gene expression profiles.</s><s>We propose that EFhd2 controls gene expression in a way that controls behavioural traits and the risk of alcohol consumption initiation, but does not control the way how alcohol itself affects gene expression after consumption.</s><s>This interpretation is in accordance with the reversal of the addictive phenotype by β-carboline.</s><s>However, it does not exclude the possibility that gene expression after the loss of EFhd2 is not modulated in other areas of the brain such as the Nac or the VTA.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we identify that EFhd2/Swiprosin-1 is a common genetic determinator for sensation-seeking/low anxiety and alco-hol addiction.</s><s>We showed that a lack of EFhd2 induces high-risk personality traits associated with enhanced alcohol consumption.</s><s>The resilience provided by EFhd2 and co-regulated genes may work by its control of monoamine basal activity and DA-mediated alcohol reward magnitude in the mesolimbic system of the brain on the one hand.</s><s>On the other hand, EFhd2 and co-expressed genes are required for full cortical development and, thereby, indirectly control personality traits and alcohol consumption levels.</s><s>These data would support preventive approaches using EFhd2 expression as a predictive marker during development and for therapeutic approaches in alcohol addiction treatment that enhance EFhd2 activity.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>EFhd2 is a
