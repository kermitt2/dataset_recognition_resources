<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Overwhelmingly, rural counties in North Carolina had an exceedingly higher percent of asthma-related ED visits than suburban and urban counties, with the Eastern region consistently having the highest rates among Tier 1 counties in the northeastern part of the state.</s><s>Using this method, the results presented here reflect trends in ED visits across North Carolina that may support enhanced surveillance for state asthma reports.</s><s>For example, we identified that children aged 5-9 years experienced the largest percentage increase of asthma-related ED visits among all age-groups across the study period.</s><s>This corresponds with recent statewide survey (CHAMPS) data that indicates children aged 5-10 years had the highest asthma rates (11.0%) in the state [9], suggesting that this group may be an ideal age group to target for asthma education and intervention efforts.</s></p><p><s>The high rates of asthma ED visits in eastern North Carolina warrants increased public health concern.</s><s>Although data on race and ethnicity were not available, Eastern counties with the highest asthma rates were also located in the poorest counties with the highest percent black, non-Hispanic population.</s><s>Further investigation is needed to examine Asthma-related ED rates were calculated using the number of asthma-related ED visits (with primary or secondary ICD-9-CM, 493.00-493.92</s><s>diagnosis code) as the numerator, divided by the US Census mid-year population for each year for each age-group as the denominator.</s><s>Age-adjusted rates were calculated for region, urbanicity and age-groups using the direct method, standardized to the 2000 US Standard Population.</s></p><p><s>this issue.</s><s>However, these results are reflective of national reports and the published literature that low-income, and uninsured, high-risk minorities often rely on the ED as a safety net for asthma-related care <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref>.</s><s>Although we did not factor costs into our project, the fact that asthma rates were increasingly higher in rural counties leads us to conclude that hospitals in eastern North Carolina are dispropor-tionally absorbing excessive asthma-related ED costs, and that asthma education and/or medication compliance in counties are simply not adequate.</s><s>Given eastern North Carolina's continued disproportionate chronic health disparities and health conditions in the state, it is not surprising to see asthma listed as yet another health burden.</s><s>A large percent of the population in eastern  North Carolina continue to have low access to health care, combined with a shortage of health care providers in the region.</s><s>The social determinants of health also pose additional challenges and risk factors for those with asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s>For example, eastern North Carolina continues to have some of the worst substandard housing conditions in the state <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Poor housing conditions are presumably likely to contain numerous asthma allergen triggers (eg, mold from leaking roofs) that can pose unfortunate exposure opportunities for someone with allergic asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Other contributory risk factors, such as exposure to first-hand and/or second-hand smoke, are also a consideration.</s><s>In 2016, North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data reported that Eastern North Carolina had the highest percentage of current smokers (19.4%) compared to Western and Piedmont regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(R) Craven E(R) Gates* E(R) Forsyth P(U) Greene* E(R) Currituck E(R) Harnett E(R) Gaston P (S) Guilford P(U) Graham* W(R) Henderson W(S) Halifax* E(R) Hertford* E(R) Granville P(R) Hyde* E(R) Johnston E(R) Hoke E(R) Haywood W(R) Iredell P (S) Jones* E(R) Lee P(R) Jackson* W(R) Mecklenburg P (U) Lincoln P (S) Lenoir* E(R) Macon* W(R) New Hanover E (U) Montgomery* P(R) Martin* E(R) Madison W(R) Pender E(R) Nash* E(R) Moore P(R) McDowell* W(R) Person P(R) Northampton* E(R) Onslow E(R) Mitchell W(R) Randolph P(R) Perquimans* E(R) Orange P (S) Pamlico E(R) Robeson* E(R) Rowan P (S) Pitt E (S) Pasquotank* E(R) Stanly P(R) Rutherford* W(R) Richmond* P(R) Polk W(R) Stokes P(R) Sampson E(R) Rockingham P(R) Swain* W(R) Union P(S) Surry W(R) Scotland* E(R) Transylvania W(R) Warren* P(R) Vance* P(R) Tyrrell* E(R) Watauga W(R) Wilkes W(R) Wayne E(R) Wake P(U) Yancey* W(R) Yadkin P(R) Wilson E(R) Washington* E(R)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>As a secondary data analysis, these results should be interpreted with caution.</s><s>For example, data variables for race/ethnicity, occupation, and behavior (eg, smoking) were not available for analysis and not included in the evaluation.</s><s>Furthermore, although NC DETECT captures 99% of all ED visits, the data does not include federal facilities, which are not required under mandate to report data.</s><s>Data also does not include residents who visited hospitals outside of North Carolina, primary care physicians, or ambulatory facilities.</s><s>When calculating age-adjusted rates, we included ED visits of patients with either first and/or second diagnoses of asthma with an ICD-0 493.xx, which is consistent with the methodology in the literature, but may result in higher rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10]</ref>.</s><s>Because of data confidentiality requirements, we were unable to control for duplicate ED visits.</s><s>Other limit-ing factors that may have contributed to either increases or decreases included: affected residents that traveled outside of North Carolina for asthma ED care; whether the patient was presenting with an acute asthma exacerbation or routine asthma; and exposure to environmental pollutants from natural sources (eg, forest fires) and/or anthropogenic sources (eg, pulp mills), which can pose respiratory concerns that can trigger asthma attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Asthma remains a serious chronic health condition in North Carolina.</s><s>With the recent loss of federal asthma funding to the North Carolina Division of Public Health, county health departments have less state-level support for asthma education efforts to raise awareness in their communities.</s><s>Concentrated efforts by programs such as Mission Children's Hospital <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, Community Care of North Carolina-Wake/Johnston Counties <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>, and the Eastern Carolina Asthma Prevention Program <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> have shown tremendous benefit to those with asthma through home-based education and intervention efforts.</s><s>Programs like these represent good models to follow to lower the asthma burden throughout North Carolina communities, but more funding and resources are needed to keep these programs in motion.</s></p><p><s>Without appropriate leadership and guidance to address the asthma burden in North Carolina, the disproportionate burden of asthma remains challenging particularly for those at the highest risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Collaborative efforts among health care providers and policymakers are needed to prioritize this issue to reduce asthma among high-risk populations and excessive asthma-related ED visits in North Carolina.</s><s>Medical care providers are on the front-line of patient care and are in ideal positions to provide enhanced care and edu-cation for asthma control <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref> and inform public policy to raise awareness in settings such as school environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr">33]</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>figure 1.
