mainly caused by the increase in expression of MDR-associated genes, such as ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B 1 gene (ABCB1) (MDR1), ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCG2 (BCRP1).</s><s>Numerous efforts have been made to develop strategies for modulation of MDR-associated genes.</s><s>The classical type of MDR is mediated by overexpression of the P-glycoprotein (PgP), the gene product of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1.</s><s>Therefore reversal approaches target the expression and function of ABCB1/PgP (4).</s><s>Among these approaches the use of cytokines has shown promise for downregulation of ABCB1 in association with increased drug uptake and chemosensitization of tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Several studies have shown, that cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon γ (IFN-γ), leukoregulin and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are capable of reducing ABCB1 gene expression and increasing chemosensitivity of different cancer cell lines in vitro, and more recently also for endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with the pre-clinical findings of cytokine-mediated chemosensitization, clinical trials have demonstrated synergism of combinations of cytostatic drugs with TNF-α or interferones in cancer patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s><s>Among all cytokines used for ABCB1 expression modulation, TNF-α has shown the highest efficiency in vitro, in vivo and in clinical approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</s><s>Although the TNF-α mediated effects on ABCB1 expression were repeatedly shown at functional level, it is still not fully understood, what mechanism in cell signalling is reponsible for these effects.</s></p><p><s>TNF-α exerts its intracellular activities via TNF-receptor 1 (TNFR1, p55) and TNF-receptor 2 (TNFR2, p75).</s><s>Among other factors, the receptor-mediated intracellular signalling cascade requires nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer (NF-κB) as one key mediator and TNF-α is one of the most potent activators of NF-κB signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Activation of NF-κB, which is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an inactive factor, is mediated via the nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex, which is triggered by proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α or cytostatic drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>IKK phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, which is then degraded by the 26S proteasome complex.</s><s>NF-κB is released, unmasking its nuclear localization signal and enters the nucleus to activate transcription of specific target genes, including of its own inhibitor IκBα.</s><s>Within this signaling cascade IκBα mediates both, rapid activation of NF-κB and strong negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The link between NF-κB and ABCB1 gene expression regulation has been analyzed in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>These studies demonstrate that transient induction of NF-κB is associated with increase in ABCB1 gene expression and inversely, inhibition of NF-κB leads to downregulation of ABCB1 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Promoter analyses revealed that the human ABCB1 promoter harbors NF-κB responsive elements, which bind NF-κB to mediate regulation of ABCB1 gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>However, other studies revealed a more complex picture of TNF-α triggered NF-κB activation and its target gene regulation.</s><s>They provide detailed insights into the diverging nature of TNF-α/NF-κB signaling.</s><s>This is strongly dependent on duration of pathway activation, showing rather contrary effects of early transient and of late persistent phase effects, mediated either by IκBα or IκBβ <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, such differential action can lead to negative feedback mechanisms of TNF-α/NF-κB signaling which dampen the initial early transient phase effects, in which IκBα and IκBβ are important regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this context our study analyzed both, the transient and more importantly persistent TNF-α mediated effects on ABCB1 expression in human colorectal cancer cells as diverging action of this cytokine.</s><s>We show that NF-κB/p65 exerts signal transduction via TNFR1, which is strictly timedependent and tightly associated with the modulation of ABCB1 expression.</s><s>These findings extend the picture of previously described diverging nature of TNF-α action.</s><s>They provide a potential link to chronic inflammation, persistent TNF-α release and drug sensitivity in TNF-α exposed cells or tissues, as is clinically observed in e.g.</s><s>inflammatory intestine diseases <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>MDR still represents a leading obstacle for successful chemotherapy of cancer.</s><s>Many different approaches are used to overcome MDR including the use of MDR reversing drugs or cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34)</ref>.</s><s>One long known molecule, which mediates MDR in cancer is the ATP binding cassette ABCB1/PgP transporter.</s><s>This membrane protein is responsible for the drug extrusion from cancer cells causing drug resistance.</s><s>Therefore great efforts are aimed at downregulation of ABCB1 expression to sensitize tumor cells towards chemotherapy.</s><s>One such approach is the use of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α or INF-γ for chemosensitization of resistant tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35)</ref>.</s><s>From numerous studies it is well accepted that particularly TNF-α is able to modulate the ABCB1 expression.</s><s>In this regard several studies report, that treatment with TNF-α mediates ABCB1 downregulation, which in turn leads to improved drug accumulation in association with increased cytotoxicity.</s><s>This has been found in different tumor models, including glioblastoma, colon, breast and hepatocellular cancer, and more recently also for endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>By contrast there are reports with the opposite observations, stating that treatment with TNF-α or other factors, which lead to activation of the NF-κB pathway rather act as inducers of ABCB1 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>, thus, interference in NF-κB signaling by inhibitors has been shown to downregulate ABCB1 expression, which then sensitizes tumor cells towards chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Due to the complex and partially contradictory picture on TNF-α mediated effects we were interested to determine the interplay between short-and long-term TNF-α treatment, NF-κB signaling and the resulting modulation in this signaling, which leads to ABCB1 repression in colon cancer cells.</s></p><p><s>In this study we determined in more detail the impact of short-term and of long-term action of TNF-α on the expression regulation of ABCB1 in intrinsically resistant human HCT15 colon carcinoma cells.</s><s>We have shown, that persistent treatment with TNF-α for 24-72 h leads to significant downregulation of ABCB1 in association with sensitization of these cells towards drug treatment.</s><s>This is in line with previous publications, in which TNF-α leads to MDR reversal <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Apart from these studies, the question remained, what mechanism is responsible for the TNF-α mediated downregulation of ABCB1, which is mostly observed for persistent treatment.</s><s>We therefore evaluated by which TNFRsignaling such modulation of ABCB1 expression is permitted.</s><s>This analysis revealed, that TNFR1 mediated signaling is important for this process.</s><s>Since TNF-α triggers NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation via TNFR1, we focused on this pathway under conditions of short-and of long-term TNF-α activation.</s><s>The human ABCB1 promoter harbors NF-κB binding sites linking NF-κB signaling and ABCB1 expression regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Our study shows short-term TNF-α treatment triggers NF-κB activation.</s><s>This is demonstrated by nuclear accumulation of NF-κB, accompanied by disappearance of IκBα from the cytoplasm, and binding of the transcription factor to its consensus sequence in the EMSA.</s><s>By contrast, long-term TNF-α treatment does the opposite: NF-κB is not shuttled to the nucleus, even at time points shortly after TNF-α re-stimulation, although NF-κB is still present in the cytoplasm.</s><s>This is associated with lack of IκBα re-appearance in the cytoplasm.</s><s>This re-appearance would be expected after TNF-α treatment to rescue NF-κB from the nucleus and to reduce its DNA-binding ability leading to the known termination of NF-κB signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, similar observation regarding lack of IκBα re-appearance was made in FS-4 fibroblasts treated for up to 15 h with TNF-α.</s><s>In this study long-term TNF-α prevents re-appearance of IκBα due to persistent proteasome-mediated degradation of the protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40)</ref>.</s><s>It is known that IκBα is not only important for the termination of NF-κB signaling but is also essential for re-initiation of the signaling after its resynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>(A) HCT15 cell were treated with 30 ng/ml TNF-α and NF-κB/p65 binding was determined

h+.</s></p><p><s>The absence of IκBα leads to delayed and reduced cytokineinduced NF-κB activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>Here we show, that the persistent TNF-α action prevents re-appearance of IκBα due to reduced IκBα transcription, which is then unavailable for maintenance of ABCB1 expression.</s><s>In addition, we did also observe significant reduction in IκBβ transcription and reduced protein level in the long-term TNF-α treated HCT15 cells.</s><s>This reduction however, does not reach the extent observed for IκBα.</s><s>It is suggested that the remaining IκBβ level might be sufficient for dumping the long-term oscillations in NF-κB signaling, as described by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>In this context almost unaltered presence and action of IκBβ might overrule the remaining small IκBα activity and hinder NF-κB activation, which finally results in ABCB1 downregulation.</s></p><p><s>As we observed, persistent TNF-α treatment not only reduces nuclear translocation of NF-κB, but also DNA binding to its consensus sequence in the ABCB1 promoter, explaining why ABCB1 transcription is reduced.</s><s>This is further supported by the reporter assays.</s><s>They clearly show, that long-term TNF-α treatment has inhibitory effects, whereas for shortterm TNF-α treatment induction in reporter gene expression was seen.</s><s>Interestingly, even re-application of TNF-α in the long-term treatment was unable to restimulate reporter gene expression, from either the Cignal NF-κB/p65 Renilla/firefly dual luciferase reporter system or the authentic ABCB1 promoter construct.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study provides new perspectives on the mechanism how long-term treatment of TNF-α is reducing NF-κB signaling, which results in the downregulation of ABCB1.</s><s>This strongly supports the MDR reversing potential of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, which in turn mediates effective chemosensitization of colon cancer cells.</s><s>Furthermore, this mechanism might also apply to the phenomena observed in situations of chronic inflammation of the gut associated with persistent presence of TNF-α, such as ulcerative colitis.</s><s>These conditions are reported to be associated with reduced expression of ABC transporters, including ABCB1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, apart from colon cancer such observation has recently also been made in an inflammation model for microglia parenchymal cells, where ABCB1 expression is
