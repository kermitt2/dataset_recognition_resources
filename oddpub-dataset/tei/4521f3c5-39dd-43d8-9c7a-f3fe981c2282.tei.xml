<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>A 37-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with difficult-to-control hypertension that she has had since age 12 years.</s><s>At 18 years, enalapril was administered.</s><s>One year before referral to our department, she was admitted with a left-sided hemiparesis and blood pressure values &gt;200/120 mm Hg.</s><s>Thereafter, blood pressurelowering treatment was intensified and a statin was begun.</s><s>The patient is a short-statured ballet dancer (her height is 143 cm).</s><s>Physical examination was otherwise devoid of target organ damage.</s><s>There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.</s><s>Laboratory tests including electrolytes, acid-base balance, and renal function were normal.</s><s>Both her brother and mother also had hypertension at a young age.</s><s>A plain roentgenogram of her hand was revealing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The patient has a Mendelian form of hypertension, autosomal-dominant hypertension with type E brachydactyly (HTNB).</s><s>The family was aware of the diagnosis from the OMIM (112410) database.</s><s>HTNB is a non-salt-sensitive form of hypertension featuring a remarkable increase in blood pressure with increasing age amounting to about 50 mm Hg by age 50 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>Untreated, HTNB results in stroke before age 50 years.</s><s>Other forms of target organ damage are uncommon.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is your diagnosis?</head><p><s>Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) were recently shown to cause HTNB. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The mutated enzyme has an enhanced cyclic adenosine monophosphate-hydrolytic activity due to increased phosphorylation of 2 serines at positions 428 and 438 in close proximity to the mutations.</s><s>We screened the highly conserved area in exon 4 of PDE3A and found that our affected family members had a mutation at glycine 449 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>A Canadian family had a valine substitution at this point (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), whereas our Dutch family reported here has a novel aspartic acid substitution at this same site (p.G449D).</s><s>To prove that this novel mutation also causes hyperphosphorylation, we relied on a peptide SPOT assay of the PDE3A Gly449Asp mutant.</s><s>Compared with wild-type  peptide, the mutation leads to a significantly enhanced phosphorylation at the PDE3A Ser438 residue, as we showed earlier for the other mutants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c and d</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> HTNB was initially described in a Turkish kindred.</s><s>Phenotyping showed that the hypertension resembles essential hypertension, as opposed to all other Mendelian hypertensive syndromes described to date that feature increased sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron.</s><s>Blood pressure-lowering generally requires 2 to 3 different drug classes to avoid premature stroke, as underscored by our patient.</s><s>She is currently adequately controlled with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.</s><s>As we reported earlier elsewhere, all classes of antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure in HTNB to a similar extent compared to essential hypertension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Neurovascular contact at the rostral ventrolateral medulla and faulty baroreceptor reflex blood pressure buffering are also described.</s><s>The renin-angiotensin system, catecholamine values, acid-base regulation, and responses to volume expansion and contraction are normal in HTNB. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> We believe that the HTNB findings are relevant to patients with essential hypertension.</s><s>First, a linkage analysis led to this locus in Chinese families with essential hypertension without a skeletal phenotype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Second, 2 separate genomewide association studies have identified PDE3A in cohorts with essential hypertension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Third, the PDE3 inhibitor milrinone lowers blood pressure both systemically and in the pulmonary circulation.</s><s>We believe that more modest PDE3A variation could contribute to essential hypertension.</s><s>The enzyme is an attractive drug target because it is inhibited by increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate and could also be addressed by specific protein-protein interactions functioning at intracellular microdomains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Physicians treating hypertension should be familiar with this syndrome.</s><s>The condition may be more common than generally has been believed.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 | Shortened metacarpals and cone-shaped epiphyses feature brachydactyly type E.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="1,349.06,263.28,155.48,209.76" type="bitmap" /></figure>
