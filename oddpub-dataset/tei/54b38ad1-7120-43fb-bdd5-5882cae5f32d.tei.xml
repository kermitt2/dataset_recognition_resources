<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In the present study, we investigated the effects of HCV infection on IFN-γ-induced i-proteasome expression using an in vitro HCVcc infection system.</s><s>We found that HCV infection prevented the induction of the i-proteasome subunits β1i/LMP2, β2i/MECL-1 and β5i/LMP7 at the protein level in a PKR-dependent manner.</s><s>Furthermore, we demonstrated i-proteasome suppression by studying not only the subunit composition but also the function of the 20S proteasome complexes isolated from HCV-infected cells.</s><s>Previously, we showed that type I and III IFNs are produced from HCVinfected cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and that i-proteasomes can be induced by type I IFNs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>In future research, it should be examined whether type I IFN-induced i-proteasome expression is also impaired by the PKR-dependent mechanism in HCV-infected cells.</s></p><p><s>To combat viral infections, the expression of i-proteasomes triggered by type I or type II IFNs, the generation of a virusderived peptide repertoire and the subsequent induction of viral antigen-specific CD8 + CTLs is of major importance.</s><s>On one hand, a vigorous CTL response is beneficial because it allows the infected cells to be destroyed.</s><s>On the other hand, the release of IFNs by activated lymphocytes results in the induction of oxidative stress.</s><s>In particular, newly synthesized proteins are sensitive to oxygen radicals, and the exposure of cellular proteins to such radicals leads to oxidative protein damage, the accumulation of proteins and the destruction of both infected and non-infected cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>ral interference with the i-proteasome function has been shown to occur either on the transcriptional level or through the direct interaction of viral proteins with the i-subunits.</s><s>In both human and mouse cytomegalovirus-infected fibroblasts, the transcription and protein expression of the i-proteasome subunits are inhibited, thus preventing their incorporation into nascent proteasome complexes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>This mechanism was suggested to lead to changes in the CTL epitope repertoire during the effector phase of the immune response against cytomegalovirus infection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>Direct interference with the proteasome complex has been reported for the HIV-1 Tat protein, which interacts with six β subunits of the 20S proteasome, as well as with the β2i/MECL-1 and β5i/LMP7 i-subunits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>In addition, HCV NS3 directly binds to β5i/LMP7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>Both mechanisms result in impaired proteasomal proteolytic activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>n the present study, IFN-γ-induced i-proteasomes were examined as important players in the antigen processing of cytoplasmic proteins.</s><s>However, the expression of other components of the antigen-processing machinery is also increased by IFN-γ.</s><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> Given that IFN-γ-induced i-proteasome expression is suppressed by a PKR-mediated mechanism in HCV-infected cells, the protein expression of other antigenprocessing machinery components might also be suppressed by the same mechanism in HCV-infected cells.</s><s>Indeed, we confirmed this hypothesis by showing that IFN-γ-induced proteasome activator 28 expression was suppressed in HCV-infected cells (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>PKR phosphorylation, which is induced by double-stranded RNA, leads to eIF2α phosphorylation and ultimately suppresses new protein translation.</s><s>In HCV infection, this pathway was shown to be responsible for the impaired expression of antiviral IFN-stimulated gene proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>This is considered to be one of the major mechanisms of HCV immune evasion and has been shown to be dependent on the presence of a specific polymorphism within the HCV strains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref></s><s>We demonstrated that this mechanism operates to suppress IFN-induced MHC class I molecule expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and i-proteasome induction in HCV-infected cells.</s><s>This indicates that the PKR-eIF2α pathway regulates not only antiviral innate immune responses but also CD8 + CTL responses and non-immune functions, such as the maintenance of protein homeostasis under conditions of IFN-induced oxidative stress.</s><s>This further suggests that the pathway can be targeted for anti-HCV drug development.</s><s>Recently, it was shown that cyclophilin inhibitors reduce PKR phosphorylation and restore IFN-stimulated gene protein expression in HCV-infected cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>It is thus worthwhile to investigate whether cyclophilin inhibitors restore i-proteasome induction in HCV-infected cells.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we could not study directly the function of CD8 + CTLs specific to i-proteasome-dependent HCV epitopes because i-proteasome-dependent epitopes have not yet been identified in HCV proteins.</s><s>Instead, we examined the generation of the HBV core 141-151 peptide, a strictly i-proteasome-dependent CTL epitope.</s><s>Previously, it was demonstrated that the generation of the HBV core 141-151 peptide determines the activity of the CTL response. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>reover, the generation of the HBV core 141-151 peptide has been used as a functional evidence of the i-proteasome induction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>n summary, we have shown that i-proteasome induction, assembly and function is suppressed in HCV-infected cells in a PKR-dependent manner.</s><s>We propose the existence of an HCV immune-regulation mechanism that affects the antigenprocessing machinery and the processing of cytoplasmic viral proteins.</s></p></div>
