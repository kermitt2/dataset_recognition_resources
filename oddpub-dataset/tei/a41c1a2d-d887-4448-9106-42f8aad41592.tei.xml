<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this cross-sectional study we measured plasma PAPP-A2 concentrations in adult men and non-pregnant women of a general study population.</s><s>The PAPP-A2 concentrations tended to be higher in women in comparison to men, and positively correlated with age.</s><s>While smoking status was not associated with PAPP-A2 concentration, we found weak associations with body weight, BMI and alcohol consumption.</s><s>Among biochemical factors, GGT, ASAT and LDH concentrations were positively associated with PAPP-A2 concentration.</s><s>Haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit and red blood cell count were inversely associated with PAPP-A2, although interaction analyses showed that the inverse associations were restricted to women only.</s></p><p><s>PAPP-A2 is highly expressed during the course of pregnancy, with a potential role in foetal growth and a potential prognostic value for evaluating pre-eclampsia <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Here we present the first study measuring PAPP-A2 concentration in a large population independent of the pregnancy context.</s><s>In 2013, Kløverpris et al. introduced an immunoassay for PAPP-A2 measurement in human serum <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>During assay testing, they measured PAPP-A2 concentration in serum samples of two male and two female participants and reported a mean concentration of 300-500 pg/mL 3 , which is in line with our findings using the same immunoassay.</s></p><p><s>This far, research has pointed to a role of PAPP-A2 in foetal growth and development, since it is highly expressed in the placenta during pregnancy and supposed to increase IGF bioavailability by cleavage of binding proteins IGFPB-3 and IGFPB-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, members of two families were recently identified, whose homozygous mutations in PAPPA2 (p.D643fs25* and p.Ala1033Val), lead to a complete absence of PAPP-A2 proteolytic activity resulting in increased IGF-1 bound to IGFBPs and decreased free IGF-1 concentrations.</s><s>The affected individuals were characterized by progressive growth failure, moderate microcephaly, thin long bones and mildly decreased bone density <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>In our analysis in an adult population, we did not find an association between height and PAPP-A2 plasma concentration.</s><s>However, it is quite reasonable, that the potential causal relationships between PAPP-A2 concentration and growth do not persist into adulthood, when the growth period is over.</s></p><p><s>With respect to the other anthropometric measures, we found indications for weak inverse associations of PAPP-A2 concentration with weight and BMI.</s><s>From a theoretical perspective, IGF-1 is supposed to be central to the regulation of anabolic (growth) processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ; however, the current knowledge of the biological function of PAPP-A2 is too scarce to draw inferences.</s><s>Much more complexity is added since the relationship between BMI and IGF-1 levels is presumably inversely U-shaped, while free IGF increases with obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, elevated serum IGF-1 levels have been found to be associated with reduced risk of osteoporosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> on the one hand, while they are associated with a higher risk of breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> on the other.</s><s>Thus, to elucidate the role of PAPP-A2 in an adult population, a next step would be to determine the relationship of PAPP-A2 with concentrations of IGF-1, free IGF1 and IGF binding proteins in an adult population.</s></p><p><s>We had self-reported information on diagnoses of diabetes, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases in this study population.</s><s>We found higher adjusted mean PAPP-A2 concentrations in participants reporting to have inflammatory bowel diseases in comparison to participants without this condition.</s><s>Furthermore the adjusted means PAPP-A2 concentration in participants indicating diabetes was slightly although not significantly higher than in participants without diabetes.</s><s>It should be noted that the self-reported diagnoses of diseases in this study were not validated by physicians' records or medication information.</s><s>In addition, given that our study population was selected from the general population, the number of diseased persons was relatively small.</s><s>Therefore, results for these subgroups need to be interpreted cautiously.</s><s>Future studies are warranted to explore the association of PAPP-A2 concentration with respect to diabetes or inflammatory bowel diseases.</s></p><p><s>With respect to biochemical parameters, we found a positive association between PAPP-A2 concentration and GGT, ASAT and LDH serum concentration.</s><s>We point out, that in this study population the concentration of all three parameters varied within the normal clinical range, which is also true for white blood cell count as a standard marker for inflammation.</s><s>Since all three parameters might function as chronic markers of cell damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> irrespective of an acute inflammatory event, one might speculate, that in the same way as GGT, ASAT or LDH are released from cytosol to the circulation upon cell damage, PAPP-A2 is released, thus leading to increased plasma concentrations.</s><s>Interestingly, we found an inverse association between PAPP-A2 concentration and concentrations of haemoglobin, haematocrit and red blood cells, which was restricted to women.</s><s>Some studies suggest that concentrations of haemoglobin may fluctuate according to the menstrual cycle, due to menstrual blood loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>One may therefore speculate that the inverse association with these blood parameters indicates that PAPP-A2 concentrations also depend on menstrual cycle.</s><s>However, when we stratified the analysis into women still having menstrual cycles and those who have not we surprisingly found that the inverse association was even stronger among women not having menstrual cycles and weaker (and statistically non-significant) among women having menstrual cycles, although the difference between both groups of women was statistically not significant.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of our study include the selection of the study population, which was predominantly drawn from the general population through population registries.</s><s>It should be noted, subjects willing to participate in medical studies are likely to be more health conscious than others, and, therefore our study may not be representative for the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, the wide variability with respect to age, body mass and lifestyle characteristics allowed us to demonstrate association between PAPP-A2 concentration and several parameters which might be generalizable.</s><s>The size of our populations seems appropriate to show biological meaningful differences in PAPP-A2 concentrations over various lifestyle, anthropometric or biochemical parameters and to repeat analyses stratified by gender.</s><s>Data assessment followed standardized procedures and was conducted by trained personnel, especially the measurement of anthropometric parameters followed the WHO protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and did not rely on self-reports, which are prone to some errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore all clinical laboratory measurements were performed in the same laboratory following standardized procedures and within 6 hours from blood drawing.</s><s>However, triglyceride concentration may be affected by fasting status <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> and fasting was not a prerequisite in our study; thus, the results with respect to triglycerides concentration should be interpreted cautiously.</s><s>Measurement of LDL-C was performed directly, and thus do not depend on fasting status <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In addition, the method used to quantify PAPP-A2 concentration has been extensively tested to determine limit of detection, linearity of dilution and spike recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>However, the cross-sectional design of our study limits causal inferences.</s><s>In conclusion, this study presented PAPP-A2 concentrations measured in a general adult population of men and non-pregnant women.</s><s>PAPP-A2 concentration was measurable in all participants which is a prerequisite for all future studies aiming to further elucidate the biological role of PAPP-A2 in adults.</s><s>We were able to show a widespread distribution of PAPP-A2 concentration with variation over age, sex and weight.</s><s>PAPP-A2 concentrations were positively associated with age and serum concentration of GGT, ASAT and LDH and negatively associated with weight in all participants and with serum concentration of haemoglobin, haematocrit and red blood cell count in women.</s><s>However, it is important to direct future research to the simultaneous measurement of IGF-1 and IGFBPs, since these are the primary targets of the metalloproteinase PAPP-A2.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Graphical presentation of plasma PAPP-A2
