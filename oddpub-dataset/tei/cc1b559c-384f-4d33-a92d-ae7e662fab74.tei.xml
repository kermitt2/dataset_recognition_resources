<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Study design and quality control.</s><s>To identify genes involved in food allergy, we performed a GWAS in a discovery set of 523 food allergic cases and 2682 population-based controls from the German Heinz Nixdorff Recall Study (HNR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>All cases were from the Genetics of Food Allergy Study (GOFA) in which the diagnosis of food allergy was based on OFCs according to current guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>After applying stringent quality control criteria (see "Methods"), the discovery set consisted of 497 cases and 2387 controls with high quality genotype data.</s><s>For imputation, we used the Haplotype Reference Consortium data at the University of Michigan as reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>In order to ascertain high quality of imputed genotypes, we filtered for a quality score of r 2 &gt;0.5 and excluded low frequency variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt;5%), yielding over five million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) available for analysis.</s><s>The study design is summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>Association with disease was calculated with FastLMM using an additive allele-dosage model.</s><s>The main analysis was performed on any food allergy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we investigated the three most common allergies against specific foods separately, including HE (n = 288), PN (n = 220), and CM (n = 169; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>There was no evidence for inflation of the test statistics neither in the GWAS on any food allergy (λ = 1.03) nor in the allergen-stratified analyses (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>For replication, we considered all loci with moderate association in the discovery set (P &lt; 1 × 10 SNPs to replicate: FA, n = 3; HE, n = 2; PN, n = 2; CM, n = 1 Replication threshold (Bonferroni corrected) FA, P R &lt; 5.9 × 10 -5 HE, P R &lt; 5.6 × 10 -5 PN, P R &lt; 6.1 × 10 -5 CM, P R &lt; 5.9 × 10 -5 and P metaD+R &lt; 5× 10 SNPs in low LD (r 2 &lt; 0.2) were present, again the best SNP was selected for replication.</s></p><p><s>To replicate the findings, we investigated 380 additional food allergic cases of the GOFA study and 986 population-based controls of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , of which 379 and 984 samples passed the quality check.</s><s>All individuals of the discovery and replication set were of European ancestry as confirmed by principal component analysis.</s><s>A detailed characterization of both data sets is provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, variants replicating with the same risk allele as the GOFA discovery set at nominal significance (P &lt; 0.05) and not reaching the Bonferroni corrected P value in the GOFA replication set were confirmed in the Chicago Food Allergy Study (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>) comprising 671 food allergic children, 144 non-allergic, non-sensitized normal controls, and 1382 controls of unknown phenotype (234 children and 1148 parents), all of European ancestry (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Loci associated with food allergy.</s><s>In the main analysis on any food allergy, two loci already showed association at genome-wide significance (P &lt; 5 × 10 −8 ) in the discovery set (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>The respective lead SNPs, rs12123821 on chromosome 1q21.3</s><s>(odds ratio (OR), 2.55; P = 8.4 × 10 −10 ) and rs11949166 on 5q31.1 (OR, 0.60; P = 1.2 × 10 −13 ), were also significantly associated with food allergy in the GOFA replication set after correction for the number of tests performed (for FA; n = 847, P &lt; 5.9 × 10 −5 , Bonferroni correction).</s><s>They replicated with the same risk alleles  Variant rs12123821 at 1q21.3 is located within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) near the epidermal barrier gene filaggrin (FLG, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>) which was previously associated with PN allergy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Since we identified LD between rs12123821 and a LOF mutation in FLG, c.2282del4 (r 2 = 0.19, Dʹ = 0.78), we evaluated whether the association signal at 1q21.3 was due to known FLG mutations.</s><s>We included the two most common FLG LOF mutations in European populations, FLG c.2282del4 (tagged by rs12123821) and p.R501X (rs61816761) as covariates in the analysis which eliminated the highest association peaks within the EDC (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>).</s><s>While our results confirmed the role of FLG null mutations in food allergy, a residual association was still detectable between FLG and the repetin gene (RPTN;
