<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant selection</head><p><s>Participants were recruited in the practice if they fulfilled the following eligibility criteria: BMI 25.0-29.9</s><s>kg/m 2 with other risk factors (i.e.</s><s>hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity) or BMI over 30.0 kg/m 2 ; at least 2 previous evidence-based weight management programmes with consecutive weight regain in the last years (! 1kg / year); will to reduce weight; age 18-75 years; increased cardiovascular risk profile to develop cardiovascular disease by considering age &gt;65 years, male sex, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking for coronary artery disease as single cardiovascular risk factors (more than 3 individual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>); dental examination within the past 12 months; good oral health and functioning occlusion.</s><s>Exclusion criteria were participation in a weight reduction programme during the last 6 months prior to this study, weight fluctuation of ! 5% over the last year, uncontrolled eating behaviour, clinical or biochemical evidence for the presence of concomitant chronic inflammatory disease, presence of any other significant uncontrolled medical condition or any other treatment known to alter appetite or weight, obesity due to secondary disorders, inability to understand the consent form, participation in or consent to participate in another study, malignant disease, wearing dental prosthesis, less than 10 teeth /jaw with maximally mild to moderate periodontal disease, and poor oral/dental health (as confirmed by the trial dentist).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study protocol</head><p><s>Patients who fulfilled the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria were sent to the orthodontist (consultant to the project) for baseline testing and preparation of dental impressions using a purpose-designed kit (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The device was custom-made for each individual from the individual's dental impressions.</s><s>When needed, the orthodontist adjusted the tool to ensure that it fit securely prior to commencement of use.</s><s>Patients were advised to refrain from using the device if they felt any problems and to consult the orthodontic at their earliest convenience.</s><s>On the day of device dispensation (day 1), each participant attended the practitioner for a consultation and baseline measurements.</s><s>Participants were encouraged to use the device for all meals.</s><s>Further advices included to strictly avoid sweetened or sugary drinks, avoid any cognitive control over their eating behaviour and to eat what they felt was best for them: in other words, to refrain from any conventional caloric-restricted diet or meal supplements, to eat when and what they liked, to take their times with their meals, savouring every bite and eating mindfully <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and to take up physical activity only if they felt like it.</s><s>Patients were advised to use the device for all meals for the first 8 to 12 weeks (Phase I).</s><s>They were told not to use the device thereafter (Phase II), but allowed to place the box with the device next to them when eating for remembrance.</s></p><p><s>Participants attended follow-up appointments in the practice at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, and at months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30 and 36.</s><s>Weight, compliance, adverse events (AEs), and qualitative feedback were obtained during each consultation.</s><s>For AEs, a standardised questioning at each contact was performed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The intraoral device</head><p><s>The novel intraoral device has been designed to slow the eating process, with the intent of prolonging the chewing process and delaying the swallowing of a single bite in order to improve the function of physiological satiation mechanisms.</s><s>Additionally, the duration of the single bite in the mouth should be extended to intensify the tasting of the food.</s><s>Thereby the device aims to promote mindful eating and a long-lasting change in eating behaviour.</s></p><p><s>The design of the intraoral device consists of two thermoplastic splints made of Polyethylenterephthalat-Glycol (PET-G) for the upper and lower jaw (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>On top of each splint a smooth layer made of Polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) is formed, which reduces the occlusal surface in centric jaw occlusion.</s><s>Additionally, a linear increase with a width of about 3mm over the upper premolars and molars further reduces the chewing area.</s><s>Thus, the occlusal surface is reduced to about one fourth of its original surface.</s><s>The completely smooth surface of the splint that covers the lower jaw further restricts the chewing process by inhibiting the interlocking of dental cusps.</s><s>The device is inserted immediately before ingestion of food and is removed afterwards.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical assessment and questionnaires</head><p><s>Weight was measured at baseline and each follow-up (see above), using the same digital scales.</s><s>Patients' historical weight was retrieved from the individual records.</s><s>At baseline and last follow-up, height, weight and waist circumference were quantified and the body mass index (BMI, kg / m 2 ) calculated.</s><s>Supine blood pressure was measured in the left arm.</s><s>Venous blood samples were taken at baseline and after 3 and 6 months, as clinically indicated, to assess plasma glucose, insulin, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total, high-density lipoprotein and lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides.</s><s>These samples were taken after an overnight fast.</s><s>Concomitant medication was assessed at baseline and changes monitored throughout the study.</s></p><p><s>To exclude participants with uncontrolled eating behaviour, volunteers were screened for uncontrolled eating behaviour using the German version of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>A questionnaire, specifically designed for this study, assessed participants' acceptability of the intraoral device, eating rates, food choices, comfort, appetite, and meal size throughout Phase I. Responses were noted by the practitioner and evaluated at the completion of the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliance</head><p><s>Compliance throughout Phase I of the study period was defined as reported by participants.</s><s>Good compliance as use of a minimum use of 3 meals/day, 6 days/week; moderate compliance as use of 15 to 18 meals/week; poor compliance as use of 9 to 14 meals/week; less 9 meals/ week was defined as no compliance.</s><s>These values were averaged to obtain a "mean uses per week" across the Phase I of the study for each participant.</s><s>Additionally, length of use in weeks and cumulative duration of use in hours were recorded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse events and qualitative data</head><p><s>At each visit, participants were asked to report any adverse events; these were recorded, and where necessary, follow-up action was taken by the medical officer or dentist.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of eating with the device</head><p><s>In their first week, the last three participants included in the observation volunteered to participate in an additional acute eating experiment with the device.</s><s>For this, they were asked to eat an identical ad-libidum meal (lunch) on two following days at home without the device (baseline) and on the following day with the device.</s><s>All volunteers were instructed to eat a light breakfast on the test days.</s><s>They all reported to have followed the instructions.</s></p><p><s>Appetites were measured with a German translation of the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and additional standardised questions assessing chews per bite, duration (in seconds) to swallow, percentage of consumed meal, satisfaction from the meal, awareness of food composition and amount of food consumed, duration of the meal, intake of a snack after 2-3 hours and type of snack following each meal.</s><s>Changes of eating behaviour and appetite following the meals were assessed by comparison of the individual questionnaires from day 2 with baseline.</s><s>Food intake motivation after the respective test meals was assessed with the use of a paper version of the VAS, completed directly afterwards on a 100-mm line.</s><s>The scales assessed: hunger (How hungry do you feel at this moment?),</s><s>desire to eat (How strong is your desire to eat at this moment?),</s><s>fullness (How full does your stomach feel at this moment?),</s><s>and motivation to eat (How much food do you think you could eat at this moment?).</s><s>These VAS ratings have been determined to be valid and reliable indicators of hunger and satiety VAS.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).</s><s>All continuous variables were assumed not to be normally distributed due to the small number of patients included and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test.</s><s>Comparison of categorical variables was generated by the Pearson χ 2 test and the Fisher's exact test.</s><s>Primary outcomes (weight loss in Phase I and Phase II) were assessed on an intention-to-treat basis.</s><s>A total of 6 patients will enter this study.</s><s>The probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a relationship between the independent and the dependent variables at a one-sided 0.05 significance level, if the true change in the dependent variables is 2.484 units per one standard deviation change in the independent variable in a test to find an association if the dependent variable is affected by the treatment.</s><s>This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the dependent variable is 2.</s></p><p><s>Statistical significance was assumed if a null hypothesis could be rejected at p 0.05.</s><s>All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 21.0.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Weight loss and compliance</head><p><s>All patients significantly lost weight during the initial Phase I (6.8 ± 3.3 kg or 7.3 ± 3.6% of baseline bodyweight after 3 months, p &lt; 0.05, Fig 3B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">and 3C</ref>) where they wore the device.</s><s>Interestingly, all patients continued to lose weight in Phase II (4.0 ± 4.1 kg during Phase II, p &lt; 0.05) without usage of the device, achieving our primary weight-loss objective of a longterm change of eating behaviour (10.5 ± 4.2 kg or 11.0 ± 4.9% of baseline bodyweight for last follow-up, p &lt; 0.01, Fig 3B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">and 3C</ref>).</s><s>All patients lost &gt;5% initial bodyweight, and 67% (4/6) achieved a &gt;10% bodyweight loss over the whole study period.</s><s>When restricting the observation period to 12 months similar success rates were measured, since all patients had lost &gt;5%, and 67% (4/6) achieved a &gt;10% bodyweight loss.</s><s>Waist circumferences also decreased significantly (−9.4 ± 3.6 cm, p &lt; 0.05).</s></p><p><s>After receiving the device, patients used the device between 4 to 10 (7 ± 2) weeks.</s><s>The wide range is explained by a self-reported significant weight loss due to a change in eating behaviour in 2 patients, who were than allowed to eat without the device.</s><s>Four patients were defined as</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety and acceptability</head><p><s>There were no adverse events with the device reported.</s><s>All patients reported uncomfortable foreign body sensation with the device that subsided after 1 week (n = 2), 2 weeks (n = 3), or after 4 weeks (n = 1).</s><s>Further discomfort was reported by 2 patients, related to mild gingivitis that required re-adjustment by the orthodontist (n = 1), intermediate difficulties with biting and chewing some food (salads and certain meat) and attracting another person's attention (n = 1) during eating and were reported to be "rare" or "very rare".</s><s>Apart from these events related to the device, no other incidences occurred.</s><s>In general, patients reported that handling of the device for insertion and removal was "very good" or "good" in 4 cases and to be "acceptable" in 2 cases.</s><s>Three patients would recommend the device "unreservedly" and 3 "more yes" (on a scale to five).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in eating behaviour</head><p><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, all patients noticed a change of eating behaviour.</s><s>Three patients reported using the device as a reminder on rare occasions, whereas the others refrained from using the device as reminder.</s></p><p><s>Changes in food intake were considerable and similar in all three volunteers between eating without (baseline) or with the device, as shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</s><s>Using the device, there was an increase in chews per bite (3-fold), time to swallow a bite (3.5-fold), and duration of the meal device, Phase I is the time period where patients used the device (4 to 10 weeks), Phase II is the follow-up period, during which the device was no longer used.</s><s>to satiety (3.5-fold), whereas the size of the meal consumed was reduced to 59%.</s><s>Awareness of composition and amount of food consumed was higher with the device in the acute test meal setting and patients reported during a long-term follow-up that this effect continued.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The findings of this study support the hypothesis that this medical device is the first non-invasive medical device to reduce weight in overweight and obesity effectively and enduringly.</s><s>Our data indicate that this weight loss is a result of a sustainable change in eating behaviour.</s><s>What's more, the approach of this therapy strongly contrasts with contemporary weight loss strategies in that all patients were instructed to eat whatever they liked.</s><s>Treatment of obesity includes food consumption because this is the primary source of caloric intake and manipulating eating behaviour thus is a primary target.</s><s>Commonly, weight loss strategies to fight individual and populations overweight and obesity include behaviour modification, pharmacotherapy, meal replacements, and more drastically, gastric bypass surgery, or gastric balloon.</s><s>Despite proven short-and medium-term weight reduction of these evidencebased programs, rapid weight gain is a serious health problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> for the majority of patients trying to lose weight.</s></p><p><s>All patients with increased cardiovascular risk profile who were included in our study had increases in weight despite previous evidence-based strategies to reduce weight over the last years.</s><s>Participants all lost weight in the first phase, when they used the device for their meals and reported to have changed both the size of their meals as well as the choice of food consumed during this first acute phase of only a few weeks.</s><s>To verify this finding, an acute experiment was conducted in a subgroup of patients, where patients showed prolonged eating duration, increased awareness of food composition and feelings of satiety, although they had eaten smaller meals when eating with the device.</s><s>Satisfaction and compliance with the medical device in our study was acceptable after initial discomfort and no adverse events occurred.</s></p><p><s>Thus, this device is different from other medical intra-oral devices that attempt to prevent an individual from eating but do not change eating behaviour.</s></p><p><s>There is a strict relationship between bite size and food intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> as well as oral health status and involuntary weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>First experiences have been made with intraoral medical devices to restrict food consumption in obesity.</s><s>An oral volume restriction device modified the subjects' bite size, but this was not associated with changes in food consumption, hunger or satiety feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Overweight patients lost weight during a short follow-up period of 4 months with an oral restriction device <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, however data from long-term follow-ups are not available.</s><s>Two other approaches to prevent obese patients from overeating were wiring of jaws and intermaxillary fixation.</s><s><ref type="bibr">[29] [30]</ref>.</s><s>Both procedures achieved significant initial weight loss, but when the devices were removed weight was regained <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Another group studied a tongue patch for impeding swallowing combined with a low-calorie diet.</s><s>Within the very small number of patients available for follow-up, 84% of patients maintained their initial weight loss during 3 months to 4 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> with high drop-out rates.</s></p><p><s>The change of eating behaviour translated into sustained weight loss in the consecutive months in the second phase during long-term follow-up, where the patients continuously lost weight without using the device.</s><s>During long-term follow-up, all of the patients in our study significantly lost weight in a range defined as effective program <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Complex neurophysiological changes during cognitive control and unusual eating patterns of individuals have been identified as strong inducers of weight regain.</s><s>Our approach to help overweight and obese

to savour <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and indulge each and every bite.</s><s>Thus, the two competing goals-namely, the aspiration to diet induced by cognitively inhibiting chronic self-control and the desire to eat with pleasure seem reconcilable by the use of this simple medical device.</s></p><p><s>This study has several limitations, such as the small number of 6 patients, the retrospective design of long-term follow-up with limited phenotypic data at inclusion and the long recruitment period as well as the lack of a control arm.</s><s>We cannot exclude the possibility that patients have been included in this study who previously failed to reduce weight because of cravings caused by the sensory deprivation of monotonous diets.</s></p><p><s>Thus, a more powerful study is now conducted with a large number of patients in a prospective, randomised, controlled multicentre trial.</s><s>This is to prove the concept and the underlying mechanism.</s><s>Since the majority of patients will regain weight after conventional dieting, our approach may prove a serious alternative treatment for obesity in obese and overweight patients for whom evidence-based options
