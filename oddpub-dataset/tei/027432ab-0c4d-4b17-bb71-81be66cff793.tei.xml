<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The primary aim of this study was to assess the association between maternal exercise during pregnancy on maternal and fetal HR responses during labor and delivery.</s><s>We hypothesized that during labor and delivery, there would be lower baseline fetal HR, lower maternal HR, and increased fetal HRV, with no differences in fetal heart accelerations and decelerations in the exercise group relative to the non-exercise group.</s><s>Contrary to our hypotheses, the results of this study suggest there are no associations between maternal exercise and maternal and fetal HR response during labor and delivery.</s><s>As Medians and ranges are reported, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test was used to determine differences between groups.</s><s>Gravida refers to the maternal history of the number of pregnancies, whereas parity refers to the number of live children.</s></p><p><s>such, we conclude that maternal participation in exercise is neither helpful nor harmful to the response of the maternal and fetal cardiovascular systems during parturition.</s></p><p><s>Although it is known that maternal exercise during pregnancy blunts the natural increasing HR with advancing gestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and that maternal HR increases during labor, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> the response of maternal HR in active women during labor and delivery has not been thoroughly investigated.</s><s>Our findings suggest that there are no differences in maternal HR response during the physiological stress of labor, regardless of the level of prenatal exercise.</s></p><p><s>There are a few possible explanations for these findings.</s><s>One explanation for the lack of difference in maternal HR response between groups is due to the stage of labor in which maternal HR was measured.</s><s>Research indicates that maternal HR increases during  <ref type="figure">-------------</ref>-   contractions, and more contractions occur in stage 2 relative to stage 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> Although the exact stage of labor in which women were was not known in this study, no differences in number of contractions during labor and delivery were present between groups, suggesting the women were in similar stages during HR recordings.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Intensity (%) ----- ----- -----<label>Low</label></formula><p><s>Another explanation for these null findings is that the position of the women during the recording was not controlled for in the analyses.</s><s>Research demonstrates that ambulation and upright positions are associated with shorter labor duration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref></s><s>Shorter labor duration likely reduces the physical intensity exerted by the mother and lowers her level of overall fatigue during parturition, effectively reducing her HR response to the physiological stress of labor and delivery.</s><s>Lastly, maternal HR response may not adequately represent the cardiovascular response to the stress of labor and delivery.</s><s>Exposure to a physiological stress elicits a response from the cardiovascular system to include HR, stroke volume, and cardiac output. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s>It is possible that maternal cardiac output, stroke volume, and ventricular contractility increased significantly, with less of change in HR.</s><s>In addition, the response of these cardiovascular parameters potentially differs between the exercise and non-exercise groups, given the established cardiovascular adaptations with exercise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref></s><s>Cardiac output, stroke volume, and ventricular contractility, however, were not assessed in this study.</s><s>As such, future investigations examining the cardiovascular response to labor and delivery should include these parameters.</s></p><p><s>The observation of similar fetal HR response during labor and delivery between exercise and non-exercising mothers was unexpected.</s><s>Previous research demonstrated lower fetal HR and increased HRV at rest when exposed to regular maternal exercise during pregnancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>The fetal HR response was dose dependent, similar to the adaptation found in exercise-trained adults (eg, lower resting HR). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s> such, we anticipated a lower fetal HR and increased HRV during labor and delivery, suggesting a fetal HR training effect consequent to maternal exercise.</s><s>However, this hypothesis was not supported.</s><s>A potential explanation for the similar fetal HR response between exercise and non-exercise groups is the time period in which the fetal heart responses were recorded.</s><s>To standardize the measurement time period, fetal HR measurements were recorded during the first hour of labor and delivery, indicating these women were likely in the early stages of the labor.</s><s>Consequently, these women likely experienced a significantly lower physiological stressor, reflected by a maternal HR corresponding to light exertion and normal fetal HR (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Therefore, the exposure to a less vigorous physiological stressor in the first hour of labor and delivery may have precluded our ability to detect any significant differences in maternal and fetal heart responses that are attributable to maternal prenatal PA.</s></p><p><s>In support of this speculation, Sönchen et al (2011) found significantly greater maternal HRs during the latter stages of pregnancy, with HRs reaching 170 bpm for over 50% of the subjects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>This HR reflects vigorous exertion that is typical during the active stage of labor and delivery.</s><s>Importantly, significant differences in maternal HRs during this stage of labor were found between active and inactive women, with the former exhibiting a lower maternal HR.</s><s>Fetal HR was not assessed in that study; however, because maternal and fetal HR patterns are similar during labor and delivery, we speculate that fetuses of active women would have also exhibited a lower HR due to the maternal exposure of a less vigorous physiological stressor.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, research has shown that the post-exercise recovery HR in adults is faster in exercise-trained adults relative to non-exercise controls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref></s><s>Although fetal recovery HR was not measured in this study, future research with the focus of fetal HR and maternal exercise, should consider assessing the difference in neonatal HR recovery immediately following labor and delivery between fetuses exposed to maternal exercise during pregnancy.</s><s>It is possible that fetal HR during labor and delivery may not differ between exercise and non-exercising mothers, as indicated by the findings of this study; however, the fetal HR among exercising mothers may recover more quickly compared with fetuses born to non-exercising mothers.</s><s>In support of this, previous studies demonstrated a significantly faster fetal HR recovery following an acute bout of maternal exercise in fetuses exposed to chronic exercising mothers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref></s><s>is study has strengths and limitations that warrant attention.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, this is the first study to assess maternal and fetal HR responses to the physiological stress of labor and delivery between exercising and non-exercising mothers.</s><s>Despite our inability to find differences between maternal and fetal HR responses, as hypothesized, these findings provide preliminary information about the relationship between maternal exercise and fetal heart responses during labor and delivery.</s><s>Another strength of this study is the rigorous measurements of maternal and fetal HR.</s><s>These measurement methods provide objective and accurate assessments of cardiovascular parameters.</s><s>Some limitations of this study include the sample size, study design, and measurement of maternal exercise.</s><s>The small sample size used in this study likely resulted in insufficient power, precluding our ability to detect differences between the exercise and non-exercise group.</s><s>Next, our employment of a cross-sectional study design limited our ability to assess maternal exercise during pregnancy.</s><s>This is critical because evidence indicates that exercise in pregnancy declines considerably, especially in the third trimester.</s><s>In addition, the use of selfreported maternal exercise is a significant limitation.</s><s>Considering that maternal exercise is a positive health behavior, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> it is possible that social desirability affected the responses of the women.</s><s>Consequently, misclassification may have been present, leading to inaccurate data; we, however, utilized the same questionnaire and cut-offs that previously found differences in resting maternal HR during pregnancy in exercisers vs controls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>Lastly, the stage of labor and the position (ie, ambulatory, supine), factors known to affect HR, were not taken into account. <ref
