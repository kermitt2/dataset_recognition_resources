<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The novel aspects of our study include the design of a formulation of CLU-containing nanoliposomes by PEGylation and the initial proof-of-concept that the formulation protects against LC-induced human microvascular endothelial dysfunction.</s><s>This is potentially relevant in efforts to develop novel therapeutic agents that directly reverse tissue toxicity of amyloid proteins.</s></p><p><s>AL amyloidosis remains a disease associated with significant mortality and morbidity.</s><s>We showed that soluble LC-induced endothelial dysfunction in human adipose and coronary arterioles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Migrino et al., 2011)</ref>, which is consistent with reports by other investigators that the prefibrillar protein species confer tissue toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Shi et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Currently, there is no available treatment that directly reverses LC toxicity.</s><s>Contemporary treatment relies on use of chemotherapeutic drugs with or without stem cell transplantation to remove neoplastic plasma cells that produce the LC, an approach that often cannot be offered or has to be modulated to milder regimens/doses in patients with advanced cases in light of high treatment-related mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Dispenzieri et al., 2004a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Skinner et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>CLU, also known as apolipoprotein J, is a constitutively expressed chaperone glycoprotein displaying cytoprotective properties, including the stabilization of damaged unfolded proteins, which subsequently prevents the formation and accumulation of amyloid fibrils.</s><s>Several studies have shown that the protective effect of CLU on stressed proteins is associated with the formation of high molecular weight complexes via hydrophobic interactions which later favors their refolding by the heat-shock protein Hsp70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Humphreys et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Poon et al., 2002)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We reported that human endothelial cells exposed to LC showed reduced viability that was associated with reduction of CLU expression and secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Franco et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, co-treatment with exogenous CLU restored endothelial cell viability and microvascular endothelial function.</s><s>In-vivo, CLU was reported to have a short half-life (&lt;2 h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rizzi et al., 2009)</ref>, limiting its potential utility when administered intravenously on its own.</s><s>CLU also acts as an apolipoprotein that could potentially be diverted for lipid transport while in circulation before it can interact with LC at the target microvascular tissue.</s><s>One way of transporting CLU to vascular tissue is through the utilization of a carrier system.</s><s>We chose nanoliposomes as they are well-established biodegradable, biocompatible, and nontoxic drug delivery systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lian &amp;
