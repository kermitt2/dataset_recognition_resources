of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) blocked HPV, whereas exogenous nSMase caused TRPC6 translocation and vasoconstriction that were blocked by CFTR inhibition.</s><s>nSMase-and hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction, yet not TRPC6 translocation, were blocked by inhibition or deficiency of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) or antagonism of S1P receptors 2 and 4 (S1P 2/4 ).</s><s>S1P and nSMase had synergistic effects on pulmonary vasoconstriction that involved TRPC6, phospholipase C, and rho kinase.</s><s>Our findings demonstrate a central role of CFTR and sphingolipids in HPV.</s><s>Upon hypoxia, nSMase triggers TRPC6 translocation, which requires its interaction with CFTR.</s><s>Concomitant SphK1-dependent formation of S1P and activation of S1P 2/4 result in phospholipase C-mediated TRPC6 and rho kinase activation, which conjointly trigger vasoconstriction.</s><s>I n regional hypoventilation of the lung, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) protects against systemic hypoxemia

sensitization <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>A potential role of S1P in HPV is particularly intriguing in consideration of its potential tie to CFTR, in that CFTR is one of only two

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>HPV Requires CFTR.</s><s>First, we probed for the functional relevance of CFTR for an intact HPV response.</s><s>In isolated perfused mouse lungs, acute hypoxia (1% O 2 ) triggered the characteristic increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), which was attenuated by ∼50% by either pharmacological inhibition or genetic deficiency of CFTR, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), both of which had no effect on basal Ppa.</s><s>Similarly, in an in vivo model of regional hypoventilation following partial airway occlusion with saline, CFTR-deficient (CFTR −/− ) mice had more severe hypoxemia compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>), further consolidating a critical role for CFTR in HPV.</s><s>Conversely, angiotensin II-induced increases in Ppa were little affected by CFTR inhibition and unaltered in CFTR −/− mice, indicating that the functional role of CFTR in pulmonary vasoconstriction is rather specific for the response to hypoxia (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>Cl − channels have been implicated in the PASMC response to hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>; however, HPV responses in lungs perfused with Cl − free perfusion did not differ from control lungs, suggesting that the functional relevance of CFTR was not attributable to its function as a Cl − channel (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>).</s><s>Western blot analyses showed unabated CFTR expression in cultured PASMCs exposed to 2-24 h of hypoxia (1% O 2 ; Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>), or in pulmonary arteries of WT mice exposed to 5 wk of hypoxia [10% (vol/vol) O 2 ; Fig. <ref type="figure">1F],</ref> indicating that either acute or chronic hypoxia do not result in a loss of CFTR.</s></p><p><s>CFTR Deficiency Partially Protects from Hypoxia-Induced PH and Pulmonary Arterial Remodeling.</s><s>To evaluate whether CFTR is also crucial for long-term vascular adaptation to chronic hypoxia, Cftr tm1Unc Tg(FABPCFTR)1Jaw/J mice (which have normal longevity due to intestinal CFTR expression but lack CFTR in the lungs) and corresponding WT mice were exposed to 5 wk of chronic hypoxia (10% O 2 ).</s><s>Compared with normoxic mice, WT hypoxic mice showed elevated right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>); increased pulmonary arterial medial wall CFTR is required for HPV and its role in lung vasoconstriction does not relate to CFTR's function as a Cl − channel.</s><s>(A) Hypoxia (1% O 2 )-induced increase in pulmonary artery pressure (ΔPpa) in isolated mouse lungs was attenuated by CFTR inhibition (CFTRinh-172; 10 μmol/L) and in lungs of CFTR-deficient (CFTR −/− ) mice.</s><s>(B) CFTR −/− mice developed more profound hypoxemia in response to partial airway occlusion by tracheal instillation of 25 μL saline compared with wild-type (WT) mice.</s><s>(C) CFTR inhibition (CFTRinh-172; 10 μmol/L) or deficiency did not alter the increase in mean Ppa (ΔPpa) in response to angiotensin II (1 μg bolus).</s><s>(D) Cl − free perfusate did not affect the hypoxia-induced increase in Ppa.</s><s>Representative immunoblots and quantitative data (normalized first to tubulin as corresponding loading control, and then to normoxia as baseline) show differential expression of CFTR in PASMCs during 2, 4, or 24 h of acute hypoxia (1% O 2 ) (E) or pulmonary arteries isolated from WT mice exposed to 5 wk of normoxia or hypoxia [10% (vol/vol) O 2 ] (F).</s><s>Values are given as mean and SEM; n = 6, 5, 5, 4-5, 8, and 4 per group for A-F, respectively.</s><s>*P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01 vs. control group.</s></p><p><s>thickness of small (20-50 μm), medium-sized (50-100 μm), and large pulmonary arteries (100-150 μm) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> B and C); and a higher degree of muscularization in small pulmonary arteries (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>).</s><s>In mice deficient in pulmonary CFTR, the hypoxiainduced increases in RVSP, medial wall thickness, and small vessel muscularization were markedly attenuated compared with hypoxia-treated WT mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), whereas right ventricular hypertrophy assessed by Fulton index did not differ between CFTR-deficient (0.36 ± 0.02, mean ± SEM) and WT mice (0.35 ± 0.02).</s></p><p><s>CFTR Is Required for Hypoxia-Induced Ca 2+ Signaling and TRPC6 Translocation.</s><s>To dissect the mechanistic role of CFTR in HPV, we analyzed the effect of CFTR inhibition on hypoxia-induced Ca 2+ mobilization in PASMCs.</s><s>Hypoxia (1% O 2 ) caused a rapid increase in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in human PASMCs, which was completely attenuated by CFTR inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3 A and B</ref>).</s><s>Compared with human PASMCs, Ca 2+ mobilization in response to hypoxia was markedly lower in isolated murine PASMCs, but was again significantly reduced in CFTR −/− compared with corresponding WT mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).</s><s>Although the [Ca 2+ ] i increase in PASMCs exceeded the response to hypoxia in coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) by almost one magnitude, a finding that is in line with the selectivity of hypoxic vasoconstriction to the pulmonary circulation, CFTR inhibition attenuated the response in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of both vascular beds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>).</s><s>Based on the emerging recognition of sphingolipids as mediators of HPV, we also tested for the role of CFTR in the SMC response to S1P.</s><s>Intriguingly, CFTR inhibition attenuated the S1P-induced [Ca 2+ ] i increase in PASMCs, yet amplified the respective response in CASMCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref>), suggesting an important site-specific role for CFTR in the regulation of sphingolipid-mediated vasoactive responses.</s></p><p><s>The effects of pharmacological or genetic CFTR deficiency are strongly reminiscent of the
