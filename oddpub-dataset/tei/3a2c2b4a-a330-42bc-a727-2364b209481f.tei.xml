(2001b)</ref> observed a larger effect of length on naming RTs in a transparent orthography with consistent letter-to-phoneme mapping (German) than in an inconsistent orthography (English).</s><s>In line with this finding, the influential grain size theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ziegler and Goswami, 2005)</ref> states that in languages with high letter-sound consistency (transparent orthographies) letters are mapped to sound one-by-one, leading to strong effects of length on the speed of encoding.</s><s>In languages with low letter-sound consistency, though, larger chunks of letters are mapped to sound simultaneously, leading to a reduction in length effects, as additional letters do not necessarily lead to additional steps in the encoding process.</s><s>Support for this theory has been provided from native speakers of languages with varying degrees of orthographic consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Frost, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rau et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, it has not been investigated so far to what extent bilinguals are able to adjust their grapheme-tophoneme encoding strategy to the demands of each of their orthographies.</s></p><p><s>The findings described above not only suggest that word length affects lexical decisions at several levels of processing, but also that these effects might vary with contextual factors, such as stimulus list composition or language.</s><s>However, conventional analyses of lexical decision data, typically analysis-of-variance or multiple regression, are limited in their ability to isolate the (sub)processes affected by a certain variable, such as length.</s><s>This is not only because they focus on mean RTs and accuracies, which present the final outcome of the joint operation of these assumed sub-processes, but also because RTs and accuracies are mostly analyzed separately, and not as the joint outcome of the decision process (but see <ref type="bibr">Grainger and Jacobs, 1996 for exceptions)</ref>.</s><s>A general alternative for the analysis of speeded 2-alternative decision tasks, such as lexical decisions, is the diffusion model framework, which estimates the unique contribution of a few separate sub-processes to a decision process described by the two-dimensional distribution of continuous RTs and binomial decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Busemeyer and Diederich, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Here we apply this approach to the effects of word length on lexical decision behavior, with the aim of directly isolating the length effects on the sub-processes into which the diffusion model decomposes decision making.</s></p><p><s>The diffusion model conceptualizes a decision between two alternatives as based on accumulation of evidence toward one of the decision alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Voss et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This accumulation is modeled using a decision variable, which drifts between two boundaries until it hits one of them, in which case the corresponding decision is made (absorbing boundaries).</s><s>The drift process is characterized by four parameters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): an initial bias toward one of the alternatives (β), the total time devoted to general, non-decision processes (τ, which include perceptual encoding and motor preparation), the rate of evidence accumulation (ν), and the distance between decisions boundaries (α).</s><s>In this setup the upper boundary is located at α, and the lower boundary at 0. The final reaction time equals to the sum of the decision time and the non-decision time τ.</s><s>The random variability of the decision process is represented as within-trial variability in the rate of evidence accumulation, which is not fixed in the model but is sampled from a normal distribution with mean ν and variance s.</s><s>The latter is an intrinsic parameter of the model and changes in this parameters result in scaling of the other parameters.</s><s>The joint distribution of total reaction time and the choice of a decision alternative in the diffusion model follows the Wiener distribution with parameters β, τ, ν, and α (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Vandekerckhove et al., 2011</ref> for the exact mathematical form of the distribution).</s><s>The multiple parameters of the diffusion model for a given data set can be obtained numerically by fitting the model to the data using maximum likelihood <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Vandekerckhove and Tuerlinckx, 2008)</ref> or Bayesian estimation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Van Ravenzwaaij and Oberauer, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The average drift rate is positive on trials with the upper boundary being the correct response, and negative on trials with the lower boundary being the correct response.</s><s>In this scheme the upper boundary represents the correct response.</s><s>Non-decision processes, such as stimulus encoding and motor preparation are contained in the non-decision time τ.</s><s>The decision is made once the amount of evidence exceeds one of the pre-defined decision boundaries α or 0. An unbiased decision process starts at the point α 2 , with a bias β of 0.5.</s><s>A β larger than 0.5 indicates a bias toward the upper decision boundary, and a β smaller than 0.5 indicates a bias toward the lower decision boundary.</s></p><p><s>The diffusion model (DM) has several statistical advantages over the standard analysis of variance, such as being especially suitable to fit the typical left-skewed form of RT distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Van Breukelen, 1995)</ref>, and the simultaneous mapping of continuous RTs and binomial response choices to one set of parameters, whereas in regression approaches, separate regression coefficients are estimated for RT and accuracy.</s><s>However, a more major advantage is that the model parameters putatively reflect specific, cognitively meaningful, elements of the decision process.</s><s>The drift rate (ν) conceptualizes the core of the decision process, namely the rate of evidence accumulation, which is larger when the amount of decisionrelevant information in the stimulus is larger.</s><s>The non-decision time (τ) is associated with stimulus encoding and responseunspecific motor preparation.</s><s>Importantly, for decisions with little variance in motor preparation (i.e., when only a simple button press is required), increases in non-decision time are usually attributed to more effortful stimulus encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ratcliff and Smith, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The decision boundary (α) is associated with the amount of evidence necessary for a decision, such that higher boundary values stand for more conservative decision strategies, and lower values for fast but less accurate decisions (explaining the commonly observed speed-accuracy trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wenzlaff et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the bias parameter is associated with the a-priori tendency in favor of one of the two alternatives.</s><s>These relative advantages have led to successful applications of the diffusion model to the lexical decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ratcliff et al., 2004a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wagenmakers et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wagenmakers et al., , 2008))</ref>.</s><s>Most notably, the diffusion model was used to map wellknown effects on RTs to selective changes in certain parameters, while showing that all other parameters remained unchanged.</s><s>For example, changes in stimulus list composition were shown to induce shifts in decision boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wagenmakers et al., 2008)</ref>, and differences in word frequency to change drift rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Ratcliff et al., 2004a)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The standard approach to fitting the DM is to estimate the parameters separately for each participant in each condition, which, however, requires a large number of data points (&gt;200) to achieve stable parameter estimations <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ratcliff and Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>This is particularly problematic in fields such as psycholinguistics, where such large numbers of stimuli per experimental condition are not always possible to achieve.</s><s>In the past, this problem was most often solved by pooling of data over a group of participants ("meta-subject, " <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Busemeyer and Diederich, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>However, this approach ignores inter-subject variability and thus does not allow statistical inference beyond a specific sample.</s><s>Moreover, it provides only limited insight into factors determining the decision process, as it does not allow for analysis of inter-individual differences.</s><s>Recently, a novel analytic approach was suggested, the hierarchical diffusion model (HDM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Vandekerckhove et al., 2011)</ref>, which allows estimating DM parameters of single participants even in sparse data sets.</s><s>In HDM, the implicit assumption that all participants of an experiment stem from one population is made explicit by assuming that for each parameter, values of all participants stem from an underlying normal distribution:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ν i ∼ N (µ ν , σ ν ) , τ i ∼ N (µ τ , σ τ ) , α i ∼ N (µ α , σ α ) , β i ∼ N µ β , σ β , i = 1, . . . , n participants.</formula><p><s>These constraints bind the parameter values of a single participant by the distribution defined by the parameters of all other participants, enabling simultaneous estimation of the parameters of all participants.</s><s>While the simple DM (i.e., nonhierarchical DM for a single participant) is typically estimated using maximum-likelihood estimates, this is not possible due to the increased complexity of the HDM.</s><s>However, HDM can be fit in a Bayesian approach using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) approximations of the underlying distributions (for a detailed description of this approach see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Vandekerckhove et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we used HDM to investigate the cognitive locus of length effects in lexical decision, and to compare HDM parameters between first and second languages in German-English bilinguals.</s><s>First, we were interested in identifying the differences in diffusion model parameters underlying slower RTs for foreign language words, as routinely found in bilingual lexical decision.</s><s>We reasoned that if they were due to participants' more cautious decision making behavior in a foreign language, they would be reflected in an increase in the distance between decision boundaries only.</s><s>If on the other hand, they were due to less stable and harder to access L2 lexical representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hsu et al., 2014)</ref>, the effect would be reflected in a decrease in rate of evidence accumulation for the L2 as compared to L1, and possibly also an increase in non-decision times.</s><s>Second, we expected the prolonging effect of length on RTs to pseudo-words to be selectively reflected in increases in non-decision times, which would be in line with the sublexical locus of the length effect, as sublexical representations are generally assumed to not contribute evidence to lexical decisions.</s><s>If differences in the length effect between languages are due to difference in encoding strategies following orthographic transparency, this effect will differ between German and English language blocks.</s><s>Finally, we were interested to see how the length of words would affect the non-decision time and drift rate parameters.</s><s>The isolation of these effects would advance the localization of length effects on words to sublexical and lexical stages of models of visual word recognition.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The present study examined the length effect in lexical decision in German-English bilinguals using a diffusion model (DM) analysis.</s><s>Participants made English and German lexical decisions on 3-6 letter words and pseudo-words.</s><s>The DM allowed us to distinguish between decision-unrelated perceptual encoding and evidence accumulation toward one of the decision alternatives.</s><s>Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of the diffusion model parameters allowed for a stable fit at the single subject level.</s><s>The results of this approach were contrasted with a linear mixed-effects regression analysis of mean RTs.</s><s>Across word lengths, lexical decisions were faster and more accurate in participants' native language German (L1) than in their second language English (L2).</s><s>The HDM revealed that this difference was selectively associated with increased nondecision times and slowed evidence accumulation, but not with modification of decision boundaries.</s><s>This finding implies that longer lexical decision times in a second language are likely to result from less efficient stimulus encoding and lexical activation, rather than more conservative decision making (which would be manifested in higher decision boundaries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Ratcliff et al., 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Busemeyer and Diederich, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Differences between pseudo-words and words were similar across languages, with converging evidence from mean-based regression and diffusion model analyses.</s><s>Namely, RTs were longer for pseudo-words than for words, in agreement with higher non-decision times and smaller drift rates for pseudo-words than for words.</s></p><p><s>Mean RTs and accuracies showed no length effect for word stimuli, whereas response times to pseudo-words increased with length, in concordance with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Ziegler et al., 2001b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Martens and de Jong, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Yap et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">see New et al., 2006</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for a summary of previous studies of the length effect in lexical decision).</s><s>However, the DM, which helps decomposing the decision making process into constituent subprocesses, provided a more differentiated picture.</s><s>Namely, while the effects of length on non-decision time and drift rate for pseudo-words were inhibitory, as expected, the pattern for words was different.</s><s>In contrast to the overall null effect of length on word RTs, we found that while perceptual encoding became slower with length, evidence accumulation accelerated for words of both languages, as evident by increased non-decision times as well as faster drift rates with length.</s><s>This novel pattern offers an explanation for the contradicting patterns previously reported, namely that length effects on lexical decision RTs reflect the interaction of several opposite sub-processes, such that the overall effect depends on the relative strength of each of the single effects.</s></p><p><s>Our findings of length effects on non-decision times in German and English provide novel insights with respect to two aspects of the reading process.</s><s>First, dual-route models of reading aloud (e.g., DRC: <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Coltheart et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">CDP+: Perry et al., 2007)</ref> usually argue that mapping of orthographic input on the lexical route is not affected by length.</s><s>The length effects on nondecision times for real words in our data suggest differently, namely that visual and/or sublexical encoding of letter strings is affected by length even in the lexical route.</s><s>This could be due to reduced peripheral visual quality of encoding, which would have strongest effects on long words <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Nazir et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jacobs et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively it could be that letter to grapheme encoding as postulated for the sublexical route in the CDP+ model also happens in the lexical route.</s><s>Second, the grain size theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ziegler and Goswami, 2005)</ref> predicts that for native speakers non-decision times will be affected by length in German more than in English, as encoding of letter strings and mapping to phonological units will be slowed by length in the transparent German orthography more than in the deep English orthography, due to a larger number of graphemes in a letter string.</s><s>However, they make no clear predictions regarding bilinguals' encoding strategies.</s><s>Our diffusion model analysis shows that the effect of length on non-decision times was equal in German and English for words, but larger in English than in German for pseudo-words.</s><s>We suggest that our participants might in fact be using smaller than optimal grain sizes to encode English words, which is more effortful due to the ambiguous mapping between small letter clusters and phonology in English, requiring more time than in German.</s><s>This result implicates that bilinguals do not gain full control over the use of different grain sizes when switching between languages, despite their high proficiency in reading the second language.</s></p><p><s>One theoretical explanation for the acceleration of evidence accumulation with length for words is along the lines of the recently reported decreases in RTs with length for short words (i.e., 3-6) and increase for longer (&gt;8 letters) words <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(New

(2006)</ref> analyzed a large set of English lexical decision data and found a decrease in RT with length for 3-6 letter long words.</s><s>They argued that the facilitatory effect of length for short words could be partially due to eye movement patterns during reading, as well as the fact that word length 3 is less frequent, and thus less expected, in English than word length 6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ferrand et al. (2010)</ref> found a slight decrease in RTs with length for monomorphemic French words when they were presented in the context of polymorphemic words, but no length effect when words were presented in a monosyllabic stimulus set.</s><s>Based on their findings, <ref type="bibr">New et al. and Ferrand et al.</ref> argued that processing of words of an expected length is faster than for words of untypical lengths, whereby expectations could stem from the specific stimulus list composition as well as from general statistical patterns in the language under study.</s><s>The comparison between length effects in English and German in our data supports this proposal.</s><s>Namely, we find a larger facilitation of evidence accumulation by length for English words than for German words.</s><s>As 5-7 is the most frequent word length in English, whereas German words are longer on average (9-11 letters in the SUBTLEX), the peak of the facilitatory effect in German might be reached at a greater length than in our stimulus set.</s><s>Importantly though, the facilitative effects of word length in our German stimuli suggest that this phenomenon is not limited to the two languages tested in these studies.</s><s>An important question for further (simulation-) studies is whether faster accumulation of lexical activation with length for words can be accounted for by models of visual word recognition.</s></p><p><s>What information is accumulated toward a response in lexical decision?</s><s>The answer is well established for "yes"-responses to words, which are typically assumed to reflect the similarity of the input to lexical representations, i.e., the amount of activation in the lexical network (e.g., in the MROM, <ref type="bibr">Grainger and</ref><ref type="bibr">Jacobs, 1996, or in the Bayesian Reader, Norris, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The case is, however, less clear for "no"-responses to pseudowords, for which the absence of positive information is decisive.</s><s>A prominent model is the deadline model, which assumes that "no"-decisions are made when positive evidence was not sufficient within a certain time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Grainger and Jacobs, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>While the deadline model is plausible cognitively, it has been criticized for its failure to account for a reversal of the RT pattern for yes/no-responses under certain experimental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wagenmakers et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>A recent suggestion to solve these issues is that evidence accumulated toward a "no"response equals to some constant (e.g., the expected amount of evidence for a "yes"-response) minus the amount of evidence for a "yes"-response (Leaky accumulator model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dufau et al., 2012)</ref> 2 .</s><s>Importantly, one of the predictions of this coupling of drift rates for words and pseudo-words within one stimulus block is that if the drift rate for words increases in one condition, it should decrease for pseudo-words of the same condition.</s><s>Interestingly this is exactly the pattern that we see for different word lengths: while the drift rate for words increased with length, the drift rate for pseudo-words decreased with length.</s><s>However, in our experiment drift rates for words and pseudowords do not sum up to a constant value across different lengths, but rather show an overall decrease with length.</s><s>Whether this can be accommodated in the framework proposed by <ref type="bibr">Dufau et al.</ref> possibly by means of an evidence-based adjustment of expected lexical evidence should be the topic of future (simulation) studies.</s></p><p><s>A major difference between our results and previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(New et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ferrand et al., 2011)</ref> of facilitatory effects of length on lexical decision is that the effect in our data is only apparent on the level of DM parameters and not in raw RTs.</s><s>A definitive explanation of these different patterns would require further comparisons between regression approaches and DM results.</s><s>However, as our data suggest that the overall effect on mean RTs results from interplay of facilitation at the level of drift rates and inhibition in non-decision time, we can speculate that these two effects may be differently affected by contextual or language-specific factors.</s><s>The overall pattern of RTs could then vary from inhibitory effects to facilitatory, as has been reported in the past (inhibitory effects: O'Regan and Jacobs, 1992; null effects of length in lexical decision: <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Frederiksen and Kroll, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr">facilitatory effects: Ferrand et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The diffusion model approach has major advantages over conventional measurement models of mean RTs.</s><s>By fitting the complete RT distributions for correct and erroneous responses, the model estimates several latent subcomponents of the decision process.</s><s>It provides thus novel predictions that can be used to advance the development of computational process models of visual word recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jacobs and Grainger, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grainger and Jacobs, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Perry et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the results of the present study demonstrate that conventional analysis methods are too crude to provide a sufficient resolution for understanding of length effects, which require a mathematical decomposition of the underlying processes.</s><s>This can inspire future research using full process modeling of the decision process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grainger and Jacobs, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Perry et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hofmann and Jacobs, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the hierarchical approach to diffusion modeling adopted here <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Vandekerckhove et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Krypotos et al., 2014)</ref> allows fitting the diffusion model at the single subject level, despite the sparseness of the data set.</s><s>This approach enables the comparison between parameters of the diffusion model in different conditions and an analysis of individual differences in small and medium sized data setsan endeavor that until now was limited to large scale projects, such as the English lexicon project <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Yap et al., 2012</ref>).</s><s>We provide the example code for defining and fitting our model in the supplementary online material, in the hope to provide valuable support for researchers with interest in diffusion modeling.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>The contradictory findings on the length effect in lexical decision have attracted a great deal of speculation.</s><s>The magnitude and direction of the length effect have been associated with factors such as orthographic depth, stimulus type, and contextual information in terms of stimulus list composition as well as statistical properties of the languages under study.</s><s>Here we use a novel approach, hierarchical diffusion modeling, to tackle the effects of stimulus length on different subcomponents of the lexical decision process.</s><s>Our findings shed light on the dual nature of length effects, disclosing an inhibitory effect on perceptual encoding but a facilitatory effect on lexical-activationbased decision.</s><s>Moreover, our data provide a comparison between length effects in the native and foreign languages of bilinguals and show that while these are qualitatively similar, properties of the native language appear to determine processing in the L2.</s></p></div>
