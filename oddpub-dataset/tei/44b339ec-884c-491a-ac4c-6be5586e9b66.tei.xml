<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Autoinflammatory diseases cause systemic inflammation which can result in damage to multiple organs.</s><s>Organ damage can occur before the start of therapy, or when patients experience ongoing inflammation.</s><s>A validated instrument to measure damage is essential to quantify damage in individual patients, and to compare disease outcomes in clinical studies.</s><s>At this moment, there is no such instrument.</s><s>In the context of the RaDiCEA project, a common damage index for Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) and Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) will be developed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p><s>To develop an autoinflammatory disease damage index (ADDI).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The ADDI will be developed by consensus building based on the Delphi method.</s><s>The top 40 enrollers of autoinflammatory disease patients in the Eurofever registry, were invited to take part in the expert group, as well as nine important experts from the Americas.</s><s>A systematic literature search for damage in autoinflammatory diseases was performed to establish possible damage items.</s><s>These items were rated by the experts in an online survey.</s><s>Experts could also provide new damage items that were not found in the literature.</s><s>Furthermore, in close collaboration with the Autoinflammatory Alliance, twenty-two patients and parents of patients were asked to rate damage items from the literature and to suggest other damage items.</s><s>Based on the comments and suggestions of experts and patients, the damage items will be adapted; multiple rounds of online surveys will be performed to reach consensus.</s><s>The final damage index will be determined in a face-to-face consensus meeting.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Fifty-seven possible damage items from the literature were selected for the online survey.</s><s>Forty of forty-nine experts completed the first round of the online survey.</s><s>Based on the first round, five items were excluded and seventeen new items were suggested by experts.</s><s>Twenty-one patients completed the online survey.</s><s>Patients suggested nineteen new items, for example learning disabilities, chronic fatigue and speech development delay.</s><s>The second round will be adapted based on these results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>An instrument to measure damage caused by autoinflammatory diseases (ADDI) will be developed based on the Delphi consensus procedure, including online surveys and a consensus meeting.</s><s>Patients fulfil a significant role in this process.</s></p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">Â© 2015 Annink et al.
