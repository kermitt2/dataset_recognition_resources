<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BMI</head><p><s>In our trial a BMI 525 at baseline resulted in a significantly reduced risk of developing clinically relevant depression with INF treatment.</s><s>Obesity is one of the core characteristics that has been associated with lower sustained viral response rates in patients with chronic hepatitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">38</ref> and might be associated with a higher relapse rate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">39</ref></s><s>Therapy with IFN-a in these patients might have less clinical antiviral effects, resulting in lower rates of neuropsychiatric side-effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Although the present study generally supports the utility of the TMT as a screening tool for HCV patients before the beginning of IFN therapy, further investigations are clearly required.</s><s>For example, additional cognitive tests should be conducted in future studies to evaluate whether other cognitive functions also predict severe IFN-associated depression (for example, attention or memory).</s><s>A more extensive evaluation would provide a stronger and more rigorous basis for assessing the potential impact of cognitive functions at the beginning of INF therapy in relation to INF-associated depression.</s><s>Although a reasonable number of patients was included, numbers did not allow for a more precise identification of risk factors for developing DSM-IV major depressive episodes or severe depression (MADRS 525).</s><s>Finally, multiple testing might limit the results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p><s>In summary, our data demonstrate that pre-existing subclinical depressive mood significantly increases the risk of clinically relevant IFN-associated depressive syndromes in patients without a history of psychiatric disorders.</s><s>Mild cognitive disturbances are an independent risk factor for the development of severe depression.</s><s>Scoring on the MADRS single items reported sadness, loss of concentration, pessimistic thoughts and reduced sleep prior to treatment, or a MADRS total score 43 at baseline may identify patients at risk of treatment-emergent depression.</s><s>Pre-emptive treatment with antidepressants is recommended in these high-risk patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 2 Decision tree analyses using single symptom items on the Montgomery-A ˚sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to predict interferon-alpha (INF-a)-induced depression during antiviral treatment.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
