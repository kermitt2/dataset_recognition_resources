<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: There is a large body of experimental evidence suggesting that omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are capable of modulating immune function.</s><s>Some studies have shown that these PUFAs might have a beneficial effect in patients suffering form multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).</s><s>This could be due to increased n-3 PUFA-derived anti-inflammatory lipid mediators.</s><s>In the present study we tested the effect of an endogenously increased n-3 PUFA status on cuprizone-induced CNS demyelination and remyelination in fat-1 mice versus their wild-type (wt) littermates.</s><s>Fat-1 mice express an n-3 desaturase, which allows them to convert n-6 PUFAs into n-3 PUFAs.</s></p><p><s>Results: CNS lipid profiles in fat-1 mice showed a significant increase of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels but similar docosahexaenoic acid levels compared to wt littermates.</s><s>This was also reflected in significantly higher levels of monohydroxy EPA metabolites such as 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE) in fat-1 brain tissue.</s><s>Feeding fat-1 mice and wt littermates 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks caused a similar degree of CNS demyelination in both groups; remyelination was increased in the fat-1 group after a recovery period of 2 weeks.</s><s>However, at p = 0.07 this difference missed statistical significance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>These results indicate that n-3 PUFAs might have a role in promotion of remyelination after toxic injury to CNS oligodendrocytes.</s><s>This might occur either via modulation of the immune system or via a direct effect on oligodendrocytes or neurons through EPA-derived lipid metabolites such as 18-HEPE.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS.</s><s>In the Western world it is the main cause of disability in young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> surpassed only by trauma, yet its aetiology remains elusive.</s><s>Recent research has acknowledged that even at its onset MS is a neurodegenerative disease with irreversible damage to axons and neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Although the precise mechanism responsible for neuronal loss is not known, the two main risk factors for injurious processes are inflammation and demyelination.</s></p><p><s>However, recent evidence suggests that the inflammatory response to demyelination is not just a risk factor for neuronal loss, but also a necessary condition for remyelination <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that inflammation enhances remyelination via direct effects on oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) survival, migration and differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Also, the presence of myelin debris in CNS tissue inhibits remyelination by OPCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Hence the presence of activated macrophages that clear this debris is essential for remyelination.</s><s>Furthermore, activated macrophages are also capable of inducing OPCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>This Janus-face of inflammation has resulted in the distinction between destructive and protective Open Access inflammation, where protective inflammation is associated with enhanced remyelination and reduced neuronal loss.</s></p><p><s>Despite promising initial results, all recently developed drugs that tried to address these new findings have been unable to stop disease progression or to exert neuroprotection or even neuroregeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Instead, some of the newly developed drugs had adverse side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> or unexpected drug interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>There are some suggestions that diets which are high in n-3 PUFAs and low in saturated fatty acids might stabilize disease in MS patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>The rationale behind this approach is that n-3 PUFAs via their lipid mediators that are also known as resolvins and protectins <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, might modulate the destructive autoinflammatory response.</s><s>However, empirical evidence supporting this advice is limited.</s><s>In a Cochrane review of randomized trials of dietary interventions for MS, Farinotti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> could not find a significant effect of neither omega-6 (n-6) nor n-3 PUFAs on disease progression nor relapse rate.</s><s>By contrast, a recent epidemiological study from Australia suggested that the risk for central nervous system demyelination is reduced in people with a higher intake of omega-3 PUFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There have been many studies in rodents looking at the anti-inflammatory effect of PUFAs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model for MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, in all these studies the focus was on n-6 PUFAs only.</s><s>So far only one study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> has used the cuprizone model for the study of the n-3 PUFA effect in neural demyelination and remyelination and found that a diet high in salmon fish oil protected from demyelination and increased remyelination <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We set out to confirm the results of this first n-3 PUFA cuprizone study in the fat-1 mouse model.</s><s>This mouse, by expressing fat-1 n-3 PUFA desaturase from C. elegans, can endogenously synthesize n-3 PUFA from n-6 PUFA without using dietary supplementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> thus eliminating confounding factors of diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>These mice were recently used in several models of neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, epilepsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and stroke-related brain injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In all models, when compared to wt littermates, they were protected from neuronal damage.</s><s>Using the fat-1 model, the cuprizone model of demyelination is superior to the EAE model, because in EAE the priming and proliferation of autoreactive T-cells might already be impeded by the differences in n-3 PUFA tissue status.</s></p></div>

the brain there was no difference in the amount of demyelination between fat-1 and the wt animals, possibly reflecting the fact that additional n-3 PUFA synthesis in fat-1 mice was not able to confer an additional protective effect on top of the already high n-3 PUFA levels in wt brains.</s><s>However, we saw improved remyelination in fat-1 mice; but this difference missed statistical significance at p = 0.07.</s><s>Given our relatively small sample size with an average group size of 5 animals statistical significance might be reached by increasing case numbers.</s><s>Thus the data presented here suggest that an increased n-3 PUFA tissue status might lead to a mild beneficial effect of n-3 PUFAs on in vivo CNS remyelination in mice.</s></p><p><s>Our data are only partially consistent with previous data on the effect of n-3 PUFA in the cuprizone model of demyelination.</s><s>Torkildsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> had tested the effect of diets with different compositions of PUFAs on de-and remyelination in C57/BL6 mice with cuprizone-induced demyelination.</s><s>They found that mice receiving a salmonbased diet suffered less demyelination in response to cuprizone than those on a cod liver or soybean oil diet and saw no differences in the degree of remyelination.</s><s>The three different diets that were tested in Torkildsen's study differed in the lipid source of their 4% lipid content.</s><s>One diet contained its lipids from salmon fillets with an unknown n-3 PUFA content, the other from cod liver oil (with approx.</s><s>24 g n-3 PUFAs/100 ml cod liver oil, of which 12 g DHA and 8 g EPA) and the third from soybean oil (with approx.</s><s>50 g linoleic acid/100 ml soybean oil).</s><s>Mice were started on one of these diets at four weeks of age, i.e. 4 weeks prior to cuprizone feeding.</s><s>However, this study lacked direct PUFA measurements in brain tissue.</s></p><p><s>An important point of our study is that we quantified actual differences in PUFA tissue status both in the tail and in the CNS.</s><s>Interestingly, despite small differences in the FA profile of wt and fat-1 animal brains, we were able to see differences in the degree of remyelination between these groups.</s><s>One possibility that would explain this finding is that despite similar AA and DHA profiles in the brain, there might be differences in the EPAderived lipid mediators that are produced in the course of cuprizone-induced de-and remyelination.</s><s>In this study we only established baseline measurements of hydroxyl metabolites, in which there was no difference for the DHA-derived metabolites but significant differences for the EPA-derived 18-HEPE.</s></p><p><s>Our finding of increased levels of EPA-derived 18-HEPE in the brain of fat-1 versus wt mice could be interpreted in the light of other recent studies of 18-HEPE.</s><s>Endo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> showed that in fat-1 mice there is a selective enrichment of EPA in fat-1 transgenic bone marrow cells and EPA-metabolite 18-HEPE in fat-1 transgenic macrophages.</s><s>Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that an 18-HEPE-rich environment through transplantation of fat-1 transgenic bone marrow prevented macrophage-mediated cardiac remodelling via cardiac fibroblasts.</s><s>This anti-fibrotic effect of 18-HEPE on cardiac fibroblasts was reproduced in vivo and in vitro.</s><s>Similarly, in a study on murine macrophages 18-HEPE was able to significantly decrease macrophages' TNF-alpha formation in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While there might be a tight regulation of DHA levels in the CNS, differences in EPA levels might thus lead to significant changes in anti-inflammatory lipid metabolites in the brain.</s><s>Therefore, a possible explanation for the protective effect of an n-3 PUFA-enriched tissue status in CNS demyelinating disease could be a difference particularly in EPA-derived metabolites such as 18-HEPE.</s><s>Based on the data from Torkildsen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, these could affect mainly macrophage function, although further experiments might be necessary to assess also the role of astrocytes in this model.</s><s>Future studies will now have to assess the activity and function of macrophages/microglia found at the sites of CNS injury in the cuprizone model and to understand the effect of EPA on activity of these cells.</s></p><p><s>As compared to our analysis in mice, a meta-analysis by Farinotti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> has concluded that n-3 PUFAs did not have an effect on 292 patients with relapsing remitting MS.</s><s>However, there are several arguments why a positive effect of n-3 PUFAs on remyelination in patients suffering from MS might not have shown up in the two studies that were evaluated by Farinotti and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>: Patients in both studies received EPA at 1.71 and 1.98 g/d and DHA at 1.14 and 1.32 g/d, (which is well above the general dietary recommendations by most nutritional guidelines).</s><s>Both studies found that there was a rise in EPA serum level in patients receiving fish oil compared to olive oil.</s><s>While Weinstock-Guttman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> in their 1-year study found that EPA levels at 6 and 9 months correlated with disability at 12 months, Bates et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> found a non-significant trend between higher EPA and DHA levels due to fish oil supplements and lower disability in MS patients following two years of dietary intervention.</s><s>Only Bates et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> checked for effective uptake of PUFAs into adipose tissue.</s><s>While there was a significant increase in EPA and DHA in adipose tissue as early as 6 months after supplementation, most of the change was only seen at 2 years on therapeutic intervention.</s><s>Hence, it would be essential in any interventional study to check for effective uptake of n-3 PUFAs into relevant tissue and to choose an appropriate time frame accordingly.</s><s>The data from Bates et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> suggests that the time frame that was chosen in those studies might have been too short.</s><s>Also, it is necessary to define what the relevant tissue is, i.e. whether differences in lipid profiles in the CNS, in adipose tissue or in immune cells confer those potential benefits.</s><s>Next, a recent epidemiological study from Australia with 267 cases and 517 controls showed a reduced risk of CNS demyelination with higher intake of omega-3 PUFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, there is the possibility that isolated n-3 PUFA supplementation might not exert the same benefit as n-3 PUFAs derived from natural nutrition.</s><s>The data from Torkildsen et al. suggests that salmon-derived n-3 PUFA might be superior to cod-liver oil <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Given these limitations, and as concluded by Farinotti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, future studies will be necessary to settle the question of an n-3 PUFA effect in MS.</s><s>This underscores that the topic of n-3 PUFA supplementation in MS warrants further investigation.</s></p><p><s>Given that our observation of increased remyelination due to increased n-3 PUFA tissue content narrowly missed significance, future mouse studies are Atlas, an area of 300,000 square pixels of corpus callosum tissue was selected.</s><s>Within this area, the area that stained positive for myelin was selected and quantified in square pixels.</s><s>From these, mean values (±SEM) were calculated for each treatment group also warranted to further establish this effect in a larger cohort of mice in the cuprizone model, as well as in other experimental MS models such as EAE.</s></p></div>
