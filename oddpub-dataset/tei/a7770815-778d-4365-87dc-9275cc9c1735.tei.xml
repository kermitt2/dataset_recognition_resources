<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The presence of a pacemaker (PM) or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system has long been considered an absolute contraindication for MR imaging (MRI).</s><s>However, various studies in the last 15 years have been able to show that it is possible to perform MR examinations with an acceptable level of risk in patients with conventional PM/ICD systems taking into consideration the individual risk/benefit profile as a single-case decision and as "off-label" use and applying specific safety precautions <ref type="bibr">[1 -20]</ref>.</s><s>In 2008, a European position paper regarding this topic with participation of corresponding expert groups from cardiology and radiology was published and the presence of PM/ICD systems was newly classified as a relative MR contraindication <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the same year MR conditional or MR compatible pacemaker systems were introduced for the first time and are now offered by all major pacemaker manufacturers.</s><s>These systemsdefined as a functional unit composed of the pacemaker pulse generator, leads, and a software-based MR protection modeare tested and approved for MR examination under certain conditions.</s></p><p><s>Experience in recent years in Germany has shown that use of the systems varies greatly.</s><s>While some specialized centers perform MR examinations as an off-label procedure even in patients with conventional PM/ICD systems with a corresponding indication under the recommended specific safety precautions, many MR facilities refuse to investigate patients with pacemakers or ICDs, even those with MR conditional systems.</s><s>One reason for this is a significant lack of information and legal uncertainty on the part of both radiology and cardiology with respect to the concrete handling of these new developments and this technically complex and interdisciplinary issue in the clinical setting.</s></p><p><s>Updated recommendations/guidelines regarding this topic were published in 2013 by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and in 2015 by the German Roentgen Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> but relate, particularly in the ESC publication, to the own specialty and do not provide a procedure that has been coordinated and approved by both societies.</s></p><p><s>This joint consensus paper of the German Roentgen Society and the German Cardiac Society provides physical and electrophysiological background information and specific recommendations for the procedural management of patients with PMs and ICDs, outlining the responsibilities of radiology and cardiology regarding patient education, indications, and monitoring with PM/ICD reprogramming being discussed in particular.</s></p><p><s>The following recommendations relate to the total clinical spectrum of MR examinations.</s><s>Cardiac MR, which represents only a relatively small percentage of the total number of MR examinations but is becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of cardiac diseases, is discussed separately.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MR imaging in patients with active cardiac implantsphysical and electrophysiological background</head><p><s>There can be interactions between active cardiac implants (i.</s><s>e., PMs and ICDs) and MR scanners that can be attributed to an interaction with the electromagnetic fields in the MR system, i. e., the static magnetic field (B 0 ), the gradient fields (G x , G y , G z ), and the high-frequency fields (B 1 ).</s></p><p><s>The static magnetic field has a field strength of 0.5 -3.0 Tesla in most clinical MR systems and is necessary to polarize the spins of hydrogen protons and thus to achieve nuclear magnetization.</s><s>This strong magnetic field affects the ferromagnetic components of the implant.</s><s>This results in an attractive force that is at its maximum in the immediate vicinity of the MR system in the region of the opening of the MR tunnel as well as a torque that is at its maximum in the center of the MR tunnel.</s><s>These forces can result in paresthesia in individual cases in the region of the pacemaker pocket in older pacemaker models but are not large enough to dislocate ingrown PM/ICD systems or leads.</s><s>In modern active cardiac implants, the ferromagnetic components have been largely reduced so that the effective forces have been decreased by a factor of approximately 10 and are lower than the gravitational forces acting on them <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Older pacemakers and ICDs use a mechanical switch, known as the reed switch, as a control element.</s><s>These reed switches are activated (closed) by a weak magnetic field in the form of a hand magnet, resulting in a mode switch to the asynchronous stimulation mode (D00 or V00) with deactivation of the sensing function in pacemakers and in deactivation of tachycardia detection in ICDs.</s><s>However, these reed switches do not function properly in the strong static magnetic fields of MR systems.</s><s>Since the torque effect predominates here, 50 % of switches remain deactivated (open) under consideration of all possible spatial orientations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Since the behavior of the reed switch in the individual case cannot be predicted, there is a potential safety risk during an MR examination, e. g. due to uncontrolled asynchronous stimulation.</s><s>In current devices and in particular in all MR conditional devices, Hall sensors are used instead of mechanical reed switches as the magnetic field detectors which function properly even in strong static magnetic fields.</s></p><p><s>Movement in the static magnetic field as well as voltages induced by the gradient and high-frequency fields can result in an electrical reset in older conventional devices with activation of an emergency mode (typically VVI).</s><s>This can result in suboptimal pacing since individual stimulation parameters or protective antitachycardiac functions will be reset.</s><s>According to current data, these electrical resets, which represent a potential safety risk, no longer occur in MR conditional pacemakers due to modifications and improved protection of the internal circuits.</s></p><p><s>The gradient fields are active during MR imaging to achieve spatial encoding of the MR signal.</s><s>They have maximum slopes up to 80 mT/m and can be activated and deactivated in the submillisecond range (slew rate up to 200 T/m/s).</s><s>The gradient fields are therefore temporally variable electromagnetic fields and can induce voltage pulses in the leads.</s><s>This can be perceived by the PM/ICD system as intrinsic action of the heart with consecutive inhibition of PM stimulation or in the worst case can lead to a stimulation pulse with asynchronous myocardium stimulation.</s><s>According to current data, the risk of cardiac stimulation is largely ruled out in the case of MR conditional pacemakers as a result of modifications to the electrical filters and protective circuits in the system.</s></p><p><s>The most complex and most significant interactions occur between the implant and the radiofrequency field of the MR unit.</s><s>The radiofrequency field is necessary to excite the hydrogen protons to generate the MR signal.</s><s>The frequency of these field referred to as high frequency (HF) or radio frequency (RF) depends on the magnetic flow density based on the gyromagnetic ratio and has magnetic field strengths of approximately 64 MHz at 1.5 Tesla respectively 128 MHz at 3.0 Tesla.</s><s>These RF fields are electromagnetic waves and therefore possess in addition to the magnetic field an electrical field component that can interact with the conductive lead of the implant.</s><s>The wave length of the RF field in the human body is approximately 50 cm at 1.5 Tesla and 25 cm at 3.0 Tesla due to the high dielectricity constant of human tissue.</s><s>If PM or ICD leads have a length of whole or half-integral multiples of the wave length of the RF field, resonance effects can result in particularly high energy deposition at the lead tips.</s><s>Like an antenna, the lead can receive the RF signal, locally intensify it and transmit its energy to the lead tip and from there to the heart muscle tissue resulting in thermal tissue damage and irreversible pacing capture threshold increases.</s><s>The level of energy absorption and transmission to the tissue depends on many factors, such as the position and path of the lead in the patient, the position of the patient in the MR system, the design and insulation of the lead and the electrical design of the RF transmitter coil used in the system.</s><s>In phantom experiments with clinically realistic system-lead configurations as well as in animal experiments, it was shown that the RF field can induce a significant temperature increase (ΔT up to 65°C) at the lead tip with the leads in certain positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, it was shown that the coupling of a pacemaker pulse generator to the lead tends to reduce the RF-induced heating of the electrode tip.</s><s>This is important, for example, when implanted leads must be disconnected (abandoned leads), which further increases the risk of potential heating of the leads.</s></p><p><s>Although the frequency of the RF field is much too high to result in direct depolarization of the cardiac muscle cell and thus cardiac contraction, rectification processes, e. g. via the nonlinear response of a protective diode in the system, are fundamentally possible.</s><s>This may result in cardiac stimulation and the induction of ventricular tachycardia.</s><s>Moreover, the RF field during these rectification processessimilarly to gradient fieldscan result in inhibition of the pacemaker and erroneous tachycardia therapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Incidence of complications of MR imaging in pacemaker and ICD patients</head><p><s>The real incidence of complications in MR examinations of patients with PM or ICD systems cannot be determined from real world data or register data since MR examinations in these patients were absolutely contraindicated until recently.</s><s>There are only individual reports of complications from case reports of patients who underwent an MR examination without specific safety precautions because the physician was unaware of the presence of a pacemaker/ICD system.</s><s>This includes at least 7 cases with a fatal outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Both the true number of MR-related complications and the reference value, namely the total number of patients who underwent such an "accidental" MR examination, are not known.</s></p><p><s>Alternatively, it is possible to use the controlled studies in which PM/ICD patients underwent an MR examination under dedicated safety precautions and after detailed review of pacemaker function.</s></p><p><s>Under these controlled conditions, clinically relevant complications (bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia requiring treatment, lead dysfunction with the need for lead revision, damage to components or the total integrity of the pacemaker with the need to replace the system, myocardial infarction, pericardium perforation, death) were not reported in any of these studies with a cumulative total number of over 1000 patients.</s></p><p><s>However, various MR-induced effects that did not endanger patient safety were observed.</s><s>The following should be mentioned here:</s></p><p><s>Before and after MR examination, statistically significant but very small and clinically irrelevant changes in the pacing capture threshold, impedance, and battery voltage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> could be observed in pacemaker patients and lengthening of the charging time and a decrease in battery voltage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> were seen in ICD patients.</s><s>A small (&lt; 20 %) change in amplitude in the right atrium and right ventricle was observed in approximately 80 % and 90 % of device patients, respectively.</s></p><p><s>With respect to MR conditional PM and ICD systems, there are multiple prospective randomized clinical studies about the MR safety of these active cardiac devices.</s><s>Clinically relevant MR-related events or complications have not been reported in any of these studies <ref type="bibr">[29 -32]</ref>.</s></p></div>
