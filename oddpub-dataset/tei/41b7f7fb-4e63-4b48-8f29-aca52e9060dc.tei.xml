<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>The existence of multiple conformational substates of G-protein-coupled receptors in equilibrium may provide for the interaction with multiple partners at the same interface.</s><s>Here we provide evidence that photoactivated rhodopsin exists in a manifold of conformational substates in a lipid environment, but not in the extensively studied dodecyl maltoside detergent micelles.</s><s>Moreover, the photoactivated state decays spontaneously to the inactive state on a timescale of minutes.</s><s>Remarkably, binding of the activated receptor to the cognate G protein strongly biases the receptor to an interacting state that retains more than one conformation, suggesting flexibility in the complex.</s><s>liposomes, and EPR spectral lineshape analysis suggested the presence of alternative conformations of the receptor in both the inactive and activated state in lipid bilayers, with shifts in populations upon activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Although these studies indicated a greater complexity in the rhodopsin energy landscape than that inferred from crystal structures of the receptor, EPR spectral lineshapes give only a qualitative picture of conformational changes.</s><s>For example, the lineshapes can be degenerate with respect to the number of states present, and, most importantly, contain no information on the magnitude of structural changes that correspond to the detected conformations.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, high-resolution SDSL-DEER distance mapping using pairs of spin labels is used to monitor the positions of TM5, TM6, and TM7 of rhodopsin in DDM and in phospholipid nanodiscs in which the receptor has properties similar to those in native membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>Distance mapping with DEER overcomes the limitations in CW lineshape analysis and provides a length scale to the energy landscape.</s><s>Spin label sites to monitor the helix positions are located on the outer surface of the helices to avoid structural perturbations and are the same sites used in the earlier DEER distance mapping of rhodopsin in DDM solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>The behavior of activated rhodopsin in a lipid bilayer environment is of primary interest here, but a comparison with DDM provides a perspective on the influence of the lipid environment.</s><s>The DEER data obtained here for rhodopsin in DDM are in excellent agreement with the study of Altenbach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, but recent advances in instrumentation (28) (Q band vs. X band) and data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> permit increased resolution of details in the distance distributions.</s></p><p><s>In DDM the photoactivated receptor appears to be in a dominant single conformation with positions of TM5, TM6, and TM7 in good agreement with crystal structures of the activated state.</s><s>However, in nanodiscs multiple discrete components are resolved, and the relative populations are strongly pH-dependent, indicating that the conformations are in equilibrium.</s><s>In DDM, the distance distributions are only weakly dependent on pH.</s><s>Remarkably, in nanodiscs but not DDM, the manifold of conformations in the activated state spontaneously relaxes on a minute timescale to the conformation characteristic of the inactive receptor.</s><s>In the inactive receptor in both DDM and nanodiscs, dominant populations of TM6 and TM7 are at positions consistent with crystal structures of the inactive state, but also visit positions of low probability similar to those in the activated receptor structure.</s></p><p><s>The cytoplasmic ends of helices TM6 and TM7 are apparently involved in the recognition of the G protein, arrestin, and kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, and the conformational heterogeneity in these regions of the activated receptor in nanodiscs may be involved in selective recognition of these or other binding partners.</s><s>Indeed, the binding of a G protein is shown to select a particular receptor structure that itself has multiple conformations, suggesting flexibility in the complex.</s></p></div>

30, 29, and 29 Å, respectively) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>However, the distributions are not monomodal, but have satellite components of lower population that appear as shoulders on the main peak (dashed lines, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>This is particularly evident in the distribution for TM6.</s><s>The significance of these satellite peaks will be discussed below.</s><s>Overall, the distance distributions are relatively similar in DDM and nanodiscs in the inactive receptor, but the satellite populations are suppressed in nanodiscs relative to DDM.</s></p><p><s>In the photoactivated receptor, dramatic differences between the conformations in DDM and nanodiscs become apparent.</s><s>The smallest difference is for TM5, where after photoactivation in DDM the distance distribution shifts to a longer distance by ∼1 Å to a position corresponding to the shoulder in the distribution of the inactive state.</s><s>This small change reproduces that previously reported and emphasizes the reproducibility and high resolution of the DEER distance mapping.</s><s>In nanodiscs, the change due to activation is absent.</s><s>Thus, in nanodiscs, both TM2 and TM5 at the level of sites 74 and 225, respectively, do not move upon activation.</s><s>The very small change in DDM could be due either to a small movement of 74R1 or 225R1 or both.</s></p><p><s>For TM6 in DDM, activation results in a shift in the population by 5 Å to a longer distance, as previously observed, resulting in a dominant (&gt;90%) relatively broad population centered at 34 Å.</s><s>This position is in good agreement with modeling of R1 in a crystal structure of activated rhodopsin (21) (PDB ID 3PXO; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, this position corresponds to one of the minor components in the inactive state distribution.</s><s>The situation in nanodiscs is strikingly different.</s><s>At pH 6.0, where MIIbH + is reported to be the dominant population in a membrane environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>, the distance distribution for TM6 has three resolved components of comparable populations at positions corresponding to the populations in the inactive state in both DDM and nanodiscs.</s><s>The populations at 29 Å and 34 Å apparently correspond to the inactive and active state crystal structures.</s><s>The shorter distance at 26 Å can be accounted for by a clockwise rotation of TM6 as viewed from the cytoplasmic surface (Discussion).</s></p><p><s>For TM7, the distribution for the inactive receptor in both DDM and nanodiscs is very similar, with a main peak at 29 Å and a poorly resolved shoulder at ∼ 26 Å.</s><s>Upon activation in DDM, the most probable population shifts by ∼ 2-3 Å inward, in good agreement with earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and with comparisons of R1 modeled in crystal structures of the inactive and active receptors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>This new position appears to correspond to the shoulder in the inactive state.</s><s>The situation is similar in nanodiscs, except that a resolved population exists at the position of the inactive receptor.</s></p></div>

target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>Although crystal structures of active and inactive rhodopsin indicate substantial motions of TM5, these changes occur in the cytoplasmic extensions of the helix in the aqueous phase, but not at site 225, consistent with the SDSL-EPR data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>The above features appear to be characteristic of the rhodopsin family of GPCRs based on the available crystal structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>Not seen in the crystal structure of active rhodopsin is that, in a native-like phospholipid environment at low pH where MIIbH + is strongly enriched, the fully activated receptor is apparently in equilibrium between multiple conformations of comparable populations defined by the positions of TM6 and TM7 at the cytoplasmic surface.</s></p><p><s>For TM6 in the activated receptor, two of the three states observed correspond to helix positions in the inactive and active crystal structures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>The third conformation, identified by the short distance at 26 Å, can be accounted for by a clockwise rotation of TM6 by about 40°when it is in the outward position.</s><s>Such a rotation was suggested earlier to explain CW-EPR distance mapping in activated rhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, and a smaller rotation in this sense is in fact present in the crystal structure of activated rhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>It could be argued that the short distance arises from the appearance of a new R1 rotamer of 252R1 caused by a local structure change.</s><s>However, the invariance of the CW lineshape upon activation (17) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) argues against this interpretation because the motion of the nitroxide and hence the lineshape is exquisitely sensitive to the local environment, which would be changed in a new rotamer state.</s><s>One reasonable interpretation of the data is that the three states of TM6 are (i) in the inactive position (TM6°); (ii) tilted outward by 5-6 Å (TM6*); and (iii) tilted outward and rotated clockwise (TM6**).</s><s>For TM7, two states are clearly resolved, each corresponding to positions of TM7 resolved in the inactive and active crystal structures; these are designated TM7°and TM7*.</s><s>From the data presented here, it cannot be determined whether or not the distinct TM6 and TM7 states occur independently or are correlated.</s><s>However, modeling based on crystal structures suggests that an inward motion of TM7 cannot occur without the outward displacement of TM6 to avoid steric clashes in the packed interior of the protein.</s><s>Moreover, the rotation of TM6* to form TM6** may require the inward position of TM7 (TM7*); otherwise, residue 252R1 in TM6 would have steric clashes with residues in TM7 and become immobilized, which is not observed.</s><s>In the context of this model, there would be minimally four conformational states of the receptor, namely {TM6°, TM7°}, {TM6*, TM7°}, {TM6*, TM7*}, and {TM6**, TM7*}.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows schematic representations of these speculative conformations.</s><s>The considerations above argue for an appearance of the conformations in a time-ordered fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>The {TM6**, TM7*} conformation has not been observed previously by optical spectroscopy, and it remains to be determined how it relates to the equilibrium of MII substates.</s></p><p><s>Which of the conformations represents the fully activated receptor with respect to G-protein recognition?</s><s>An answer is provided by the distance distributions with transducin bound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>The G protein apparently selects predominantly the state designated {TM6*, TM7*}.</s><s>However, within the context of the models presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, there must also be smaller populations of {TM6**, TM7*} and {TM6*, TM7°} present to account for the other distances observed, suggesting the surprising result that the helices remain in exchange between more than one state even in the G-protein-bound state.</s><s>The formation of the complex is apparently complete in the nanodisc, based on the reduction of the major population at the distance corresponding to the inactive state.</s><s>In addition, earlier studies of transducin binding to activated rhodopsin in nanodiscs showed that complex formation is complete under the conditions used here <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it is tentatively concluded that the presence of multiple populations in the complex is not due to incomplete complex formation but rather to flexibility of the structure within the complex itself.</s></p><p><s>Rhodopsin in Nanodiscs: The Inactive State.</s><s>Interestingly, even with the 11-cis retinal inverse agonist bound in the inactive receptor, three populations of TM6 and two of TM7 are detected at the same distances found in the active state, although those corresponding to TM6*, TM6**, and TM7* are strongly suppressed and are revealed only as shoulders in the distance distribution.</s><s>The apo protein opsin is formed upon retinal dissociation, and the active structure relaxes spontaneously to one essentially identical to the inactive state with respect to the distances mapped.</s><s>Nevertheless, neither the inactive receptor nor opsin activate transducin, indicating that additional requirements must be met for recognition of the G protein.</s><s>Such a requirement could be for a coordinated fluctuation of the helices with a lifetime sufficiently long to form a collision complex or, alternatively, the release of additional constraints on the structure due to retinal isomerization.</s><s>The pH independence of the populations in the inactive state favors the latter interpretation.</s><s>Earlier studies reported by Kim et al. found that certain mutations could displace the cytoplasmic regions of the helices without activation of the G protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>Collectively, these results suggest a weak coupling of the ligand-binding site with the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor.</s><s>A model consistent with the data is that the cytoplasmic terminations of the helices in the inactive state are flexible and can visit alternative conformations similar to those in the activated state, but additional changes due to agonist binding are required for a productive complex.</s><s>At least one of the additional changes must be in the region of Glu134, the protonation site leading to the formation of MIIbH + .</s><s>This follows from the pH independence of the conformations in the inactive state.</s></p><p><s>In the β 2 adrenergic receptor and the adenosine A 2A receptor, multiple conformations were found in both the unliganded protein and with an inverse agonist bound, also suggesting a weak coupling of the cytoplasmic surface with the ligand-binding site <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Rhodopsin in DDM.</s><s>Remarkably, distances corresponding to the three states of TM6 and two of TM7 are also observed in the inactive receptor in DDM.</s><s>This situation cannot be accounted for by some fraction of inadvertently activated receptor because in DDM the activated state does not reveal the three populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the spectral ratio A280/A500 ∼ 1.6 for the purified receptor in DDM solution is characteristic of pure inactive rhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the activated state with the all-trans retinal agonist bound, there is a dominant state with a most probable distance corresponding to the fully activated state observed in the corresponding crystal structure, but the distribution is relatively broad.</s><s>On the timescale where the structure spontaneously decays to the inactive state in nanodiscs, little change in the most probable position of TM6 occurs, but the distribution becomes increasingly broad, indicating an increased conformational heterogeneity, possibly due to local unfolding.</s></p><p><s>The unique behavior of activated rhodopsin in DDM relative to bilayers may be related to binding of detergent monomers to protein surface sites or cavities to stabilize a particular conformation, but apparently not to the retinal binding site <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</s><s>An In each model, the dashed line is the interspin distance between nitroxides of R1, which was modeled using known rotamers of R1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>Data analysis suggests that the G protein selects TM6* and TM7* as dominant populations.</s></p><p><s>alternative (but not mutually exclusive) thermodynamic model posits that the conformations of the protein may be determined by an interfacial tension between the protein and detergent or lipid environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>.</s><s>If a detergent or lipid interacts more strongly with itself than with the protein, the interfacial tension is positive, leading to a compressive force on the protein.</s><s>On the other hand, a more favorable interaction with the protein than with itself leads to a negative tension and an expansion of the protein interfacial area.</s><s>In the context of this simple model, the shift in TM6 toward the inward position in bilayers relative to DDM would be interpreted as a positive interfacial tension in the bilayer, whereas the strong bias to the outward position in DDM would arise from a negative tension.</s><s>The compressive/expansive forces can be large <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Summary.</s><s>The key results presented here are the following: (i) in DDM micelles, the activated receptor is essentially a single conformation, as previously reported, corresponding to a fully activated MIIbH + state; (ii) in nanodiscs, activated rhodopsin exists in a pH-dependent conformational equilibrium between substates of comparable amounts.</s><s>Two of the conformations correspond to the inactive and active crystal structures of the receptor, and the third may involve an additional rotation of TM6; (iii) in both DDM and nanodiscs, the inactive receptor visits active-like conformations with low probability, but additional structural or dynamic requirements must be met for formation of a productive complex; (iv) upon formation of a complex with the G protein in nanodiscs, the position of the conformational equilibrium is strongly shifted to a new state that appears to retain multiple conformations, suggesting flexibility in the complex.</s></p><p><s>The multiple states of activated rhodopsin in nanodiscs may be involved in the recognition of multiple binding partners, and this will be the subject of a
