<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Medicinal plants are the active source of both traditional as well as modern medicines.</s><s>The active compounds present in herbal medicines have the compensations of being joined with several other compounds that seem to be inactive.</s><s>However as compared to isolated and pure active compounds, the bio compounds present in plants give them far superior security and efficiency as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Many studies have been carried out to investigate the antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oil of olive.</s><s>The presented work was conducted to observe the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plant as O. ferruginea against gram positive bacteria, gram negative bacterium and yeast strains.</s><s>From the results it was observed that Gram positive bacteria (B.</s><s>subtilis and S. aureus) were more sensitive as compared to gram negative bacterium (E.</s><s>coli) used.</s><s>The results were well correlated to findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> where gram negative bacterium E. coli was also more resistant to the extracts of S. xanthocarpum.</s><s>It was also observed that methanol extract showed highest inhibitory activity because of its high polarity and it allows extracting all the phenolic compounds.</s><s>In addition, as compared to isolated compounds, extracts can be more   properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>It was also found that n-hexane fraction of leaf of O. ferruginea has higher biological activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria as compared to chloroform and methanol.</s><s>While in our study methanol extract was found to have higher antimicrobial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is observed from present results that active antimicrobial biocompounds could be extracted in ethanol and methanol extracts.</s><s>Except phenolics, bound to insoluble carbohydrates or proteins, most of the compounds extract in methanol or acetone <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In present study, ethanolic and methanolic extractions of O. ferruginea were found to have acceptable antimicrobial activities with respect to reference antibiotic discs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>It was observed in present study that plant extracts showed high inhibitory activity against bacteria in contrast to fungi.</s><s>Previously extracts of Bellis perennis have also shown more activity towards bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, methanolic extract was found more active in our studies which is correlated to results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, methanol extract of H. afficinalis was more active against P. aeruginosa and B. subtillus.</s><s>The antimicrobial activity of plants may be the consequence of presence of wide range of bioactive compounds.</s><s>Plant extracts comprise many polyphenols, flavonoids and alkaloids which could be antimicrobial representatives.</s><s>Many studies show the association between antimicrobial activities of plants and the phytochemicals present in them.</s><s>Flavonoids are well known for their antiviral <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, antimicrobial <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and spasmolytic <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> activities.</s><s>Likewise, alkaloids extracted from plants have also shown antimicrobial activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The inhibition of microbial growth may result from the binding of biocompounds to the cell wall.</s></p><p><s>The antioxidant activity of plants and their natural products is widely evaluated by using scavenging activity for free radicals of 1.1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH).The methanol extract of stem bark of O. ferruginea showed higher radical scavenging activity (73.97 ± 0.02) followed by ethanol and chloroform extracts.</s><s>Overall, methanol extracts have shown higher antioxidant activity.</s><s>It has already been proven that phenolic compounds are best extracted in ethanol and methanol solvents <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Total phenolic content was found higher in methanol extract as compared to ethanol and chloroform extracts.</s><s>Therefore, it can be easily assume that DPPH free radical scavenging activity is corresponded to present of bioactive compounds like phenols, as methanol extract showed highest antioxidant activity.</s><s>A significant variation was found in total phenolic content among the different extracts of stem bark and leaf extract of O. ferruginea.</s><s>Free radicals such as superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl and singly oxygen play a vital role in many disease conditions.</s><s>Herbal drugs, comprising free radical scavengers, are getting prominence in treating such diseases.</s></p><p><s>Many plants shows competent antioxidant properties due to presence of phytochemicals including phenolic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The amount or concentration of substrate causes 50% loss of the DPPH activity is known as its IC50 and it is calculated by plotting a linear regression of antiradical activity in percentage against the amount of compounds tested.</s><s>Methanol extracts showed being the lowest IC50 values which shows highest antioxidant activity.</s><s>As compared to leaves extracts, stem bark extracts of O. ferruginea exhibited significant activity with low IC50 value.</s><s>Moreover, a linear relationship was found between the total polyphenol and the reciprocal of IC50 value, indicating that polyphenols are directly proportional to antioxidant activity.</s><s>Similar results were recorded by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p></div>
