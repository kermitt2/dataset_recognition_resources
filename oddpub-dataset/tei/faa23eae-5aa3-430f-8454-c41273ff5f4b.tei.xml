Soc.</s><s>B 282: 20150228</s></p><p><s>and the trial terminated.</s><s>These trials were introduced in order to ensure that the observers would give priority to the decision.</s><s>On other trials (25%), the observers still made a binary decision, following which an additional stream of eight numbers was presented and the observers were asked to estimate the average value of the entire sequence (16 numbers) using an analogue scale between 0 and 100 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>We label this condition decision-extra-evidence (DEE).</s><s>The remaining 25% of trials were as the DEE trials, except that observers were asked to press the space bar key after the first eight numbers, instead of indicating a binary choice.</s><s>We label this condition, no-decision extra-evidence (NEE).</s><s>All trials were randomly intermixed, and subjects did not know which condition was presented until a response was prompted or the trial terminated (see Material and methods).</s><s>Contrasting the two conditions (DEE/NEE) allows one to distinguish between the different mechanisms that can give rise to a confirmationbias effect.</s><s>While 'reduced-gain' predicts that the reduced sensitivity to the extra-evidence will result in diminished discrimination between different profiles of additional information, the 'value-shift' hypothesis predicts a change in the estimated values in the direction of the decision, without a diminished discrimination between additional values (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>; electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>Observers were able to make accurate decisions (accuracy ¼ 65.7%; t 20 ¼ 12.99; p , 0.0001; as compared to chance level (50%)), and their accuracy increased with the absolute deviation of the sequence's mean from the decisional-criterion (repeated measures ANOVA F 20,100 ¼ 11.43; p , 0.0001; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>, black error bars).</s><s>Further, the final evaluations were well correlated with the actual sequence average (M ¼ 0.49; black circles, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>, lower panel; see the electronic supplementary material for data analysis), indicating that the observers were able to accurately make binary decisions about the sequences as well as to estimate its average value on a continuous scale.</s></p><p><s>The main effect of interest was the difference in the evaluations given under the DEE and the NEE conditions to otherwise identical value sequences.</s><s>We use several complementary measures in order to quantify the difference between DEE and NEE conditions and distinguish between the alternative mechanisms discussed above.</s><s>All these measures indicate a clear effect of the preliminary decision on the final evaluation (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>First, the accuracy of the evaluations (Pearson correlation of evaluations with the sequences' actual means) is lower for the DEE condition as compared to the NEE condition (t 20 ¼ 22.4; p ¼ 0.026; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), suggesting that the decision reduces the efficiency of the subsequentinformation processing.</s><s>Second, we analysed the numerical difference between the evaluations made in trials in which the average additional information is higher than 50 to those made in trials where it is lower than 50 ('spread').</s><s>This measure reflects the difference in estimations that are due to extra evidence.</s><s>We find that in the DEE condition the spread is lower than in the NEE condition (t 20 ¼ 23.79; p ¼ 0.001; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>; this observation is present in 18 of the 21 participants).</s><s>This suggests that in agreement with the predictions of the reduced-gain hypothesis, but not with the value-shift hypothesis, the participants exhibit a diminished sensitivity to the additional information, after making a decision.</s><s>The diminished spread in the DEE condition is not predicted by the value-shift mechanism, since value-shift does not influence the processing of extra-evidence (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>; electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3b</ref>).</s><s>Third, in the DEE condition, participants are less accurate when estimating the average of sequences in which the mean additional information was incongruent to the decision as opposed to sequences, in which the additional information was congruent (t 20 ¼ 22.72; p ¼ 0.013; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>; the same pattern is observed using correlation; Corr_Cong ¼ 0.6; Corr_Incong ¼ 0.18; t 20 ¼ 27.36; p , 0.0005).</s><s>This pattern is not predicted by the value-shift hypothesis (see the electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3c</ref>).</s><s>Forth, when regressing the observers' evaluations on the mean of the first eight-numbers (interval 1) and of the additional eight-numbers (interval 2) from each trial, we find a highly significant interaction between the conditions (DEE, NEE) and the regression coefficients (F 1,20 ¼ 12; p ¼ 0.002; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>; see the electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref> for the full time-course regressions).</s><s>Post hoc comparisons reveal that in the DEE condition, observers are more influenced by information from the first than the second interval (t 20 ¼ 4.43; p , 0.001), while weights do not differ between intervals in the NEE condition (t 20 ¼ 0.78; p ¼ 0.44).</s><s>Taken together, these results demonstrate that human observers lose sensitivity to subsequent information after making a decision.</s><s>An alternative account of these results (reduced-gain in the DEE condition as compared to the NEE condition) is that some participants assume that the evidence of the second stream is not providing any new information and thus stop integrating the information following the preliminary decision and base their evaluations on the first stream alone.</s><s>If few participants were to rely on such a strategy, the group data could show reduced-gain, as an averaging artefact.</s><s>To test this possibility, we tested whether any of the participants ignore the extraevidence in the DEE condition.</s><s>The results confirmed that all participants exhibit a certain degree of sensitivity to the additional information, as reflected by (i) a positive (greater than 0) spread in the DEE condition in 21 out of 21 observers; (ii) a significant ( p , 0.05) regression coefficient for the additional mean (X2) in 20 out of 21 participants ( p ¼ 0.08 for the additional participant); and (iii) all participants (21 out of 21) have made final evaluations that were opposite to their preliminary decision on a substantial fraction of trials (M ¼ 32%; s.d.</s><s>¼ 8%; the minimal observed fraction was 16%); 72% of these 'changes of mind' (M ¼ 23%; s.d.</s><s>¼ 7%) occurred on trials in which the mean of the additional information was incongruent with the participants' preliminary decision.</s><s>These three observations demonstrate that all participants had processed the additional information to a certain (but reduced) extent, and did not assume that the mean of the additional numbers is the same as the preliminary mean.</s></p><p><s>We used computational modelling to tease apart the different potential mechanisms mediating the effects of decision commitment on the evaluation of subsequent evidence (see Material and methods for a full description of the models and the electronic supplementary material for fitting procedures): (i) an unbiased (null-hypothesis) model, whereby all samples of information receive identical weight; (ii) a global reduction in gain for additional information; (iii) a decision-induced value-shift, in which the chosen alternative's value is shifted in the direction of the decision; and (iv) a variant of the gain-reduction, in which gain of additional evidence is selectively reduced only for evidence that is inconsistent with the preliminary decision (we label this model 'selective-gain-reduction').</s><s>All the models were fitted to the observed decisions and evaluations using the maximal likelihood method (see Material and methods).</s><s>We obtained, per each model, best fitting parameters and maximal likelihood estimations.</s><s>Comparison of maximal likelihoods between models support the selective gain-reduction model (congruent_gain ¼ 96%;

see the electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the computational analysis provides support for the global reduction in gain model, closely followed by the selective gain model, suggesting that decisions trigger a reduction in sensitivity to additional information.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b) Change of mind paradigm: reduced-gain leads to preference for early decision</head><p><s>In our second experiment (N ¼ 10), we set out to test for the effects of decision-commitment in a paradigm that allows the observers to explicitly report changes of mind.</s><s>Here we aimed at studying the common situation of making decisions between competing options whose values vary in time, and in which, a while after indicating our choice, we are asked to confirm or change it.</s><s>During this 'suspended' timewindow, additional evidence contradicting our preliminary choice may become available.</s></p><p><s>To create a laboratory analogue of this situation, we presented observers with two discs of fluctuating brightness <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>On each trial, one side's brightness level stochastically dominating the other (sides counterbalanced; see Material and methods and the electronic supplementary material for details).</s><s>In the first experimental session, observers were instructed to choose, when ready (free-response protocol), the disc that they believed to have the higher probability of being brighter.</s><s>After making a decision, the fixation-cross turned red for 1.5 s and during this time-period additional information was presented (the perceptual stream continued).</s><s>After 1.5 s of mandatory response suspension, the fixation cross turned green indicating that observers could either confirm, or change their initial decision (information was continuously displayed until the final decision).</s><s>Approximately a week later, the same observers attended a second experimental session, in which the exact same streams of information were 're-played' to them, and they were asked to make a single decision (which disc had an overall higher level of brightness) upon the termination of the complete stream on each trial (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the first experimental session (free-response), observers' accuracy in the preliminary decision was constant across their response-times (RT) quantiles (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>), indicating that they integrated the perceptual evidence to a decisional boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, rather than relying on idiosyncratic strategies, such an internal timer, which would have predicted an increasing accuracy with time (more evidence till timer runs out).</s><s>In order to quantify the influence of the preliminary decision on the integration of additional information, we ran a logistic regression for participants' final choice, using as predictors the perceptual evidence that was presented until the preliminary decision (interval 1) and the evidence following it (interval 2), separately for the two sessions.</s><s>We find a significant interaction between (non-normalized) regression weights in the two sessions (repeated measures ANOVA of interval X session; F 1,9 ¼ 20.12; p ¼ 0.001; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>).</s><s>Post hoc comparisons reveal that in the first experimental session, in which participants made a preliminary decision, more weight is ascribed to the information that preceded the decision as compared to the same information in session II, in which participants did not make a preliminary decision (t 9 ¼ 2.7; p ¼ 0.025).</s><s>Similarly, weight ascribed to additional information in session I, was lower than in session II (t 9 ¼ 22.93; p ¼ 0.017), suggesting that the preliminary decision caused a reduction in the weight assigned to information that followed the decision, as compared to no-decision control.</s></p><p><s>We finally conducted a control experiment (experiment 3; N ¼ 10) to test the possibility that the change in temporal weights is due to an order effect ( participants having done the no-preliminary decision task in a second session).</s><s>We presented each participant with the exact perceptual stream that was presented to one of the experiment 2 participants, in session II.</s><s>We found that the regression-coefficients are very similar to those observed in experiment 2 session II (indicating recency; see the electronic supplementary material, rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc.</s><s>R. Soc.</s><s>B 282: 20150228 figure <ref type="figure">S5</ref>) and are significantly different from the weights obtained in session I (F 1,18 ¼ 5.23; p ¼ 0.035; see the electronic supplementary material).</s></p><p><s>As a complementary measure, we compared the fraction of trials in which participants made a final choice corresponding to the recent information, when this information was incongruent with the preliminary information (i.e.</s><s>trials in which the additional information supports the response opposite to the preliminary choice; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>).</s><s>We found that when making a preliminary decision, participants' final decision is less likely to be in accordance with the incongruent information as compared to situations where the same information is presented, yet no preliminary decision is made (t 9 ¼ 24.1; p ¼ 0.003; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that preliminary decisions affect the processing of subsequent evidence.</s></p><p><s>To distinguish between potential mechanisms underlying this effect of the first decision, we compared four models, corresponding to the models in experiment 1: (i) an unbiased (null-hypothesis) drift-diffusion model (DDM) with a leak parameter (i.e.</s><s>Ornstein -Uhlenbeck diffusion; leak was added in order to account for recency in the no-decision condition; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>); (ii) a global reduction in DDM-gain, in which following a preliminary decision the integrated samples are scaled-down/reduced (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>); (iii) a DDM value-shift, in which the accumulator's value is shifted towards the direction of the preliminary decision (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref> ); and (iv) a selective reduction in gain of additional evidence, whereby sensitivity is reduced only for information that is incongruent with the preliminary decision.</s></p><p><s>As the models are identical in their processing of the predecision evidence, we first fitted all models to the correct and incorrect RT distributions of the preliminary decision and obtained an estimate of the models' three common parameters (internal noise ¼ 4.3; boundary ¼ 107; leak ¼ 0.0005).</s><s>With these parameters, the model accounts well for the accuracy within each RT quantile (black line in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>; see the electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref> for the observed and fitted RT distribution).</s><s>Next, in order to identify the post-decision model-variant and its parameters, we fitted each of the models to the slope of the regression coefficients for the pre-and post-decision evidence observed in the first experimental session (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>, blue line), under the constraint of meeting the observed per cent of trials in which observers changed their choice (7% + 1 s.e.; parameters that predicted a large deviation from the observed fraction of changes of mind were not considered).</s><s>We further assessed the model's predictions for the slope of the regressionweights in session II and for the fraction of trials in which observers responded according to additional incongruent information (generalizability criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the conclusion from the computational modelling of the data of experiment 1, we find that the global reduced-gain model (gain ¼ 0.6) and the selective reduced-gain model (congruent_gain ¼ 1.1; incongruent_gain ¼ 0.7) are the best fitting models that are able to predict the observed data (lines in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a,b</ref>; see the electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref> for the selective reduced-gain fit).</s><s>Conversely, the value-shift model was unable to account for these effects (shift ¼ 20; see the electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The results of the two experiments, combined with the computational analysis, point to a clear effect of decision commitment on the evaluation of, or weight given to, subsequent evidence, which generalizes across domains ( perceptual and numerical) and task contingencies (categorical decisions and continuous evaluations).</s><s>We find that after participants made a preliminary decision, they are less influenced by the subsequent evidence (figures 2d,4a) as compared to situations, in which the same information is presented without making a preliminary decision.</s><s>This effect leads to a deteriorated accuracy (figures 2a,4b) and its magnitude predicts the reduction in accuracy (electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4</ref>).</s><s>Previous behavioural studies have reported similar effects of decision commitment, which were interpreted to imply a cognitive dissonance or a sunk cost mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>However, several different underlying information-processing mechanisms may give rise to commitment effects and it is unclear whether these phenomena are restricted to high-level motivational situations.</s><s>By controlling the accumulation of the evidence before, after and in the absence of categorical decisions, we find that even in simple perceptual and numerical decisions, made in a controlled laboratory setting, observers exhibit commitment effects and confirmation bias.</s><s>Future studies will need to carry out similarly controlled experiments in order to characterize post-decision bias processes, in socially relevant situations, such as evaluating a tournament contender after having already gambled on that contender.</s></p><p><s>More recent work has demonstrated that humans can revise extended actions, which can be interpreted to indicate changes of mind <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>These studies, however, did not control the evidence following a decision, and thus could not quantify confirmation biases or effects.</s><s>By controlling the additional streams of information, we were able to identify the dynamical mechanism that underlies the confirmation bias effects, within a sequential sampling framework.</s><s>Our model comparison reveals that two models provide the best account for these effects: a model in which the preliminary decision reduces global sensitivity to subsequent information (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>) and a model which postulates reduction in gain only for additional information that is incongruent with the preliminary decision.</s><s>This latter variant is consistent with a recent model that assumes dynamic gain modulation during accumulation of evidence which is incongruent with the predicted mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, a model that postulates a shift of value for the chosen alternative (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref>) is unable to account for several of the observed phenomena in both experiments (electronic supplementary material, figures S3 and S8).</s><s>Although simple, this gain-reduction mechanism may be able to account for a wide range of previously reported confirmation bias effects.</s></p><p><s>One objection that may be raised against the decisioninduced global gain-reduction account is that it could reflect a non-specific reduction of arousal, or 'fatigue', after the initial choice.</s><s>This fatigue account might entail a general detriment in information processing following the preliminary decision.</s><s>Importantly, however, because decreased arousal is associated with increased neuronal variability across the cerebral cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, this account predicts a global increase in internal noise after the preliminary decision.</s><s>When fitting the data with two internal-noise parameters, one for each interval (see Computational Method, model v), we find that the internal noise is not higher in interval 2 (noise ¼ 24) as compared to interval 1 (noise ¼ 25)-a pattern which implies that the decision did not induce fatigue or loss of attention.</s><s>Further, note that the selective gain-reduction model, which provided a fit almost as good as the global gain-reduction model, is also inconsistent with a reduction of general arousal, which would be non-selective.</s></p><p><s>Both the global and the selective gain-reduction models account for the intuition that once we reach a decision, we are less likely to respond to new evidence.</s><s>The neural mechanism that underlies this reduction in sensitivity to evidence is an important topic for further investigation.</s><s>One possibility is that forming a decision triggers a transition to an attractor state <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, the neural circuitry that underlies the evaluation of evidence is not fixed but rather is altered at the time a decision is reached, possibly, as a result of neuromodulation <ref type="bibr">[46 -50]</ref>.</s><s>For example, a modulatory increase in the recurrent excitation and in lateral inhibition may turn the decision state from one that is characterized by an accumulator (or drift diffusion process; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>) to one characterized by attractor dynamics <ref type="bibr">[20,23 -25,48]</ref>, in which the state is relatively insensitive to new evidence.</s><s>Accordingly, the reduced gain to extra-evidence in our data may be due to the triggering of such modulations by the request to decide.</s><s>In our experiment 2, for example, such decisiontriggered modulations take place in session I (free-response paradigm, when the observers need to make a preliminary decision), but not in session II, until the end of the evidence is presented (interrogation paradigm).</s><s>We show in the electronic supplementary material that a decision-modulated change in the decision attractor dynamics (within the leaky-competing accumulators framework) predicts reduction in sensitivity to additional information (electronic supplementary material, figures S9 and S10).</s></p><p><s>Our analyses of commitment effect in experiment 1 have focused on a time scale of seconds (i.e.</s><s>sequences of eight items); a more fine-grained analysis of the relative influence of each item reveals that in the DEE condition the influence of the 11th item is reduced (see full time-course regression, electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>This temporal decrease in gain could reflect decision-triggered neuromodulation (see the electronic supplementary material, figure <ref type="figure">S9b</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the full time-course regression shows that the influence of the 8th item in the DEE condition is increased, indicating an enhanced weight in the accumulation process of the most recent evidence before the initial decision, and/ or an enhanced memory for that most recent evidence.</s><s>Future studies will be needed to investigate the fine grained time course of this effect.</s></p><p><s>While a decision-induced gain-reduction may appear disadvantageous for situations in which the decision is reversible, some degree of inertia on decisions may help to reduce indecisiveness that could lead to multiple changes of mind when faced with ambiguous evidence and to avoid time wasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s>Recent work within the framework of embodied decisions have shown that decision models in which the motor action has a stabilizing feedback input into the decision process can improve task performance, when the cost of action-changes are factored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>.</s><s>The identification of the neural basis of a post-decision commitment mechanism, with regard to specific model-variants and its putative adaptive role, remains an important topic for future investigations.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Overall, 41</head><label>41</label><figDesc><div><p><s>participants (range 21-29 years) participated in
