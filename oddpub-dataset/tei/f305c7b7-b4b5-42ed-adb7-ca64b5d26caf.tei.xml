<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Due to demographic change, kidney diseases have become a major health problem and the number of people suffering from acute or chronic kidney disease is increasing.</s><s>Renal failure leads to reduction in the glomerular filtration rate and the loss of nephrons, the functional units of the kidney.</s><s>Nephron structure is conserved among vertebrates and shows three main segments: glomerulus, proximal tubule and distal tubule.</s><s>After renal injury mammals can regenerate segments such as proximal tubules and glomeruli partially, but are unable to form new nephrons and replace lost ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, in fish nephrogenesis and renal regeneration persists throughout life <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>This is facilitated by a pool of progenitor cells, which are activated after induction of kidney injury, giving rise to new nephrons being visible as basophilic clusters of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>MicroRNAs are 20-22 nucleotides long non-coding RNAs and are known to play a role in several processes by regulating post-transcriptional steps of gene expression.</s><s>While a role for miRNAs in regeneration of fish kidneys has not been demonstrated yet, a recent report shows a role for miR-34 in kidney morphogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In mammals a set of miRNAs was shown to be changed in its expression after kidney damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>One of these miRNAs, miR-21 is up-regulated after kidney injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref> and is involved in development of fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to mammals, however, in fish only little or no scar formation accompanies the regenerative process as has recently been shown for the heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>At the present time, the role of miRNAs in the regeneration of fish kidney has not been studied.</s></p><p><s>Here, we have used the African killifish Nothobranchius furzeri, which has recently been established as a new model in aging research <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>We have addressed the role of miR-21 in the process of renal tubular regeneration and have found that it plays a critical role in kidney regeneration of N. furzeri.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p><s>Neonephrogenesis and tubular regeneration in N. furzeri after renal injury</s></p><p><s>In fish two different kidneys can be found.</s><s>While embryos and larvae possess a simple pronephros, consisting of one or two glomeruli, adult fish harbor a mesonephros.</s><s>The latter can have different shapes, varying in respect to the size of the cranial and caudal portion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>This led us to investigate the kidney structure of N. furzeri and compare it to that of zebrafish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a and b</ref>).</s><s>In zebrafish, the kidney is located at the dorsal side of the body and shows three different parts from anterior to posterior: head, trunk and tail kidney (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>While in N. furzeri the kidney is located at the dorsal side as well, it only shows an elongated head structure, thus resembling a head kidney only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>This is comparable to the kidney of medaka <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Injection of 40 kDa dextran-FITC, a fluorescent sugar, being selectively reabsorbed in the proximal parts of the tubules confirmed the observations from bright field microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c and d</ref>).</s><s>Histological analysis of the N. furzeri kidney demonstrated the presence of glomeruli, proximal tubules (identified by brush border) and distal tubules as well as hematopoietic tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>).</s><s>The presence of the latter is known form other fish species as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Having characterized the structure of the N. furzeri kidney, we next wanted to investigate renal tubular regeneration.</s><s>After induction of kidney damage by intraperitoneal injection with the nephrotoxic drug gentamicin, which specifically damages the proximal parts of the tubules <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the regeneration process was analyzed.</s><s>Dextran-FITC was used to indicate kidney functionality, since it is no longer reabsorbed upon tubular damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f and j</ref>).</s><s>Two days after administration of gentamicin, in 25 out of 32 fish (78 %) no dextran-FITC signal was seen, suggesting severe tubular damage.</s><s>After 6 days, kidney function recovered and exhibited reabsorption of dextran-FITC.</s><s>At 8 days post injection (dpi), a normal dextran-FITC signal was observed in 23 out of 24 fish (96 %).</s><s>Compared to zebrafish, where tubular structure appears intact after 2 weeks post injury and functionality is restored after 3 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> recovery in N. furzeri is thus quite fast.</s><s>We next wanted to examine the underlying cellular and molecular processes and first examined apoptosis and proliferation.</s><s>Two days after damage induction, levels of apoptotic cells in the tubules increased to 14.2 % from less than 1 % prior injury (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g and k</ref>).</s><s>At 8 dpi levels of apoptotic cells in tubules dropped to 6.8 % indicating that the recovery process is not yet completely finished.</s><s>Cell proliferation in the tubules was measured using an EdU-assay.</s><s>At 2 dpi proliferating cells could be detected in 33 % of the tubules and decreased to basal level at 6 dpi (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h and l</ref>).</s><s>At 8 dpi proliferation again increased, however, the effect was not significant.</s><s>To assess kidney damage and regeneration histologically, H&amp;E staining was performed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>).</s><s>In control kidneys, the brush border was found to be intact in proximal tubules.</s><s>After gentamicin injection, cell aggregates were found in the lumen of proximal and distal tubules and the brush border was disrupted (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>, white arrows).</s><s>An enlargement of the lumen of tubules was observed 4 days post injection.</s><s>Eight days post injection, specific basophilic structures were observed, indicating newly developing nephrons <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Combining functional and immunohistochemical data, we conclude that in N. furzeri initial and prompt repair processes take place in the tubules to allow fast functional recovery after kidney damage.</s><s>Enhanced proliferation rates in the tubules at 2 and 4 dpi point towards regenerative processes in the tubules.</s><s>Similar effects have been reported after renal injury in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, suggesting a similar response of tubular regeneration.</s><s>In contrast to mammals, however, this process is followed by neonephrogenesis in fish.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential expression of microRNAs after induction of kidney damage in N. furzeri</head><p><s>Previous reports have shown that a number of miRNAs are up-and down regulated after kidney damage in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>Whether these miRNAs also have an influence on kidney regeneration in fish has not been investigated yet.</s><s>We selected a set of miRNAs with conserved expression in the kidney among vertebrates: miR-21, miR-30a, miR-194 and miR-200a <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for these miRNAs was performed using RNA from N. furzeri kidney tissues at 2, 4 and 8 dpi (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>After damage induction, miR-21 was significantly up-regulated when compared to undamaged kidneys.</s><s>MiR-194 was down-regulated after induction of kidney damage, a result also seen in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>MiR-30a and miR-200a expression levels were unchanged after renal injury.</s><s>Previous studies have investigated the role of miR-21 in fibrosis following kidney damage in mammals; however, we did not observe fibrosis in fish after renal injury (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>We therefore decided to study the influence of miR-21 on kidney regeneration in N. furzeri.</s><s>Upon sequence comparison we found that miR-21 is highly conserved among mammals and fish (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>Especially the seed region is identical.</s><s>In a next step, we investigated the localization of miR-21 in the kidney tissue.</s><s>An in situ hybridization was performed with kidney cryosections of different time points after induction of kidney damage, using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) in situ probe (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).</s><s>In undamaged control kidneys, miR-21 was ubiquitously expressed in low amounts, in the hematopoietic tissue as well as in the kidney tubules.</s><s>After damage induction, a significant and persistent increase of miR-21 expression was found, especially in the tubules of the kidney.</s><s>Interestingly, there was a significant overlap between miR-21 positive and EdU positive cells suggesting a connection between miR-21 expression and proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</s><s>These data are consistent with the qPCR results and show that miR-21 is specifically upregulated in the tubules of damaged nephrons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MiR-21 can be blocked by using LNA-antimiR-21</head><p><s>In order to investigate the influence of miR-21 on kidney regeneration, we wanted to inhibit up-regulation of this miRNA after renal injury.</s><s>To achieve this, we made use of a specific LNA-antimiR-21 oligomer.</s><s>These stabilized RNA-oligonucleotides have been shown to bind specifically to their target miRNA and prevent them from binding to their respective mRNA targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>The antimiR-21 was injected intraperitoneally in two different concentrations (10 μg and 20 μg/g body weight) into N. furzeri and different organs were analyzed for detectable miR-21 levels (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>).</s><s>The most efficient blocking of miR-21 was detected in kidney and liver, where a high amount of blood is filtered.</s><s>Levels of miR-21 in the kidney were decreased very efficiently after administration of antimiR-21 at both concentrations.</s><s>Similar results were received for the liver with a more pronounced dose-dependence.</s><s>A clear inhibition of miR-21 was also seen in the skin.</s><s>A decrease of miRNA-level of more than 3-fold was found with both concentrations.</s><s>In the brain no miR-21 reduction was observed, presumably due to an inability of the antimiR-21 to cross the blood brain barrier.</s><s>Based on this experiment, 10 μg/g body weight was used in the following experiments as standard concentration.</s><s>Before performing regeneration kinetics, we tested the stability of antimiR-21 in the kidney (Fig. <ref type="figure">2f</ref>).</s><s>A single dose was injected and tissue was collected at different time points over a period of 15 days.</s><s>Analysis of miR-21-levels revealed that it is efficiently blocked by the antimiR-21 in the kidney of N. furzeri, even after 15 days.</s><s>To examine whether miR-21 inhibition influences expression of other miRNAs, we measured miR-30a and miR-194 levels in antimiR-21 injected fish at distinct time points after kidney damage (Fig. <ref type="figure">2g and h</ref>).</s><s>In samples injected with antimiR-21, miR-30a showed no difference in expression levels, compared to control.</s><s>For miR-194, down-regulation was observed in control and antimiR-21 treated fish, but no significant differences were observed between both groups.</s><s>These data show that antimiR-21 did not influence expression of these two miRNAs and can thus be considered specific.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AntimiR-21 treatment changes gene expression patterns</head><p><s>In order to identify genes that might be deregulated by antimiR-21 administration and thus explain the observed changes in regeneration we performed RNA-Seq.</s><s>We used kidney samples from four groups at four different time points, namely at 0, 2, 4 and 8 dpi.</s><s>As control we considered kidney RNA from fish that had been injected with a mismatch LNA.</s><s>To assess the effect of gentamicin on gene expression we used RNA from fish that had received gentamicin together with the mismatch oligonucleotide.</s><s>A third group got injected with the antimiR-21 together with gentamicin.</s><s>The fourth group comprised animals injected with antimiR-21 only.</s><s>Subsequently, we identified significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref> and Additional file 2: Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>Given that miRNAs in general have a modulatory role and do not serve as on/off switches, it is not surprising that gentamicin had a more significant effect on gene expression (745 DEGs) than the application of the antimiR-21 (292 DEGs).</s><s>We subsequently focused on genes that were differentially regulated between gentamicin/mismatch control and gentamicin/antimiR-21 injection.</s><s>We performed cluster analysis using STEM and identified clusters with up-regulation of gene expression at either 2 (early response) or 4 dpi (late response) as most significantly enriched patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>).</s><s>In case of gentamicin/mismatch control 128 genes were observed to be up-regulated in early response (Profile 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>).</s><s>Of those 45 genes maintained their expression upon gentamicin/antimiR-21 administration while 62 of the genes showed an altered expression profile after injection of antimiR-21 (Profile 3 to 5).</s><s>From 114 DEGs of the late response upon gentamicin/mismatch injection (Profile 6), 39 genes displayed a changed expression profile after gentamicin/antimiR-21 treatment (Profile 8 to 10).</s><s>GO-term enrichment analysis for DEGs from gentamicin/mismatch injection 'early response' (profile 1) revealed 'apoptotic process' as term comprising most DEGs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>).</s><s>The most notable changes after gentamicin/antimiR-21 injection were observed in the category 'programmed cell death'.</s><s>This is in agreement with the observed enhanced apoptosis upon antimiR-21 treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3e</ref>).</s><s>GO-term analysis for DEGs at the later time point revealed terms such as 'membrane invagination' (profile 6) and 'cellular homeostasis' (profiles 8 to 10) pointing to reorganization of cells.</s><s>A common term between the gentamicin/mismatch control and gentamicin/antimiR-21 samples is 'response to wounding' suggesting that genes affecting these processes are affected by gentamicin and display altered expression upon antimiR-21 administration.</s><s>We selected two genes for further analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>): insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (igfbp-3), which shows a profile 3-like expression pattern and FOS-like antigen 1 (fosl1) from profile 5. Quantitative PCR showed that while gentamicin treatment influenced expression of both genes, this was significantly changed after antimiR-21 treatment, particularly at 4 dpi.</s><s>Of note, igfbp-3 has been linked to apoptosis and oxidative stress in the kidney <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and was recently identified as miR-21 target gene in glioblastomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Fosl1 belongs to the AP-1 transcription factor complex, leading to cellular growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Recent results indicate that the AP-1 complex could be a direct target of miR-21 as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In summary, our data suggest a novel role for mir-21 in kidney regeneration.</s><s>Among the genes that might mediate its function are igfbp-3 and fosl1.</s><s>MiR-21 seems to be required for initiating fast proliferation after damage as its knockdown delays proliferation.</s><s>A similar phenomenon has been described in mouse liver regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Our functional and transcriptome analyses also suggest that in the context of kidney regeneration miR-21 acts as an antiapoptotic factor.</s><s>This has also been found to be the case in an ischemia-reperfusion injury model in the mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In addition our data show that miR-21 can act differently in the same organ in different vertebrate species, as no significant fibrosis is observed in fish.</s></p></div>
