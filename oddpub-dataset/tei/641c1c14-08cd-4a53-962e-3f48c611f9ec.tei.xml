<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Many lactic acid bacteria (LAB) reside in the intestinal tract of vertebrates.</s><s>In addition, among these, it has been demonstrated that some strains belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, and Pediococcus are probiotic, since they have beneficial effects for the health of the host organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guarner et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The main mechanisms of action of probiotics are to strengthen the intestinal barrier, stimulate the immune system, or counteract the effects of pathogens through acidification of the environment, the production of antimicrobial substances, and competition for nutrients and adhesion to the epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guarner et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Many of these LAB produce a wide range of exopolysaccharides (EPS) that are considered prebiotic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Salazar et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>These EPS could reach the colon where they are selectively fermented by the gut microbiota increasing beneficial anaerobic bacteria that contribute to the homeostasis and have beneficial effects on health <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Verbeke et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These bacteria and their EPS are used in the development of functional fermented foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Zannini et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Linares et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Marco et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the EPS, especially β-glucans, can act as immumodulators.</s><s>β-Glucans are recognized by pattern recognition receptors such as dectin-1 and Toll-like receptors activating the NF-κB pathway that lead to the release of several cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lee and Kim, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This activation stimulates the proliferation of monocytes and the maturation of dendritic cells and could be involved in anti-tumor responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Meng et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Pediococcus parvulus 2.6 is a LAB isolated from Basque Country cider, whose genome has been determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Pérez-Ramos et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>This bacterium produces a 2-substituted (1,3)-β-D-glucan of high molecular mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dueñas-Chasco et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Evaluation of this bacterium using in vitro models showed the influence of β-glucan in some probiotic properties such as adhesion to human enterocyte cell lines and immunomodulation of macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fernández de Palencia et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>This β-glucan provided enhancement of bacterial growth and adhesion capability of lactobacilli <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Russo et al., 2012)</ref>, and was also able to activate human macrophages with an antiinflammatory response <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Notararigo et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a P. parvulus 2.6 fermented cereal-based matrix, producing the β-glucan in situ resulted in improved technological and functional features of the products <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pérez-Ramos et al., 2017a)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, these β-glucan enriched matrices have a protective effect and improve the growth of probiotic LAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pérez-Ramos et al.,

digestible, and it contains vitamins and minerals, and is the most important source of ω3 lipids, which are important for reducing cardiovascular risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Marik and Varon, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Wild fish is a limited resource on earth, but fish farms could assure the human supply in the future.</s><s>To increase the profitability of aquaculture, one of the most important aspects is to reduce the cost of feeding.</s><s>For this aim, in recent years, the use of feed with 100% vegetable proteins has obtained successful results.</s><s>However, the use of these kinds of feeds present certain problems related to the fish immune system, affecting their intestinal morphology and producing diseases such as enteritis and diarrhea.</s><s>These pathological problems can lead to death due to bacterial or viral outbreaks, which can cause considerable economic loss in aquaculture <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Subasinghe, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Torrecillas et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>To diminish this problem, β-glucans from plant, fungi, and yeast are widely utilized to avoid the outbreak of infectious diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Meena et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the β-glucan produced by P. parvulus 2.6 as well as the bacterium itself could be of interest in aquaculture as an immunomodulant and as a

(1,3)-β-D-glucan-producing P. parvulus 2.6 (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pérez-Ramos et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, evaluation of this bacterium and its isogenic nonproducing 2.6NR strain according with the EFSA specifications revealed that these bacteria were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), and consequently there were not substrates for horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants.</s><s>Therefore, we envisaged the in vivo evaluation of these pediococci in zebrafish models.</s><s>Thus, with the aim of visualizing pediococci in the gut of the zebrafish larvae, the 2.6 and 2.6NR strains were fluorescently labeled with the mCherry protein by transfer of the pRCR12 plasmid.</s><s>The resulting recombinant strains were designated 2.6[pRCR12] (2.6p) and 2.6NR[pRCR12] (2.6NRp) and total plasmid DNA preparations of these strains were compared with those of the parental strains by analysis in agarose gels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) to confirm that the genetic manipulations have not affected the former plasmid content.</s><s>P. parvulus 2.6 carries three natural plasmids: pPP1 (39.1 kbp), pPP2 (24.5 kbp), and pPP3 (12.7 kbp; Pérez-Ramos et al., 2017b), and the 2.6NR strain was generated from 2.6 by pPP2 plasmid curing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fernández et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, according with these differences, the plasmidic DNA analysis revealed that 2.6p and 2.6NRp harbor the expected plasmids and TNFa-R GCATGGCTCATAAGCACTTGTT that these bacteria also carry the 4.4 kbp pRCR12 plasmid.</s><s>In addition, the plasmidic profiles showed that the establishment of pRCR12 in these hosts did not modify significantly the ratios of the natural plasmids.</s><s>Consequently, it seems that there is no incompatibility between the replication machinery of pRCR12 plasmid and those of the other plasmids.</s><s>The pPP2 plasmid harbors the gtf gene, which encodes the GTF glycosyltransferase responsible for the β-glucan synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Werning et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we searched for the presence of the gtf gene in the plasmidic DNA samples.</s><s>A Southern blot hybridization of the total plasmidic DNA preparations of the four P. parvulus strains was performed using an internal region of the gtf gene as a probe.</s><s>As expected, hybridization signals were observed at the position of the 24.5 kbp pPP2 plasmid only in the 2.6 and 2.6p DNA samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>With regard to the expression of the mCherry fluorescent protein, P. parvulus 2.6p and 2.6NRp formed bright pink colonies on MRS-agar medium (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), and this coloration was visible even after incubation of the plates for 16 days (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>This long-term detection indicated the stability of mCherry labeling in these hosts.</s><s>Moreover, the colonies of the 2.6p strain retained the ropy phenotype of its parental 2.6 strain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) indicating that both produce the 2-substituted (1,3)-β-D-glucan.</s><s>To validate this hypothesis, supernatants of cultures of both pediococci were used to determine the concentration of EPS released to the medium by these strains, using an immunological method for specific detection of the pediococcal β-glucan.</s><s>The results revealed a similar production of the EPS, e.g., at an OD 600 nm = 1.0, 114.97 ± 2.58 and 130.95 ± 6.53 mg L −1 for the 2.6 and 2.6p strains, respectively.</s><s>In addition, expression of the mCherry protein was visualized at the cellular level by fluorescence microscopy.</s><s>This analysis revealed an intense red color of the 2.6p and 2.6NRp bacteria, and superimposition of phase contrast and fluorescent images showed that all bacteria of both populations were expressing active mCherry protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The use of the recombinant strains 2.6p and 2.6NRp instead of 2.6 and 2.6NR required that the genetic manipulation did not drastically affect the bacterial growth.</s><s>Thus, the growth of the four P. parvulus strains in liquid medium was analyzed and the growth rate at the exponential phase was calculated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>The β-glucan-non-producing 2.6NR strain displayed a higher growth rate (µ = 0.231 ± 0.024) than that of the 2.6 strain (µ = 0.182 ± 0.005).</s><s>The same behavior was observed, when the growth rate of the recombinant strains was compared µ = 0.184 ± 0.013 for 2.6NRp strain and µ = 0.174 ± 0.011 for 2.6p strain, but less differences between them were observed, a good characteristic for further comparative studies of bacteriazebrafish interactions.</s><s>In addition, the 2.6 and 2.6NR strains grew slightly faster than the corresponding recombinant strains.</s><s>This behavior was expected, since only 2.6p and 2.6NRp were grown in the presence of Cm, because the pRCR12 plasmid confers resistance to this antibiotic.</s><s>The high level of expression of the mCherry in the recombinant pediococci made it possible to analyze in real time, and simultaneously the growth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) and the fluorescence (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>) of the cultures.</s><s>The levels of the red fluorescence emitted by the recombinant strains were increasing during the bacterial growth and remained stable during the stationary phase.</s><s>These were similar in both strains and achieved a value of 111.27 ± 7.03 for 2.6NRp and of 93.18 ± 2.85 for 2.6p at OD 600 nm =

the bacteria has to be removed by centrifugation.</s><s>Thus, the β-glucan that remains attached to the bacteria after sedimentation and resuspension as well as after mechanical removal was quantified with the specific ELISA method.</s><s>The results revealed that during the adhesion assay, the EPS bound to the 2.6p and 2.6p * samples, was at a concentration of 248 ± 11 and of 3.7 ± 0.1 ng mL −1 , respectively.</s><s>Moreover, as expected, the immunological assay revealed no detection of the β-glucan bound to 2.6NRp strain.</s><s>Furthermore, analysis of the bacteria by transmission electronic microscopy confirmed the presence of the EPS bound to the 2.6p cells, the almost complete removal in the 2.6p * , and its absence in 2.6NR (insets in Figure <ref type="figure"
