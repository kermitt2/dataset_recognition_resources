<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of different potassium hydroxide concentrations on the morphology of schistosome ova</head><p><s>As we observed an incomplete maceration process of the 5% formalin fixed placenta tissues after 24 h, specimens used for this experiment were conserved either in 0.9% saline or 70% ethanol.</s><s>As described above one placenta piece was cut into several smaller pieces and placed in a 50 mL test tube.</s><s>Two Schistosoma mansoni infected naïve mouse livers were cut into approximately 0.5 x 0.5 cm pieces and three pieces from different liver areas were added to each tube with placental tissue, respectively.</s><s>Tubes were filled with either 10% KOH or 4% KOH and placed in a warming cabinet for 24 h at 37˚C as described above.</s><s>Mouse liver pieces incubated alone with 10% KOH or 4% KOH served as controls to verify that schistosomal eggs were not digested by KOH.</s><s>After 24 h the test tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2,500 rpm and room temperature.</s><s>The supernatants were discarded and the whole pellets were examined under the microscope at 100-fold and 400-fold magnification for eggs of Schistosoma sp. with particular attention to their morphology.</s><s>The experiments were performed in duplicates.</s></p></div>
