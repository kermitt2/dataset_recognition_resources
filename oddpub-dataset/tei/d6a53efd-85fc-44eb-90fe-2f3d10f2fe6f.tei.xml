<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Borderline ovarian tumors (BOTs) were first described by Taylor in 1929 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and have been a challenge for both pathologists and oncologists.</s><s>BOT is a disease of younger, fertile women, generally with a benign course; however, a minority of patients progress and eventually succumb to the disease.</s><s>Although the corrected survival for patients with disease confined to the ovary is 100% at 15 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, .30% of patients with serous BOT with invasive implants will develop persistent or recurrent tumor, most commonly low-grade serous carcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>For the group of patients with invasive implants, there is no consensus regarding standard therapy.</s><s>Some oncologists would agree that adjuvant treatment is warranted for these patients, based on their worse prognosis and the tendency of these tumors to recur, not only as BOT but also as a low-grade ovarian neoplasm; however, the response of such tumors to systemic chemotherapy needs to be clarified.</s><s>Platinum-based regimens are recognized as the standard chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, achieving the highest response rates and the longest survival.</s></p><p><s>At present, chemotherapy is offered mostly to patients with invasive implants, regardless of histological subtype.</s><s>We aimed to clarify the effect of platinum-based adjuvant treatment on women of any age with a histological diagnosis of BOT of any variant compared with no adjuvant treatment and with regard to progression-free and overall survival and response rates to adjuvant treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>Articles selected for inclusion were English-language, peerreviewed articles that examined the effect of platinum-based chemotherapy on the treatment of BOT of any variant presenting with invasive implants at primary diagnosis (BOTi).</s><s>We considered all articles, regardless of whether the studies were retrospective or prospective.</s></p><p><s>We excluded reports that did not state outcomes from BOTi patients separately from outcomes of BOT patients with noninvasive implants or without implants.</s><s>Also excluded were studies that did not report the follow-up of patients who received adjuvant treatment separately from those receiving other treatments and those that did not use a platinum-based regimen (at least in a group of patients); reports treating patients with surgery only were considered.</s><s>Reports that stated outcomes from ovarian cancer patients reported together with BOTi were also excluded, as were case reports, which represent unusual occurrences and/or disease courses.</s></p><p><s>Included in the analysis were women of any age with a histological diagnosis of primary BOT of any variant with the presence of invasive implants at primary diagnosis.</s><s>Women who did not have an up-to-date histological diagnosis of BOTi (according to Bell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and women with concurrent ovarian cancer or other malignant tumors of the ovary were excluded.</s><s>We further excluded any form of recurrent BOT.</s></p><p><s>We considered articles in which at least one group of patients with BOTi received adjuvant chemotherapy with platinum-based regimens and articles in which at least one group of patients with BOTi were treated by upfront surgery only.</s></p><p><s>The primary and secondary endpoints were overall survival and disease-free survival, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search Strategy and Identification and Selection of Studies</head><p><s>The PubMed database was searched using the following search terms: ((borderline) OR (low malignant potential) AND (ovarian)) AND ((tumor) OR (cancer)) AND (invasive implants) AND ((follow-up) OR (survival) OR (treatment) OR (chemotherapy) OR (adjuvant treatment) OR (surgery) OR (surgical treatment)).</s><s>All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searches were examined.</s><s>The full text of potentially relevant references was obtained.</s></p><p><s>Each potentially relevant study was tabulated for each characteristic: author, title, year of publication; inclusion and exclusion criteria; study design; study population (total number of enrolled patients; total number of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy or combination therapy; patients' ages; histological subtype; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage; presence and type of implants; central pathological examination); surgery details (type of initial surgery, presence of residual disease); chemotherapy details (regimen, dose and number of cycles; use for primary or recurrent disease; duration of follow-up); and outcome (recurrences, progression to carcinoma or death; patient status [dead of disease, dead of other causes, alive with disease, or alive with no evidence of disease]; type of response to treatment).</s></p><p><s>Odds ratio (OR) of mortality reduction is the primary measure of treatment effect.</s><s>The OR was imputed using the raw data provided in the studies.</s><s>OR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each side effect were calculated.</s></p><p><s>Pooled recurrence and mortality estimates were computed using random-effects models.</s><s>Odds ratios of mortality and recurrence reduction were computed using randomeffects models to analyze the data.</s><s>Egger's regression intercept test across the different interventions was calculated using the Comprehensive Meta Analysis V2 software (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, http://www.meta-analysis.com).</s></p><p><s>The risk of bias was analyzed by funnel plot of the effect by the inverse of its standard error.</s><s>The symmetry of such funnel plots was assessed formally with Egger's test.</s><s>The heterogeneity was assessed formally by calculating I 2 .</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Upfront Surgical Treatment</head><p><s>In some of the studies, it was not possible to ascertain the completeness of staging because it was not mentioned.</s><s>Whenever the authors did not mention how many patients were staged but rather stated how many patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or omentectomy separately, the staging rate was calculated based on the number of patients treated with at least O, which denotes intent to stage.</s><s>According to this method,the following rates were achieved: Camatte et al., 100% <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>; Morice et al., 88% <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; Seidman and Kurman, 78%  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> mentioned the number of staged patients but provided no definition of staging, with 100%, 100%, 98%, 48%, and 23%, respectively.</s><s>Sneige reported 100% staging through peritoneal biopsies and washings and at least omentectomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Prat and De Nictolis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> did not mention the extent of surgical staging; however, 37.7% of patients in the study had advanced stage disease.</s></p><p><s>Eight studies reported the definition and/or number of patients undergoing complete cytoreduction.</s><s>The following studies classified optimal cytoreduction as no visible evidence of disease, and it was achieved in the following proportions of cases:  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Of the studies that reported the rates of optimal cytoreduction, one emphasized the relationship between complete cytoreduction and improved outcomes.</s><s>Kokawa et al. reported that the absence of residual tumors was significantly associated with improved survival rates, although the p value was not given <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Two studies did not find a significant relationship between residual tumor characteristics and outcomes during the follow-up period <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjuvant Treatment</head><p><s>None of the studies provided information about the dosage and schedules of treatment, providing only the information "platin-based" treatment.We included any study with patients with BOTi in which at least a group underwent platin-based treatment as long as the follow-up of these patients was independently discernable in the article.</s><s>Because of the low number of patients, we did not set a minimum number of patients per study.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This paper is the first review of exclusively platinum-based regimens in the treatment of primary BOT presenting with invasive implants at primary diagnosis.</s><s>Peritoneal implants are found at initial diagnosis in 20%-46% of patients with serous BOT [23], of which 83%-96% are noninvasive <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Given the low prevalence of invasive implants in a disease that is uncommon, this study benefits from the inclusion of 3,124 patients, 181 with invasive implants, representing every age group, with a median age range from 21 to 55 years.The review further benefits from the inclusion of 18 studies that performed a central pathological evaluation and from even distribution regarding disease stage; 7 studies included only the more unusual advanced-stage patients, and 8 studies included .75% stage I patients.</s><s>We opted to include only platinum-based regimens because current consensus  Currently, all histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian tumors are treated with the same first-line adjuvant treatment, although serous, mucinous, and endometrioid tumors are thought to have different ethiopathogeneses.</s><s>Consequently, we opted not to select one histological subtype, although 14 studies consider only serous BOT, including 1,089 patients (102 BOTi).</s><s>We encountered several difficulties related to heterogeneous patient groups, incomplete descriptions of interventions, and a general lack of information about dosage and number of treatment cycles.</s><s>Surgery forms the basis of BOT treatment; however, only 30 patients with BOTi were treated exclusively by surgery, and only 3 studies treated BOTi solely with surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Evidence suggests that aggressive initial surgical debulking is critical to outcome in ovarian cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>The accuracy of staging is generally reported incompletely.</s><s>The calculated figures range between 29% and 100% for complete or comprehensive staging based the surgical data provided in the different studies.</s><s>Although accurate staging is crucial for the analysis of patient cohorts, not only in terms of effects of treatment but also in terms of prognostic factors, it seems that the recurrence and mortality rates do not differ substantially between these works.</s><s>This question was investigated by Fauvet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, Snider et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> and du Bois et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> analyzing the role of restaging surgery in BOT.</s><s>An upstaging rate of 14.8% was reported, but there was no difference in recurrence rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the study by du Bois et al. reported staging quality as a prognostic factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.
