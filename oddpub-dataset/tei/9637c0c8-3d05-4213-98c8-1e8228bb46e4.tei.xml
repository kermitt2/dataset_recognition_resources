figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A</ref>).</s><s>In line, significantly lower numbers of clustered clonotypes were detectable in RCD type II/EATL as compared with ACD ( p=0.0009) and RCD type I ( p=0.0109; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3B</ref>).</s><s>Patients with ACD showed a significantly higher number of clonotypes compared with patients with CD GFD ( p=0.0024).</s><s>In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3C</ref>, an RCD type II case is compared with a control case with respect to the frequency of the 20 most common T-cell clones, highlighting the strikingly different distribution of clonotypes.</s><s>To ascertain that differences in frequencies of T-cell clones do not merely reflect the age of the patient as suggested previously for peripheral blood T-cells, we plotted the number of individual clonotypes indicative for T-cell diversity against the age of the patients-irrespective of CD diagnosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">29</ref></s><s>Interestingly, no correlation was found (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3D</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, no correlation between transglutaminase-IgA titre and the frequency of the most dominant clonotypes was detected (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5</ref>).</s><s>The finding of significantly higher clonotype frequencies in RCD type II as well as RCD type II/EATL cases and the accompanied lower TCRβ diversity could be approved by the quantitative assessment of biodiversity via the Shannon diversity index (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">27</ref></s><s>Rβ repertoire variety and stability among patients with CD In contrast to assays restricted to fragment length, HTS-based data are based on individual TCRβ sequences providing an unlimited resolution of the entire TCR of a given sample.</s><s>Thus, First, to address the question of stability of the TCR in small intestinal biopsy samples and reproducibility of this technique, we analysed the TCR composition of multiple small intestinal biopsies sampled from the same individual ( patient #3, #4, #5, #10 and #43) at different time points (time in between endoscopies from two consecutive days up to 5 years).</s><s>Thereby, we were able to track defined TCR rearrangements in samples over time.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref> exemplifies the stability of individual T-cell clones over a period of 5 years.</s><s>This corresponded to a Shannon diversity index that stayed fairly constant in mucosa samples that had been examined repeatedly (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>This implied that (i) TCR diversity data from individual mucosal biopsies are meaningful and that (ii) in the small intestine a set of dominant clonotypes can persist over a long period of time.</s></p><p><s>Second, to study the variety and re-occurrence of TCRβ sequences within or among CD groups, we compared all clonotypes of individual cases with all other clonotypes of our cohort and displayed the resulting overlaps as a heatmap (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, no disease-specific identical clonotypes or TCRβ motifs were found within the various CD groups.</s><s>Likewise, no specific TCRβ sequence was found to be identical among all groups.</s></p></div>
