<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiomyocyte death is not always localized with detectable pneumococci</head><p><s>Given the stark differences in pathology, we sought to assess cardiomyocyte death in the heart using immunological methods, and further, to determine if the diffuse damage that was observed across the heart was directly associated with the presence of bacteria.</s><s>TUNEL staining for broken DNA revealed positive nuclei in close proximity to TIGR4 microlesions (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, hearts of mice infected with strains D39, WU2, and 6A-10 exhibited TUNELpositive nuclei (dead cells) dispersed across the sections; these were not necessarily adjacent to the bacteria (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Enumeration of the TUNEL-positive nuclei within the infected myocardium revealed that microlesion-incapable strain D39 incited the most cell death, followed by strains TIGR4, WU2, and 6A-10 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Severe pneumococcal disease is an established risk factor for adverse cardiac events in hospitalized adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Direct invasion of the heart by systemically-circulating S. pneumoniae has been implicated as a cause of cardiac injury that contribute to PACE.</s><s>This direct cardiotoxicity most likely exacerbates the physiological stresses placed on the heart during severe disease to collectively cause PACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>While previous studies aimed at understanding the basis of cardiac complications post-infection were done using the highly-invasive and commonly used lab strains, serotype 4 strain TIGR4 and serotype 2 strain D39, it was unknown whether other clinical pneumococcal strains could also incite cardiac damage.</s><s>Herein, using a comprehensive panel of nine S. pneumoniae clinical isolates belonging to eight different serotypes, we report that cardiac damage is most likely dependent on the ability a clinical isolate to cause high-grade bacteremia and that the pathological attributes of this damage are in turn highly strain dependent.</s></p><p><s>Our observation that only strains that could cause sustained high-grade bacteremia (D39, WU-2, TIGR4, and 6A-10) were recovered in a meaningful manner from the hearts is consistent with prior work that shows pneumococci gain access to the heart by crossing the cardiac microvasculature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Unclear is if clinical isolates, other than CDC7F:2617-97, that did not cause bacteremia (e.g.</s><s>AMQ16 or BHN97) would cause heart damage if the animal had been immunosuppressed or infected with a higher-dose and the host defense overwhelmed.</s><s>Nonetheless, our observation that CDC7F:2617-97 only had slightly higher cardiac involvement, despite a 100-fold increase in the bacterial challenge dose, indicates that the intrinsic virulence of each strain is a critical aspect to causing cardiac damage, perhaps equal as the host defense.</s><s>This is clinically relevant as pneumococci are highly diverse in their genetic content.</s><s>The observation that CDC7F:2617-97 was not able to cause disease in experimentally immunocompromised mice suggests attenuation during bacteremia was due to differences in virulence gene expression that would affect nutrient acquisition or due to other host factors.</s><s>One such possibility is peritoneal, splenic, and cardiac macrophages; although our approach to deplete neutrophils was not precise and resident macrophages and dendritic cells may have also been affected.</s><s>Importantly, we observed 10,000 bacteria in the heart of one mouse infected with CDC7F:2617-97 that had a blood titer less than 1,000 CFU/mL.</s><s>This is likely a consequence of clearing the bacteria in the bloodstream whereas those in the heart were capable of as &lt; 50% of myocytes undergoing myocytolysis, &gt; 50% of myocytes undergoing myocytolysis, or no myocytes undergoing myocytolysis.</s></p><p><s>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204032.g002</s><s>sustained replication.</s><s>This has recently been shown by Ercoli et al. to occur following a transient bacteremia episode, with pneumococci replicating within splenic macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Pneumococci within infected splenic macrophages serve as a source of bacteria during resurgent sepsis.</s></p><p><s>For those strains that could invade the heart, the type of cardiac damage was found to be strain specific.</s><s>We observed three general categories of cardiac damage: acute microlesions not associated with immune cells (caused only by TIGR4), infiltrated immune cells at sites where bacteria were present (best exemplified by D39), and cell death at tissue sites where bacteria were not present.</s><s>Importantly, the amount of cardiac damage as measured by troponin-I, was positively correlated with severity of bacteremia.</s><s>This, too, is supported by the literature, as it is those individuals with the most severe forms of pneumococcal infection who require admission to the ICU and that are most likely to develop PACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>This has also been seen in non- human primates, where animals with mild pneumonia had the lowest levels of cardiac troponin in serum <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, the specific type of cardiac damage did not seem to be dependent on the number of bacteria that were within the heart suggesting damage was instead due to strain specific effects.</s></p><p><s>An assessment of CbpA levels and H 2 O 2 production for our strains found no correlation between these factors and the ability to cause disease nor the type of cardiac damage that was experienced.</s><s>A negative correlation for pneumolysin production was observed, in particular those that produced the least amount of pneumolysin were those that caused the greatest amount of cardiac damage.</s><s>This unexpected result can perhaps be explained by the recent report that pneumolysin impairs pneumococcal translocation across vascular endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, we acknowledge that nutrient rich culture media is certainly not representative of in vivo conditions.</s><s>Thus, our studies that examine levels of these determinants need to be interpreted with caution.</s><s>Future efforts to address this include an examination of virulence gene expression levels in vivo and are ongoing.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, cardiac cytotoxicity was not always observed in cardiac cells adjacent to pneumococci, suggesting released bacterial factors such as pneumolysin circulating within the bloodstream or diffusing away from the pneumococci in the heart might play a role.</s><s>Prior studies by Alhamdi et al. show that circulating pneumolysin is capable of causing cardiac damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Alhamdi et al. suggested that all cardiac injury was due to circulating pneumolysin, as they did not detect heart-invaded D39.</s><s>This was subsequently proven erroneous, as D39 is detected within hearts; however, the concept that pneumolysin in the circulation can cause disseminated heart damage is viable and possibly an explanation for the results that are observed herein for bacteria-independent heart damage.</s><s>One important consideration is, however, that bacteria are indeed close to the dying cells, but not present within the heart section that was ultimately visualized.</s><s>One key aspect of this is that with the exception of TIGR4, heart damage was not localized and was spread across the ventricle, presumably affecting heart function as a whole.</s><s>Note that high-grade bacteremia would allow for sufficient pneumolysin to be released to cause this form of disseminated damage.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our results show that high-grade bacteremia is requisite for pneumococcal invasion of the heart and cardiac damage.</s><s>The high-grade bacteremia allows for sufficient levels of cardio-invasion, and perhaps also high levels of noxious products that can kill cells distally to the bacteria.</s><s>In turn, the specifics of the cardiac damage appear to be highly straindependent and not readily explainable by our limited analyses of bacterial virulence determinants in vitro.</s><s>Taken together, this work provides better insight into the type of pneumococcal disease that places individuals at risk for PACE and highlights the previously unknown pneumococcal strain-dependent variability of heart damage that could possibly occur in.</s><s>It demonstrates that some, but not all, pneumococci are capable of cardiac involvement.</s></p></div>
