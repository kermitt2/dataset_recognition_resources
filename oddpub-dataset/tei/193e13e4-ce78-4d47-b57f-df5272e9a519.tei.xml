<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>The management of the classical form of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) has changed thanks to the introduction of neonatal screening programs, which allow early diagnosis and replacement therapy.</s><s>Over the last few years the progressive reduction of TSH-cutoff at neonatal screening and the advancements in the molecular analysis led to the definition of novel syndromic forms of CH, that are associated with mild thyroid deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Mutations of the NKX2.1 gene, previously known as TTF1 (thyroid transcription factor 1, OMIM*600635), mapping on chromosome 14q13, have been identified and associated with a syndromic form of CH (OMIM*610978) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, initially named brain-lung-thyroid syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> due to the broad phenotypic spectrum including a variable combination of lung, thyroid and neurological defects.</s></p><p><s>Recently, in light of the varied manifestations of heterozygous mutations of the NKX2.1 gene, the disorders have been referred to as NKX2.1-related</s><s>disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>These disorders range from benign hereditary chorea (BHC), the hallmark of NKX2.1-related disorders, to choreoathetosis, congenital hypothyroidism and neonatal respiratory distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>So far, ninety-six mutations of the NKX2.1 gene have been reported , 70 of which are point mutations and 26 large deletions, often spanning the entire gene (HGMD Professional 2014.2).</s></p><p><s>The NKX2.1 gene has three exons and encodes for a member of the NK-2 family of transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that mediates thyroid-specific genes transcription.</s><s>During embryogenesis the gene is expressed in the thyroid gland, in the lung and in the forebrain, especially in the hypothalamic area, infundibulum and basal ganglia region <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We identified a novel mutation of NKX2.1 in an infant showing neurological symptoms associated with nearnormal results at CH screening test, negative history of neonatal respiratory distress and recurrent pulmonary diseases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Case presentation</head><p><s>Child of non consanguineous parents, the patient was born at 41 weeks of normal pregnancy, with normal birth weight (3965 g).</s><s>The family history reported two cases of walking delay in the paternal line and several cases of autoimmune thyroid diseases in the maternal line.</s><s>Both parents showed normal thyroid function.</s><s>Neonatal adaptation was normal (APGAR 1°9, 5°10), with no respiratory distress at birth.</s><s>At neonatal screening, TSH spot value was equal to the cut-off level (10 mUI/L).</s><s>The test was repeated on blood spot and TSH levels became normal (4.4 mUI/L), thus no further analysis was performed.</s><s>In the first months of life, the infant showed a progressive impairment in neurological development, characterized by choreoathetosic movements, disordered motility in the lower limbs, reduced motility of the upper limbs, axial hypotonia and development delay.</s><s>At 8 months of age the analysis revealed a mild hypertireotropinemia with normal fT4 values.</s><s>Thyroid ultrasound showed a normal in situ gland.</s><s>Electroencephalography and brain MRI were normal at 12 months of age.</s><s>Due to the progressive increase of TSH levels, the infant started the replacement therapy with L-Thyroxin at 13 months.</s><s>Growth parameters and pulse rate were recorded, electrocardiography was performed and blood samples were taken in order to determine TSH and free T4 serum levels.</s><s>Biochemical and clinical features measured at follow-up are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Serum free T4 and TSH levels were measured using a commercial chemiluminescent assay (Bayer, Fenwald, Germany).</s><s>The clinical manifestation of the patient resembled defects that have been previously associated with mutations of the NKX2.1 gene.</s><s>Therefore, DNA sequencing analysis was performed after obtaining informed consent.</s><s>Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of the child and his parents and the NKX2.1 gene coding region, comprising exon 1-3 of isoform 1, as well as the exon-intron boundaries were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced by Sanger sequencing.</s></p><p><s>Two point mutations were identified, a heterozygous substitution, NM_001079668:c.390C</s><s>&gt; G:p.(Tyr130Term), resulting in a nonsense mutation and a single base exchange in intron 2, NM_ 001079668:c.463</s><s>+ 41C &gt; T, not reported in the SNP database (NCBI).</s></p><p><s>The mutation was not detected in the parents, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</s><s>Upon administration of the replacement therapy, the patient showed a progressive improvement in neuromotor and growth development.</s><s>Of note, the height increased from −0,63 SDS to −0,12 SDS after one year of treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We report the case of an infant with a novel mutation of the NKX2.1 gene, showing neurological symptoms, with mild impairment of thyroid function, in the absence of neonatal respiratory distress, as a typical example of an already established group of disorders namely NKX2.1related disorders.</s></p><p><s>The phenotypic spectrum of NKX2.1-related disorders is highly variable and ranges from abnormalities in a single organ system to any combination of brain, thyroid and lung involvement.</s><s>The neurological presentation may be the most frequent one.</s><s>In particular BHC, the hallmark of NKX2.1-related disorders, is a classic early finding, as suggested by previous evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and is characterized by involuntary, irregular, jerk-like and continuous movements, frequently associated with hypotonia, ataxia and choreoathetosis.</s><s>In some cases BHC is associated with respiratory distress syndrome or congenital hypothyroidism.</s></p><p><s>The case that we report here is characterized by mild clinical presentation.</s><s>The movement disorders of the child were monitored starting from the first months of life and choreathetosis was evident at 8 months.</s><s>Neonatal CH screening showed near-normal results.</s><s>A mild form of hypothyroidism was detected in his first months of life and was responsive to a low dose of L-Thyroxine.</s></p><p><s>No respiratory distress at birth and no respiratory symptoms during childhood were observed.</s></p><p><s>A novel NKX2.1 nonsense mutation (Y130X) and a single base exchange in intron 2(c.</s><s>463 + 41C &gt; T), not reported in the SNP database (NCBI), were identified.</s><s>The mutations were not detected in parents, despite the known history of walking delay in the paternal line.</s><s>This evidence indicates that we identified de novo mutations.</s></p><p><s>The phenotype observed in our patient was mild despite the presence of NKX2.1 gene null mutation (Y130X).</s><s>This discrepancy is not surprising in light of previous data showing the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation in NKX2.1-related disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, likely due to the pathogenetic role of genetic and environmental factors that need to be further investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The pathogenetic mechanism of the mutation, as other truncating mutations, might involve haploinsufficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, we cannot exclude the potential activation of an alternative initiation site leading to a shorter product of 268 aminoacids with intact homeobox domain (HD) and TD and lacking the protein N-terminal.</s><s>This product may partially preserve the protein function and therefore explain the mild phenotype of the patient.</s></p><p><s>Several nonsense NKX2.1 mutations upstream to the DNA binding domain, which associate with a high phenotypic variability, have been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Asmus et al.</s><s>The G142X nonsense mutation upstream to the NKX2.1 DNA binding domain was described by Salerno et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> in a patient with CH and respiratory distress but not chorea, whose father was a immune carrier.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, the high phenotypic variability, even in cases carrying the same mutation, is not restricted to NKX2.1 nonsense mutations, but is a feature of all types of NKX2.1 mutations.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, the hypothesis of the activation of an alternative initiation site with intact HD in the novel Y130X nonsense mutation, upstream to the NKX2.1 DNA binding domain, seems to be remote.</s><s>Functional studies are needed to definitively rule out this hypothesis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Previously published data do not allow a clear interpretation of the pathogenetic role of NKX2.1 mutations in NKX2.1-related disorders, since a number of cases were not fully characterized for the phenotypic presentation of choreoathetosis.</s><s>Moreover, the same mutation of the NKX2.1 gene can present with diverse phenotypes and highly variable clinical manifestations.</s><s>Our analysis suggests that in the absence of severe thyroid deficit or respiratory distress, neurological evaluation should guide the patient's management.</s><s>The mild hypothyroidism, frequently observed in these cases, may not be detected by neonatal screening.</s><s>The low frequency of CH cases due to NKX2.1 mutations that are reported in literature is expected to be higher in a subgroup of patients selected according to the neurological presentation.</s><s>In these patients, the analysis of NKX2.1 mutational status is recommended.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Peall et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and Hamvas et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> reported three cases characterized by the same Y144X nonsense mutation and different phenotypes.Asmus et al. and Peall et al. reported the case of a patient with chorea, as the only clinical presentation.</s><s>Hamvas et al. described a patient with hypotonia, development delay and recurrent pulmonary infections, who died of a respiratory sincytial virus infection.</s><s>Other nonsense NKX2.1 mutations upstream to the DNA binding domain occuring with choreoathetosis,</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
