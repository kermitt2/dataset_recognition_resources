<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Environmental cues are important moderators of ongoing instrumental behavior.</s><s>Via Pavlovian learning, previously neutral cues can acquire motivational value by predicting the occurrence of rewarding or punishing events.</s><s>In substance dependence, stimuli previously associated with drug reward enhance craving, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> promote approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> and may thus lead to relapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> Experimental approaches to study the influence of Pavlovian conditioned cues on instrumental responses are Pavlovian-toinstrumental transfer (PIT) paradigms (for example, Holmes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> ).</s><s>They combine instrumental learning, where a reward enhances or decreases the occurrence of a specific action, with Pavlovian, where learning confers incentive salience to previously neutral cues by pairing them with a reward.</s><s>The interaction between Pavlovian cues and instrumental behavior can be specific, that is, when a Pavlovian cue promotes instrumental behavior specifically associated with the same reward.</s><s>In contrast, general PIT denotes that, depending on the motivational valence, Pavlovian cues can moderate instrumental approach and avoidance responses in general independent of reward types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref></s><s>Thereby, positively valued Pavlovian cues encourage approach tendencies, while negative cues promote inhibition and avoidance actions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref></s><s>PIT is considered to be an essential mechanism in behaviors that are subject to cuecontrol, such as eating, alcohol use and drug-taking.</s></p><p><s>PIT paradigms have been extensively used in animal studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref></s><s>egarding substance dependence, stronger specific PIT effects were reported in rats after repeated cocaine or amphetamine administration, compared to drug-naive animals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref></s><s>Notably, pretreatment with cocaine also enhanced general PIT, where neither Pavlovian cues nor instrumental responses were drugrelated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref></s><s>elated to that, studies in humans demonstrated attentional biases towards non-drug related (for example, monetary) rewards leading to impaired goal-directed inhibition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref></s><s>Interestingly, those attentional biases were found to be greater in opioid-dependent patients compared to controls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref></s><s>4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> In the context of alcohol dependence, our group recently reported that PIT was more pronounced in alcohol-dependent patients compared to controls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>In a larger sample, we also observed that the PIT effect of non-drug-related cues was positively related to stronger signals in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) only in relapsers, but not in abstainers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s>These findings demonstrate that the degree to which Pavlovian cues affect behavior varies markedly across subjects, which might be further influenced by personality traits.</s></p><p><s>One important personality trait that is known to be a risk factor for initiating drug and alcohol use as well as addiction is impulsivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s>0]<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> One of its components is the sensitivity of choices to delay, as assessed by delay discounting tasks, where impulsive choice behavior is defined as the tendency to prefer immediate over delayed rewards.</s><s>There is a conceptual similarity between models of addiction and the tendency to prefer immediate over delayed rewards, since addictive behaviors are characterized by choosing to consume a substance in the present, often at the expense of concern about future outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>There are numerous studies reporting higher delay discounting in alcohol-dependent patients compared to controls (for a metaanalysis see MacKillop et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> ), and within patients, higher discounting rates seem to be sensitive for the prediction of relapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s>On the neural level, impulsive decisions are linked to stronger activation in limbic regions including amygdala and NAcc, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> which are also reported to play a key role during PIT (for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>The current study pursued three aims.</s><s>First, we wanted to replicate our previous finding that severely alcohol-dependent patients compared to controls show a stronger general PIT effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> by now analyzing both, a clean replication sample (n = 130) where we excluded subjects of previously reported subsamples and the full sample containing all assessed subjects (n = 207).</s><s>Second, due to the bigger sample size, we can provide a more exhaustive analysis to explore whether positive and negative Pavlovian cues differ in their potency to separately influence approach and avoidance behavior, as noted by Geurts et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> Third, based on the described literature linking impulsive choice behavior to PIT, we tested whether more impulsive individuals exhibit stronger PIT effects compared to less impulsive subjects.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Data were collected in Berlin and Dresden as part of the LeAD study (Learning and Alcohol Dependence; www.leadstudie.de;</s><s>clinical trial number: NCT01679145).</s><s>We included 18-65-year-old male and female alcohol-dependent patients who were abstinent from alcohol by a mean of 17 days (s.d.</s><s>= 11) as well as age-and gender-matched healthy controls.</s><s>Exclusion criteria for all subjects were left-handedness, MRcontraindications (for example, metal-containing foreign body, pacemaker, and claustrophobia), a history of dependence or current substance use except for nicotine; other current DSM-IV axis one psychiatric or neurologic disorders and borderline personality disorder.</s><s>Included patients were severely alcohol-dependent with a history of alcohol dependence for a minimum of 3 years and had been recently detoxified.</s><s>Patients were off any medication known to interact with the central nervous system (more than four half-lives post last intake) and displayed no relevant alcohol withdrawal symptoms (CIWA-Ar score ⩾ 3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s>We assessed 212 participants fulfilling all criteria.</s><s>Due to technical problems in either the delay discounting or the PIT task, data of 5 participants were missing, resulting in a final sample of 116 patients and 91 age-and gender-matched healthy controls.</s><s>For sample characteristics, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General experimental procedures</head><p><s>Participants underwent two experimental days.</s><s>On the first day, after giving written informed consent, participants were interviewed using the computerized Composite International Diagnostic Instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> to check for DSM-IV axis I disorders.</s><s>Following the interview, participants filled out several self-rating questionnaires (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) before they completed a delay discounting task.</s><s>On the second day, participants completed a PIT paradigm.</s><s>We excluded current alcohol use by breath alcohol readings at the beginning of both experimental days.</s><s>At the end of each day, participants received task winnings and a monetary compensation for study participation, resulting in an average payout of 10 €/hour.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Delay discounting task</head><p><s>Participants completed an adaptive delay discounting task which is part of a value-based decision-making task-battery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref></s><s>On each of 30 trials, subjects chose between a small immediate and a larger delayed monetary reward.</s><s>Delays were set to 3, 7, 14, 31, 61, 180, or 365 days.</s><s>Rewards varied between 0.30 €-10 €.</s><s>Participants were informed that one of their choices was credited to their compensation at the end of the experiment.</s><s>On the basis of the choices, we estimated individual delay discounting rates k assuming a hyperbolic discounting function as proposed by Mazur <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> and a softmax decision function.</s><s>Because the distribution of k was skewed, statistical analyses were performed on the natural logarithmic scale.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PIT paradigm</head><p><s>On the second experimental day, participants completed a PIT paradigm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref></s><s>The task was programmed using Matlab 2011 (MATLAB version 7.12.0,</s><s>2011; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) with the Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3) extension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref></s><s>The PIT task consisted of four sequential parts:</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pavlovian training</head><p><s>For Pavlovian conditioning, 80 trials of pairing monetary rewards or punishments with compound visual and auditory CS were presented to the subjects.</s><s>At the beginning of each trial, a compound CS consisting of abstract pictures and pure tones was presented for 3 s.</s><s>The compound CS was followed by a delay of 3 s with two fixation crosses at the two potential CS locations (left and right), then a US (monetary reward or punishment) was presented for a further 3 s (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>).</s><s>CS and US presentation was separated with a 3-second interstimulus interval.</s><s>Subjects were instructed to passively observe the CS and US and to memorize the pairings.</s><s>The set of stimulus pairings consisted of two positive CS paired with images of +2€ and +1€ coins, respectively; one neutral CS paired with 0€ and two negative CS paired with − 1€ and − 2€, respectively (coins with a superimposed red cross).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer</head><p><s>Subjects performed the instrumental task again, this time without outcome feedback.</s><s>The background was tiled with one of the money CS presented during Pavlovian training, or one of 4 beverage stimuli (2 pictures of the favorite alcoholic drink and 2 pictures of water).</s><s>Participants performed 162 trials while each trial lasted 3 s (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>Data were analyzed using R 3.2.0</s><s>(R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2014). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref></s><s>Demographic group characteristics and group comparisons were examined using chi-square and t-tests (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>While all further described analyses refer to the transfer part of our experiment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>), analyses of the instrumental training and the forced choice trails can be found in the supplement (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2 and 3</ref>).</s><s>In a first step, we replicated our previous finding that patients compared to controls show a stronger general PIT effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> by creating a clean replication sample, excluding all subjects of those previously reported studies.</s><s>To analyze differences in accuracy between patients and controls, we used binomial mixed-effects models (glmer, R-package: lme4).</s><s>We report Bonferroni-corrected estimates, standard errors, z-values and P-values from the glmer output.</s><s>We coded participants' response for each trial as correct ( = 1) if a good shell was collected or a bad shell was left, and as false ( = 0) if a bad shell was collected or a good shell was left, respectively.</s><s>In a second step, we used the same models to analyze the transfer part within our full sample.</s><s>Finally, to check for the influence of impulsivity on the PIT effect in the full sample, we extracted the parameter k from the delay discounting task.</s><s>Since the range of k was approximately equal in patients (Min = − 13.3; Max = 4.3) and in controls (Min = − 12.6; Max = 5.1), we performed a median split to divide the whole sample in high k vs low k subjects.</s><s>After median split, the high k group included 68 patients and 35 controls, and the low k group included 48 patients and 56 controls.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>We observed stronger PIT effects related to both money CS and beverage stimuli in alcohol-dependent patients compared to controls.</s><s>In general, positively valenced background stimuli (associated to monetary gains) substantially enhanced accuracy of approach behavior (that is, when collecting good shells) and impaired accuracy when inhibiting approach behavior (that is, when leaving bad shells).</s><s>Complementary, negatively valenced background stimuli (associated to monetary losses) had the opposite effect on accuracy.</s><s>Particularly, when patients were confronted with a combination of a negatively valued instrumental cue (for example, a bad shell) and a positively valenced background Pavlovian cue (for example, +1€, +2€, or water), their behavior was strongly driven by those background cues, rendering them less able than controls to appropriately perform the instrumentally learned inhibition.</s><s>When accounting for impulsive choice behavior as measured by the delay discounting parameter k, we found stronger PIT effects in high impulsive compared to low impulsive participants.</s><s>Further, the stronger PIT effect in patients compared to controls was only present in the high-impulsive group, whereas low impulsive patients and controls did not differ.</s></p><p><s>We could successfully replicate our previous finding of stronger PIT effects in alcohol-dependent patients compared to controls in the full sample as well as in a replication sample, for which subjects of previously reported subsamples were excluded.</s><s>In these previous presented studies, patients were behaviorally more affected by money and by beverage cues, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> while the influence of money cues was positively related to stronger activity in the NAcc only in relapsers, but not in abstainers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s>The current results extend these data by separately analyzing Pavlovian influences on instrumental approach and avoidance behavior.</s><s>We showed that patients compared to controls were more susceptible to Pavlovian background cues in general, and particularly to cues associated to monetary gains while they should perform an instrumentally learned inhibition.</s><s>Therefore, Pavlovian effects may automatically and implicitly bias patients to make decisions that are contrary to their previously formed behavioral intention.</s><s>Translated to everyday risk situations for relapse, this concept may manifest itself as a strong susceptibility to seduction, which can be a crucial aspect in high-risk situations for relapse.</s><s>Surprisingly, we found the same effect of failed behavioral inhibition when pictures of water were presented in the background, while pictures of alcohol decreased instrumentally learned approach.</s><s>Both effects were more pronounced in patients, particularly in high-impulsive patients.</s><s>Thus, water pictures exerted appetitive effects similarly to CS paired with winning money, while alcohol stimuli resembled CS paired with losing money.</s><s>We could further confirm this assumption with data from the forced choice trials: participants preferred water pictures over negative (−1€, − 2€) and neutral (0€) money CS as well as water and all money CS over alcohol pictures.</s><s>When asking subjects to choose between alcohol and water pictures, both patients and controls preferred the water picture, while the aversion against alcohol pictures was even stronger in patients.</s></p><p><s>The unexpected aversion against alcohol pictures in patients might be related to the long stimulus presentation in our task (for example, 3 s in each trial during the PIT part).</s><s>All studies investigating attentional biases towards alcohol-related cues used shorter presentation times.</s><s>For instance, data from a visual probe paradigm shows that alcohol-dependent patients exhibit an attentional bias towards alcohol cues (for example, faster detection of a probe that replaces alcohol cues compared to neutral cues) only when the duration of stimulus presentation is short (50 ms).</s><s>When cues were presented for 500 ms, social drinkers showed an increased attentional bias compared to alcohol-dependent patients, and when stimuli were presented for 1250 ms no attentional bias was found, neither in patients nor in social drinkers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref></s><s>Vollstädt-Klein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> further showed that patients, who were abstinent for longer than 2 weeks, exhibited the same patterns in attentional orienting towards alcohol cues as healthy controls.</s><s>These results suggest a vigilance-avoidance pattern towards alcohol-related stimuli that could also explain the stronger dislike of alcohol pictures in our data.</s><s>Since our stimuli presentation times were relatively long, patients might have successfully applied attentional avoidance-and cognitive evaluation strategies to process those alcohol-related cues, especially in their current status after recent detoxification and within continuous abstinence-oriented treatment.</s><s>Another possible explanation is that 'general' and 'specific' PIT effects exerted by alcohol pictures might differ in their direction: while we observed a general inhibitory effect of alcohol pictures on instrumental responses to money cues, alcohol pictures might still enhance the approach towards alcohol cues, which we did not test (that is, 'specific' PIT).</s></p><p><s>In our study, PIT effects were more pronounced in highimpulsive subjects, and above all in high-impulsive patients.</s><s>Those patients seem to be particularly sensitive to the impact of Pavlovian cues on ongoing behavior.</s><s>A possible mechanism underlying this overlap between choice impulsivity and susceptibility to Pavlovian cues might be a generally increased sensitivity to rewards.</s><s>For instance, Hariri et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> reported the data of an fMRI study showing that higher discounting rates were positively correlated with increased ventral striatal activity in response to both, positive and negative feedback in a Striatal reactivity paradigm.</s><s>Further, in the context of problem drinking and AUD risk, the combination of steep monetary delay discounting and activity patterns of high ventral striatal and low amygdala reactivity where identified as a possible pathway to increased stress-induced drinking behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref></s><s>In summary, these results imply that impulsive patients with a strong responsiveness to rewards might also be less able to inhibit a behavioral response towards a reward-associated background cue.</s><s>Accordingly, this higher reward-sensitivity could explain the incentive salience those subjects attribute to Pavlovian cues.</s><s>Another complementary theoretical approach to explain the susceptibility to Pavlovian cues can be found in the goal-and sign-tracking literature, which describes individual variance in the degree to which Pavlovian cues acquire motivational properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref></s><s>While goal-tracking individuals tend to approach the position of anticipated reward delivery, sign-trackers excessively approach the position where the stimulus predicting the reward is presented.</s><s>Related to that construct, Tomie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref></s><s>showed that sign-tracking behavior was associated with higher choice impulsivity: high impulsive compared to low impulsive rats showed remarkably more approach behavior towards the CS.</s><s>Moreover, sign-tracking as well as impulsive choice behavior further increased after acute administration of ethanol, but only in high impulsive, not in low impulsive animals.</s><s>In a more recent human study, Garofalo and di Pellegrino 51 used eye-tracking to identify goal-and sign-tracking behavior during a PIT paradigm.</s><s>Correspondingly, they found that sign-trackers showed a stronger PIT effect and higher levels of impulsivity compared to goal-trackers.</s><s>We assume that the strong PIT effects we observed in high-impulsive patients could rely on related mechanisms.</s><s>Similar to sign-tracking individuals, highimpulsive patients appear to attribute incentive salience to Pavlovian CS, which motivate reward-related actions and thus interfere with instrumentally learned behavior.</s></p><p><s>We want to address two limitations to be considered when interpreting our data: First, there are a number of sample characteristics that differ between patients and controls, which possibly could have biased our results.</s><s>For instance, the socioeconomic status of patients was lower compared to controls.</s><s>Differences in the socioeconomic status might be important for decision-making in the delay discounting task as well as in the PIT paradigm, because it can affect the subjective value of presented money stimuli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52</ref></s><s>Further, we allowed subjects to smoke before the beginning of the experiment.</s><s>Since nicotine is known to independently affect reward learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53,</ref><ref type="bibr">54</ref> and impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> the current smoking state of subjects might have influenced our results.</s><s>However, due to the complexity of our statistical models we could not control for differences in socioeconomic status or smoking state.</s><s>Second, the stronger PIT effects in high-impulsive patients might have simply been explained by their poorer instrumental learning.</s><s>Indeed, patients and particularly highimpulsive patients achieved lower accuracies than controls during instrumental training (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) and therefore might have responded according to values of the money CS by neglecting instrumental learned stimuli during the PIT phase.</s><s>To test this assumption, we included participants' achieved accuracy during instrumental training in our model analyzing the PIT phase.</s><s>Results revealed that instrumental training performance did not affect the stronger PIT effect in patients compared to controls, while this effect remained unchanged when we included impulsivity in the model.</s><s>Taken together, we conclude that the strong effect of Pavlovian cues on highly impulsive patients' behavior cannot be explained by poorer instrumental training performance.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our findings indicate that during a PIT paradigm, monetary Pavlovian cues as well as pictures of beverages can strikingly influence instrumentally learned behavior.</s><s>Particularly, high-impulsive alcohol-dependent patients showed inappropriate approach behavior elicited by contextual cues and therefore failed to correctly inhibit previously learned actions.</s><s>In real life, this trait might render them highly susceptible to seduction by environmental cues that are incongruent with their behavioral intention to stay abstinent.</s><s>Such cues can be alcohol-related or alcoholunrelated, and both occur in what therapists like to call 'chains of seemingly harmless decisions'.</s></p><p><s>For example, listening to pleasant music while finding the picture of an old friend may prompt a patient to call that friend, the good food that friend suggests to have at a restaurant might make him accept the friend's invitation, talking about the fun they had with old drinking buddies might make him go see them in a bar next street, and there ultimately be seduced to accept a drink.</s></p><p><s>Our results bear two implications to help highly impulsive alcoholics abstain despite their strong PIT effect.</s><s>In the cognitive domain, they could be informed about their susceptibility to context cues and how these can influence everyday behavior in a way that increases relapse risk.</s><s>On a more implicit, habitual level of behavioral control, these patients might particularly profit from cue-reactivity training, which aims to relearn automatic responses to cues and replaces approach by withdrawal reactions (for example, Eberl et al., <ref type="bibr">55</ref>  Neural correlates of alcohol-approach bias in alcohol addiction: the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak for spirits.</s><s>Neuropsychopharmacology 2014; 39:
