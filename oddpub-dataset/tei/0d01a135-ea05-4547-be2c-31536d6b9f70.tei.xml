<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In the current study we quantified facial skin ageing in females combining the clinical and the biophysical perspective.</s><s>Furthermore we tried to disentangle primarily intrinsic from extrinsic ageing phenomena.</s></p><p><s>Most of the investigated parameters were associated with chronological age which is in accordance with previous findings.</s><s>For instance, we observed that lifetime sun exposure was positively correlated with chronological age.</s><s>That is reasonable and in line with a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>We observed higher skin ageing, wrinkle, and sagging scores in the aged groups, which supports the construct validity of the applied clinical scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>We also reproduced an age-dependent increase in  max und   <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>The analysis of the skin colour revealed a significant reduction of skin luminance ( * value) with age, which is in concordance with previous studies that reported a diminution of this parameter with age on the face of female subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>An increase in skin extensibility with age was also previously shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, which might be explained by a loss of elastic fibres and changes in the extracellular matrix during skin ageing <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, aged skin showed reduced elastic recovery indicating that the skin is less able to regain its original state after deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>TEWL, SCH, and pH are regarded as the most important parameters to quantify the barrier function of the skin in vivo.</s><s>Mean TEWL decreased with age which is supported by a recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, but the strength of this relationship was weak.</s><s>There were no  associations between skin surface pH and SCH indicating that the facial skin barrier function seems to changes little during facial skin ageing.</s></p><p><s>Besides correlations with chronological age associations of other parameters with each other were detected.</s><s>The four measured skin elasticity parameters express associated properties of the skin and thus their correlations with each other were high.</s><s>The same was true for the roughness estimates.</s><s>The high interrelatedness of the three clinical scales was shown for the first time.</s><s>Although conceptually distinct, the clinical phenomena facial skin ageing, wrinkling and sagging seem to be closely related to each another in the investigated sample.</s><s>Interestingly, in our study lifetime sun exposure showed clear associations only with chronological age and the clinical scores on both cheeks.</s><s>This indicates that UVexposure might have a minor impact on other skin structure or barrier characteristics.</s><s>This was an unexpected finding.</s><s>Indeed several studies have shown that biomechanical and skin barrier parameters are different on sun exposed and sun protected skin areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>However, our findings indicate that the variable chronological age seems to have the most important impact on biophysical characteristics of facial skin than the accumulation of UV exposure.</s></p><p><s>Measured parameters and patterns of associations were similar on the left and right cheek skin.</s><s>This indicates that despite possible asymmetrical sun exposures skin ageing related changes are highly comparable on both body sites.</s><s>The similarity of our findings between the left and right cheek skin supports the internal validity of the study results.</s></p><p><s>In order to statistically reduce the influence of intrinsic ageing, the analyses were rerun adjusted for the variable chronological age.</s><s>After that, 85 (84%) of the bivariate associations were no longer detectable.</s><s>This indicates that the majority of bivariate associations could be explained by intrinsic ageing (chronological age) to a large extent.</s><s>Depending on the direction of the multivariable associations beta coefficients of the remaining models were mostly lower than the bivariate associations.</s><s>This again indicates the strong influence of chronological age on nearly all bivariate associations.</s></p><p><s>A major finding on both cheeks was that the degree of skin "yellowness" ( * ) predicted the skin ageing and wrinkle scores after adjustment to chronological age.</s><s>This might be explained by the accumulation of collagen-and elastic fibre crosslinks caused by lifelong UV damage, which leads to the appearance of wrinkles and an overall aged appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Another possible explanation is the thinning of epidermis which may lead to a translucency of supporting fat and to the formation of wrinkles.</s><s>Similarly, associations between residual skin deformation and the clinical phenomenon of sagging remained statistically significant on both cheeks after adjustment for age.</s><s>This might be caused by thinning of the epidermis and a lower amount of elastic fibres in the dermis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, which results in changes in skin stiffness properties.</s><s>Skin thickness and dermal collagen content is also decreased in postmenopausal women due to hypoestrogenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s>Thus decreased elastic recovery may also be an effect of hormonal changes during menopause, in which all women of the oldest group of our study had been.</s></p><p><s>Our finding indicates, that residual skin deformation may be predicted by clinical evaluation without instrumental measurement and vice versa.</s><s>A surprising finding of this study was the negative association between skin roughness and luminance, which persisted after adjustment for age on the left cheek.</s><s>Probably smoother skin appears brighter because more light is being reflected.</s><s>Taken together, only skin yellowness, the clinical skin ageing scores, and skin elasticity seem to be "really" related to each other independently from chronological age.</s><s>Thus these parameters seem to be mainly influenced by extrinsic factors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1.</head><p><s>Limitations.</s><s>This study was conducted in a small number of subjects to evaluate possible bi-and multivariate associations between different skin parameters.</s><s>However, a larger study is needed to confirm results.</s><s>Our study provides the evidence for effect sizes that are needed for future sample size calculations.</s><s>We included female subjects only in order to reduce possible gender bias.</s><s>Whether findings are applicable to males is unclear.</s><s>Similarly our findings might be applicable for light skin tones only.</s><s>The strength of correlations might have been influenced by the ranges of the applied scores and measurements.</s><s>For instance a slight increase of the sagging score (range 0 to 4) had a stronger influence on residual deformation expressed in millimeters than vice versa.</s></p></div>
