<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: This paper aimed to identify whether high psychological distress is associated with an increased risk of income and multidimensional poverty amongst older adults in Australia.</s><s>Methods: We undertook longitudinal analysis of the nationally representative Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australian (HILDA) survey using modified Poisson regression models to estimate the relative risk of falling into income poverty and multidimensional poverty between 2010 and 2012 for males and females, adjusting for age, employment status, place of residence, marital status and housing tenure; and Population Attributable Risk methodology to estimate the proportion of poverty directly attributable to psychological distress, measured by the Kessler 10 scale.</s><s>Results: For males, having high psychological distress increased the risk of falling into income poverty by 1.68 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.75) and the risk of falling into multidimensional poverty by 3.40 (95% CI: 1.91 to 6.04).</s><s>For females, there was no significant difference in the risk of falling into income poverty between those with high and low psychological distress (p = 0.1008), however having high psychological distress increased the risk of falling into multidimensional poverty by 2.15 (95% CI: 1.30 to 3.55).</s><s>Between 2009 and 2012, 8.0% of income poverty cases for people aged 65 and over (95% CI: 7.8% to 8.4%), and 19.5% of multidimensional poverty cases for people aged 65 and over (95% CI: 19.2% to 19.9%) can be attributed to high psychological distress.</s><s>Conclusions: The elevated risk of falling into income and multidimensional poverty has been an overlooked cost of poor mental health.</s></p></div>

D <ref type="bibr">Schofield et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">[46, 51]</ref>).</s><s>However, given the older age group lower labour force participation is likely to only be part of the reason for lower income reported in this study, due to the majority of older people with and without high psychological distress being out of the labour force.</s><s>None-the-less those with low psychological distress did have a higher proportion of people in employment and so the analysis adjusted for labour force status.</s></p><p><s>The high risk of falling into multidimensional poverty, even after controlling for employment status, may be explained by older people with high psychological distress and low income and poor overall health accessing their savings or accumulated wealth stocks to pay for their health condition (or conditions).</s><s>The results did show that a high proportion of people with high psychological distress who were in multidimensional poverty had low income and poor health, rather than just low income and a low level of education attainment.</s><s>Individuals aged 45 to 64 in Australia who had depression or another mental illness were more likely to have significantly less wealth or none at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study of the out-of-pocket medical costs faced by older Australians listed depression as the third most costly condition, only behind heart disease and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and another study has shown that over 40% of Australians with depression skip health care due to the cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the potential for medical costs to reduce the amount of wealth held by older people with psychological distress, it is known that those with depression and other mental health problems are less likely to hold income producing assets such as investment properties and shares <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, even if developing high psychological distress did not result in a drawdown of total wealth, it may result in a change in wealth portfolio structure to safer and less management intensive assets, which also produce lower returns, hence negatively affecting income.</s></p><p><s>Even after removing the SF-36 MCS, which measures overall mental health, from the measure of multidimensional poverty, both males and females with high psychological distress were still more likely to be multidimensionally poor, having low income plus either poor overall health status or an insufficient level of education attainment.</s><s>This is likely to be explained by the findings of other studies, which have shown that amongst older adults, depression does increase the risk of a decline in physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The key limitation of this study is that it is based on self-reported data.</s><s>Firstly, the study relies on responses to the Kessler-10 survey instrument and does not measure clinically diagnosed psychological distress.</s><s>The measure also only asks respondents about their experiences in the previous 4 weeks.</s><s>Despite this, the K10 is a validated survey instrument shown to have good validity and reliability (as noted in the methodology section).</s><s>Furthermore, cognitive ability at baseline is a further potential confounder that was not available on the dataset and thus not included in the analysis.</s><s>It should also been noted that although the HILDA dataset is accompanied by population weights, and weighted results are reported, the sample was truncated, with those already in income poverty excluded.</s><s>This may have affected the accuracy of the population weights.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Overall the results of this study have shown that older adults with high psychological distress have a higher risk of falling into income poverty and multidimensional poverty.</s><s>Nearly half of older adults with high psychological distress in 2009 would fall into income poverty and multidimensional poverty by 2012.</s><s>Even after adjusting for potential confounders, older males with high psychological distress had 1.7 times the risk of falling into income poverty and 3.4 times the risk of falling into multidimensional poverty, and older females had 2.2 times the risk of falling into multidimensional poverty, than their counterparts with low physiological distress.</s><s>To date, these additional costs of psychological distress have not been quantified.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Baseline characteristics, Australian population aged 65 years and over who were not already in income poverty in 2009</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Characteristic</cell><cell cols="2">Low psychological distress</cell><cell cols="2">High psychological distress</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>n</cell><cell>N (%)</cell><cell>n</cell><cell>N (%)</cell></row><row><cell>Age -mean (SD)</cell><cell>72.5 (6.3)</cell><cell></cell><cell>73.0 (6.2)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Female sex -no (%)</cell><cell>412</cell><cell>568,100 (51%)</cell><cell>42</cell><cell>67,400 (58%)</cell></row><row><cell>Male sex -no (%)</cell><cell>27</cell><cell>543,400 (49%)</cell><cell>394</cell><cell>35,000 (42%)</cell></row><row><cell>Area</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Major City</cell><cell>479</cell><cell>692,800 (62%)</cell><cell>41</cell><cell>59,100 (58%)</cell></row><row><cell>Inner Regional Australia</cell><cell>224</cell><cell>294,700 (27%)</cell><cell>16</cell><cell>20,700 (20%)</cell></row><row><cell>Outer Regional Australia</cell><cell>87</cell><cell>107,400 (10%)</cell><cell>11</cell><cell>19,700 (19%)</cell></row><row><cell>Remote Australia</cell><cell>16</cell><cell>16,500 (1%)</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>2800 (3%)</cell></row><row><cell>Labour force status</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Employed</cell><cell>170</cell><cell>222,200 (20%)</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>9500 (9%)</cell></row><row><cell>Unemployed</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>11,100 (1%)</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>Not in the labour force (retired)</cell><cell>633</cell><cell>878,100 (79%)</cell><cell>63</cell><cell>93,000 (91%)</cell></row><row><cell>TOTAL</cell><cell>801</cell><cell>1,111,500</cell><cell>69</cell><cell>102,400</cell></row></table></figure>
