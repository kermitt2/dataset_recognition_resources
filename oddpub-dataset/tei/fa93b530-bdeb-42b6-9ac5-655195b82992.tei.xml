<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Limited data are available on how NMOSD affects patients' lives.</s><s>To address this gap in the literature, the present study analysed patientreported data provided by an online community of 522 patients with NMOSD.</s><s>To assess the representativeness of the PLM NMOSD patient population, we compared the characteristics of the PLM population with patients in the NMO Multicenter Analysis, a retrospective analysis of 187 NMOSD patients from three academic medical centres <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mealy et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The populations were similar, although the PLM population had higher proportions of male and white patients.</s><s>We also compared the median reported time to diagnosis after first symptoms of NMOSD with that of other central nervous system disorders, including ALS, MS, and PD, and found that they were roughly similar, ranging from 0.9 to 1.3 years.</s><s>Thus, despite NMOSD being rarer than MS, it does not seem to be associated with a longer period of time before a diagnosis is established in this population.</s><s>NMOSD has received more attention since the identification of the anti-aquaporin-4 IgG biomarker <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wingerchuk et al., 2015)</ref>, and this, coupled with the severity of optic neuritis or transverse myelitis is likely to trigger more aggressive follow-up that is likely that this may be leading to more rapid diagnosis of this condition.</s></p><p><s>Patients with NMOSD experience many symptoms that can interfere with their daily living, including pain, fatigue, and stiffness/spasticity. Pain is common in patients with NMOSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bradl et al., 2014)</ref> and is known to contribute to fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chavarro et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Other symptoms included insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and a variety of emotional/ cognitive concerns.</s><s>When comparing the PLM NMOSD and MS populations using the NMORS and MSRS scales, as well as symptom severity reports, many symptoms were reported at similar rates in NMOSD and  MS patients, including pain, stiffness/spasticity, bladder problems, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia.</s><s>These results support those of a prior study in NMOSD and MS members that showed similar levels of pain, sexual dysfunction, and sleep disturbances in the two populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chanson et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>It was notable that fatigue was the symptom most commonly rated as being moderate to severe in PLM members with NMOSD, as prior descriptions of NMOSD clinical features typically do not emphasize fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sellner et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wingerchuk et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Prior studies evaluating the effects of NMO and NMOSD on cognitive function have shown that approximately 54-57% of patients have some degree of cognitive impairment when tested for memory, processing speed, executive functioning, and attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Moore et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Blanc et al., 2008</ref>).</s><s>In the PLM population, 22% of NMOSD members reported at least moderate levels of "brain fog"; however, the self-selecting nature of the sample may mean that those with severe cognitive issues were unable to participate on the Web site.</s><s>Some members reported taking baclofen and gabapentin, which may contribute to these symptoms.</s><s>Nevertheless, it is important for health care professionals who treat patients with NMOSD to be aware that patients commonly experience these symptoms, so that they may screen for and manage them appropriately.</s><s>Impaired health-related quality of life was frequently reported by PLM members with NMOSD in this study.</s><s>More than 95% of patients reported at least some impairment in their ability to "accomplish as much as (they) would like to," or to participate in "work or other activities."</s><s>In studies of patients with MS, rates of unemployment generally ranged from 24% to 80%, with rates of 56-58% observed in one large, cross-sectional study (n = 8867) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Julian et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Factors contributing to unemployment in patients with MS included worsening of symptoms, greater disability, lessened mobility, impaired hand function, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction.</s><s>While there was no direct measure of unemployment in this study, our findings suggest that impairment in ability to work is a significant concern for NMOSD patients.</s></p><p><s>This retrospective, observational study has limitations that deserve discussion.</s><s>The sample of patients with NMOSD in this study was selfselected, and all reporting was voluntary.</s><s>All data, including diagnosis information, is self-reported by PLM members, so it is possible that the sample may have included patients reporting an incorrect or unconfirmed diagnosis.</s><s>However, previous studies in MS and PD attempting to confirm PLM self-reported diagnoses through medical claims have found rates of concordance of approximately 94% <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Eichler et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Because PLM community members are mostly based in the United States and must have access to a computer and the Internet, they may have greater access to resources and may not fully represent the global NMOSD community.</s><s>Specifically, when we evaluated representativeness, the sample in this study comprised a greater  proportion of male and white patients than did a cohort recruited from three academic centres <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Mealy et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is also possible that the PLM NMOSD community is less disabled than (and therefore not representative of) the overall NMOSD population, since members with severe visual, motor, or cognitive disability may be less likely to access the website.</s><s>With respect to comparisons made between the MS and NMOSD member populations, caution is required when interpreting results, given the observational nature of the data and potential confounding and selection biases.</s></p></div>
