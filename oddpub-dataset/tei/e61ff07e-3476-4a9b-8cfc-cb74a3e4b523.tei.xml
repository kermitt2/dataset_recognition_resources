Jones, Tamburelli, Watson, Gobet, &amp; Pine, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>While explanations of such effects typically invoke mechanisms for the more robust encoding or retrieval of the nominal items, as a function of how closely they correspond to the long-term linguistic repertoire of the participant, there is also evidence showing an influence of sequence-level factors that transcend the properties of the individual items themselves.</s><s>For example, short-term serial recall performance is facilitated when item sequences are such that their coarticulatory transitions are relatively fluent or familiar than when they are not, even when the items making up those sequences are equivalently familiar <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Murray &amp; Jones, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Woodward, Macken, &amp; Jones, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Prior, passive exposure to varying interitem transitional probabilities also leads to subsequent superior serial recall performance for sequences more closely matching those preexposed transitional probabilities (e.g., M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Botvinick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">M.

Jones &amp; Macken, 2015)</ref> whereby incrementally larger chunks of information are learned based on the model's increased exposure to sequential input.</s><s>Since the language domain offers the opportunity to estimate the type of sequence knowledge that one may experience (e.g., via child-directed speech samples), CLASSIC has focused on the language domain in investigations of how domain-general mechanisms influence task performance.</s><s>CLASSIC is therefore presented with naturalistic word-delimited child-directed speech converted into phonemes and learns sequences from the input in a bottom-up fashion.</s></p><p><s>The learning mechanism is simple: From a given utterance, recode the utterance into as few meaningful units (chunks) as possible, based on existing chunked knowledge, then learn a new chunk for each adjacent pair of chunks in the recoded utterance.</s><s>While we refer to Bchunks^in relation to the model's learning, CLASSIC is serving as a proxy to the type of associative learning that may take place for a given input and the results from the model will therefore indicate the effect that associative learning may have on task performance.</s><s>In this context associative learning might include increased perceptual sensitivity to sequences of sounds and words that appear often in the input and/or the improvement in articulatory motor coordination that arises from practice in producing those sound sequences.</s></p><p><s>CLASSIC begins with knowledge of the basic phonemes in standard British English (one chunk for each phoneme).</s><s>Given this basic starting knowledge, the first phonemic utterance presented to CLASSIC will therefore be converted into individual phoneme chunks (e.g., the utterance BDaddy's ball^, d ae d i z / b l, would be recoded into eight chunks: d, ae, d, i , z, b, , l).</s><s>Learning will then create a new chunk for each pair of adjacent chunks without crossing word boundaries unless the chunks themselves are words or multiword sequences (dae, aed, di , i z / b , l for the example utterance).</s><s>Should the same utterance be repeated, CLASSIC would now use the newly learned chunks to recode the utterance using fewer chunks than were required on first presentation (i.e., dae, di , z / b , l).</s><s>Learning would create new chunks for each of the adjacent recoded chunks (i.e., daedi , di z / b l).</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> gives an example of how learning would progress when the same utterance exists four times in succession in the childdirected speech.</s></p><p><s>CLASSIC's learning mechanism potentially means acquiring a great deal of knowledge on every presentation of an input utterance; however, in order that the model does not learn spurious sequences, the learning rate is set to .50 such that any sequence must be encountered twice on average in order to be learnt as a new chunk (n.b. previous work using CLASSIC set the learning rate to 1.00 because less input was used).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input to the model</head><p><s>Input to CLASSIC is a combination of maternal utterances directed at 2-year-old to 3-year-old children from the Manchester corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Theakston, Lieven, Pine, &amp; Rowland, 2001)</ref> and similar input directed at 4-year-olds to 5-year-olds that is available on CHILDES <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(MacWhinney, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>As the children in our behavioral studies are 6 years of age, the input was supplemented by story books aimed at 4-year-old to 6year-old children (e.g., Alice in Wonderland).</s><s>The Byounger( 2-year-old to 3-year-old) input contained more than 300,000 utterances across 12 different mothers, whereas the Bolder^(4year-old to 6-year-old) input contained 75,981 utterances in total.</s><s>A random sample of 75,981 utterances was therefore taken from the younger input to match the older input.</s><s>CLASSIC was therefore presented with a total of 2 × 75,981 = 151,962 utterances, intended to be representative of the type of input that children receive up to the age of 6 years.</s><s>Each utterance is presented to the model in full; for each utterance, CLASSIC will recode the utterance into as few chunks as possible given the chunks that are known thus far.</s><s>Learning will then create a new chunk for each adjacent pair of chunks, assuming the word boundary and learning rate constraints are fulfilled.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameters and assumptions in CLASSIC</head><p><s>CLASSIC is an intentionally parsimonious computational model that we use to illustrate how a simple associative (sequential) learning mechanism operating on the linguistic environment is able to predict human performance in language-related tasks.</s><s>The model is no more complex than that described above because its goal is simply to provide an estimate of the sequential knowledge of language that a typical participant might be expected to have gained, in order to use that to predict STM performance with different types of verbal material.</s><s>However, since there are certain assumptions and parameters that may influence performance of the model, we describe them here.</s></p><p><s>Parameter 1: learning rate of 0.50 Previous versions of CLASSIC (e.g., G.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jones, 2016)</ref> have used a learning rate of 1.00 to show how the model is able to simulate children's performance when using a smaller input set than that outlined above.</s><s>This was because the input to the model was trivial compared to the developing child, who hears up to half a million utterances in a 3-week period <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Swingley, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>We compensate for the increase in input here by reducing the learning rate to 0.50.</s></p><p><s>Parameter 2: input to the model The only other parameter relating to the current model is the input received, which is outside of the model's architecture.</s><s>Larger amounts of input lead to greater learning in the model.</s><s>This has overwhelming support from language literature where a robust finding is for greater exposure to language resulting in larger vocabularies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hoff &amp; Naigles, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer &amp; Lyons, 1991)</ref>.</s><s>Clearly, the language input is inextricably linked to the learning rate parameter; the number of chunks learned may be equivalent for a model having a large input with a small learning rate versus a small input with a large learning rate.</s><s>Our goal in this regard is to show how associative learning operating on the linguistic environment is able to predict short-term memory performance, and for this we use a realistic learning rate given the paucity of language input.</s></p><p><s>Assumption 1: associative (sequential) learning mechanism There is substantial support for the simple learning mechanism invoked in CLASSIC, from the recoding of familiar item sequences into larger units (e.g.., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller, 1956)</ref> to word segmentation on the basis of statistical regularities in the input (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Saffran, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Within the model, every chunk learned is available to recode any subsequent utterance.</s><s>No limit is placed on the learning mechanism, but since the input is one utterance at a time, the largest chunk that can be learned relates to one whole utterance (assuming sufficient exposure to that utterance).</s><s>Within the memory literature, much larger feats are possible (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ericsson, Chase, &amp; Faloon, 1980)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Assumption 2: word-delimited input The model begins with only the phonemes of standard British English because we do not wish to impart any further linguistic knowledge within the model that may influence results.</s><s>However, we assume that the child already knows how to segment words within continuous speech because children are already capable of determining word boundaries via a range of phonetic, phonological, and distributional cues by their first birthday (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rowland, 2014</ref>, for a review).</s></p><p><s>Assumption 3: phonetic input For the present purposes, the issue of whether phonemes are the correct basic unit (as opposed to, e.g., onsets, rimes, syllables) is not critical, since the same basic learning processes will still be at play and lead to qualitatively similar outcomes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performing span and repetition tests</head><p><s>As discussed in the Introduction, the broad hypothesis is that performance in the vSTM setting is a function of the extent to which the material presented in that setting corresponds to the long-term linguistic knowledge of the rememberer.</s><s>In operational terms here, this corresponds to the number of chunks needed to recode the test sequence: The greater the correspondence between test stimulus and long-term knowledge, the fewer chunks are required.</s><s>Span and repetition test materials can therefore be presented as input to the model, and after learning we can determine how many chunks are required to recode the input, which can then be used to compare (for example) span lists involving digits versus words or nonword sets that are wordlike versus those that are not wordlike.</s></p><p><s>There is a caveat to the modeling work in that (as noted earlier) the language input is a limited reflection of the sheer amount of input that children receive.</s><s>Ultimately this may have little bearing on nonword repetition results because, by definition, these are constructed from units that will only have been encountered sublexically, and exposure to the 151,962 utterances used as input means that the model is exposed to well over 2 million biphone sequences.</s><s>However, the input will not reflect all of the possible digit sequences and word sequences to which the child is exposed, and, therefore, estimates involving these tests are likely to underrepresent the involvement of associative learning.</s></p><p><s>Modeling predictions for digit span, nonword repetition, and sentence recall Stimuli Measurement of digit span use is dominated by the Wechsler intelligence scales and therefore the digit span test from the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Third Edition, UK version (WPPSI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wechsler, 2004)</ref> was used because the child studies involve 6-year-olds.</s><s>This scale involves lists containing two to nine items, with two different digit lists at each length.</s><s>Further lists were created based on the procedure used by G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jones and Macken (2015)</ref>, who investigated associative learning by comparing digit span, word span, and mixed lists that contained both digits and words.</s><s>Digit lists and word lists are compared because there is substantial evidence that both children and adults are more able to recall lists containing random sequences of digits than lists containing random sequences of words (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dempster, 1981</ref>, for a meta-analysis across child studies, and also G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jones &amp; Macken, 2015</ref>, for a detailed analysis concerning adults).</s><s>In the current study, only nouns were considered for word lists.</s><s>Each digit was matched for syllabic length and, when possible, phonemic length; however, frequency took precedence whereby nouns were selected having frequencies far greater than digits to rule out any effects that could be attributed to higher frequency for digits since they may appear as both words and numerals (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Word lists were produced by substituting each digit in the digit span lists for its corresponding noun.</s><s>Mixed lists were produced by (a) substituting each odd-numbered digit with its corresponding noun, and (b) substituting each even-numbered digit for its corresponding noun (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> for examples).</s><s>The comparison of coding for matched word and digit lists in the model will allow us to examine if superior recall for digit lists over word lists can be explained by associative (sequential) learning. 1</s><s>The mixed lists allow us to more directly examine the extent to which any differences between digits and words are due to the learning of sequential associations based on language exposure, rather than inherent characteristics of the items themselves by comparing digit recall when a digit is neither preceded nor succeeded by another digit (an Bisolatedd igit) versus the same for words, and digit sequence recall when a list contains a digit sequence versus a word sequence.</s></p><p><s>Since young children may only be expected to recall lists containing relatively few items, two lists were changed prior to producing the mixed lists (one at List Length 3 and one at List Length 4) to ensure that all mixed lists at lengths 3 and 4 contained at least one isolated digit/word and at least one digit/ word sequence.</s><s>The benefit of producing two types of mixed list (one that substitutes odd numbers and one that substitutes even numbers) is that it allows direct comparison of individual digits versus individual words, and digit sequences versus word sequences, without being confounded by the serial position of the item(s) within list (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Two nonword repetition tests were used.</s><s>The first was the Children's Test of Nonword Repetition (CNRep; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gathercole, Willis, Baddeley, &amp; Emslie, 1994)</ref>, which uses nonwords that have been split into those that are wordlike and those that are not wordlike based on subjective ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gathercole, 1995)</ref>, each group containing 15 nonwords, five of each with two, three, and four syllables.</s><s>However, some nonwords in both groups bear strong similarity to actual lexical items (e.g., trumpetine) or contain morphemes (e.g., tafflest; e.g., Graf Estes, Evans, &amp; Else-Quest, 2007).</s><s>We therefore added a second test from G. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jones et al. (2010)</ref>, where nonwords contain no lexical items or morphemes but are split into two groups, one each having six of two, three, and four syllable nonwords containing biphones of a relatively high frequency in standard British English and the other with matched characteristics but containing significantly lower frequency biphones.</s></p><p><s>The sentence recall test was taken from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Preschool-Second Edition UK (CELF-2-Preschool; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wiig, Secord, &amp; Semel, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Up to 13 sentences are read aloud by the experimenter with the child's task being to repeat the sentences accurately.</s><s>Sentences gradually increase in length from three words to 13 words.</s></p><p><s>For all stimuli, the relevant item or list was presented to the model and was recoded in as few chunks as possible, with the number of chunks being recorded.</s><s>For example, a list of digits would be given as input to the model, and the number of chunks required to recode the list would be recorded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model predictions</head><p><s>Note that for all of the modeling results, there is no variability in the model's performance-all figures represent the actual number of chunks required to recode the respective lists, and therefore any differences are real differences in the model's performance.</s><s>Number of chunks, therefore, provides a simple estimate of processing efficiency due to prior learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ericsson et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Miller, 1956)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digit span, word span, and mixed span</head><p><s>We first examine the number of chunks required to recode digit lists and word lists, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>At all list lengths, fewer chunks are required to recode lists containing digits than lists containing words, suggesting that an associative learning account operating on language exposure predicts superior 1 Note that we do not consider the possibility that known digit pairs may interfere with to-be-remembered digit pairs.</s><s>This is because children's learning of frequently encountered word combinations only serve to facilitate performance on language-related tasks (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bannard &amp; Matthews, 2008)</ref>, with no evidence to suggest that known word combinations interfere with that performance.</s><s>performance for digit span over word span.</s><s>For mixed lists, we separately examine all lists and lists up to a length of six items, on the assumption that 6-year-old children are unlikely to proceed further than six items on such a test.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the number of chunks that are required to recode isolated digits, isolated words, digit sequences, and word sequences.</s></p><p><s>When considering all lists, there is no difference in the number of chunks used to recode isolated digits and isolated words, but a marked difference appears when considering sequences where digit sequences are recoded into fewer chunks than word sequences.</s><s>When considering list lengths up to six items, a similar pattern appears, though there are marginally fewer chunks required to recode isolated words (this is because on occasion a digit-word or word-digit sequence forms a phonetic chunk, e.g., to bed [two-bed]).</s><s>Based on associative learning, one may expect children to recall digit sequences more accurately than word sequences but perform similarly for isolated digits and words.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General discussion</head><p><s>We set out to examine whether patterns of vSTM performance in children found with different types of verbal material could be accounted for by reference to simple domain-general associative processes operating on the linguistic experience of the child.</s><s>CLASSIC used a simple sequential learning procedure to estimate the kind of associative learning that may take place for linguistic stimuli.</s><s>Our model simulation began with a repertoire whose units were restricted to basic British English phonemes and was then presented with corpora representing the linguistic experience of a 6-year-old.</s><s>Word-delimited utterances in the corpora were encoded using the fewest possible units in the available repertoire, and learning took place via the formation of new units (chunks) for pairs of adjacent units in the input.</s><s>After training on the corpora, the model was then tested with the types of stimuli typically used in tests of vSTM in children, revealing increased efficiency (fewer chunks) in the encoding of digits versus word sequences, of wordlike and phonotactically regular versus nonwordlike and phonotactically irregular nonwords, as well as showing experience-based improvements in encoding of novel sentences.</s><s>The performance of 6-year-old children for tests relating to digit span, word span, mixed span, and nonword repetition in Experiments 1 and 2 mirrored these processing efficiencies, down to the level of short-term recall of individual nonwords, as well as revealing a relationship between linguistic experience and sentence recall in both model and child.</s><s>Furthermore, the magnitude of performance differences across different stimuli sets was similar between model and child for all stimuli except sentence recall.</s><s>The pattern of performance, then, implicates basic associative learning 2 Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the failure to find significant correlations with age may be due to insufficient power, it is nonetheless clear that there is sufficient power with N = 34 to detect the other correlations, and it can at least be concluded that the role of age is considerably less than that of the other factors.</s><s>processes operating on the child's experience with language as underpinning his or her performance

functions.</s><s>This work shows that performance on widely used short-term memory tasks can be predicted by reference to associative learning mechanisms that are known to be involved even in infancy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Saffran, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In short, our computational model of associative learning provides a parsimonious explanation of performance in vSTM tasks without the need for additional bespoke processes such as a short-term memory system.</s><s>Rather than being viewed as a specific processing system, we suggest that vSTM be viewed as a particular setting in which the participant applies his or her language knowledge to the task at hand.</s><s>It is worth noting that the model presented here successfully predicts the short-term memory performance of the children while implementing a very limited (unrealistically so) set of constraints with respect to its knowledge base and the type of learning that occurs.</s><s>So, the linguistic repertoire used to encode the input is the inventory of English phonemes, while, for any given point on the developmental trajectory, a more realistic representation would plausibly include some combination of subphonemic knowledge (such as acoustic/ articulatory features, as well as larger units, such as onsets, rimes, syllables, and even longer multisegment strings, knowledge of which may precede knowledge of smaller segments, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bybee, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vihman, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, while the model only builds up knowledge based on adjacent pairwise cooccurrences in the input, longer range dependencies and predictive relationships are also a critical aspect of natural language learning, and so a more realistic reflection of the learning that can be accomplished from the input would also have to incorporate such processes.</s><s>We suggest that the limited nature of the learning that takes place in the model underlies its lesser ability to capture performance on sentence recall-a task likely to benefit more from just such longer range semantic and syntactic learning-compared to the other vSTM tasks.</s><s>However, given that the rarefied implementation presented here nonetheless is able to mirror children's performance on vSTM tasks, it is not unreasonable to suggest that a more realistic implementation, containing a more refined and elaborate set of knowledge units and associative learning processes, would likely provide a more powerful model of performance on short-term memory tests, without having to invoke short-term memory processes per se.</s><s>Also, our findings are not restricted to the particular stimuli presented in the vSTM measures used.</s><s>Similar effects occur when
