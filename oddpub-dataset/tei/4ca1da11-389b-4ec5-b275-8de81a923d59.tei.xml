<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>Individuals eligible for this study were notified as cases of tuberculosis to the Berlin health authorities between 1 st November 2010 and 31 st October 2011.</s><s>The definition of a tuberculosis case in Germany is based on the decision made by the attending physician to start a full course of anti-tuberculosis treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Notification is mandatory for all tuberculosis cases who are categorized as either clinically confirmed, clinically confirmed with an epidemiological link to another confirmed case, or laboratory confirmed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Eligible individuals were selected from the electronic notification system which is operated jointly by public health authorities at community and federal level, and included if they gave informed consent to be interviewed.</s><s>Participants included tuberculosis patients diagnosed in the penitentiary system.</s><s>Individuals were not considered for the study if they were initially notified elsewhere (i.e.</s><s>transferred in), if their diagnosis was established post-mortem, or if the case report was withdrawn due to unfounded diagnosis within three months of reporting.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study definitions</head><p><s>The study population was divided into three study groups: (i) First generation migrants were all individuals who were foreign-born and immigrated to Germany after the year 1949 (before 3 rd October 1990: immigration either to the Federal Republic of Germany or to the German Democratic Republic).</s><s>(ii) Second generation migrants were born in Germany to at least one parent being a first generation migrant or of foreign citizenship.</s><s>These definitions were in accordance with those used for the German microcensus 2011 (Federal Statistical Office) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>(iii) Native residents included all individuals who did not meet the above definitions.</s><s>The term 'foreign origin' in this study denotes individuals with either a foreign country of birth or a foreign citizenship.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and data collection</head><p><s>A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted.</s><s>Eligible individuals were informed about the study by the attending social worker of the Berlin Centre of Tuberculosis either face-toface or via a letter.</s><s>Letters were produced in German, English, French, Turkish, Russian and Arabic.</s><s>If consent was given to be contacted for the study, contact details were transferred to the study team.</s><s>Following informed verbal consent (see: ethics statement), face-to-face interviews were conducted by a trained study nurse, using a standardized questionnaire.</s><s>The questionnaire included demographic information (such as date and place of birth), information about migration history of patients and their parents, and maternal and household language use.</s><s>Patients with insufficient German language skills were interviewed with assistance of certified interpreters.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data sources and management</head><p><s>Data obtained via the interviews were entered into a study database using double-entry verification.</s><s>The study database was linked at the Robert Koch Institute with the standard notification data for Berlin of the same period, using a list of unique identifiers administered by the Centre for Tuberculosis.</s><s>Population-based data on the number of first and second generation migrants and native residents in Berlin were obtained from the German microcensus 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Data Analysis STATA 10.1 statistical application (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for data analysis.</s><s>The response rate for the study was determined by comparing the number of patients enrolled to the number of tuberculosis cases notified in the study period.</s><s>A non-response analysis was conducted on the basis of notification data, in order to assess the effect of participation on tuberculosis rates in each of the three study groups.</s><s>Variables were included in a multivariable logistic regression model according to the strength of their association, using a step-wise forward technique.</s><s>Likelihood ratio test statistics were calculated to identify variables independently associated with study participation at significance level α = 0.05, and to assess potential interaction.</s></p><p><s>Proportions of first-, second generation migrants and native residents and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) in the study sample were calculated.</s><s>Tuberculosis rates and rate ratios for each of the study groups were calculated as follows: The proportions of first-and second generation migrants and native residents observed in the study sample were applied to the total number of tuberculosis cases notified, to calculate the expected numbers of tuberculosis patients for each of the study groups.</s><s>Rate denominators for the three study groups were derived from the microcensus.</s><s>Rate-ratios were calculated for first-and second generation migrants, using the tuberculosis rate among native residents as the baseline.</s></p><p><s>In order to assess for non-response bias, tuberculosis rates were re-calculated on the basis of group proportions weighted for study participation using inverse probability weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> derived from the logistic regression model on study participation (see above).</s></p><p><s>To investigate how complete first and second generation migration was captured in the German notification system we calculated sensitivity estimates for the notification data variables country of birth and citizenship using our study results as a reference.</s><s>"Sensitivity" was defined as the number of individuals considered as migrants when a particular variable was used divided by the true number of migrants (first and second generation) ascertained through the interviews.</s><s>For example, the sensitivity to detect migration by the variables country of birth and citizenship combined was calculated as the number of study participants with either foreign country of birth or foreign citizenship (according to the notification data) divided by the total number of first and second generation migrants identified through the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics statement</head><p><s>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin (№ EA2/126/10).</s><s>A detailed procedure of information and verbal informed consent that takes into account the specific needs of eligible patients in our setting was developed.</s><s>The patients' age and their capacity and ability to understand the purpose and essential information of the study were assessed by the attending social worker (upon pre-information) and again by the interviewer (and interpreter).</s><s>A standardized information and consent protocol was used to document the patient's comprehension of the study and verbal consent.</s><s>In individuals with reduced capacity or ability to provide informed verbal consent and in children under 18 years of age, we sought to obtain informed consent from and to conduct the interview with a parent or legal guardian.</s><s>Additionally, assent to participate was sought in children aged between 10 and 17 years.</s><s>We decided to obtain verbal instead of written consent for the following reasons: We considered that immigrants may feel uncomfortable to provide written informed consent, in particular if they were staying in Germany without legal residence permit.</s><s>Further, verbal informed consent allowed us to offer eligible patients to be informed (and interviewed) via phone in case they were unable to come to the study centre or uncomfortable to receive visitors.</s><s>The procedure of verbal informed consent including the consent protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee.</s></p><p><s>Access and linkage of notification data with the research database was approved by the data protection officers of the Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study shows that in Berlin, one of the European capital cities, second generation migrants have a 2-fold higher rate of tuberculosis compared to native (non-migrant) residents.</s><s>The tuberculosis rate appears to be gradually higher from native residents to second to first generation migrants.</s><s>Both first and second generation migrants together account for almost twothirds of tuberculosis cases, a finding that is in line with trends in other major European cities, underscoring that migrants (and their families) constitute one of the most important risk groups for tuberculosis control in Western Europe nowadays <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date, very few studies in Europe and elsewhere have investigated tuberculosis in successive generations of migrants.</s><s>In a series of prospective studies of childhood tuberculosis in Sweden more than 30 years ago, Romanus showed that tuberculosis was about eight to ten times more common in non-BCG-immunized children born in Sweden to foreign parents than in children born to Swedish parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our prospective study suggests that second generation migrants are at higher risk of tuberculosis compared to native residents: Several factors may explain this finding: Second generation migrants may be at increased risk of infection compared to native residents due to more frequent contact to/mixing with individuals at higher risk of active tuberculosis, such as the parent generation of migrants.</s><s>Crowded conditions in asylum or migrant shelters <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref> may accelerate this risk.</s><s>Further, visiting their family's country of origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref> may contribute to a higher risk of tuberculosis in second (and first) generation migrants compared to native residents, particularly in those visiting countries with a high prevalence of the disease.</s><s>Upon infection, second generation migrants might incur an increased risk of disease progression compared to native residents due to socio-economic, lifestyle and nutritional factors.</s></p><p><s>The high risk of tuberculosis in individuals with a personal history of immigration to Western Europe, such as asylum seekers, is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>We found that most first generation migrants with tuberculosis immigrated to Germany in more recent years, a finding that is consistent with previous studies that have documented a continuous decline but persistently high risk of tuberculosis over time since immigration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We show that under the prevailing German notification system second generation migrants are not sufficiently captured.</s><s>The system includes data for country of birth and citizenship, which, as we show, allow for capturing first generation migrants but are insufficient to reasonably distinguish second generation migrants from the resident population, rendering tuberculosis monitoring and evaluation in this particular group impossible.</s></p><p><s>Our study was conducted in the complex environment of city-wide tuberculosis health care services and has several limitations.</s><s>We were unable to include more than half of eligible patients in this study.</s><s>Data protection and confidentiality issues required a rigorous recruitment strategy, where patients could only be contacted once within a pre-specified time window and informed about the study by the attending social worker.</s><s>Non-response was due mainly to failure to contact (or receive feedback) from eligible tuberculosis patients.</s><s>We tried to avoid nonresponse bias by ensuring the voluntary nature and confidentiality of the interviews, and by providing multilingual information and interpretation.</s><s>Weighting for factors associated with lower participation resulted in only minor changes to notification rates estimated in our study, suggesting that non-response bias is unlikely to explain the observed results.</s><s>However, absolute rates and rate-ratios have to be interpreted with caution because the possibility of non-response bias cannot be fully excluded.</s><s>Our study aimed to investigate the frequency of tuberculosis in subpopulations, but it does not allow for estimating risk at the individual level given that individuals may be heterogeneous in terms of other risk factors for

did not allow us to stratify the rate of tuberculosis in immigrants by different countries or areas of origin.</s><s>Moreover, we were unable to consider incident tuberculosis cases not known to the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In this large metropolitan setting in Western Europe, second generation migrants are at higher risk of tuberculosis compared to native (non-migrants) residents.</s><s>Their elevated risk is likely related to the much higher risk in first generation migrants.</s><s>Given the long period between immigration and disease notification in the latter (median: 8 years), it is unlikely that at-entry screenings for tuberculosis alone are currently effective.</s><s>Instead, making primary health care accessible and affordable for migrant families, particularly for refugees and asylum-seekers, could have a greater impact on tuberculosis control <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Strengthening of primary health care is needed to increase provider's awareness of symptoms and risk factors for tuberculosis and to provide information and care that is culturally and socially sensitive.</s><s>A more comprehensive approach for tuberculosis prevention and management for first generation migrants at the primary care level will likely benefit tuberculosis control in successive migrant generations.</s><s>We speculate that care providers should additionally consider screening for latent infection in second generation migrants.</s></p><p><s>We show that migration as an important determinant for tuberculosis in Western Europe is incompletely captured by the surveillance variables country of birth and citizenship because these variables largely fail to capture second generation migration.</s><s>Surveillance systems in Western European countries should allow for quantifying the tuberculosis burden in this important risk group.</s><s>By the time this study was conducted, Germany adapted routine recording and reporting to include information about parental migration history of tuberculosis cases.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
