infiltration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Although the etiology of psoriasis has not yet been fully elucidated, the abnormal production of several inflammatory mediators from immune cells such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-23 are confirmed to play a key role in psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>In recent years, it has been shown that the disturbed epidermal barrier function plays an important role in psoriasis susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The differentiation of keratinocytes is demonstrated impaired in the psoriatic skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Involucrin and loricrin are both proteins play key role in formation of the skin barrier and terminal differentiation of epidermis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>It is well known that the expression of involucrin is increased and mislocalized in psoriatic epidermis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>However, the expression of loricrin was found to be decreased in lesional and non-lesional skin of psoriasis in comparison with normal skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Rottlerin (also called Kamala or Mallotoxin) is a polyphenolic compound derived from Mallotus philipinensis (Euphorbiaceae) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Rottlerin was originally used as an inhibitor of the PKCδ <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>However, recent studies indicate that rottlerin may not have a direct effect on PKCδ and PKCδ-independent mechanisms of action have been indicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Purified rottlerin has recently been found to possess a wide range of therapeutic effects, such as anticancer, antifertility, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and antioxidation effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Rottlerin also causes growth arrest in different cell types, including pancreatic cancer stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, MCF-7 breast cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>,which is the mechanism involving inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) nuclear migration and downregulation of cyclin D1.</s><s>As a result, many researchers have proposed the possible therapeutic effects by rottlerin to treat psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is important to clarify the effects of rottlerin on keratinocytes and psoriasis in order to propose a new and acceptable intervention for patients with psoriasis requiring long-term of therapy.</s></p><p><s>The former data is only based on HaCaT cells.</s><s>Since HaCaT cells are more readily available and do not require time-consuming isolation from tissues, this cell line has been widely used as an alternative for normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) and as in vitro model of psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However, these cells bear some genetic alternations and lack potential interdonor variability.</s><s>In addition, since the expression of differentiation markers in HaCaT cells in response to cytokines are different from NHEKs, HaCaT cells may have a limitation when studying related inflammatory skin diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In order to identify the effects of rottlerin more precisely, NHEKs were employed to evaluate whether rottlerin induces the same effects observed in cancer and immortalized HaCaT cells.</s><s>Meanwhile, it is well known that the mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation (IPI) may develop a T cell-dependent inflammatory skin disease with several similarities to psoriasis, which serves as a wellestablished model for investigating of the pathogenesis and therapeutic agents of psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we investigated the effects of rottlerin on the IPI of BALB/c mice, focusing on the alterations induced by rottlerin.</s></p><p><s>This study demonstrates that rottlerin inhibited the proliferation, cell senescence of NHEKs and tube formation on matrigel made of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).</s><s>We also showed that inflammatory cytokines induced by 12-O-tetradecanolylphorbol13-acetate (TPA) in keratinocytes were significantly inhibited after rottlerin treatment.</s><s>These results suggest that rottlerin has multiple anti-psoriatic effects in vitro.</s><s>Furthermore, we showed that imiquimod-induced psoriasiform inflammation was more attenuated by rottlerin in mice.</s><s>Taken together, our findings presented provide evidence that rottlerin offers insights into possible therapies for the treatment of psoriasis.</s></p></div>
