monocytes was described <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>It was suggested that the imbalance between monocyte subsets in patients with Crohn's disease is due to recruitment of the classic monocytes, which are more migratory than the non-classic monocytes, to sites of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the difference between axSpA and Crohn's disease may be caused by differences in the extent of local inflammation which controls recruitment of monocytes.</s><s>On the other hand, HLA-B27 could also affect the differentiation of monocyte subsets and promote the differentiation of classic monocytes.</s><s>Thiesen et al. analysed cytokine production of sorted human monocyte subsets and found that classic monocytes, though considered more phagocytic and less inflammatory, produced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines than the non-classic monocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, we observed enhanced spontaneous as well as MDP-and FSL-1-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with axSpA and, according to the data by Thiesen et al., this could be related to the expansion of classic monocytes.</s></p><p><s>The enhanced cytokine production by monocytes of patients with axSpA in particular to suboptimal stimuli such as MDP and FSL-1, which require co-activating signals such as ineffective doses of LPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or low levels of cytokines, suggests that monocytes of patients with axSpA are pre-activated in vivo.</s><s>This is also suggested by mRNA expression profiles showing enhanced IL-1 receptor expression in blood cells of patients with axSpA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and by results of protein profiling of monocytes of axSpA patients that showed enhanced expression of proteins involved in TLR signaling, leukocyte extravasation, and other inflammatory pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Genome association studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and experimental <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and clinical <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> data suggest an involvement of the IL-23-Th17 pathway in axSpA.</s><s>However, the production of IL-12/23p40 production was rather low in peripheral blood monocytes in our study and with no difference between axSpA patients and controls.</s><s>Even after strong stimulation with LPS, only about 5 % of the monocytes produced IL-12/ 23p40, suggesting that monocytes are not a major source of this cytokine.</s><s>In fact, our own analysis of the bone marrow of facet joints of patients with AS revealed myeloperoxidase-positive cells and, to a lesser extent, macrophages and dendritic cells as sources of IL-23 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the enhanced cytokine responses to MDP and FSL-1, cytokine production in response to LPS was, at least partially, reduced in patients with axSpA.</s><s>Reduced LPS responses are observed in endotoxin tolerance which is induced by pre-exposure of monocytes to low doses of LPS.</s><s>However, the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine responses by monocytes of patients with axSpA is rather minor and accompanied by a strong suppression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 production, whereas the state of endotoxin tolerance and monocyte paralysis, as for instance observed in patients with sepsis, is characterized by a strongly suppressed proinflammatory response and partly preserved IL-10 production <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the decent reduction of cytokine responses to LPS which is the strongest of the tested stimuli may indicate exhaustion of monocytes after pre-activation rather than tolerization.</s></p><p><s>The enhanced spontaneous production of cytokines was restricted to axSpA patients under conventional treatment and is not found in axSpA patients under TNFα inhibitor treatment or in RA patients.</s><s>However, LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-10 production was also reduced in axSpA patients who received TNFα inhibitor.</s><s>This could be attributable to the presence of TNFα inhibitors in the whole blood stimulation which may neutralize some autocrine effects of TNFα produced during early activation.</s><s>In particular, IL-10 depends on autocrine production of TNFα <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Also, in patients with RA, LPS-induced production of IL-6 and TNFα was reduced and this may also be related to glucocorticoid therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Differences in cytokine responses to TLR ligands may be caused by differential expression of TLRs.</s><s>In fact, enhanced expression of TLR 4 on blood monocytes has been described in patients with SpA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, in our study, no differences were found in the expression of TLR 1, 2, and 4 in axSpA patients compared with controls and this might be due to technical differences as we analysed expression in whole blood as compared with isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used a different gating strategy.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, stimulation of bone marrow cells and splenocytes from HLA-B27/huβ2m transgenic rats with TNFα <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> or zymosan or Mycobacterium tuberculosis also resulted in elevated production of IL-1α and IL-1β compared with control rats, indicating that the enhanced responsiveness of axSpA patients to bacterial triggers may be related to HLA-B27.</s><s>On the other hand, the expansion of classic monocytes and in vivo pre-activation of monocytes in patients with axSpA could also be the result of in vivo activation by cytokines released by local inflammation or by bacterial components such as LPS which may translocate during intestinal inflammation as mucosal inflammation is a common feature in axSpA.</s><s>Thus, about 5 % of patients with AS also suffer from overt inflammatory bowel disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and about 50 % show microscopic gut lesions in the absence of gastrointestinal discomfort <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Delineation of potential triggers of the spontaneous cytokine production is difficult since cellular responses of monocytes to LPS and cytokines such as TNFα are strongly overlapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Only some genes such as apoptosis-related genes are selectively induced in monocytes by LPS in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and analysis of their expression might provide clues on the activating signal of monocytes in patients with axSpA.</s></p><p><s>TNFα inhibitor treatment of axSpA normalized the functional state of monocytes as elevated cytokine responses were confined to axSpA patients under conventional treatment.</s><s>The fact that MDP-and FSL-1-induced Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> No difference in Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1, 2, and 4 expression on CD14 + monocytes between axial spondyloarthritis patients and controls.</s><s>The expression of TLR-1, TLR-2, and TLR-4 on monocytes was determined in healthy controls (C) (n = 16), patients with axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) (n = 22), and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 9) by surface staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting and is given as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).</s><s>Monocytes were identified according to CD14 expression cytokine production was unaffected under TNFα inhibitor treatment suggests that the effect of TNFα inhibitor treatment is an in vivo effect rather than an in vitro effect.</s><s>Thus, the TNFα inhibitor treatment may interfere with the triggers of monocytic cytokine production such as local cytokine production or bacterial antigen translocation.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, we found that spontaneous MDP-and LPS-induced production of cytokines correlated with disease activity.</s><s>As CRP correlated neither with BASDAI nor with the monocytic cytokine production, monocyte activation might be a more sensitive indicator of inflammation than CRP.</s><s>However, the monocytic pre-activation, particularly the spontaneous production of IL-1β as well as IL-6, does not seem to be directly pathogenic as blockade of IL-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> as well as IL-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> is of limited or no efficacy in reducing disease activity in AS.</s><s>The enhanced IL-1β and IL-6 production by monocytes rather seems to be an indicator of systemic innate immune activation while other immune functions of monocytes or other cell types may exert the pathogenic effects.</s></p></div>
