<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mortality rates</head><p><s>We analysed trends in mortality rates of SIDS and related diagnostic groups between 1968 and 2009 in the United States.</s><s>We used the following International Classification of Diseases (ICD) systems: the 8th revision (ICD-8) for the years 1968-1978, ICD-9 for 1979-1998, and ICD-10 for 1999-2009 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided the annual numbers of infant deaths and live births.</s><s>Infant deaths were defined as deaths of infants less than 1 year of age.</s><s>We calculated mortality rates by dividing the number of infant deaths by the number of live births.</s><s>After the introduction of the SIDS diagnosis in 1969, SIDS mortality increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</s><s>This increase seems to have been partially caused by a diagnostic shift to SIDS from other diagnoses, such as ill-defined causes of death, unintentional suffocation, and respiratory infections.</s><s>We included related diagnostic groups to determine a cut-off after which an artefact due to coding seemed unlikely.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunisation coverage</head><p><s>We retrieved data on DTP, OPV, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) immunisation coverage using existing surveys <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>DTP, OPV, and the Hib vaccine are all scheduled during the first 6 months of life (at 2, 4, and 6 months), which is the peak age range for SIDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>To ensure comparability over time, we used the reported coverage of at least three doses of the respective vaccine.</s><s>From 1995 onwards, any pertussis vaccine was reported including acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The following three surveys provided data on immunisation coverage in the United States: the United States Immunization Survey <ref type="bibr">(USIS;</ref><ref type="bibr">1968</ref><ref type="bibr">-1985)</ref>, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; 1991-1993), and the National Immunization Survey (NIS; 1994-2009) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>The USIS started as an area-probability household survey using face-to-face interviews and became a telephone survey in 1971 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Until 1978, the USIS assessed the immunisation of children between 1 and 4 years of age.</s><s>Between 1979 and 1985, the survey included only children aged 24-35 months.</s><s>The collected information was based on either parental recall or an immunisation record that was maintained at home.</s><s>There was a lack of information on immunisation coverage from 1986-1990.</s><s>From 1991 onwards, the NHIS assessed the immunisation status of children aged <ref type="bibr">19-35 months [20,23,24]</ref>.</s><s>The NHIS examined a representative probability sample of households in the United States using face-to-face interviews.</s><s>If a child's immunisation records were available, the data were abstracted from the records; otherwise, the collected information was based on parental recall.</s><s>Then, in 1994, the CDC implemented the NIS for continuous monitoring of immunisation coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>For 1994, we used the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, and for the years 1995-2009, we used the public use files that are published on the CDC website <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>.</s><s>*includes diagnoses such as accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (E913.0/W75)</s><s>and unspecified threat to breathing (E913.9/W84).</s></p><p><s>The NIS is a random-digit-dialling telephone survey of households with children aged 19-35 months.</s><s>The data were validated with the immunisation history of the child, which was obtained from the family's health care provider <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The NIS and NHIS yielded similar results for estimated immunisation coverage levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In the current study, immunisation coverage is presented graphically as the percentage of children who were immunised with DTP, OPV, and the Hib vaccine in each year during the time period from 1968 to 2009.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>Joinpoint regression analyses, also called segmented or piecewise regression analyses, were conducted to identify the specific years (joinpoints) when significant changes in trends of mortality rates occurred.</s><s>Joinpoint regression splits the data into segments and fits the trends for each segment.</s><s>The annual percentage change (APC) in the mortality rates of SIDS and related diagnostic groups within all segments was estimated.</s><s>The APC described the percentage change in the mortality rates in a specific year compared to the previous year.</s><s>The analysis assumed that mortality rates changed at a constant percentage every year during the defined time periods between joinpoints.</s><s>Log-linear models were fitted for mortality rates and the number of possible joinpoints was set between 0 and 5.</s><s>The number of joinpoints was verified using a permutation test.</s><s>For the annual percentage change estimates, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.</s><s>The Joinpoint Regression Program version 4.0.1 (National Cancer Institute, Calverton, MD, USA) was used.</s></p><p><s>Based on the results of the joinpoint analyses, the multivariable analysis of the association between SIDS mortality rates and DTP immunisation coverage was restricted to the years 1975-2009.</s><s>The large increases in SIDS rates in the years <ref type="bibr">1968-1971 and 1971-1974</ref> were most likely caused by changes in coding.</s><s>As a consequence, the analysis was started after the point of change in the year 1974 which resulted in the analysed period of the years 1975-2009.</s><s>First, lowess smoothers, a non-parametric regression method, were plotted to visualise the association between SIDS rates and DPT immunisation coverage.</s><s>Then, multivariable generalised additive models were fitted using the procedure GAM of the statistical software package R (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).</s><s>GAM is an exploratory data analysis tool that evaluates the linearity of associations.</s><s>We evaluated the association between SIDS mortality rates as the dependent variable and the independent variables of DTP immunisation coverage and prevalence of the supine sleep position.</s><s>Because the dependent variable was mortality rate, the log-link function was used.</s><s>The initial assessment showed that the associations between SIDS mortality rates and DTP immunisation coverage, adjusted for the prevalence of the supine sleep position, were linear.</s><s>Therefore, a Poisson regression model was built as the final model for SIDS mortality rates using the procedure GLM in R with the log-link function.</s><s>The independent variables of this model included DTP immunisation coverage and prevalence of the supine sleep position.</s><s>We also considered OPV and Hib immunisation coverage as independent variables.</s><s>Spearman's rank correlation was used to determine the correlations among DTP, OPV, and Hib immunisation coverage.</s><s>The correlation coefficients were 0.96 between DTP and OPV, and 0.65 between DTP and Hib immunisation coverage (from 1992 onward).</s><s>Thus, the final Poisson regression model did not include OPV and Hib immunisation coverage due to collinearity.</s><s>To investigate the association between OPV immunisation coverage and SIDS mortality rates, we built a separate Poisson regression model with OPV immunisation coverage and prevalence of the supine sleep position as the independent variables.</s><s>The association between SIDS mortality rates and Hib immunisation coverage was not investigated because the corresponding data were not available before 1992.</s><s>The estimates are presented as incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs.</s><s>The analyses were performed using R version 2.15.1 with the additional MGCV package.</s></p></div>

SIDS rates from the late 1960s to 1974 as shown by the current study's joinpoint analyses were most likely due to a shift in coding.</s><s>After 1974, SIDS mortality rates stabilised with only minor increases until 1979.</s><s>SIDS mortality rates started to decrease slightly between 1979 and 1991.</s><s>The most notable decreases in SIDS rates occurred from 1991 onwards, coinciding with increases in DTP immunisation.</s></p><p><s>Meta-analyses have shown that DTP immunisation, with or without OPV or the Hib vaccine, is associated with a reduced risk of SIDS <ref type="bibr"

target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>However, recommendations to the public and the 'grey literaure' often do not include immunisation in the prevention of SIDS.</s><s>Prevailing safety concerns with regard to immunisation may have played a role in this hesistance for many years.</s><s>Studies showing a reduction of SIDS associated with immunisation have typically reported their results cautiously, often using double negations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</s><s>For example, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development SIDS Cooperative Epidemiological Study showed that the relative risk of SIDS associated with DTP immunisation was 0.54 in cases compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001, no CI reported) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The authors carefully concluded that "DTP immunisation was not a significant factor in the occurrence of SIDS" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>DTP immunisation may protect against SIDS by preventing infection with Bordetella (B.) pertussis.</s><s>SIDS    might thus be undiagnosed pertussis <ref

found in SIDS cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>However, a case-control study investigating the association between B. pertussis infection and SIDS did not show a difference in the prevalence of B. pertussis between the SIDS cases and the controls (5.1% vs. 5.3%, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s><s>In the case of an association, SIDS might occur at a time when B. pertussis is not yet or no longer detectable.</s><s>More studies are needed as evidence from only one case-control studyeven if well-done -is too sparse to draw a conclusion.</s><s>B.

a lack of sensitivity in diagnostic testing or a protective effect of the immunisation, independent of direct prevention of B. pertussis infection.</s></p><p><s>In the current study, DTP immunisation was highly correlated with OPV and Hib immunisation.</s><s>Furthermore, similar to DTP immunisation, OPV immunisation was associated with a reduced risk of SIDS.</s><s>Case-control studies have associated a similar reduction in SIDS risk with DTP and OPV immunisation, whereas less evidence is available regarding Hib immunisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</s><s>In most countries, OPV immunisation did not decrease to the same extent as in the United States.</s><s>In England, for example, OPV immunisation coverage remained at approximately 80%, with the trends in SIDS mortality being similar to the trends in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</s><s>Hib immunisation was introduced in many countries during the early 1990s, and this vaccine may be a responsible agent in the prevention of SIDS as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the pertussis component, DTP includes diphtheria and tetanus components.</s><s>Certain countries, such as England and Sweden, previously experienced major decreases in pertussis immunisation but administered diphtheria and tetanus vaccines separately, thus maintaining high coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>.</s><s>The SIDS trends in these countries were similar to the trends in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, diphtheria and tetanus immunisation seem less likely to be associated with SIDS.</s></p><p><s>Changes in the coverage of pertussis immunisation, the recommended schedule, and the type of immunisation often coincided with the promotion of the non-prone sleep position for infants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</s><s>This phenomenon renders the disentangling of individual effects on SIDS mortality difficult.</s><s>The increasing prevalence of the supine sleep position during the 1990s coincided with the increase in DTP immunisation coverage in the United States.</s><s>Similarly, in England, the national 'Back to Sleep' campaign and the resumption of pertussis immunisation of the population both occurred during the early 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</s><s>In West Germany, for example, pertussis immunisation was removed from the national recommendations between 1974 and 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The reintroduction of pertussis immunisations in 1991 occurred at the same time as regional campaigns promoting the non-prone sleep position <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The lack of standardised assessments of both pertussis immunisation coverage and infants' sleep positions, however, hinders regional comparisons over time.</s></p><p><s>The current study has several limitations.</s><s>A major limitation is the use of historic data and the lack of uniform assessment of pertussis immunisation.</s><s>Three different surveys provided the data that were used in the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the USIS had several known methodological weaknesses that led to its discontinuation in 1985 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>These weaknesses included the shift from using a household-based survey to a telephone-based survey in 1971 and the mixed use of parental recall and immunisation records.</s><s>The NHIS survey also changed its methodology between 1991 and 1992 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The third survey, the NIS, was a telephonebased survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Despite adjustments, differences in immunisation coverage between households with and without a telephone cannot be excluded.</s><s>An additional limitation is the lack of data on immunisation for the years 1986-1990.</s><s>Data on sleep position were only available beginning in 1992 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>. Carrying the first value (13%, supine sleep position) backward might have underestimated the association between SIDS mortality and sleep position if the supine sleep position had been more prevalent during the first years of the analysis.</s></p><p><s>Finally, ecological studies are at a higher risk of being affected by confounders compared with other epidemiological studies due to the use of aggregated data.</s><s>Both immunisation and the supine sleep position were more prevalent in populations with a higher socioeconomic status during the early 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>.</s><s>Socioeconomic status is linked to a number of other health-related behaviours that potentially affect the occurrence of SIDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Potential confounders at the population level include changes in the prevalence of smoking, breastfeeding, and pacifier use, as well as changes in sleep environment and socioeconomic conditions, including cultural background <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s></p></div>
