the model system under study is allowed to relax to equilibrium completely after a perturbation before the effect of a subsequent perturbation is considered.</s></p><p><s>However, in experiments involving real-world physical systems, individual avalanches are often not directly observable-the signal is in many cases continuous.</s><s>Perturbations are generated by the presence of stochasticity intrinsic to the system and may occur at random before the termination of an avalanche caused by a prior perturbation.</s><s>Thus avalanches 'overlap' in the temporal domain and the degree of overlap depends on the size of the system, assuming that perturbations occur at random in each component element; such overlapping generates a continuous signal.</s></p><p><s>In neuroscience, several experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have provided evidence in vitro that small isolated neuronal networks display CD; however, the networks studied do not typically display a separation between periods of inactivity and activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>In such experiments, a period of inactivity is defined by the network returning to a quiescent baseline level of lesser activity set by a threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>While this technique may work for small networks isolated in cultures, results have been contradictory in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>; no consideration has yet been given to the hypothesis that this discrepancy is due to the absence of separation of time-scales in the continuous neuronal activity.</s></p><p><s>When testing the hypothesis of criticality in the human brain, the problem of a lack of separation between avalanches is especially pressing.</s><s>The use of invasive electrodes is problematic and research is often limited to macroscopic imaging of the entire brain, using, for instance, electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings.</s><s>The entire human brain never attains a quiescent level of baseline activity; the brain is continuously active rather than being relatively inactive between bursts of activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Only a few papers have claimed to test the hypothesis of criticality from the large-scale brain signals of awake human subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>These analyses are subject to several difficulties; firstly, the threshold set for separation between activity and inactivity is high, thus making the relationship to genuine separation of time-scales unclear.</s><s>Secondly, as a consequence of this high threshold, the authors find CD only over short time-scales (&lt;1 second).</s><s>Thus no explanation may be offered on this basis of the long-term variability of human brain activity.</s></p><p><s>Such difficulties stemming from the lack of separation between activity and inactivity in vivo make unclear whether the results of in vitro experiments confirming criticality in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> generalize to the intact brain of awake human subjects.</s><s>Despite these difficulties, the question remains, why does the human brain display the same 1/f γ form in its power-spectra <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> as posited by CD <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>?</s><s>The most prominent alternative theory to CD proposes that the scale-free form of the power-spectra, for example, of EEG and MEG data, is due not to CD but to passive filtering (PF) of activity through the extracellular media <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>; thus the authors show that CD is not necessary to explain the 1/f γ form of the power-spectrum.</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we show that the PF explanation is insufficient in reproducing certain longrange properties of EEG data which we show theoretically must hold if the CD theory is correct.</s><s>We demonstrate that if a critical system produces temporally overlapping avalanches, which superimpose linearly at the level of sensors (as is known for electrophysiological recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>), then the corresponding stochastic process generated by such activity may be shown to display novel properties, distinct from the form of the power-spectrum, which are provably not explainable by the PF theory.</s><s>Our theory shows for the first time that critical universality classes naturally fall into subclasses which we refer to as meta-universality classes; the meta-universality classes are defined according to the spectral properties of the narrowband amplitude processes derived non-linearly from the activity produced by the system.</s><s>The theory allows us to derive a test for CD in macroscopic neural recordings without requiring separation of activity and inactivity.</s><s>We apply the test to EEG recordings and find that the data strongly favour the CD hypothesis over the PF hypothesis as a theory of neuronal variability over long time-scales.</s><s>An illustration of our approach is displayed in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of theory</head><p><s>We assume that we record activity of a macroscopic electrophysiological signal such as the EEG or MEG and that the activity is generated by a large neural network.</s><s>We assume moreover that the activity is composed of the activity of numerous local neural networks such that the total activity measured is a linear superposition of the activity of these local networks; this linear superposition is well known and studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The activity of these local neural networks is composed of bursts of activity interleaved by periods of quiescence, due to the sparseness of neuronal firing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>In physical terms, these bursts of activity may be thought of as perturbations from equilibrium caused by the intrinsic stochasticity of the network.</s><s>We shall refer to these bursts of activity as "avalanches", independently of whether their size and lifetime are power-law distributed.</s><s>Thus short bursts of activity will be referred to as "short avalanches", despite the everyday connotation of the word "avalanche" as a "tumbling of snow of immense size".</s><s>To simplify matters we assume that at each time step a fixed number of avalanches of local neural networks are initiated.</s><s>Thus the recorded signal consists of the linear superposition of all avalanches initiated at prior times which have yet to subside.</s></p><p><s>According to the CD theory the size (number of neurons firing) and lifetime (length in time) of the avalanches of local neural networks are power-law distributed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>; according to the PF theory, the size and lifetime distributions decay faster than a power-law <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the case of the PF theory the long range correlations/ power-law power spectrum observed in the macroscopic neural signals are generated by filtering through the extracellular medium between recording electrode and neuronal activity.</s><s>The PF hypothesis asserts that this filtering is caused by ionic diffusion generated by recalibration of concentrations through the medium at the source of the neuronal activity after polarization of neuronal membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Vital to note from the outset is that our theory predicts properties of the amplitude dynamics of the narrowband activity of macroscopic neural signals.</s><s>The importance of these The approach taken in this paper.</s><s>Criticality implies that the distibutions of discrete avalanches are power-law (left hand side).</s><s>However analysing discrete dynamics is problematic on the basis of continuous EEG/ MEG recordings.</s><s>Until now it was unclear how to distinguish criticality from alternative explanations of 1/f γ power-spectra on the basis of continuous data (right hand side) such as EEG/ MEG.</s><s>We show that criticality implies that the narrowbands of the continuous data have specific long-range properties (left hand branch of right hand side).</s><s>The passive-filtering theory of the origin of the 1/f γ form of EEG/ MEG power-spectra does not predict such longrange narrowband properties (right hand branch of right hand side).</s><s>Thus we have a criterion to distinguish criticality from passive filtering on the basis of MEG/ EEG recordings.</s><s>We perform this test on empirical data.</s><s>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175628.g001</s><s>dynamics in the CD/ PF debate is that they are invariant to linear filtering of the underlying signal.</s><s>This is because the signal may be considered a linear combination of its narrowband (individual frequency) activities-a linear filter has only the effect of reweighting these narrowbands <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Thus predictions made on the basis of CD regarding these narrowband dynamics circumvent the counterarguments of the PF theory.</s></p><p><s>Fig 2 illustrates our theory.</s><s>The upper row (rows delineated by the square brackets and dotted lines) displays sample avalanches which are initiated at each time-step according to both the PF and CD theories; for visualization purposes, each subsequent avalanche is displayed at a separate position in the y-direction (from bottom to top in time, according to when each period began).</s><s>In the second row, we see the sample activity X(t), produced by the network, composed as the linear superposition (sum) of all of these avalanches.</s><s>The third row displays the observed data at the measurement device X 0 (t), which is given according to PF by a 1/f γ filtered version of X(t) but according to CD simply as a scalar multiple (dependent on the proximity to the recording electrode) of X(t).</s><s>The fourth and fifth rows display narrowband timeseries f ω 1 (X 0 (t)), f ω 2 (X 0 (t)) which are obtained from the observed activity X 0 (t) by linear filtering in a narrow pass-band around two distinct frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 .</s><s>In each row we visualize three cases.</s><s>The left hand column corresponds to the PF theory, the right two columns correspond to two distinct universality classes in CD, which we denote by parameters α, β; the length of avalanches are distributed as p(L)*L −α and the height of avalanches as p(h)*L β .</s><s>Informally α determines how likely long avalanches are in comparison to short avalanches and β relates to how tall long avalanches are in comparison to short avalanches (see Section: Materials and Methods: Theoretical Results for details).</s><s>In Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> we consider fixed β since varying β has simply the effect of altering the results quantitatively (but not qualitatively) and controlling the exact onset of the distinct behaviours (thus we relegate detailed discussion of β to the theory section).</s></p><p><s>We see that the PF and CD theories make differing predictions and that the predictions of the CD theory depend on the universality class.</s><s>The predictions relate to the dynamics of narrowbands f ω (X 0 (t)) for all ω.</s><s>This holds since in both the PF and CD cases, the dynamics of f ω i (X 0 (t)) are unaffected by linear filtering of X(t).</s></p><p><s>1.</s><s>The PF theory predicts that X(t) is not an auto-correlated time-series over long-time scales (left, second row).</s><s>This is because the avalanches do not span long enough time-scales to induce long-range correlations (left, top row).</s><s>This implies that distant time-points of X(t) are independent.</s><s>The long-range variability of X 0 (t) (where X 0 (t) is the observed data) is induced by passive filtering through the extra cellular medium (left, third row).</s><s>This implies that the amplitude envelopes of the narrow-band time-series, f ω 1 (X 0 (t)), f ω 2 (X 0 (t)), are also uncorrelated over long time-scales and across frequencies (left, fourth and fifth row); this is because f ω i (X 0 (t)) preserves the dynamics of f ω i (X(t))-the process of linear filtering has no effect on narrowband dynamics.</s></p><p><s>2. For α = 2.5 long avalanches are far more likely than in the passive filtering case; the total variance of long avalanches outweighs the variance of small avalanches (centre, top row).</s><s>This implies that the total activity of the system X(t) and therefore the observed activity X 0 (t) display scale-free fluctuations over all time-scales (centre, second and third rows).</s></p><p><s>Because the variance of the large avalanches dominate over the small avalanches, the amplitude of the narrowband time-series display scale-free fluctuations on all time-scales; since the fluctuations arise from the swell in variance profile generated by individual avalanches which have broadband frequency content, these scale-free fluctuations are correlated across frequencies (centre, fourth and fifth rows).</s><s>Informally speaking, the avalanches "protrude" from X 0 (t); such "protruding" causes fluctuations in all f ω i (X 0 (t)).</s></p><p><s>3. For α = 1.5 the likelihood of long avalanches is larger than the likelihood when α = 2.5.</s><s>This implies that the number of avalanches gradually accumulates over time (right, top).</s><s>As for α = 2.5 the presence of long avalanches implies the presence of long-range fluctuations in X (t) and X 0 (t) (right, second and third rows).</s><s>This is because the frequency content of the signal X(t) is given by the sum of frequency content over all active avalanches-this takes the form of a power-law.</s><s>Formally, frequency content sums linearly over a superposition of avalanches, which means that whether the individual avalanches are visible or not is immaterial to whether the power-spectrum is of power-law form.</s><s>However since the number of avalanches active gradually accumulates, the narrowband time-series do not display longrange correlations or correlations across frequencies (right, fourth and fifth rows).</s><s>Informally, the small exponent α causes avalanches to "stack up" cumulatively.</s><s>This process causes the profiles of the individual avalanches to become invisible, meaning that scale-free fluctuations disappear from the f ω i (X 0 (t)), although X 0 (t) still displays scale-free fluctuations.</s></p><p><s>See Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for an illustration of the difference between values of α in the case of the CD theory.</s><s>As α decreases (from bottom to top), individual avalanches become visible in the continuous data, but for values α &lt; 2, avalanches are no longer individually discernible.</s><s>This continuous transition may be explained in terms of moving gradually between the three cases above: the PF theory, the CD theory with α = 2.5 and the CD theory with α = 1.5.</s><s>For large values of α, the qualitative properties X(t) for the CD theory and the PF theory are identical; large avalanches are improbable.</s><s>(lower-part of <ref type="bibr">Fig 3,</ref><ref type="bibr">labelled MU4)</ref>.</s><s>Here the data has a homogeneous character, with individual bursts of activity not clearly visible.</s><s>As α decreases, large avalanches become more probable, and these become discernible in the continuous time-series (middle part of <ref type="bibr">Fig 3,</ref>.</s><s>However, as α continues to decrease, the relative probability of long avalanches become so great that avalanches overlap to an extent that they are not individually discernible (top part of <ref type="bibr">Fig 3)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Our findings provide evidence which support the hypothesis of criticality in the human brain rather than the shaping of a 1/f γ spectrum by passive filtering;

2 then such analysis will yield an estimate that no critical dynamics are present at all although they are present but not identifiable.</s><s>Moreover continuity considerations may imply that for α close to 2 estimation could be inaccurate.</s></p><p><s>Given these difficulties relating to continuous neural data what do existing analyses which use thresholding tell us?</s><s>Several papers have confirmed predictions of the CD hypothesis over short time-scales and for the extremal activity of macroscopic neuronal time-series such as EEG/ MEG <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover exponents correlate with Hurst exponents of e.g.</s><s>alpha range amplitude envelopes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Our findings imply that close to the boundary MU1/2, avalanches are impossible to detect individually; however close to the border between MU2/3 avalanches should nevertheless be detectable at the extremes of neuronal time-series, for sufficiently large β, assuming artifactual activity leading to shifts in voltage is not present.</s><s>However, since avalanches in EEG/MEG are estimated from broad-band data, it is still unclear what effect passive filtering will have on the derived exponent values-this awaits further work, thus leading us to question the size exponent τ = −3/2 reported in several studies.</s><s>In addition, even if this value is accurate, the theory which claims τ = −3/2 is only valid for a critical branching process or mean-field network <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>;
