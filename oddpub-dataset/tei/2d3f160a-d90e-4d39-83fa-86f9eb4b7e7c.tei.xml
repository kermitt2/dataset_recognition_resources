<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The thalamocortical projection is essential for sensory processing.</s><s>In rodents, vibrissae provide input to specific thalamic nuclei and these nuclei have well-defined connections with the so-matosensory cortical region where sensory information is processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970)</ref>.</s><s>These connections have a somatotopic organization, and sensory information from each vibrissa reaches a specific barreloid in the thalamic ventrobasal (VB) complex and is relayed to a specific cortical barrel field in the primary somatosensory cortex.</s><s>During their developmental outgrowth, thalamocortical axons are guided by a variety of cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Molna ´r et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>After crossing the subpallial-pallial border, thalamocortical axons advance within the intermediate zone (IZ) and, approaching the cortex, they accumulate below the cortical plate (CP) at the subplate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Ghosh et al., 1990)</ref>.</s><s>The interaction of thalamocortical axons with the subplate is one of the most enigmatic processes in the development of thalamocortical fibers.</s><s>Even in Reeler or p35 knockout (KO) mice, where the subplate is aberrantly located, thalamocortical axons cross the CP toward the misplaced subplate before connecting to their final targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molna ´r, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, the molecular mechanisms that control thalamocortical axon-subplate interaction and ultimately the correct targeting of thalamic projections are largely unknown.</s></p><p><s>In the developing brain, bioactive phospholipids like lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) play important roles in cortical migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fukushima et al., 2000)</ref> and neuronal apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kingsbury et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>These effects are mediated by LPA receptors, namely LPA 1 -R and LPA 2 -R, which are expressed in the developing brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kingsbury et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>LPA is a well-described repellent factor for axons, eventually leading to growth cone (GC) collapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Campbell and Holt, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>However, while in vitro experiments suggested an involvement of LPA 1 -R in LPA-mediated axonal retraction, deletion of specific LPA receptors did not lead to significant alterations of fiber tracts in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Contos et al., 2002)</ref> and did not affect inhibitory LPA effects on retinal GCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Birgbauer and Chun, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Together, this suggests additional LPA-dependent signaling pathways independent of LPA receptors.</s><s>LPA is enzymatically inactivated by dephosphorylation via lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs), which are cell-surface lipid enzymes and constitute a large family of phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAP2).</s><s>Recently, it was shown that LPA signaling at the synapse is controlled by PRG-1/Lppr4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Trimbuch et al., 2009)</ref>, which belongs to a new class of LPA-interacting molecules (plasticity-related genes, PRGs) sharing transmembrane features of the LPPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bra ¨uer et al., 2003)</ref> but which seem to have a different mode of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McDermott et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Among these, PRG-2/Lppr3 is expressed in developing thalamocortical axons and has a high expression level in GCs.</s><s>Using both PRG-2 À/À animals and a thalamus-specific PRG-2 DE12/DE12 /Gbx2 CreER /R26 tdTomato mouse line, we set out to analyze the role of this new LPA regulatory mechanism in outgrowing axons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>PRG-2 -/-Mice Have an Aberrant Thalamocortical Projection PRG-2/Lppr3 is prominently expressed in the thalamus (as shown by in situ hybridization by http://www.genepaint.org; Figure <ref type="figure">S1B</ref>, available online) and in developing thalamocortical fibers <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1A and S1A;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for antibody specificity see Figures <ref type="figure">S1G-S1I</ref>), where PRG-2 co-localized with the thalamic axonal marker L1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Robichaux et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>According to this expression pattern, we hypothesized that PRG-2 plays a role in the developing thalamocortical projection.</s><s>We therefore performed biocytin tracing studies in thalamocortical brain slices of wild-type (WT) and PRG-2 À/À mice at embryonic day (E)17 <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1D,</ref><ref type="bibr">1E,</ref><ref type="bibr">1H,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 1I)</ref>, a time point when thalamocortical axons accumulate below the subplate <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Molna ´r et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Slices were injected with Alexa 488-labeled biocytin into the VB complex of the thalamus and were incubated for 6 hr to allow for antero-grade biocytin transport.</s><s>This procedure combines the advantages of maintaining slice integrity with precise tracer application in the VB.</s><s>While WT thalamocortical fibers were restricted to the IZ <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1D and 1H)</ref>, as described by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Molna ´r et al., 1998)</ref>, PRG-2 À/À fibers aberrantly protruded into the CP (Figures <ref type="figure">1E and 1I</ref>).</s><s>To further substantiate this finding, we used a conditional PRG-2 fl/fl mouse line <ref type="bibr">(Figures S1E and S1F)</ref>, which was cross-bred with a Gbx2 CreER line, resulting in thalamus-specific CreER expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Normand et al., 2013)</ref>, and an R26 tdTomato line <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Madisen et al., 2010)</ref>, which produces red fluorescent protein (RFP) upon cre-mediated recombination.</s><s>Using thalamus-specific PRG-2-deficient mice (PRG-2 fl/fl / Gbx2 CreER /R26 tdTomato ), we analyzed the effects of thalamusspecific PRG-2 deletion induced by tamoxifen treatment at E12.5 (PRG-2 DE12/DE12 ;
