<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Global burden of disease</head><p><s>In the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), the global prevalence of wheeze was estimated to be 11.6% for 6-7-year-old children and 13.7% for 13-14-year-old children for the period around 2001-2003 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Wheeze is particularly prevalent in English-speaking and Western countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Far less data are available on international prevalence rates of doctor-diagnosed asthma in children.</s><s>The ISAAC study estimated the global prevalence of parent-reported doctor-diagnosed asthma among 6-7-year-old children to be 10.8%, with lower rates in Northern and Eastern Europe (4.5%), and the highest rates in North America (20.0%) and Oceania (29.2%).</s><s>This pattern was repeated in 13-14-year-old children, with figures suggesting a small increase with age of ∼2% in most countries except for Western Europe (9.1% among 6-7-year-olds to 16.3% among 13-14-year-olds) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Wheeze versus doctor-diagnosed asthma</head><p><s>Self-reported wheeze is often used as an indicator of asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>While wheeze and asthma frequently go hand-in-hand, wheeze is not a sufficient, nor a necessary symptom, for the diagnosis of asthma.</s><s>Partly due to the highly variable expression of asthma, there is no uniform set of diagnostic criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>SPYCHER et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> showed that only 2.9% of all children in the general population present with the combination of wheeze, atopy and bronchial hyperresponsiveness described as typical for asthma.</s><s>In another study, 25.8% of young adults with asthma never experienced childhood wheeze and of the children with wheeze, 51.8% did not develop asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>If differences between prevalence rates of wheeze and asthma vary internationally, using wheeze as a proxy for asthma is problematic.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gaps in the evidence</head><p><s>Despite evidence of varying prevalence rates, no international comparisons of wheeze in combination with doctor-diagnosed asthma by child age are available.</s><s>The ISAAC survey only measures self-reported wheeze and asthma in two age groups consisting of different samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Studying these variations between countries could lead to a greater understanding of modifiable factors involved, e.g.</s><s>relating to the environment or the diagnostic process.</s><s>The MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy) partnership provides individual-level, longitudinal data with harmonised measures of wheeze and doctor-diagnosed asthma across cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>We aimed to examine variations in the prevalence of childhood asthma, wheeze and wheeze with asthma by child age in Europe.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>We analysed cross-sectional differences in childhood asthma and wheeze by child age and wheeze with asthma at age 4 years in datasets from European cohorts with harmonised variables on asthma and wheeze.</s><s>Data were requested from 13 MeDALL cohort studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides an overview of the 10 included cohorts, representing eight countries and a total sample of 26 663 children.</s><s>More information about the cohorts can be found in the ENRIECO database (www.enrieco.dk).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p><s>The MeDALL partnership has developed harmonised variables, including harmonised definitions of asthma and wheeze <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>"Ever asthma" is defined by the question "Has your child ever been diagnosed by a doctor as having asthma?" and "ever wheeze" is captured by the question "Has your child ever had wheezing or whistling in the chest?"</s><s>For BAMSE, LISAplus and GINIplus cohorts, only wheeze and doctor diagnosis of asthma in the past 12 months were available in the follow-ups analysed, and composite measures based on annual reports of wheeze and/or asthma were created where possible (supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>A third outcome measure was constructed to capture the proportion of children whose parents reported wheeze at least once from birth until age 4 years and who were reported to be diagnosed with asthma by age 4 years.</s><s>Severity of wheeze was considered a potential explanatory variable in the relationship between cohort and percentage of children with wheeze diagnosed with asthma.</s><s>However, as it was only available in five cohorts, it was used in additional analyses only.</s><s>The measure was constructed from the question "How many attacks of wheezing has your child had in the last 12 months?"</s><s>and coded low (0 times), medium or high severity (coding varied by cohort).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Prevalence rates of wheeze and asthma were calculated up to age 8 years, because four cohorts had no data from later time points (ROBBIC, RHEA, BiB and PARIS) and for many other cohorts a high loss to follow-up affected the reliability of the data (supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Data</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence rates of asthma and wheeze by child age</head><p><s>In all cohorts with longitudinal data, figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> suggests a trend for prevalence rates of asthma to increase with child age.</s><s>Differences between prevalence rates at the first and last time point are statistically significant for each cohort (supplementary table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>However, there were large differences between cohorts across the entire age range.</s><s>Reported ever wheeze did not consistently increase with child age (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Explaining variations between European cohorts</head><p><s>To put our findings in perspective, we compared our results with estimates from international surveys (supplementary appendix S1 and supplementary figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>Although no data on doctor-diagnosed childhood asthma were available, findings from two surveys among adults suggest findings in line with ours, with the highest prevalence rates of asthma in the UK, Sweden, France and the Netherlands, and consistently lower prevalence rates in Germany, Spain, Greece and Italy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Our estimates of wheeze in Spain and Italy are higher than previously found, but these cohorts are not representative of the general population (supplementary table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Variations may be attributable to international differences in the diagnosis of childhood asthma or guideline adherence.</s><s>The PRACTALL (Practical Allergy) consensus recommendations provide guidance for diagnosis and treatment of childhood asthma in Europe and North America, and state that suspected asthma can only be diagnosed through follow-up and a trial of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Current Dutch guidelines are even more cautious and discourage the diagnosis of asthma for children under the age of 6 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s><s>UK guidelines recommend a trial of treatment or watchful waiting for those under the age of 6 years, but state that more frequent and/or severe symptoms add certainty to the asthma diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Swedish guidelines prioritise lung function and allergy tests even for those under the age of 4 years; in France, radiographs are recommended as standard practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, there are indications of underdiagnosis of childhood asthma, e.g. in Italy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, and evidence of overdiagnosis in the Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>One study found that asthmatic complaints which often led to an asthma diagnosis for children in the Netherlands were frequently diagnosed and treated as bronchitis in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>These differences in healthcare may contribute to some of the variation in prevalence rates of asthma and wheeze with diagnosed asthma found in our study.</s></p><p><s>Alternatively, limited access to healthcare and differences in the translation and interpretation of "wheeze" might play a role in various countries.</s><s>The strength of the relationship between wheeze and asthma may also vary between countries.</s><s>A recent study comparing childhood mortality rates found that the mortality rate for paediatric respiratory disorders in England was 6.6 times that of Sweden, despite the prevalence of childhood asthma being high in both countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for research</head><p><s>Future research should aim to explain variations in childhood wheeze and diagnosed asthma in longitudinal analyses, e.g. in age-period-cohort analyses.</s><s>This could determine whether rates of asthma in some countries are rising over time, rather than with age alone.</s><s>We also suggest that, in addition to environmental factors such as air pollution and climate, international variations in diagnoses, access to healthcare and quality of care deserve consideration.</s></p><p><s>A second implication for research concerns the findings that, while the prevalence of childhood asthma increased with child age, wheeze did not.</s><s>Wheeze is not a reliable indicator of asthma at an early age when many young children are yet to be diagnosed.</s><s>The levelling in the prevalence of ever wheeze with increasing child age suggests that these estimates are affected by recall bias.</s><s>Parents may not remember transient wheeze suffered by their children at an early age if it does not progress to asthma.</s><s>A previous version of the UK guidelines warned that "Parents often use 'wheezing' as a non-specific label …" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Using parent-reported wheeze as an indicator of asthma for young children therefore leads to overestimates of the prevalence of childhood asthma.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for practice</head><p><s>Consensus recommendations have not yet led to an internationally uniform diagnosis of childhood asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Our results suggest that the likelihood of children with asthma being diagnosed, and subsequently the quality of care, may vary internationally.</s><s>We have shown that in many countries children are diagnosed with asthma at age 4 years or earlier, while it is doubtful whether a diagnosis of childhood asthma can be made with certainty at such a young age.</s><s>It will take the joint effort of healthcare professionals and researchers to ensure the diagnosis of childhood asthma is uniform and accurate.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>As shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, cohorts used different inclusion and exclusion criteria, and participants were recruited from centres not representative of the general population.</s><s>Limited generalisability is particularly problematic for cohorts using exclusion criteria related to the risk of asthma, such as mothers who do not speak the language of the country and infants with complications at birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>This, in addition to variations in time periods of data collection and the limited availability of harmonised covariates at different follow-ups, means that comparisons of prevalence rates between cohorts and within cohorts over time should be made with caution.</s><s>For example, composed outcome variables created for some cohorts were based on data from multiple time points, leading to overestimation.</s><s>Despite the availability of data at multiple time points, our analysis was cross-sectional and measured asthma and wheeze "ever" rather than "in the last 12 months" due to data limitations.</s><s>However, we believe our conclusions are strengthened by taking into account key covariates, by the fact that differences between cohorts persist at different child ages and that these generally correspond with results from other surveys.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>There are differences in prevalence rates of childhood asthma and wheeze across Europe, which vary by child age.</s><s>The proportion of children with wheeze who were diagnosed with asthma was higher among cohorts in England, Sweden and France than in the Netherlands and Spain, even when the higher proportion of severe wheeze in England and France was adjusted for.</s><s>This may partly indicate that asthma is more readily diagnosed in some countries, while going unrecognised in others.</s><s>Given the burden on patients and healthcare associated with overdiagnosis as well as underdiagnosis, the discussion on diagnostic criteria for asthma should be an international one.</s></p></div><figure
