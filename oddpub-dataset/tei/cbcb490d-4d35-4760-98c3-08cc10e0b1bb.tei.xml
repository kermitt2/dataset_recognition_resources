<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The overall engraftment rate for the primary cervical cancer PDX model was 71.4 Â±12.5% (n = 14).</s><s>Tumours maintained morphological, histoarchitecture and immunohistochemical features of the parent tumour, and demonstrated invasiveness into local tissues.</s><s>Single cell suspensions did not produce tumour growth in this model.</s><s>Mean length of time (32.4 +/-3.5 weeks) for the transplanted tissue to generate a tumour in the animal was similar between successive transplantations.</s><s>Three of four xenografted cervical dysplasia tissues generated microscopic cystic structures resembling dysplastic cervical tissue.</s><s>Normal cervical tissue (4 of 5 xenografted) also developed microscopic cervical tissue grafts.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>The subrenal capsule can be used for a PDX model of human cervical cancer with a good engraftment rate and the ability to model in vivo characteristics of cervical cancer.</s><s>For the first time we have demonstrated that cervical dysplasia and normal cervical tissue generated microscopic tissues in a PDX model.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Cervical cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality for women worldwide.</s><s>It is the fourth most common cancer for women globally, with approximately 84% of cases occurring in the developing world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Cervical screening programs have significantly reduced the incidence in developed countries.</s><s>Early detection and prevention of cervical cancer is based on the existence of a clear premalignant state, cervical dysplasia, and that the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is essential to cervical cancer development <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Despite this, specific events that convert dysplasia into invasive cancer are unknown.</s><s>Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for women with advanced disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, and attempts to find new treatments have been unsuccessful <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>There is a need for models to further study cervical dysplasia and cancer, and test new therapies.</s></p><p><s>Due to the established importance of HPV in the development of nearly all cervical cancer in humans, transgenic mouse models have been developed to study oncogenic contributions of various HPV genes in vivo.</s><s>These have elegantly shown that of the two HPV oncoproteins, E7 is more oncogenic than E6 for cervical malignancy.</s><s>However, these models have limitations.</s><s>For example, in these transgenic models the induced cervical cancers are estrogen dependant, whereas the contribution of estrogen to human cervical cancer does not appear essential.</s><s>Further, it does not model human metastatic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, there are differences between the cellular mechanisms within cells that differ between mice and humans, for example telomerase activity in adult somatic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The differences between human and mouse metabolism affect both tumour behaviour, and drug actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, models involving human tissues by xenograft are more applicable to human disease.</s></p><p><s>The difference between murine and human cancers has been observed in other tumour types <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and hence xenograft models using tissue taken from human cancers have been developed.</s><s>Immortalised cell lines frequently used in xenograft models have higher engraftment rates compared to primary cell lines but do not represent the full diversity of cell types within a tumour <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, the cell culture process irreversibly alters primary tumour cells from their natural phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models better represent the range of human tumour phenotypes, maintain gene expression patterns of the parent tumour <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and offer the potential for the future development of mouse "avatars" for human disease and personalised therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>For example, correlation between tumourigenicity of ovarian cancer xenografts and clinical progression shows their relevance to patient care <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>PDX models also allow the observation of progressive genetic alterations in cancer samples over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>PDX models have been established for cancers of the colon, stomach, breast, and ovary <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Interest in PDX models is increasing, with efforts to standardize model development underway <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The Mouse Tumour Biology database at the time of writing does not contain any entries for PDX models of carcinoma of the cervix uteri <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>However, cervical cancer PDX models have been reported using the subcutaneous and orthotopic (cervical) models.</s><s>Engraftment rates were 70% at the subcutaneous site, and 48-75% at the orthotopic <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Higher engraftment rates (up to 95%) have been reported for other tumour types in the sub-renal capsule compared with subcutaneous locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Successful engraftment is essential for a PDX model to become a reliable clinical tool.</s><s>There are no models for dysplastic or normal cervical tissue.</s><s>Here we describe a new PDX model for grafting both cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer using the sub-renal capsule location.</s><s>Additional aims were to determine whether single cell suspensions from cervical cancer produced tumour growth.</s></p><p><s>Melbourne Pathology provided support in the form of salary for author J.A.T., but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</s><s>The specific roles of the authors are articulated in the 'author contributions'

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing a PDX model for cervical dysplasia</head><p><s>Seven dysplasia samples were transplanted as described above.</s><s>At necropsy, no obvious macroscopic tumour growth was observed.</s><s>However, microscopic examination of the kidney demonstrated epithelial-lined cystic structures in 3 of 7 patient samples (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>The lining epithelium immunostained with human nuclei antibody, indicating the cells were of human origin (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>The epithelium in 2 of 3 cysts were positive for p16 INK4a , with patchy HPV staining <ref type="bibr">(Fig 4A)</ref>.</s><s>This data suggests that these two cysts represent persistent survival and growth of cervical dysplasia tissue xenografted beneath the renal capsule.</s><s>We also examined whether normal cervical tissue survived transplantation under the kidney capsule.</s><s>Four of five samples survived for four months under the kidney capsule, resulting in microscopic growths similar to the cervical dysplasia samples (Fig 4B <ref type="figure">)</ref>, however the tissue that persisted appeared to be stroma rather than the epithelium from which cervical squamous carcinoma arises.</s><s>These xenografts immunostained for anti-human nuclear antibody and , consistent with its stromal appearance and stromal tissue is not typically infected by HPV.</s><s>However, in a single sample typical squamous epithelial cells were observed, and these were HVP positive (Fig 4B <ref type="figure">ii</ref>).</s><s>This sample may be a previously undetected case of dysplasia, however no dysplastic histological features were seen.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The main finding of this study was our demonstration for the first time that fresh cervical cancer, cervical dysplasia, and normal cervical tissues can grow beneath the renal capsule of highly immunocompromised mice.</s><s>Tumours from cervical cancer xenografts recapitulated parent tumour architecture and immunohistochemical profiles for p16 and HPV for at least 3 passages in vivo.</s><s>Generated tumours were invasive but metastases were rare in our model.</s><s>We demonstrated for the first time that cervical dysplasia tissues generate microscopic cystic growth under the murine renal capsule showing features expected of dysplasia for key markers of cervical cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, we demonstrated for the first time that the NSG renal capsule permitted the survival and microscopic growth of normal human cervical tissue in vivo.</s></p><p><s>Human cervical cancer tissue grew slowly, requiring 6 months to generate adequate tumours for serial transplantation and characterisation.</s><s>The renal capsule site provides a unique approach for the biological study of cervical dysplasia conversion into cervical cancer, albeit a lengthy process.</s><s>Key tumour characteristics preserved in this model were histological morphology, and cervical cancer markers p16 INK4a and HPV.</s><s>The sub-renal capsule is highly conducive to transplantation of xenograft samples and opens possibilities for studying the natural history of cervical neoplasia or for assessing new treatments.</s><s>The microscopic size of the dysplasia and normal tissue grafts may hinder the clinical applicability of these aspects of this model.</s><s>The finding that two of four dysplastic samples resulted in microscopic growth of human tissue with immunohistochemical features consistent with cervical dysplasia is significant.</s><s>To our knowledge this is the first time that dysplastic tissue has been intentionally cultivated in a xenograft model.</s><s>Growth of premalignant cells has rarely been described, and reported only once as a serendipitous finding in a prostate cancer PDX model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>These cells have subtler variations from normal and are much less tumorigenic.</s><s>Importantly our PDX model offers the opportunity to examine the development of cervical cancer from its premalignant state.</s><s>There is potential for dysplastic tissue growing in a PDX model to be harvested for use in future studies, although the small size of the xenograft will make this technically challenging.</s><s>Lesions that eventually progress to carcinoma after multiple passages in vivo could be examined to determine changes at a molecular level that allowed the dysplastic cells to become invasive.</s><s>In addition, the successful growth of microscopic normal cervical tissue in a PDX model is described here for the first time.</s></p><p><s>PDX models likely select more tumorigenic cell subpopulations within tumours with capacity to thrive in the murine milieu and respond to murine growth factors, particularly in animals without a competent host immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Our sub-renal capsule PDX model shows this occurred for the majority of samples.</s><s>A key difference between this model and other cervical cancer PDX models is the mouse breed.</s><s>Nude or Scid mouse models have been used previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>However, we used NSG mice, which are more profoundly immunosuppressed, lacking natural killer (NK) cell immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>NK cells mediate their function through Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) recognition, and destroy non-self cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Without this surveillance, neoplastic, dysplastic, and normal xenografted tissue growth was enabled, a major advantage with our model, although only cancer biopsy samples produced large cell masses.</s><s>The inability to recognise MHC molecules likely greatly improves the engraftment of human cells, however, the study of tumour cell interactions with host innate immunity is a limitation of this model.</s></p><p><s>A lower engraftment rate was obtained for sub-renal capsule xenografts compared with prostate and endometrial cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> for reasons that remain unclear.</s><s>A few samples had a longer time to engraftment, which would potentially lower engraftment success.</s><s>These were earlier samples when skill acquisition necessitated a longer procedural duration.</s><s>However, these earlier PDX did not have a lower engraftment rate.</s><s>Although published PDX models of non-cervical cancers have allowed even longer windows for transplantation of up to 24 hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, future applications of this model should aim for engraftment of freshly obtained samples within the first few hours to ensure maximum tissue viability.</s><s>The engraftment rate of this model was comparable to a subcuticular PDX model for cervical cancer of 70% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and the recently described orthotopic PDX model at 75% <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> suggesting engraftment rates are tissue and tumour specific.</s><s>At the commencement of this study the highest rate achieved by an orthotopic PDX model of cervical cancer was only 48% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Another group has since published a PDX model using the sub-renal capsule as transplantation site and achieved an engraftment rate of 66.7%, which is comparable to our own rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>PDX models require the combination of high engraftment rates, technical ease, and maintenance of in vivo tumour characteristics.</s><s>Subcutaneous models provide easy access to the xenograft site for monitoring tumour growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, but do not accurately model in vivo tumour behaviour as they become encapsulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Further, direct comparison between the subcutaneous and orthotopic sites for the same patient sample showed that orthotopic transplantation, but not subcutaneous, mimics the metastatic pattern observed in the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>A high engraftment rate is essential for clinical application.</s><s>Our study suggests that engraftment success can be maximised by engrafting at least 2 animals for each sample.</s><s>Our finding that subsequent passages of PDX grafts sometimes yielded varied tumour grades suggests that multiple replicate transplantations of each sample should improve preservation of cell population diversity of a patient's tumour.</s><s>Hence, to ensure the best use of this resource in a potential future 'patient avatar' situation at least two animals should be transplanted for each patient sample.</s></p><p><s>No growth was achieved from the transplanted cervical cancer cell suspensions, despite a previous application of cell suspensions to orthotopic xenografting, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The inability of cervical cancer cell suspensions to produce tumours compared to other reproductive tract tumours such as endometrial carcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> may be due to the extensive collagen laid down by SCC of the cervix.</s><s>Harsher digestion is required which damages cells by stripping adhesion molecules on the tumour cells.</s><s>Cell suspensions from stomach cancer xenografted to the orthotopic location yielded lower metastatic rates than tissue pieces surgically grafted to that location <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>This may also be due to better preservation of multiple cell populations required for tumour growth and that non-tumour human cells provide growth factors and signalling mechanisms that improve cancer cell survival and proliferation.</s><s>Alternatively, transplantation of tumour pieces may better preserve cell cues by maintaining the tumour microenvironment and microarchitecture.</s></p><p><s>A limitation of the sub-renal capsule model is difficulty monitoring tumour growth.</s><s>As the tumour grows beneath the kidney surface, tracking of tumour size at early stages is difficult compared with the subcutaneous site.</s><s>Tumour growth is often not apparent until the tumour is of considerable size.</s><s>We used palpation of the flank, in combination with a pilot phase to assess lesion size at necropsy, to assess for tumour growth.</s><s>The pilot phase also suffers from the limitation of being conducted through the skill acquisition phase, which may have reduced the success of some engraftments.</s><s>The difficulty in creating a single-cell suspension inhibited our ability to transfect the cells with luciferase for bioluminescence imaging.</s><s>The model could be strengthened, however, with the addition of other modalities of non-invasive imaging such as ultrasound or MRI.</s><s>Future applications of this model should make use of these technologies to monitor the variability of individual tumour growth rates that are a feature of PDX models.</s></p><p><s>However, sub-renal capsule transplantation overcomes problems of xenograft encapsulation and low rates of metastasis compared to the subcutaneous site.</s><s>The long latency time of this model is not unexpected or unique to this particular PDX model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>It does, however present difficulties to the clinical application of PDX models as "patient avatars" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In this concept, the PDX animal bearing the graft of an individual patient could undergo sample treatments to determine the optimal regimen for the donor patient.</s><s>Cancer treatments cannot wait six months, suggesting that the best application of this model may be for recurrent or resistant disease once standard therapies fail.</s></p></div>
