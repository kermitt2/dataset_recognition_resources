<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extension phase</head><p><s>Primary endpoints and safety-related endpoints were obtained before and after the extension phase in which patients were dialyzed for additional 8 weeks with the assigned dialyzer.</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, serum albumin was stable after 8 weeks with High-flux (37.6 to 37.9 g/l), and increased non-significantly after 8 weeks with MCO-Ci (35.7 to 36.4 g/l).</s><s>TNF-α mRNA and IL-6-mRNA remained stable over the course of this 12-week phase Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Treatment with the MCO-Ci dialyzer was generally well tolerated.</s><s>16 serious adverse events (SAE) occurred throughout the trial (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). 4 SAE arose while the patients were treated with High-flux dialyzers and 6 while treated with the MCO-Ci dialyzer.</s><s>4 SAE were classified as severe, of these 3 during High-flux period and 1 during the washout period after cross-over periods.</s><s>No SAE was classified as related to the study product.</s><s>In 11 of the 16 SAEs, patients fully recovered, one death occurred during the High-flux period (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present clinical trial examined the middle-term effects of the newly developed MCO-Ci membranes.</s><s>Our results show that both TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA are lowered to a greater extent with MCO-Ci compared to High-flux.</s><s>This underlines the capacity to reduce the inflammatory level in chronic dialysis patients with MCO-Ci dialysis.</s><s>We chose TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA in blood leukocytes as the primary endpoint for a variety of reasons.</s><s>First, in a previous trial using HCO dialyzers we found that gene expression in peripheral blood is a reliable marker to study inflammation in hemodialysis patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Second, interpretation of the measured concentrations of serum parameters depends on several  factors.</s><s>Binding to other proteins such as soluble receptors, formation of multimers, distribution and re-shift from tissue and other factors influence serum concentrations of interleukins and makes their measurement and interpretation difficult.</s><s>MRNAs of inflammatory parameters such as IL-6 and TNF-α on the other hand are intracellular markers and are thus not eliminated during dialysis.</s><s>Intracellular inflammatory parameters are hence better suited than plasma levels as markers of microinflammation.</s></p><p><s>Besides the significant reduction of the mRNAs the serum concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6 were also reduced significantly with MCO but the reduction was not significant when compared to High-Flux.</s><s>IL-6 and TNF-α are important inflammatory proteins in the process of inflammation and correlate with cardiovascular events in the dialysis population.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Other interleukins that were significantly reduced with MCO-Ci included sTNFR1.</s><s>In accordance with the results of the PERCI-I-trial, levels of sTNFR1 were lowered significantly better with MCO-Ci dialysis compared to High-Flux.</s><s>sTNFR1 is known as a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in chronic dialysis patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>It seems possible, that the drop of this 18 kD -molecule was partially caused by improved elimination.</s><s>However, since we did not measure sTNFR1 concentrations in dialysate samples other factors such as reduced sTNFR1 production as a result of generally lowered microinflammation may also have played a role.</s></p><p><s>On a regulatory point of view the TNF-/TNFR superfamily seems to play an important role in this setting.</s><s>It fits in the line that sTNFR1 which is believed to have a dual role-(firstly sTNFR acts as a neutralizing and buffering component for circulating TNF-α secondly the soluble receptor may induce apoptosis via reverse TNF-α-signaling)-is significantly decreased by MCO-Ci-treatment.</s></p><p><s>After four weeks of MCO-Ci dialysis Interleukin-10 and Lp-PLA2 increased significantly.</s><s>While IL-10 is known as antiinflammatory, the role of Lp-PLA2 in the process of atherosclerosis is poorly understood and controversely discussed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several other molecules were significantly changed after MCO-Ci dialysis, but lacked significance when compared to high-flux dialysis (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, the MCO-Ci dialyzer appears to influence the inflammatory signature of immune regulatory lymphocytes and monocytes, as most of the main inflammatory cytokines of both leukocyte subsets are downregulated (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Besides modulation of inflammation we examined the course of albumin concentrations with MCO-Ci dialysis.</s><s>Our results demonstrate that in spite of the steeper cut-off compared to High Cut-off membranes loss of albumin remains an important issue in patients treated with MCO dialysis.</s><s>In accordance with the first clinical trial in which MCO dialyzers came to use we noted that with the use of MCO-Ci filters the drop in in mean albumin concentration was less than 2 g/L and thus albumin loss seems to be limited compared to HCO. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> We did not conduct systematic measurements of albumin concentrations in the dialysate.</s><s>But considering the higher cut-off of the membrane it seems highly likely that lower albumin concentrations after MCO dialysis is brought about by increased albumin filtration and/or membrane adherence.</s></p><p><s>Extending the use of MCO for another 8 weeks did not result in further reductions in serum albumin but even increased again.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, the number of clinically overt side effects was similar in both treatment arms and no AE related to hypalbuminemia was reported.</s><s>During both the two 4-weeks period and the 8-weeks extension period SAEs were equally distributed in both treatment arms without statistical significant differences.</s></p><p><s>Still, the extent of albumin loss has to be considered as low albumin levels are associated with negative long-term adverse outcomes due to malnutrition.</s><s>This is an important aspect that has to be evaluated in future trials.</s></p><p><s>Thus, trials with longer lasting treatment periods and clinical endpoints are desirable to analyze this matter further.</s></p><p><s>The present study has a number of advantages over previous trials on this matter.</s><s>It investigated the middle-term effects of dialyzers on cytokine levels and inflammatory parameters.</s><s>Most previous studies on HCO and MCO only examined short term effects on plasma levels or dialyzer clearances.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> Limitations By design, our trial focuses on surrogate parameters.</s><s>Therefore, no statements can be made regarding clinical endpoints.</s><s>Furthermore, we only used both dialyzers in a diffusive mode and cannot state whether MCO-Ci dialysis is superior to HDF regarding the elimination of middle-sized molecules.</s></p><p><s>Also, the study was an open-label study only blinded to staff performing the lab analysis and the data review, but not to patients and dialysis nurses and doctors.</s><s>Even though this trial was monitored carefully, this may possibly have interfered with the interpretation of filter tolerance and (S)AEs.</s><s>Moreover, we saw a difference regarding the results during both treatment periods and in the extension period.</s><s>While there was a great difference in the primary endpoint with respect to the dialyzer in the first phase, no significant difference was noted in the second phase and the extension period.</s><s>Even though no significant carryover effect was noted in the statistical analysis, it can be suspected that the MCO treatment caused longer lasting effects than expected.</s><s>In the group that started with MCO, possibly the preceding treatment with MCO may have interfered with the results from the second phase using HF.</s><s>In future trials a mere parallel group design thus appears preferable.</s></p><p><s>Finally, cytokine or albumin removal was not analyzed by collecting complete spent dialysate.</s><s>We decided against this option because most cytokines in blood are at a very low concentration range of pg/mL that will even be lower in diluted dialysate.</s><s>Cytokine concentrations in dialysate samples would therefore be below the detection limit of most assays.</s><s>Furthermore, possibly a significant portion may be lost via membrane adherence and thus would also be missed with analysis of the dialysate.</s></p><p><s>It therefore, remains somewhat unclear whether the effects on serum concentrations of the investigated parameters are due to reduced production or enhanced elimination.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we demonstrated a trial with MCO-Ci membranes with treatment periods of up to twelve weeks.</s><s>The use of MCO-Ci reduced the primary endpoint TNF-α and IL-6 mRNA expression in peripheral blood to a significantly greater extent compared to Highflux dialyzers.</s><s>4 weeks use of MCO-Ci resulted in a persistent change in plasma levels of several cytokines and other substances with a significant difference to High-flux for sTNFR1, kappa and lambda free light chains, albumin, urea and Lp-PLA2.</s><s>While the present trial focuses on dampening chronic inflammation in dialysis patients, the results also suggest MCO-Ci dialysis as a treatment option for other disease entities demanding removal of solutes in this molecular size range such as free light chains, myoglobin, and cytokines in sepsis.</s><s>Thus, possible indications that have to be assessed in future trials may include sepsis, multiple myeloma and rhabdomyolysis.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>This trial was a randomized, open-label, cross-over
