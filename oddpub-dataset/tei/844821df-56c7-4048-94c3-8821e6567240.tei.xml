(<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p><s>The fluorescence lifetime is also sometimes defined as the time where the fluorescence intensity of an excited fluorophore population has decreased to 1/e of its initial value, which is mathematically equivalent to the average time excited.</s><s>The fluorescence lifetime is an excellent tool for investigating the dynamics of excited states and molecular interactions.</s><s>For instance, a change in the lifetime for two separate fluorophore states will indicate a change in one or more of the quenching parameters described by the non-radiative decay rate constant k nr .</s><s>Fluorophores with a reliable and well established fluorescence lifetime -a fluorescence lifetime standard -are useful for anyone performing measurements within this field, whether it is for calibration purposes, testing for systematic errors, or simply to verify and compare own lifetime measurements to the standard.</s><s>It is also important to have information about the types of fluorophores that are suitable for a given instrumentation setup.</s><s>Especially useful is absorption and emission spectra, as well as the lifetime itself, but also it can be important to have information about which solvents and concentrations that give the most stable and reliable results.</s><s>In this paper, we have selected three fluorophores and tested their suitability to serve as fluorescence lifetime standards.</s><s>In our experiments, fluorescence lifetime data were obtained using time-correlated-single-photoncounting (TCSPC).</s><s>We used a laser producing pulses in the femtosecond regime, tuneable in the wavelength range 690-1040 nm, for two-photon excitation, and a detector with a range of 400-800 nm.</s><s>Naturally, the fluorophores were selected to have their absorption within the range of these wavelengths, meaning that for two-photon excitation the absorption should be roughly in the range of 345-520 nm.</s><s>Other selection criteria were that the fluorophores should exhibit a single-exponential decay, be readily commercially available and also have a fluorescence lifetime between 0.1-10 ns.</s><s>The upper boundary for the lifetime is both to avoid a shortening from oxygen quenching, but also to avoid a pile-up effect since the repetition rate of the laser was 80 MHz, or 12.5 ns between each pulse.</s><s>In addition to these criteria, the selection of fluorescein, quinine sulfate and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were also based on a quantitative literature search comprising the past five years.</s><s>The present three fluorophores were amongst those with the highest number of hits in publications dealing with fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime research.</s></p><p><s>The goal of this paper is mainly to provide useful information about the present selection of fluorophores in terms of their suitability as fluorescence lifetime standards, and also gaining additional information about their properties with respect to existing literature, especially concerning two-photon excitation and lifetimes acquired in the time-domain.</s><s>This instrumentation has become increasingly popular the last 10-15 years, especially in regards to working with living or fragile samples.</s><s>The present study is also building on previous work with the same setup <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The first records of fluorescence lifetime measurements were made in the 1960s and 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, however lifetime measurements from this time period were usually performed using pulse sampling oscilloscope techniques, which are not considered accurate by today's standards.</s><s>Since the late 1970s, with the introduction of high repetition rate lasers, several contributions have been made in determining lifetime standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>However, many of the proposed standards have too long lifetimes to benefit today's pico-and femtosecond instrumentation, and several were later found unsuitable due to doubleexponential decays.</s><s>Also, no systematic approach was done to evaluate the reliability of these lifetimes until 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, when comparisons of 13 different fluorophores were systematically examined by 9 separate laboratories in a very thorough and comprehensive work, although fluorescence was not induced by two-photon excitation in any of these measurements.</s></p><p><s>Fluorescein is available in a number of derivatives, and is widely used particularly because of a strong fluorescence signal, suitable absorption and emission wavelengths, as well as a number of other photophysical properties.</s></p><p><s>In 2014, a broad and extensive work on 20 fluorescein derivatives, which measured fluorescence lifetimes, quantum yields and emission maxima in ethanol and phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) was published <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>There have also been several papers published in recent years, reporting on the basic fluorescent properties of various fluorescein dyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Quinine sulfate has been used as a fluorescence standard for more than 50 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and the photophysical properties of various quinine sulfate derivatives have also been extensively studied in the past <ref type="bibr"

fluorescence lifetime measurements are scarce after 1990.</s></p><p><s>In the 1990s, GFP from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria became one of the most widely studied and exploited proteins in biochemistry and cell biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, especially due to its unprecedented ability to serve as a marker of gene expression and protein targeting in intact cells and organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>Fluorescence lifetime measurements have also been carried out <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, however, both instrumentation and other measurement parameters differ quite significantly, and thereby also the reported fluorescence lifetimes.</s></p><p><s>A common denominator for all three fluorophores is that they are extensively used in a vast array of scientific areas, and that recent fluorescence lifetime measurements, especially using two-photon excitation and time-domain instrumentation is inadequately available in literature.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absorption and Emission</head><p><s>The main reason to measure absorption and emission spectra for the fluorophores was to be able to make well-founded decisions in choosing excitation wavelengths as well as setting detector intervals for fluorescence.</s><s>All fluorophores were diluted to 10 −5 M concentrations for both absorption and emission measurements, to avoid possible aggregating of molecules as well as still having a sufficient fluorescence signal strength.</s><s>It should be noted that the emission spectra were not corrected in regards to detector sensitivity variation at different wavelengths, which may cause a slight shift in emission peaks.</s><s>However, this was not crucial to our measurements since the detector range was relatively broad for all samples.</s><s>Figures <ref type="figure">3, 4 and 5</ref> show the absorption and emission spectra of fluorescein dissolved in ethanol, methanol and sulfuric acid, respectively.</s><s>The spectra for ethanol and methanol are very similar for both absorption and emission, while dissolved in sulfuric acid, the spectra are shifted towards the blue end of the visible spectrum by 20-30 nm.</s><s>Also, there are two absorption peaks for ethanol and methanol, compared to one for the sulfuric acid solution.</s><s>Multiple absorption (or emission) peaks are in general attributed to vibronic transitions, which describes simultaneous changes in electronic and vibrational energy levels of a molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since there is a large range of different fluorescein derivates in use <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, the absorption and emission spectra also vary substantially.</s><s>Our measurements are, however, in good accordance with recently published results of free acid type fluorescein <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, with two characteristic absorption peaks around 450 and 480 nm, and an emission peak around 520 nm for both ethanol and methanol solutions.</s><s>The present work is to our knowledge the first published on fluorescein absorption and fluorescence properties in a sulfuric acid solution.</s><s>We also note that fluorescein did not completely dissolve in distilled water, and therefore we do not include any measurement results using this solvent.</s></p><p><s>Quinine sulfate does not completely dissolve in water, ethanol or methanol, and is according to literature almost exclusively dissolved in sulfuric acid.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows the absorption and emission spectra for quinine sulfate dissolved in sulfuric acid.</s><s>Absorption peaks at around 320 nm and 350 nm are in excellent agreement with both recent and earlier results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>We do, however, report a slightly red-shifted fluorescence emission maximum, at 481 nm, compared to typically around 450 nm found in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>The emission peak in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> is broader compared to those reported in

wild type <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, who reported 395 nm and 509 nm, and 395-397 nm and 504 nm, respectively, although they also reported a minor absorption peak at 540 nm and an emission shoulder at 540 nm, which were not pronounced in our results.</s></p><p><s>Fluorescence Lifetimes Fluorescein fluorescence lifetimes were measured in concentrations of 10 −3 M, 10 −4 M and 10 −5 M in solutions of ethanol, methanol and sulfuric acid.</s><s>Quinine sulfate lifetimes were measured within the same concentration range, but only dissolved in sulfuric acid as it did not dissolve satisfactory in ethanol and methanol.</s><s>We also attempted to dissolve both fluorescein and quinine sulfate in distilled water, however, none dissolved properly and since the following lifetime measurements were highly variable, the results are not included here.</s><s>(GFP) fluorescence lifetimes were measured only for the original  Our fluorescein fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed using an excitation wavelength of 900 nm and a detector interval of 440-770 nm.</s><s>The lifetimes were measured for three concentrations (10 −3 , 10 −4 and 10 −5 M) dissolved in ethanol, methanol and sulfuric acid.</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, the lifetimes are remarkably similar for all solvents and concentrations, with very low uncertainties.</s><s>It has been previously reported no change in lifetimes within a concentration range of 10 −5 -10 −7 M in EtOH and PBS buffer <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, and our results show that there is no dependency between lifetimes and concentrations as high as 10 −3 M in ethanol, methanol and sulfuric acid.</s><s>As fluorescein exists in many forms, earlier results also vary, however, most earlier measurements indicate lifetimes near 4 ns, such as for fluorescein dianion form dissolved in water, EtOH and MeOH <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr"

also increases by a similar value.</s><s>All three conditions showed single-exponential decays, which is remarkable because several earlier works dating 25-35 years back deemed quinine sulfate unsuitable as lifetime standards because of exhibiting double exponential decays <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>This may well be the reason that fluorescence lifetime measurements of quinine are basically absent from literature since the early 1990s.</s><s>The (GFP) fluorescence lifetime was only measured for the original solution of 1

with earlier results, with 2.8 ns for a deprotonated species <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and also very good with 2.7 ns reported for a GFP-Rac2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and 2.9 ns for a recombinant GFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>The latter, however, also reported double exponential decay, with the 2.9 ns component contributing 90% of the total fluorescence.</s><s>All our measurements of GFP fluorescence lifetimes produced single-exponential decays.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>To determine whether a fluorophore is suitable to use as a fluorescence lifetime standard, the two most important criteria is that it exhibits a single exponential decay and that it does not vary within at least two orders of magnitude in concentration.</s><s>It is also important that the fluorophore has a strong fluorescence signal, and that it is completely soluble in a solvent.</s><s>As a prerequisite, it should have absorption and emission peaks in the visible spectrum, as most lasers and detectors operate within this region, although this is of course dependent on what kind of fluorescence lifetime system one is using.</s><s>All three tested fluorophores meet these criteria, since they were selected on this premise, although we were still able to rank them based on how well we think they are suitable as fluorescence lifetime standards.</s><s>We found fluorescein to be the most suitable of the three fluorophores considered in this work, since the fluorescence lifetimes were stable with low uncertainties for all the tested solvents and concentrations.</s><s>Fluorescein is also extensively used in a wide range of research fields, and is relatively affordable in large quantities.</s><s>Quinine sulfate also yielded reliable lifetimes, however, its use was restricted with respect to solvent as it dissolved properly only in sulfuric acid.</s><s>This makes it less suitable both for experimental work and as a lifetime standard compared to fluorescein, especially since sulfuric acid is a more hazardous chemical to work with than ethanol and methanol.</s><s>(GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, recombinant expressed in E. coli, did also produce very good fluorecence lifetime results, however, the suitability as a reference standard is not at the level of fluorescein because it is not readily available to dissolve in various solvents, and it is also more expensive compared to both fluorescein and quinine sulfate.</s></p><p><s>Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http:// creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/),</s><s>which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 The structural formulas of fluorescein (a) and quinine sulfate (b) (from Sigma Aldrich product catalogue)</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
