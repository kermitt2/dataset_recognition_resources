<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this retrospective study of patients with ATAAD, we observed that CCA dissection, lower enhancement in the unilateral ICA, and aortic arch tears are independent CTA risk predictors for postoperative TND, while both retrograde aAO dissection and aortic arch tears are independent CTA risk predictors for PND.</s><s>The extent of the entire CCA and proximal ICA involved, CCA re-entry and lower enhancement in the false lumen, and a severely narrowed true lumen in the CCA without re-entry significantly increased the risk of TND when the CCA was involved.</s><s>Postoperative neurological complications, including TND (with a reported incidence of 2.5-33%) and PND (with an incidence of 4.2-24%), remain challenging for patients with ATAAD 3,5,7, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</s><s>In our study, the incidences of TND and PND were 14.9% and 7.1%, respectively, which are lower than those reported in most other studies.</s><s>This discrepancy likely occurred because all operations were performed at our high-volume cardiovascular surgical centre with dedicated high-volume thoracic aortic surgeons.</s><s>Moreover, all patients in our centre are cared for via an emergent green route, and the majority undergo emergency surgical repair within 8 hours of admission.</s></p><p><s>To increase sensitivity in the identification of risk factors, previous authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> have elected to combine PND and death as adverse outcomes (AO) for evaluation, but this approach may have confused the real risk predictors for PND or mortality.</s><s>The most common causes of postoperative mortality involve cardiac aetiology, while neurological complications are less significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, only PND was evaluated in the present study.</s></p><p><s>As we suspected, CCA dissection was shown to be a major CTA risk predictor for TND but not for PND.</s><s>A previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> indicated that carotid artery dissection may well correlate with cerebral malperfusion, which presents strong potential for adverse outcomes in postoperative patients with ATAAD.</s><s>In most cases requiring extensive arch repair, such as total arch replacement, unilateral antegrade selective cerebral perfusion is the cerebral protection method of choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In the setting of right CCA dissection with severe stenosis of the true lumen, however, bilateral two-vessel perfusion through the right axillary artery or the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery may be essential to avoid left cerebral artery insufficiency, which may result in cerebral infarction.</s></p><p><s>The detailed CTA characteristics of CCA dissection need to be carefully considered.</s><s>Lower enhancement in the false lumen of the CCA with re-entry or a severely narrowed true lumen of the CCA without re-entry is significantly more common in patients with TND.</s><s>A longer extent of dissection of the CCA and proximal ICA also increase the risk of TND compared with dissection of the proximal CCA or entire CCA.</s></p><p><s>Lower enhancement in the unilateral ICA is potentially predictive of TND.</s><s>Several conditions contribute to this finding, such as the ICA originating from the false lumen, a severely narrowed true lumen of the CCA, or low-enhancement CCA originating from the false lumen of the IA.</s><s>Lower enhancement indicates decreased blood flow in the carotid artery, which may be highly predictive of cerebral hypoperfusion.</s><s>This finding suggests a therapeutic strategy that may resolve malperfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Lower enhancement in the unilateral ICA also shows a high incidence of 88.9% in patients with PND.</s><s>Therefore, the finding that this condition is not an independent predictor of PND was unexpected.</s><s>This unexpected result may have occurred because this condition, which represents a manifestation of ipsilateral cerebral hypoperfusion, can be resolved via rapid establishment of cerebral flow and surgical repair of the dissection.</s></p><p><s>In our study, an aortic arch tear was found to significantly increase the risk of both TND and PND.</s><s>It is reasonable to presume that emboli (thrombi in the false lumen or plaques ruptured during a surgical procedure) flow more easily into craniocervical arteries via the entry point, resulting in subsequent artery occlusion and cerebral infarction.</s><s>Recent studies have demonstrated that strokes in patients with cervical artery dissection are most frequently associated with artery-to-artery embolization <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>In the case of an aortic arch tear combined with a thrombus in the false lumen, CTA information could alert the surgeon to pay meticulous attention to critical procedural details to avoid dislodging the embolus from the tear.</s><s>The incidence of stroke is likely to be effectively reduced by following these guidelines.</s><s>Although dAO tears were excluded as a risk predictor due to their low occurrence, we still believe such tears have an effect on postoperative neurological dysfunction due to sharing similar mechanisms with aortic arch tears.</s></p><p><s>The finding that retrograde aAO dissection serves as an independent predictor of PND was unexpected.</s><s>This condition is commonly associated with an aortic arch or dAO tear.</s><s>Thrombogenesis in the false lumen is common due to the integrated intimal flap.</s><s>Therefore, avoiding the dislodgment of a thrombus during surgical procedures may effectively reduce postoperative PND.</s></p><p><s>This study was limited by its retrospective nature.</s><s>Additionally, there was some selection bias as well as a sample size and character mismatches between the three groups.</s><s>The sample size of the patient groups with postoperative TND and PND was also small, which may influence the accuracy of the outcomes.</s><s>Furthermore, our study focused on only in-hospital TND and PND, and long-term clinical outcomes may be more important for elucidating real CTA risk predictors.</s><s>Finally, our CTA scanning procedure did not include the head, which might provide more useful information regarding the status of cerebral malperfusion.</s></p><p><s>The findings of the present study indicated that specific carotid and aortic CTA findings may help predict individual risk for postoperative TND and PND in patients with ATAAD, in addition to providing guidance for individual surgical strategies that may decrease postoperative neurological dysfunction.</s></p></div>
