<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a single-gene disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3500 individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>It is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, but in about half of the affected individuals, it arises as a spontaneous mutation.</s><s>The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17 (17q11.2);</s><s>it encodes for the protein neurofibromin, which is thought to act as a tumor suppressor.</s><s>Neurofibromin is involved in Ras GTPase activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Ras GTPase downregulates Ras, a family of proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.</s><s>Thus, lack of neurofibromin due to NF1 gene defects may lead to a lack of inhibitory control over Ras, resulting in increased cell formation, migration, and differentiation.</s><s>Clinical features of NF1 include caféau-lait spots, skin fold freckling, Lisch nodules, neurofibromas (i.e., Schwann cell tumors), optic pathway gliomas, and bone lesions (e.g., short stature or scoliosis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several brain abnormalities have been observed in NF1, including neoplasms, T2 hyperintensities (T2H), macrocephaly, and abnormalities in white matter (WM) integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Macrocephaly in NF1 has mostly been attributed to increased WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Volumetric studies of subcortical regions are sparse: one recent study showed significantly larger thalamic and right caudate volumes in NF1 compared to healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Links between neurobiological abnormalities associated with NF1 and structural brain abnormalities have not yet firmly been established, although animal studies increasingly show the importance of neurofibromin and Ras-signaling for appropriate brain development.</s><s>For example, in NF1 +/− mice, increased interneuronal Ras-signaling causes an increase in GABA release <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The level of GABAergic inhibition does not only play an important role in ongoing function of neuronal networks but also affects neuronal development, for example, by modulating the length of developmental sensitive periods.</s><s>In NF1, increased GABAergic inhibition may cause early closure of sensitive periods leading to altered patterning in cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Cognitive and social problems have also extensively been reported for NF1 patients.</s><s>The most prominent findings include problems with executive functioning (e.g., working memory, inhibitory control) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and a particularly high incidence of autistic traits (with a prevalence of up to 30 % in the severe, clinical range, and a further 25-30 % in the mild to moderate range) and ADHD (also a prevalence of up to 50 %, although it is not yet clear which proportion of those has attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Increased GABA release may not only be associated with the (social-)cognitive phenotype of NF1 through its modulatory role in activity flow in the striatum, but, as noted, may also have led to anatomical brain abnormalities, which in turn underlie the cognitive and social problems observed in NF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several studies tried to link the anatomical abnormalities to aspects of cognition in NF1.</s><s>Although there are some exceptions (particularly concerning thalamic T2H), generally, no relationship was found between the number of T2H and cognitive deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Whereas macrocephaly itself was generally not related to cognitive outcomes either <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, there have been reports of an absence of the normal positive correlation between gray matter (GM) volume and intelligence in NF1 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, of smaller superior temporal gyrus GM volume being associated with poorer performance in a social cognition task <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and of negative correlations between callosal WM volume and cognitive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Associations between GM and WM volumes and social functioning have not yet been investigated in NF1.</s></p><p><s>The present study aimed to investigate cortical and subcortical volumetric brain abnormalities in NF1 in relation to social and attention problems, social skills, autistic mannerisms, and executive functioning.</s></p><p><s>Based on the knowledge that lack of neurofibromin may lead to a lack of inhibitory control over Ras, resulting in increased cell formation, migration, and differentiation, and based on the existing evidence on volumetric brain abnormalities in NF1, it was hypothesized that subcortical volumes and whole brain gray and white matter volumes would be larger in NF1 compared to healthy controls.</s><s>Based on the evidence for suboptimal cortical organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and previous findings in NF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, it was expected that cortical GM density would be decreased in NF1 compared to healthy controls.</s><s>Furthermore, it was expected that significant group differences would exist regarding (parental reports of) executive dysfunction, social skills, social and attention problems, and autistic mannerisms.</s><s>Finally, it was hypothesized that the extent of volumetric abnormalities (increases in subcortical and total WM and GM volumes, decreases in GM density) in NF1 patients would be related to the severity of parent-rated social and cognitive impairments.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavior rating scales</head><p><s>Cognitive and social functioning were assessed using parental reports on several behavior rating scales.</s><s>Social skills were represented by the total score (i.e., the sum of four subscales: self-control, assertion, cooperation, and responsibility) on the parent version of the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Social and attention problems were assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Autistic mannerisms were assessed using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to all other questionnaires, higher scores in the SSRS represent better outcomes.</s><s>Therefore, we reversed its scores for comparability in statistical analyses.</s></p><p><s>Executive functioning was assessed using the parentrated Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, which contains questions about nine interrelated subdomains of EF in daily life situations, and from which the total score (the Global Executive Composite, GEC) was calculated and used in the present study.</s><s>In addition, the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) was used to measure EF (total score only).</s><s>The DEX is part of the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MRI data acquisition</head><p><s>All subjects underwent scanning at the Leiden University Medical Center.</s><s>Imaging was performed on a Philips 3 Tesla Achieva MRI scanner using an eight-channel SENSE receiver head coil (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands).</s><s>In each subject, a T1-weighted anatomical scan was acquired with the following scan parameters: 3D T1 TFE sequence, 140 axial slices, TR 9.8 ms, TE 4.6 ms, flip angle 8°, in-plane voxel size 1.16 × 0.92 mm, 1.2 mm slice thickness, no slice gap.</s><s>In addition, a T2-weighted anatomical scan was acquired (52 slices, TR = shortest, TE 80 ms, flip angle 90°, in-plane voxel size: 0.43 × 0.478 mm, 3 mm slice thickness, no slice gap).</s><s>All anatomical scans were reviewed by a neuroradiologist.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subcortical segmentation</head><p><s>FMRIB Software Library (FSL)'s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) was used to obtain volumes of subcortical gray matter regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>T1 input data was normalized to the 1 mm Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 152 standard space using an affine transformation.</s><s>Next, a subcortical mask was applied to exclude voxels outside the subcortical regions, followed by automated segmentation based on shape models and voxel intensities.</s><s>Next, a boundary correction was applied to ameliorate partial volume effects, after which absolute volumes of subcortical structures were calculated, taking into account the transformations made at the first stage.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Voxel-based morphometry</head><p><s>T1 data was analyzed with FSL-VBM, a voxel-based morphometry style analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, part of FSL.</s><s>The following steps were performed: brain extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, tissue-type segmentation, and nonlinear normalization to MNI152 standard space.</s><s>The resulting images were averaged to create a study-specific template, to which the native gray matter images were then nonlinearly re-registered.</s><s>These were then modulated (to correct for local expansion or contraction) by dividing by the Jacobian of the warp field.</s><s>Next, the modulated segmented images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (sigma of 3 mm).</s><s>For group comparisons, a general linear model was applied using permutation-based nonparametric testing (randomize), correcting for multiple comparisons across space (TFCE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>), and familywise error rate (FWE) corrected p = .05).</s><s>Age and sex were used as covariates.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole brain gray and white matter</head><p><s>Tissue type segmentation was carried out with FAST on the T1 scans in native space <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and total gray and white matter volumes were calculated.</s><s>Using SIENAX, the T1 scans were linearly registered to MNI152 space, yielding a global scaling value for each participant that serves as a proxy for total intracranial volume.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T2H</head><p><s>The T2 scans from NF1 patients were visually checked by a neuroradiologist for the presence of T2H.</s><s>Next, handlabeled masks were created of all voxels showing T2H.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>SPSS 21 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analyses of all metrics except for the VBM analysis.</s><s>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for distribution normality.</s><s>To test for group differences in social skills, social and attention problems, autistic mannerisms, and executive dysfunction multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA, correcting for age and sex) was used.</s><s>To test for volumetric group differences, ANCOVA (correcting for age, sex and scaling) was chosen.</s><s>One-tailed Pearson correlations were used to correlate questionnaire scores with volumetric parameters.</s><s>For this, 1000 equally sized random samples were generated from the original sample (bootstrap method) to robustly estimate the standard error.</s><s>Confidence intervals of the correlation coefficients were used for decision of significance.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study provides indications for a neuroanatomical basis of the executive and social problems in NF1.</s><s>All subcortical structures investigated (thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, and nucleus accumbens) were larger in NF1 compared to HC. NF1 patients also had larger overall WM volume compared to HC.</s><s>In contrast, smaller GM densities in NF1 compared to HC were found in midline regions of the frontal and parietal lobes.</s><s>NF1 patients were rated to have more social, attention, and EF problems than HC, more autistic mannerisms, and poorer social skills.</s><s>Whereas among HC, larger GM volumes of cortical and subcortical structures were generally associated with better cognitive and social outcomes; the same effect for NF1 patients was only found for the precentral gyrus and the right accumbens.</s><s>These results add important information to the converging evidence on associations between volumetric properties of specific brain regions and social and cognitive functioning in healthy and clinical populations.</s><s>In healthy people, larger cortical GM volumes have been associated with better cognitive outcomes rather consistently <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and larger subcortical volumes with better social and social-cognitive outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders, relative enlargements of subcortical structures (e.g., the amygdala) have been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Though in itself relatively rare, NF1 shares a common pathophysiology, involving the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, with several other genetic syndromes.</s><s>Examples include tuberous sclerosis complex, fragile X, Noonan, Costello, and Legius syndromes.</s><s>Similarities between these disorders have also been observed regarding clinical features and behavioral phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, it has even been suggested that the syndromes characterized by dysregulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway collectively account for up to 20 % of autism spectrum disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It appears that a certain optimum regarding cellular growth is required for adequate development.</s><s>In disorders such as NF1, this optimum is exceeded, resulting in less-effective connections within and between brain regions associated with cognitive and social functioning.</s><s>This subsequently might lead to autism-type behavioral phenotypes.</s></p><p><s>Our findings regarding cognitive and social outcomes, as well as regarding autistic mannerisms are in accordance with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Volumetric abnormalities (mainly enlargements) have also been reported before in NF1, both regarding whole-brain WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and, more recently, for subcortical structures such as the thalamus and caudate nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, the volumetric abnormalities appear to be more widespread than previously reported and direct associations have been observed between whole-brain WM, precentral GM, and subcortical GM on the one hand and cognitive and social problems on the other in NF1.</s></p><p><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Voxel-based morphometry: differences in gray matter density between NF1 patients and healthy controls (yellow controls &gt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Despite its limitations, several conclusions may be drawn from the results of the present study.</s><s>Most importantly, relatively strong indications were found for the existence of neural correlates of several social and cognitive impairments (as observed by parents) in NF1: in adolescents with NF1, there appears to be either a lack of normal positive associations between volumetric properties of specific brain regions and social/cognitive outcomes or even an inverse relation between the two.</s><s>These neural substrates and their associations with cognitive-behavioral phenotypes may also be important in other disorders characterized by abnormalities in the Ras/MAPK pathway and synaptic plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Regarding future research directions and potential implications for clinical practice, it should be noted that the etiology of different structural brain abnormalities in NF1 is still very much under investigation.</s><s>Neurobiological and neuroanatomical characteristics of NF1 should be studied in conjunction, and at different ages, as their interaction may differ depending on developmental stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, future studies should combine multiple neuro-imaging techniques in order to provide a more complete picture of the neural substrates underlying cognitive and social functioning in NF1.</s><s>In the present study, several techniques and means of analyses were already introduced, but we did not include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), measuring WM integrity, which has also been shown to be affected in NF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>WM integrity, a measure of structural connectivity, may be the best neural substrate for functional connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Several recent studies showed abnormal resting state functional connectivity in NF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, with further indications that these were associated with cognitive and behavioral impairments (i.e., IQ and self-reported internalizing symptoms) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, in order to obtain insight into relative influence of different aspects of brain structure and function on social and cognitive outcomes in NF1, and subsequently into what might happen following medication or training, it would be advisable to combine neurobiological investigations with a multimodal imaging approach at different stages of development.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 2 Illustration of correlations between brain volumes and executive and social outcomes in NF1 patients (a) and healthy controls (b).</s><s>Listed below is the correlation coefficient, r, with the corresponding confidence interval, CI</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="7,63.84,96.27,467.66,400.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
