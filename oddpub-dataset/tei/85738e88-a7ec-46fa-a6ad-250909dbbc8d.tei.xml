cardiomyopathy patients makes the possible explanation of rare polymorphisms highly unlikely.</s><s>This interpretation is confirmed by the absence of the mutations in a high number of ethnically matched control individuals.</s><s>Despite the very low frequency of the mutations (&lt; 1/1000 alleles), we detected the 175 variant in two independent patients from Germany and France.</s><s>Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and dbSNP datasets confirmed the rarity/ novelty of all mutations, which is a major criterion for pathogenicity in cardiomyopathies with so many "private" mutations <ref

dataset.</s><s>Using the same approach for NEBL, all mutations found by us are below that threshold, confirming their extreme rarity (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We are aware that a non-synonymous mutation causing a genetic disease increases in evolutionarily highly conserved sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The affected amino acids of the identified mutations were highly conserved in different species.</s><s>Interestingly, the conservation could be partially observed in nebulette itself.</s><s>The mutations at codons 581 and 652 showed this conservation also in the different nebulin-like repeats (Figure <ref type="figure">2 A</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the changes were non-conservative; namely, they changed the properties of the residues such as polarity or size, indicating deleterious effects on protein structure.</s></p><p><s>The localization of the mutations in a functional protein domain underscores a possible pathogenic effect.</s><s>Notably, five of the identified mutations reside in the nebulin-like repeats, the basic functional units for actin binding.</s><s>The sixth mutation (p.P916L) is located in the serine-rich linker domain responsible for cellular targeting in the Z-disk (as shown by Panaviene et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>).</s><s>The fact that transgenic animal models expressing human NEBL mutations generated by Purevjav et al. resembled a cardiomyopathic phenotype strongly enhances the confidence in our results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the NEBL gene that encodes the Z-disk protein, nebulette, is an excellent candidate gene to contribute to heart muscle disease.</s><s>The fact that NEBL is preferentially expressed in the heart makes such speculation more plausible.</s><s>Furthermore, there are a number of known cardiomyopathy disease genes encoding Z-disk proteins (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>This scheme is quite fitting for nebulette.</s></p><p><s>Purevjav et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> drew attention to four missense mutations in NEBL (p.K60N, p.Q128R, p.G202R, p.A592E).</s><s>These are also located in the nebulin-like repeats and are in close vicinity to five mutations identified by us affecting the same repeat domain in two cases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref>).</s><s>They found NEBL mutations in two newborn DCM patients (one with endocardial fibroelastosis) and two patients with DCM manifestation in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>We found mutations in familial as well as sporad-ic cases with DCM and additionally in cases with HCM or LVNC.</s><s>Furthermore, we identified clinical manifestation of cardiomyopathy mostly in adulthood (the exception was one child with severe HCM).</s><s>There seems to be a possible relation to age as seen in the probands with NEBL mutations who have an age at diagnosis between 41 and 53 years (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">II</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Relatives without cardiomyopathy often showed a negative genotype, whereas pathological phenotypes co-segregated with an NEBL mutation (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>However, two individuals, C: III-2, 19 years old, and C: III-3, 23 years old, from family C were mutation carriers without a cardiomyopathy phenotype.</s><s>This could be attributed to their young age, which is well known to be associated with a low probability of cardiomyopathy expression due to age-related penetrance <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>.</s><s>The unaffected individual A: II-5, a mutation carrier and 56 years old, may be explained by the fact that penetrance increases with age but remains less than 100%, as Watkins et al. stated in their review <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The clinical significance of the p.I652L variant in family B is puzzling.</s><s>The mother (B: I-2) showing hypertrophy and aortic stenosis was a carrier of the mutation.</s><s>However, two relatives with some degree of hypertrophy did not carry the mutation.</s><s>While individual B: I-1 had an unequivocal HCM, individual B: II-2 showed mild hypertrophy and arterial hypertension and therefore may be regarded as a likely phenocopy (i.e.</s><s>masquerading as HCM).</s><s>On the one hand, p.I652L is highly conserved in orthologs and NLRs and quite rare in patients and controls (0.01% according to ESP).</s><s>On the other hand, it is the only conserved change predicted to be benign by PolyPhen2 and has an allelic frequency of 0.3% according to dbSNP.</s><s>Taken together, we would classify p.I652L as a variant of unknown significance.</s></p><p><s>We suggest that NEBL mutations may generate cardiomyopathy phenotypes.</s><s>Thus we must propose mechanisms.</s><s>Moncman and Wang showed that a targeted disruption of nebulette expression in cardiomyocytes significantly altered myofibril assembly and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Purevjav et al. validated the functional effects of four human NEBL missense mutations in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>They generated transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of human wild-type and mutant nebulette, showing a variety of phenotypes and severity in vivo ranging from embryonic lethality due to cardiac abnormalities to LV enlargement and diminished LV function at later stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Effects at the molecular/cellular level were changes in I-band and Z-disk composition and abnormal distribution of mutant nebulette under mechanical stretch.</s><s>Their findings showed that NEBL mutations have strong but different effects on nebulette function itself and the function of interacting proteins depending on the location of the respective mutation.</s><s>Ram and Blaxall concluded that nebulette may play dual roles as both a structural protein of the Z-disk, and also -possibly through its binding partners -as a regulatory protein of signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The findings of Purevjav et al. suggest that nebulette is required for normal sarcomere genesis and Z-disk stabilization during development and adult function <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We were struck by the fact that nearly all Z-disk genes were associated with DCM as well as HCM, as Bos and Ackerman noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (underlined genes in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>They pointed out that for Z-disk-mediated cardiomyopathies it is difficult to envision how divergent phenotypes emerge, especially because maladaptive dilatation seems a more plausible phenotypic response than maladaptive hypertrophy, given the role of the Z-disk as a sarcomeric stretch sensor and mechanoreceptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The divergence in phenotypes may reflect the multiple roles of nebulette in modulating cardiomyocyte stretch-strain with specific structural/cytoskeletal modifications, as Ram and Blaxall proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is still a wide knowledge gap between the specific genetic cause and the mechanism producing a specific clinical phenotype <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</s><s>A complete understanding of how underlying mutation and resulting phenotype are connected is still pending for the cardiomyopathies.</s><s>It is obvious that the ultimate phenotype represents the sum of all the parts: genotype, mutant RNA and protein expression, further genetic variants, and epigenetic influences as well as environmental factors <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</s><s>But we still lack integrated approaches that could elucidate the mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>There may be some caveats to the interpretation of the present study.</s><s>First, it is limited by the fact that the families were too small to perform linkage analysis.</s><s>Cosegregation analysis was possible in four families and produced inconclusive results in one of them.</s><s>Second, no functional studies were performed.</s><s>We were therefore cautious with the assignment of true disease causation <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>However, considering the conservation of the affected amino acid, the nature and location of the change, its absence in controls and the general population, and the reported animal models of related mutations point to a possible significance of five of the identified mutations (as we regard p.I652L as a variant of unknown significance).</s></p><p><s>It was not possible to screen all known genes associated with cardiomyopathy; so we cannot exclude the possibility that the mutation carriers may be double heterozygotes.</s><s>This is in particular true for DCM genes, whereas we excluded nearly all HCM genes.</s><s>However, even greater patient numbers may be necessary to draw more general conclusions about the frequency of NEBL mutations in cardiomyopathy patients.</s><s>Our purpose here was to draw attention to NEBL, a gene that we believe warrants much more multidisciplinary research attention.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that five different NEBL mutations are possibly associated with various cardiomyopathies.</s><s>Already known for DCM, we herein describe the first possible NEBL mutations in HCM and LVNC.</s><s>Our findings underline the notion that the cardiomyopathies are true allelic diseases.</s><s>With regard to next generation sequencing methods, NEBL may be added to a set of cardiomyopathy genes which now can be quickly analyzed in parallel with a target enrichment approach.</s></p></div>
