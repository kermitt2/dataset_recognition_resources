<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive types of cancer with limited therapeutic options and unfavorable prognosis.</s><s>Stemness and non-classical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (ncEMT) features underlie the switch from normal to neoplastic states as well as resistance of tumor clones to current therapies.</s><s>Therefore, identification of ligand/receptor systems maintaining this privileged state is needed to devise efficient cancer therapies.</s><s>In this study, we show that the expression of CD95 associates with stemness and EMT features in GBM tumors and cells and serves as a prognostic biomarker.</s><s>CD95 expression increases in tumors and with tumor relapse as compared with non-tumor tissue.</s><s>Recruitment of the activating PI3K subunit, p85, to CD95 death domain is required for maintenance of EMT-related transcripts.</s><s>A combination of the current GBM therapy, temozolomide, with a CD95 inhibitor dramatically abrogates tumor sphere formation.</s><s>This study molecularly dissects the role of CD95 in GBM cells and contributes the rational for CD95 inhibition as a GBM therapy.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>CD95 is overexpressed and can serve as a prognostic biomarker in GBM.</s><s>Molecular markers have been identified in almost every type of cancer and can aid in the estimation of a patient's response to treatment and prognosis.</s></p><p><s>To get insight into the role of CD95 in GBM, we analyzed a data set accessible via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) featuring expression as well as clinical patient data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>When compared with unmatched, non-tumor controls, CD95 was found to be highly overexpressed in GBM patient samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Based on their respective genomic and RNA signatures, four distinct subtypes (classical, mesenchymal, neural and proneural) have been proposed for GBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>When classified according to these subtypes, CD95 was predominantly expressed in mesenchymal tumors in the TCGA GBM data set while CD95 expression was the lowest in proneural GBM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Correlation of tumor's CD95 expression with clinical data showed that CD95 might function as a prognostic molecular marker in GBM patients.</s><s>Low tumor CD95 expression was associated with significantly longer overall survival (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>When our analysis was limited to patients in whom complete remission of the tumor was achieved by initial therapy, similar observations were made.</s><s>Interestingly, this feature seems to be shared by other TNF receptor family members, as the expression levels of TNFRSF1A,B; TNFRSF11B; TNFRSF12A and TNFRSF14 showed a similar trend toward longer overall survival in the patients with low TNFR expression (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Again, low tumor CD95 expression was associated with a significantly increased time to tumor recurrence after initial therapy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Of note, almost all tumors classified as low CD95 expression GBM belonged to the proneural subtype.</s><s>Consequently, significantly longer overall survival was also observed for patients with proneural tumors relative to other GBM subtypes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Expression of CD95 correlates with NSC and EMT gene expression signatures.</s><s>To gain deeper insight into the processes driving the aggressive phenotype associated with the expression of CD95, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>The genes in the TCGA data set were ranked according to their association with high and intermediate versus low CD95-expressing GBM.</s></p><p><s>At first glance, known GSC markers, including MEF, EPHA2, ITGA6 and CD44 as well as major EMT regulators appeared to be highly overexpressed in tumors with high or intermediate CD95 expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, DCX, ASCL1 and OLIG2, genes normally expressed by more differentiated neuronal progeny as well as cell cycle regulators CDKN2A and NF1, were preferentially expressed in the less aggressive tumors expressing low levels of CD95 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>GSEA showed a significant enrichment of a NSC gene signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> in high and intermediate CD95-expressing tumors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, a published EMT gene signature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> was also enriched in this group of highly aggressive GBM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>CD95 high GBM cells display CSC properties in vitro.</s><s>To further investigate the properties of CD95-expressing GBM cells in vitro, tumor cells were freshly isolated from seven surgical specimens and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS).</s><s>A population of cells with high levels of CD95 surface expression (CD95 high )ranging from 0.2 to 71%was found in each sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Co-staining for known GSC surface markers revealed a significant enrichment of CD44, ITGA6 and CD15 but not CD133-expressing cells within this CD95 high GBM cell population (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b-e</ref>).</s><s>To test this enrichment of known GSC markers in a larger patient cohort, we again turned to the TCGA GBM patient data set.</s><s>Paralleling our findings in primary GBM cells, a significant correlation was observed between the expression of CD95 and the known GSC markers CD44, ITGA6, MEF, EPHA2 and EPHA3 but not for CD133 in this data set (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f-k</ref>).</s><s>Because of the large number of patients (n = 519), all correlations were statistically significant.</s><s>Nevertheless, correlation was strongest between the expression of CD95 and CD44 as well as MEF (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f and h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These observations suggested that the CD95 high GBM cell population might possibly hold certain stem cell-like traits.</s><s>We therefore tested the self-renewal capacity of FACS-sorted cells isolated from five patient samples by measuring sphere formation.</s><s>CD95 high cells showed extensive sphere-formation capacities, while sphere formation in CD95 neg cells was very limited (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-e</ref>).</s><s>The same was also true when the cells were plated under limiting-dilution conditions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f-i</ref>).</s><s>Even under highly restrictive conditions down to one cell per well, CD95 high GBM cells showed profound sphere-formation capacities.</s><s>The estimated stem cell frequencies ranged from 1 : 1 to 1 : 163 for CD95 high compared with 1 : 110 to 1 : 773 for CD95 neg GBM cells (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g-i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>CD95 high GBM cells are highly tumorigenic in vivo.</s><s>In order to further investigate these observed properties of CD95 high cells in vivo, primary cells were isolated from a human sample, depleted of CD45-positive immune cells as well as CD31-positive endothelial cells and sorted for CD95 expression.</s><s>One thousand unsorted, CD95 high or CD95 neg primary cells were injected into the striatum of SCID beige mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3j</ref>).</s><s>The CD95 high fraction amounted to 3.33% while CD95 neg cells made up 52.4% of cells in the patient sample (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Tumor incidence was 86 and 55% for CD95 high and CD95 neg xenografts, respectively.</s><s>Sixteen weeks after xenotransplantation, first lesions were detected in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3k</ref>).</s><s>From then on, the CD95 high -expressing tumors showed sustained growth throughout the observation period of a further 7 weeks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3k</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, despite being able to initiate a tumor, CD95 neg and unsorted tumor cells were not able to sustain tumor growth.</s><s>After an initial growth phase of the detectable lesions, the size of the lesion stagnated or even decreased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3k</ref>).</s><s>At the end of the MRI observation period 22 weeks after implantation, CD95 high GBM cells had given rise to significantly larger tumors than CD95 neg or unsorted cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3l</ref> and Supplementary Movies SM1 and SM2).</s><s>The MRI-measured tumor volumes were confirmed by histopathological analysis in samples of tumor-bearing brains (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Paralleling the significantly larger tumor in the CD95 high -injected group, those animals also showed a higher mortality (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3m</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To confirm these results, orthotopic xenotransplantation was repeated with cells derived from a second, independent patient sample.</s><s>Because of the limited availability of primary patient material, tumor cells were expanded by two rounds of subcutaneous xenografting (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Despite the increasingly efficient tumor formation by CD95 neg cells, CD95 high cells once more sustained superior tumor growth (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Inhibition of CD95/CD95L signaling precludes sphere formation while CD95 and CD95L are upregulated by conventional therapy.</s><s>Next we asked whether self-renewal of GBM cells might be dependent on a CD95/CD95L signal.</s><s>We therefore treated freshly isolated GBM cells with APG101 (Apocept), a CD95-Fc fusion protein designed to scavenge CD95L and thereby block CD95 activity.</s><s>In addition, cells were treated with the GBM standard chemotherapy, temozolomide (TMZ) or a combination of APG101 and TMZ.</s><s>APG101 was able to significantly reduce GBM sphere formation in combination with TMZ but not alone (Figures <ref type="figure">4ac</ref>).</s><s>As the inhibitor effect of APG101 is based on its binding to CD95L, we reasoned that expression of CD95L by GBM cells under culture conditions might be low and increased by TMZ treatment.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we measured CD95L by ELISA in the supernatant and lysates of GBM cells treated with TMZ or left untreated.</s><s>In two out of the four samples tested, TMZ treatment resulted in an increase in CD95L expression while a similar trend was observed in the remaining samples.</s><s>This could explain the inhibitory selfrenewal effect by the combination of TMZ and APG101 (Figures <ref type="figure">4d-k</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To compare these in vitro findings to the clinical setting, protein expression of CD95 and CD95L was examined in tissue sections from 27 original and matched relapse tumors (Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>For quantification purposes, the different tumors were scored on a scale ranging from two (lowest) to six (highest) according to the intensity and area of CD95 and CD95L immunohistochemical staining across the different tumor sections.</s><s>After initial treatment, CD95 expression was significantly upregulated in relapse tumors (Figures <ref type="figure">5b and c</ref>).</s><s>These results point toward the occurrence of a selection process favoring CD95-expressing cells with increased chemoresistance.</s><s>In accordance with our findings in vitro, expression of CD95L was also upregulated in relapsing GBM after initial treatment of the original tumor (Figures <ref type="figure">5d and e</ref>).</s></p><formula

recruits P85 and SFK and is essential for maintenance of an EMT program in GBM cells.</s><s>We have previously suggested that phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue lying within CD95's intracellular death domain underlies non-apoptotic downstream signals.</s></p><p><s>This hypothesis was, however, based on in silico prediction but never demonstrated at the molecular level.</s><s>To study tyrosine phosphorylation in GBM, we transduced CD95negative (CD95 neg ) cells with lentiviral vectors entailing either a CD95 wild type (CD95-WT) or a CD95 tyrosine-to-alanine mutant (CD95-mut) that precludes phosphorylation.</s><s>To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of CD95 in situ, we used a proximity ligation assay (PLA) that uses antibody-DNA conjugates to enable the conversion of protein-protein interactions (o40 nm distance) into detectable DNA molecules.</s><s>Thus a phosphorylated tyrosine in CD95 can be detected by the proximity of anti-CD95 to anti-phospho-tyrosine antibodies in GBM cells.</s><s>Indeed, this assay revealed the presence of tyrosine phosphorylation of CD95 (Figure <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>Upon stimulation with CD95L-T4, CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation strongly increased in CD95-WT but not in CD95-mut cells (Figures <ref type="figure">6a  and b</ref>).</s><s>After establishing this cellular model, we next wanted to test the recruitment of known downstream mediators of non-apoptotic CD95 signals.</s><s>Association of the regulatory PI3K subunit, p85, as well as a Src-familiy-kinase member (Sfk) with CD95 was readily detected by CD95 and phospho- tyrosine immunoprecipitation (IP) in naive, unsorted GBM cells treated with CD95L (Figure <ref type="figure">6c</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</s><s>Upon stimulation in lentivirally transduced GBM cells, recruitment of P85 and Sfk was observed in CD95-WT but not in CD95-mut cells (Figures <ref type="figure">6d and e</ref>).</s><s>We thus conclude that, upon stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation within the intracellular death domain might contribute to the assembly of the non-apoptotic CD95 signalosome in GBM cells.</s><s>We hypothesized that CD95 signaling, via tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of downstream mediators, might induce an EMT signal that can promote stemness and invasive migration in GBM cells.</s><s>Fitting this hypothesis, expression of CD95 correlated with the expression of the known EMT marker genes VIM, FN1, SNAI2 and S100A4 in the TCGA data set (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>To further investigate this potential link, we measured the expression of 62 EMTassociated genes in qPCR arrays for CD95 high versus CD95 neg GBM cells sorted from 4 individual patient samples as well as in our CD95-WT versus CD95-mut cells.</s><s>Here EMTassociated genes were again upregulated in CD95 high cells (Figure <ref type="figure">6f</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the EMT-associated genes were strongly downregulated in CD95mut cells lacking tyrosine phosphorylation within the death domain of CD95 (Figure <ref type="figure">6f</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>An aggressive population of GBM cells with stem celllike properties expresses high levels of CD95.</s><s>Our results demonstrate that CD95 can be used for isolation of a highly aggressive population of GBM cells with certain stem cell-like features.</s><s>CD95 high GBM cells exhibit superior self-renewal capacity in vitro and are enriched in relapsing tumors after conventional therapy.</s><s>Blocking of CD95 signaling inhibits GBM cell self-renewal.</s><s>In accordance with findings in adult NSCs as well as breast CSCs, CD95 thus seems to mediate an activation signal in CD95 high GBM cells too. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>xamination of the TCGA data set revealed that CD95 was predominantly expressed in mesenchymal GBM subtype.</s><s>Studies employing genetically engineered mouse models have shown that occurrence of genetic alterations in a certain cell type induces formation of distinct GBM subtype tumors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>n this study, the mesenchymal subtype arose from introducing mutations in differentiated neural cells.</s><s>Thus an ongoing dedifferentiation process that confers a NSC-or progenitor cell-like phenotype was speculated as underlying tumor-initiation mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>Our results indicate that CD95 might be actively involved in this process by functioning as an EMT signal.</s><s>In addition, inflammatory infiltrates are highly prevalent within mesenchymal GBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>As reported previously, innate immune cells rely on the CD95/CD95L system to be recruited to the central nervous system after injury. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>And lately, innate immunity has been linked to efficient reprogramming in the induction of pluripotency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>It is thus possible that a signal mediated by CD95L-bearing immune cells can contribute to the establishment of an aggressive tumor phenotype.</s><s>Additionally, we showed that expression of CD95L increases during tumor progression and after chemotherapy.</s><s>This suggests that GBM cells themselves might be able to maintain CD95 activity as a stimulating signal, especially later on during disease progression.</s></p><p><s>CD95, stemness and the EMT program.</s><s>As a cell of tumor origin does not necessarily have to be a CSC, it is reasonable to assume that there must be a way for cancer cells to acquire stem cell traits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>To this end, the developmental program of EMT has been reported to confer pro-invasive as well as stem cell-like properties to cancer cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>Similarly, the EMT-mediating transcription factor Twist1 has been shown to be crucial to melanoma initiation and progression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>ur observations indicate an ongoing process similar to EMT that maintains a population of aggressive, stem cell-like cells in GBM.</s><s>Given the fact that this process is similar but not identical to the EMT process resulting in metastasis formation in carcinomas, it is appropriate to denote this process as nonclassical EMT (ncEMT).</s><s>CD95, via tyrosine phosphorylation of its intracellular death domain and subsequent downstream via the PI3K pathway, seems to be actively involved in this process.</s><s>In line with these observations, the PI3K signaling pathway is involved in the induction of an EMT state in other tumors as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s>CD95 belongs to the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) superfamily, and similarly, TNFα has been implicated in EMT, tumorigenesis and tumor cell invasion in various ways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref></s><s>Furthermore, inhibition of the major EMT-regulator TGF-β has been shown to inhibit CSC activity in GBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Cells at the invasive front of GBM as well as other solid tumors usually acquire mesenchymal traits to promote their invasive migration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>Another interesting aspect regarding the role of EMT in cancer has been highlighted recently.</s><s>Studies in pancreatic and lung cancer have indicated that EMT might not be the main driver of metastatic growth but might rather induce a chemoresistant state in tumor cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>aken together, our findings suggest an active role of CD95 in GBM growth and progression.</s><s>Beyond a function as a sheer surface marker, non-apoptotic signals mediated via phosphorylation within the intracellular death domain seem to regulate ncEMT in a manner similar to other TNFα family and tyrosine kinase receptors.</s><s>However, additional efforts are required to further elucidate on the exact signaling pathway and its regulation.</s></p><p><s>Implications for GBM therapy.</s><s>Our results imply possible clinical applications of CD95 as a prognostic biomarker as well as a therapeutic target in GBM therapy.</s><s>We identified low CD95 expression as a positive prognostic biomarker predicting favorable overall and recurrence-free survival.</s></p><p><s>In 2008, we discovered that CD95 induces invasive migration of GBM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Based on this findings, APG101 (Apocept), a CD95-Fc fusion protein that neutralizes CD95L, has been developed.</s><s>In a first safety trial, APG101 showed no toxicity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref></s><s>Recently, the combination of APG101 and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy only in patients with relapsing GBM was tested in a Phase II clinical trial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>Surpassing all expectations, application of the compound in combination with radiotherapy almost doubled the progression-free survival in these patients for whom only very limited therapeutic options are available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>Increased overall survival was also observed upon APG101 treatment within a group of patients featuring low levels of DNA methylation within the CD95L promoter (and therefore expressing high levels of CD95L).</s><s>Consequently, CD95L promoter methylation status was suggested as a biomarker to predict a tumor's response to APG101 treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>ur current study provides additional insight into possible cellular effects of APG101.</s><s>Given its supposed involvement in the regulation of ncEMT in GBM cells, CD95 might be able to specifically target the aggressive subpopulation of tumor cells that we have described here.</s><s>Therefore, APG101 might be a valuable addition to conventional therapies targeting the tumor bulk and we are eager to see its effect in the larger-scale clinical trials to come.</s></p></div>
