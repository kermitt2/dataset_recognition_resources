<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Animal Welfare and Laboratory Animals</head><p><s>1.</s><s>All experiments were conducted in fully anesthetized male pigs (German Landrace × Large White) of 3-4 months of age, weighing 30-60 kg.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Anesthesia, Intubation, and Mechanical Ventilation</head><p><s>1. Withhold food for 12 hr prior to anesthesia to avoid a full stomach of the pig, but allow free access to water to minimize stress.</s><s>2. For premedication, inject a combination of azaperone (3 mg/kg), atropine (0.03 mg/kg), ketamine (25 mg/kg), and xylazine (3.5 mg/kg) into the neck muscles of the pig while the animal is still kept in its box to minimize stress.</s><s>1. Place the animal onto a stretcher and cover the eyes with a cloth for transportation once an adequate level of anesthesia is achieved.</s></p><p><s>2. Transport the pig to the surgical theater and ensure sufficient spontaneous breathing at all times by keeping the snout unobstructed.</s></p><p><s>3. Place the pig in the prone position and preoxygenate with a mask that fits the animal's snout using a high flow of oxygen (e.g. 10 L/ min).</s></p><p><s>3. Start monitoring the peripheral oxygen saturation (S p O 2 ) by clipping the respective sensor of the monitor onto one of the ears.</s><s>Gain venous access with a clinically used peripheral vein catheter (usually 18 or 20 G) placed into one of the ear veins after a wipe down procedure with alcohol swaps.</s><s>1. Start an infusion with a balanced crystalloid solution with a 500 ml bolus followed by continuous infusion of about 4 ml/kg/hr (as deemed clinically necessary depending on the experiment) and ensure correct placement of the catheter for the subsequent infusion of anesthetics.</s><s>NOTE: The infusion of larger volumes of normal saline instead of a balanced crystalloid solution can result in hyperchloremic acidosis, whereas infusion of a solution containing lactate can result in increased serum lactate concentrations, and thus interfere with the interpretation of the blood gas analysis or the results of subsequent experiments.</s></p><p><s>4. After sufficient preoxygenation (preoxygenation during the complete time for peripheral vein access, measured S p O 2 of 95-100%) inject propofol (about 5-10 mg/kg body weight -the exact dose depends on the effect of the premedication and differs from animal to animal) using the peripheral vein catheter.</s><s>5. Intubate the pig in the prone position using an endotracheal tube for clinical application (7.5-8.5 ID) and a laryngoscope designed for large animals (straight blade of about 25 cm length).</s><s>1. Strap two bandages through the snout of the animal (first investigator).</s><s>Pull one bandage upwards to move the head into the correct position and straighten the oropharyngeal structures, pull the other bandage down to open the snout.</s><s>Pull the tongue to one side (second investigator).</s><s>2. Press the tongue down with the blade of the laryngoscope and advance the blade towards the epiglottis.</s><s>Note, in this position the epiglottis is often wedged behind the soft palate of the pigs.</s><s>3. Mobilize the epiglottis with the tube, press it down with the blade of the laryngoscope and visualize the vocal cords for intubation.</s><s>4. Advance the tube through the vocal cords while turning the tube upwards and block the cuff as described in detail by Theisen et al.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5</head><p><s>. NOTE: Intubation may also be possible in the supine position, depending on the training of the investigator as well as the standard procedures of a certain institution.</s><s>A large tube diameter supports the surfactant washout due to faster inflow and outflow of the lavage fluid. 5. Check the correct placement of the tube using capnography and auscultation.</s><s>For this, ensure the capnogram is 'normally' shaped and auscultate both lungs for equal breath sounds as done in the clinic.</s><s>NOTE: Mechanically ventilate the pig with chest compressions in case of failed or delayed intubation.</s><s>This requires manual compression of the rib cage from both sides while supplying oxygen with a high flow via a tight fitting face mask.</s><s>1. Maintain anesthesia with continuous i.v.</s><s>infusion of thiopentone (20 mg/kg/h) and fentanyl (7 µg/kg/h).</s><s>NOTE: The necessary dosage may vary from animal to animal.</s><s>Do not leave the animal unattended.</s><s>Ensure a sufficient anesthesia at all times during the experiment for animal welfare and scientific reasons.</s><s>2. Check for absence of corneal reflexes and monitor the animal closely for stress/pain reactions during instrumentation.</s><s>Instrumentation should be possible without administering a muscle relaxant if anesthesia is sufficient.</s><s>Administer pancuronium bromide (0.15 mg/kg BW i.v.</s><s>bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 mg/kgBW/hr) if muscle relaxation is necessary for the experiment (e.g.</s><s>lung compliance measurements).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Instrumentation Techniques</head><p><s>1. Place the animal into the supine position and retract the legs using bandages to stretch the skin above the planned incision sites.</s><s>Sterilize the operating areas using a pre-operative skin disinfectant like an alcohol/1% iodine solution.</s><s>NOTE: We use a wipe down procedure to sterilize the operating area but do not use complete aseptical techniques, since this is a nonsurvival model.</s><s>The level of surgical asepsis depends upon the investigation following the induction of lung injury.</s><s>2. Make a 10 cm incision on the line connecting the mandible and the sternum (left or right side possible) cutting through the skin using a scalpel for placement of the central venous line and the introducer sheath of the pulmonary artery catheter.</s><s>Reassess the depth of anesthesia and increase the dosage if necessary.</s></p><p><s>3. Separate the subcutaneous tissue and the platysma using tissue forceps and surgical scissors.</s><s>Once the brachiocephalic and the sternocephalic muscles are visible perform a blunt cut down procedure separating the fascia between the muscles until the external jugular vein is visible using instruments like forceps or the fingers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Cannulate the external jugular vein with the central venous catheter and the introducer sheath by means of a modified Seldinger technique.</head><p><s>Flush all catheters with normal saline before introducing them.</s><s>1.</s><s>For this, advance the respective needle from the introducer set into the vein until venous blood (dark, not pulsating) can be aspirated.</s><s>Advance the guide wire through the cannula into the vein for about 15 cm.</s><s>Remove the needle and advance the introducer sheath into the vein.</s><s>Remove the guide wire.</s><s>Repeat the same procedure for placement of a central venous catheter if necessary for the experiment.</s></p><p><s>5. Control the correct placement of the catheters by aspiration of venous blood.</s><s>Close with standard sutures.</s><s>NOTE: Do not dilate the vein with a vasodilator as you would in case of a percutaneous approach, because this will tear the vein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>An ultrasound-guided approach is also possible if the investigator is trained in ultrasound-guided cannulization techniques in pigs.</s><s>6. Identify the fold between the gracilis and sartorius muscle of the hind leg (left or right is possible) for placement of the arterial catheter.</s><s>This is the fold where the pulsation of the femoral artery can be palpated.</s><s>7. Make a 5 cm incision along the fold cutting through the skin using a scalpel.</s><s>8. Separate the subcutaneous tissue using tissue forceps and surgical scissors.</s><s>Use a blunt cut down procedure separating the fascia between the muscles to the level of the femoral artery.</s><s>Note, avoid cutting the saphenous vessels by performing the cut down procedure cranial of them.</s><s>9. Cannulate the femoral artery by means of a modified Seldinger technique as described in 3.2.</s><s>A ligature can be looped around the artery and closed in case of bleeding at the site of puncture.</s><s>This step should be avoided, if possible, as it compromises blood flow to the hind leg.</s><s>Close with standard sutures.</s><s>10.</s><s>Connect the arterial catheter and the central venous line to the transducer system and calibrate both against the atmosphere (zero) and either 200 mmHg (arterial line) or 50 mmHg (central venous line) to start monitoring.</s><s>11.</s><s>Place all pressure transducers at the height of the right atrium (in pigs in the supine position about half the height of the thorax).</s><s>12. Perform a small (4-5 cm) incision cutting through the skin above the bladder using a scalpel for catherization of the urinary bladder.</s><s>Again, separate the subcutaneous tissue using blunt instruments.</s><s>13.</s><s>Perform a purse-string suture (1-2 cm in diameter) in the wall of the bladder once it is visualized.</s><s>NOTE: The sutures should not penetrate through all layers of the bladder wall since this would result in the loss of urine through the punctures.</s><s>14.</s><s>Do a minimal incision in the middle of the suture, introduce the urinary catheter, block the balloon with 10 ml of aqua dest, pull the catheter back until a light resistance is felt, and close the purse-string suture around the catheter.</s><s>Close the skin using standard sutures.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Introduction of the Pulmonary Artery Catheter</head><p><s>1. Inject 0.5-1 ml of air into the balloon of the pulmonary artery catheter (depending on the size of the catheter) and check for possible damage of the balloon.</s><s>Deflate the balloon again.</s><s>2. Connect the pulmonary artery catheter to the pressure transducer system and calibrate the PAC against the atmosphere (zero) and 100 mmHg (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2 and 3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>1. Introduce the pulmonary artery catheter through the introducer sheath (deflated balloon) for 10 to 15 cm, depending on the sheath length.</s><s>2. Inflate the balloon (the balloon has to have left the sheath for this) and advance the pulmonary artery catheter further while monitoring the pressure and the typical wave forms on the hemodynamic monitor.</s><s>3. Advance the PAC while the wave forms which are typical for the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery appear and stop advancing when the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) curve appears (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Deflate the balloon.</s><s>NOTE: Once the balloon is deflated the PCWP-waveform must disappear and the pulmonary arterial pressure waveform must be visible.</s><s>Otherwise the catheter is most likely inserted too far into a pulmonary artery resulting in permanent occlusion of the artery (auto wedge position).</s><s>In this case, pull the catheter back until the pulmonary arterial pressure waveform reappears to avoid serious complications (e.g.</s><s>rupture of the blood vessel) 6 .</s><s>4. Make sure the balloon is deflated whenever the catheter is pulled back to avoid serious complications.</s><s>NOTE: Pulmonary artery catheters are often accidentally advanced into liver veins via the inferior caval vein in pigs.</s><s>Thus, pull back the catheter and start all over again, if the right ventricle is not reached after about 30 cm.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Pulmonary Artery Thermodilution Technique and Hemodynamic Measurements</head><p><s>1.

Adherence to this protocol helps to increase the comparability between the findings from different experiments using the same animal model.</s></p><p><s>The induction of lung injury with lavages has several limitations.</s><s>First, repeated lavages result in some of the histopathological properties of human ARDS including the formation of major atelectasis, perivascular edema formation and an increase of the alveolar-capillary membrane thickness.</s><s>Yet, some important features like severe epithelial damage or the formation of hyaline membranes are not found in this model 2,9 .</s></p><p><s>Second, the recruitment effect of high inspiratory pressures and increased PEEP seem to be higher in lavage-induced lung injury in dogs than in lung injury induced by the infusion of oleic acid or intratracheal installation of E. coli (pneumonia model) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Thus, lavage models may be a quick, suitable method to test e.g. the effect of different ventilation regimes, but the investigator has to be careful to avoid any alveolar recruitment whenever it is not desired.</s><s>In our experience, the compromises in lung function and pulmonary vascular resistance remain stable for hours, as long as no accidental recruitment maneuvers are performed.</s><s>But, the animal can deteriorate or even improve depending on the ventilator settings.</s></p><p><s>Third, the inflammatory response to lung injury greatly differs between models and furthermore between species.</s><s>The role of e.g.</s><s>inflammatory mediators like TNFα in pig lavage models are still controversial 9 .</s><s>Fourth, this model requires complex instrumentation and monitoring procedures typically used in critical care medicine.</s><s>In addition, the maintenance of anesthesia in hypoxic large animals exposed to sudden hemodynamic changes is necessary.</s><s>Thus, only experienced investigators trained in large animal research and intensive care medicine should work with this model.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the induction of lung injury with lung lavages may result in a sudden hemodynamic decompensation and ultimately death of the animal.</s><s>Up to 10-15 % of the animals may die during the induction period.</s><s>In our experience this is usually the case, when the MAP decreases below 50 mmHg or the S p O 2 falls below 70% resulting in sudden ischemic heart failure.</s><s>Monitoring mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) during the lavage is also possible to reduce mortality because a rise of MPAP above 50-60 mmHg will result in right ventricular failure and death of the animal.</s><s>In our experience right and left ventricular failure may occur simultaneously during lavages and monitoring hemodynamics during the procedure is essential to reduce mortality.</s><s>We stop an ongoing lavage, drain the lavage fluid, and ventilate the animal whenever we record a decrease in MAP below 50 mmHg.</s><s>Nevertheless, the lavages should be performed in a quick succession to washout a significant amount of</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>6 .</head><label>6</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Start mechanical ventilation, setting the fraction of inspired oxygen (F I O 2 ) to 1, respirator frequency to 15-20/min, tidal volume of 8-9 ml/kg body weight, inspiration to expiration ratio (I:E) of 1:1.5, and apply a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H 2 O.
