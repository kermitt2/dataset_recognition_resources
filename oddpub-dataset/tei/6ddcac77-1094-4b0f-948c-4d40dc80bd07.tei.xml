<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural Brain Correlates of Adolescent Resilience</head><p><s>The construct of resilience-high competence despite a history of high adversity-has captured the attention of clinical and developmental researchers for decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Luthar, 2006)</ref>; both developmental psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cicchetti, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sroufe &amp; Rutter, 1984)</ref> and positive psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000)</ref> perspectives have emphasized the scientific advantages of studying adaptive functioning in individuals as a complement to the study of disease and disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kim-Cohen, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Although complicated by challenges of definition, measurement, and data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Luthar, Cicchetti, &amp; Becker, 2000)</ref>, research on resilience in youth has converged on a number of important findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Luthar, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>First, resilience following significant adversity can be widespread, and is often associated with what has been termed the "ordinary magic" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Masten, 2001)</ref> of strong fundamental adaptive systems such as receiving positive parenting, high cognitive ability, socioeconomic resources, and broad social support.</s><s>Second, in-depth research on resilience depends on assessment of major domains of competence, often conceptualized as developmental tasks that vary in salience by age <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Roisman, Masten, Coatsworth, &amp; Tellegen, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, resilience research has benefited from both variable-centered methodological approaches in which continuous variation of constructs is analyzed, as well as person-centered approaches-the approach taken in the current study-in which participants are classified into a number of categories based on their experienced adversity and demonstrated competence status <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Masten, 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>More recent reviews of the resilience literature have called for attention to the neurobiological and brain-based correlates of resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Charney, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Curtis &amp; Cicchetti, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Following these calls, several investigations have documented both neurobiological (e.g., stress hormone changes; EEG asymmetry) correlates of resilient adaptation in youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cicchetti &amp; Rogosch, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Curtis &amp; Cicchetti, 2007)</ref> as well as interactions between genetic/neurobiological variables and environmental context in predicting resilience <ref type="bibr">(Cicchetti, &amp; Rogosch, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This research demonstrates both the multilevel and thus partly biological embeddedness of the phenomenon of resilience, as well as the complexities of biological/environmental interaction (e.g.</s><s>variations in effects of specific genetic loci depending on environmental context).</s></p><p><s>In terms of brain imaging work on resilience, theorists have focused on the prefrontal cortex (among other brain regions) given its crucial role in planning and coordination of complex behaviors and mediation of emotional responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Curtis &amp; Cicchetti, 2003)</ref>, including adaptive responses to fearful stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Haglund, Nestadt, Cooper, Southwick, &amp; Charney, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>However, empirical work in this area remains sparse, and the direct examination of differences in brain structure or function among high-adversity youth who are classified as "doing well" in major age-salient developmental task domains is absent.</s></p><p><s>In adults, structural and functional imaging work in this area has often focused on studies of individuals who do or do not meet criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following a traumatic event, although more sophisticated sampling and design procedures are beginning to appear (see <ref type="bibr">van der Weff, Pannekoek, Stein, &amp; van der Wee, 2013, for related discussion)</ref>.</s><s>It is important to stress that these studies differ from youth resilience research in multiple ways, notably in the focus on a single traumatic event rather than broad measures of adversity as well as a focus on PTSD symptoms as an outcome rather than broad measures of competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bonanno &amp; Diminich, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, such adult-based studies remain of interest given the lack of youth-focused imaging studies, with functional and structural imaging approaches seen as complementary and of importance.</s></p><p><s>As brief examples of functional imaging studies, police officers who did not show PTSD symptoms following exposure to a shooting showed increased medial prefrontal cortex activity (and decreased left amygdala activity) during fMRI scanning while exposed to event cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Peres et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Special Forces personnel free from PTSD diagnoses despite exposure to traumatic events have shown differing fMRI activity in the subgenual prefrontal cortex (PFC) relative to age and sex matched civilian controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Vythilingam et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Reynaud et al. (2013)</ref> reported functional activation of right amygdala and left orbitofrontal regions in firefighters who score high on a scale of trait hardiness, a construct related to resilience.</s><s>Finally, van der Werff et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) reported unique resting state functional connectivity profiles for adults who experienced childhood maltreatment but who did not go on to meet criteria for any DSM-IV axis I disorder.</s><s>As noted above, we are not aware of youth fMRI studies of broad resilience, although some have investigated youth at risk for specific disorder categories (e.g., via family history): in particular, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Heitzeg, Nigg, Yau, Zubieta, and Zucker (2008)</ref> demonstrated increased activation of the bilateral orbital frontal gyrus (OFG) and left insula/putamen in adolescent children of alcoholics with low levels of problem drinking.</s></p><p><s>Few investigations have focused on structural brain correlates of resilient adaptation.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gilbertson et al.
