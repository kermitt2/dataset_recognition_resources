HPS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>However, despite the unambiguous presence of a significant platelet degranulation defect, the clinical bleeding tendency is also moderate and nonspontaneous in some other forms of HPS, and its manifestation depends on the physical insult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>Unfortunately, because we were not able to analyze platelet function in our patient ex vivo, it is unclear whether dense granule deficiency is associated with this disorder.</s><s>We speculate that the patient had a platelet granule defect that was overlooked because it was a minor part of the clinical phenotype.</s><s>The most striking difference with HPS2 was the neurologic phenotype that included significant neurodevelopmental delay, severe epilepsy, and a hearing disorder.</s><s>Only mild neurodevelopmental delay was reported in 1 HPS2 patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>eurologic involvement ranging from mild sensory deficits to mental retardation is more prominent in CHS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Second, the phenotype of our patient showed striking similarities to the mocha mouse strain, a naturally occurring mouse mutant with a null mutation in the Ap3d1 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>These mice have oculocutaneous albinism and reduced coat pigmentation and, importantly, they show a functional platelet defect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> similar to AP3b3A-deficient pearl mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>To the best of our knowledge, neither the skeletal phenotype nor investigations on neutrophil counts or lymphocyte degranulation in mocha mice have been published.</s><s>Thus, the phenotypic overlap of human and murine deficiency in the AP3b3A or AP3d subunits of the AP3 complex remains incompletely defined.</s><s>Most relevant, however, is that mocha mice show a distinct cortical excitability phenotype with brief epileptic discharges as well as balance problems resulting from otolith defects and eventual deafness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>These features specifically mirror the severe neurologic phenotype observed in our patient.</s><s>The analogy to the mouse model suggests that both epilepsy and deafness in our patient were causally related to the AP3d deficiency.</s><s>It should be noted that the initially described strain of mocha mice also carried grizzled (gr) and retinal degeneration 1 (Pde6b rd1 ) alleles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>However, the neurologic phenotype and severe hearing loss are also observed in other Ap3d1 mutant strains that do not carry these additional mutations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>hird, we show that the identified mutation significantly reduces expression levels of the AP3d protein.</s><s>Apparently this has severe consequences for the stability of the AP3 complex because the other subunits (AP3b3A, AP3s, and AP3m) were also decreased in protein expression.</s><s>This is in line with observations in mocha mice, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> in which analysis of brain extracts revealed that the complete absence of AP3d expression was associated with degradation of all other subunits.</s><s>Notably, the physiology of the heterotetrameric AP3 complex offers an explanation for the severe neurologic manifestations in Ap3d1 but not in Ap3b1 deficiency.</s><s>The d subunit is central to both the neuronal and the ubiquitous forms of AP3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), and therefore its absence cannot be compensated.</s><s>In contrast, the absence of b3A can be largely compensated in neurons but not in other tissues because of the expression of another isoform (AP3B2).</s><s>The pathophysiological link from neuronal AP3 deficiency to the severe neurologic phenotype remains to be explored.</s><s>On the basis of the observation of an interaction between the neuronal AP3 complex and a zinc transporter (ZnT3) in the brain, it was previously postulated that the absence of AP3 may lead to missorting of ZnT3 and result in zinc deficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s>In addition, in the absence of AP3, various synaptic vesicle membrane proteins are mistargeted, including synaptic vesicle chloride channel 3 (ClC-3), <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> PI4KIIa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), <ref

relevant for the development of the epilepsy.</s></p><p><s>Fourth, introduction of the wild-type AP3D1 gene into CD8 1 T cells restored the stability of the whole AP3 complex.</s><s>Although all subunits were highly reduced in unmanipulated patient cells, all of them were detected in normal levels after retroviral reconstitution with the wild-type AP3D1 gene, revealing that the patient mutation of AP3D1 was indeed responsible for the instability of the AP3 complex.</s><s>Importantly, the genetic correction also led to a functional reconstitution of the granule exocytosis defect in cytotoxic lymphocytes, proving that AP3D1 deficiency is responsible for this phenotype.</s><s>Overall, the impaired degranulation response of lymphocytes in our patient was similar to that of patients with HPS2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>It was most evident in fresh NK cells, in which the response was very low and was indistinguishable from that of patients with familial HLH, GS2, or CHS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref></s><s>However, in contrast to these conditions and similar to our observations in HPS2, the response of PHA/IL-2-stimulated cytotoxic T lymphocytes was less markedly impaired.</s><s>This could possibly be the result of an effect of IL-2 on the indirect vesicular transport pathway, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> which is independent of the AP3 complex and has a recycling function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>lthough these arguments provide a plausible link from AP3d deficiency to all aspects of the patient phenotype, a contribution of other homozygous alleles (supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) cannot be formally excluded.</s><s>The description of further patients will help to resolve this issue.</s><s>Based on the preliminary definition of this complex phenotype in a single patient, what are the clinical implications of a diagnosis of AP3d deficiency?</s><s>AP3d deficiency appears to be mainly a neurologic disorder.</s><s>In our patient as well as in mocha mice, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> the severe epilepsy associated with a significant neurodevelopmental delay dominated the clinical picture.</s><s>However, the immune-hematologic aspects of the disease are probably of similar importance and can be life limiting.</s><s>The resulting infection susceptibility is at least in part favored by a defect in neutrophil development and, as in HPS2, probably also by functional defects in other immune cell populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s>This includes an impaired degranulation and cytotoxicity of lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> and could also imply impaired dendritic cell function, as demonstrated in a mouse model of HPS2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref></s><s>We previously showed that HPS2 patients carry a small but relevant risk of developing HLH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Asymptomatic seroconversion to Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus in our patient indicates that this risk is also limited in AP3d deficiency.</s><s>However, we interpret the persistent hepatosplenomegaly and recurrent fevers in our patient as subclinical HLH-associated manifestations.</s><s>In the context of the poor neurologic prognosis, the hematologic manifestations may not justify hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but monitoring neutropenia and hepatosplenomegaly should be part of the clinical management of affected patients.</s><s>Monitoring should also include evaluation for chronic lung disease because the interstitial lung disease can determine long-term prognosis in some HPS variants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>n summary, AP3d deficiency further adds to the growing spectrum of human genetic disorders of biogenesis and trafficking of lysosome-related organelles and illuminates the importance of the cell type-specific synthesis of AP-complex subunits.</s><s>Although we could not analyze the characteristic storage pool deficiency of HPS in our patient, we suggest classifying AP3d deficiency as a novel type of HPS.</s><s>From a clinical point of view, bleeding seems to be a minor aspect of the disease (as in HPS2), but the AP3-related pathophysiology favors classification as HPS rather than as a new congenital neurodevelopmental disease, a new variant of congenital neutropenia, or a novel primary immunodeficiency.</s><s>Hence, we suggest giving the disorder the acronym HPS10, but this has to be confirmed by an appropriate taxonomy committee.</s></p></div><figure
