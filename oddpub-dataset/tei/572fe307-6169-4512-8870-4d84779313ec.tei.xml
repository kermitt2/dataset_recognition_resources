<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective Although the majority of cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are now diagnosed through newborn screening, there is still a need to standardize the diagnostic criteria for those diagnosed outside of the neonatal period.</s><s>This is because newborn screening started relatively recently, it is not performed everywhere, and even for individuals who were screened, there is the possibility of a false negative.</s><s>To limit irreversible organ pathology, a timely diagnosis of CF and institution of CF therapies can greatly benefit these patients.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>Experts on CF diagnosis were convened at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference.</s><s>The participants reviewed and discussed published works and instructive cases of CF diagnosis in individuals presenting with signs, symptoms, or a family history of CF.</s><s>Through a modified Delphi methodology, several consensus statements were agreed upon.</s><s>These consensus statements were updates of prior CF diagnosis conferences and recommendations.</s></p><p><s>Results CF diagnosis in individuals outside of newborn screening relies on the clinical evidence and on evidence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction.</s><s>Clinical evidence can include typical organ pathologies seen in CF such as bronchiectasis or pancreatic insufficiency but often represent a broad range of severity including mild cases.</s><s>CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests.</s><s>On the basis of the large number of patients with bona fide CF currently followed in registries with sweat chloride levels between 30 and 40 mmol/L, the threshold considered "intermediate" was lowered from 40 mmol/L in the prior diagnostic guidelines to 30 mmol/L.</s><s>The CF diagnosis was also discussed in the context of CFTR-related disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may be present, but the individual does not meet criteria for CF.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions CF diagnosis remains a rare but important condition that can be diagnosed when characteristic clinical features are seen in an individual with demonstrated CFTR dysfunction.</s><s>(J Pediatr 2017;181S:S52-7).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Steps to Establish CF Diagnosis</head><p><s>When the diagnosis of CF is being considered outside of the NBS context, the presenting signs and symptoms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>) play an important role in defining likelihood of CF.</s><s>An individual with multiple typical-organ system manifestations of CF (bronchiectasis, sinus polyps, and pancreatic insufficiency) has a higher probability of having CFTR dysfunction as the explanation of their phenotype compared with someone with only atypical manifestations of CF (eg, isolated symptoms such as chronic cough or sputum production without bronchiectasis, recurrent pancreatitis) that may have alternative explanations.</s><s>Therefore, diagnosis of CF can be heavily influenced by the pretest probability or how well the phenotype is consistent with CF as we understand it now.</s></p><p><s>Coincident with the consideration of presenting signs and symptoms for CF, the clinician must also compare these with The diagnosis of CFTR-related disorder has been defined as a monosymptomatic clinical entity (CBAVD/pancreatitis/bronchiectasis) associated with CFTR dysfunction that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for CF.</s></p><p><s>This draws on the international effort to characterize this clinical scenario.</s><s>See "Alternative Diagnoses" section.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>27</head><p><s>Clinicians should avoid the use of terms like classic/nonclassic CF, typical/atypical CF, delayed CF because these terms have no harmonized definition and could be confusing for families or caregivers.</s></p><p><s>The European CF Society Diagnostic Network Working Group has maintained a nonclassic or atypical CF label. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>See "Alternative Diagnoses" section for discussion.</s><s>Informed with a pretest probability that compares the likelihood of CF vs an alternative explanation, the clinician will interpret genetic analysis and tests for CFTR function (sweat chloride testing, nasal potential difference [NPD], or intestinal current measurement [ICM]) to support or refute a CF diagnosis.</s><s>Often, when a patient is referred for CF evaluation, some of these tests may have already been performed.</s><s>A clinician would best interpret these tests in the context of a reasoned pretest probability.</s><s>The tests of CFTR function may point in a clear single direction (eg, if the sweat chloride is &gt;60 mmol/L and 2 CF-causing CFTR mutations are found, vs an alternative scenario of only 1 mutation found, and the sweat chloride and NPD are normal).</s><s>Challenges arise if those CFTR tests do not provide a definitive answer.</s><s>Examples of this could include an intermediate sweat chloride level (30-59 mmol/ L), the detection of at least 1 CFTR mutation of varying or uncertain clinical consequence, or NPD/ICM that cannot be interpreted as positive or negative.</s><s>In these circumstances, the clinician may refer to their pretest probability.</s><s>It is important to note that diagnostic challenges should not delay potentially beneficial treatments.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change in Sweat Chloride Range Definitions</head><p><s>A major change that resulted from the 2015 Diagnosis Consensus Conference was the adoption of a lower sweat chloride level as the upper limit of normal.</s><s>The 2008 diagnosis consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> recommended the use of ≥60 mmol/L chloride in the sweat as diagnostic of CF, with levels from 30 to 59 mmol/L as intermediate sweat chloride values in infants under 6 months of age, or 40-59 mmol/L in individuals over 6 months of age.</s><s>After reviewing evidence accumulated in the interim (eg, Augarten et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Highsmith et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref>  The basis for a sweat chloride level of &lt;60 mmol/L in individuals who are diagnosed with CF because of a preponderance of clinical symptoms can be attributed in large part to the occurrence of CFTR mutations that do not result in a total loss of chloride channel activity.</s><s>The Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) was established to determine the clinical and functional impact of various CFTR mutations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Phenotype and genotype information are collected from patient registries, and disease-liability of each CFTR mutation is evaluated through a combination of in vivo (sweat chloride) and in vitro data (functional activity identified in cell-based systems).</s><s>The CFTR mutations are sorted into 4 categories: (1) CF-causing (defined as resulting in CF when 2 copies are present in an individual); (2) a mutation of varying clinical consequence (defined as a mutation that, in combination with a CF-causing mutation or another mutation of varying clinical consequence may result in CF); (3) a mutation of unknown clinical consequence (defined as one that has not been evaluated by CFTR2); and (4) a mutation that is non-CF-causing (defined as not causing CF when present).</s><s>Thus, consulting the CFTR2 database to determine the disease liability categories represented by an individual genotype may offer better insight into the questionable cases.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">III</ref> provides an example of the clinical data accumulated in CFTR2, and shows the clinical characteristics of patients in CFTR2 with a diagnosis of CF, but who have a sweat chloride of &lt;60 mmol/L.</s><s>In general, these patients with intermediate sweat chloride concentrations have been diagnosed at an older age and have milder manifestations of disease.</s><s>These data show some of the clinical manifestations likely in individuals with CF who are homozygous for c.1521_1523delCTT (legacy: F508del), the most common CF-causing mutation, but who have a nondiagnostic sweat chloride.</s><s>It was on the basis of the 746 individuals with CF in CFTR2 with a sweat chloride between 30 and 40 mmol/L that the consensus committee supported a change of the lower limit of the "intermediate" range to 30 mmol/L from 40 mmol/L.</s><s>A consequence of this is that individuals presenting with symptoms of CF and a sweat chloride level between 30 and 40 mmol/L who were previously considered unlikely</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cases in Which a CF Diagnosis Cannot be Resolved</head><p><s>It would be useful to place CFTR-related disorders and complex traits in which CFTR may be playing a role, into an algorithm for CF diagnosis.</s><s>In cases in which there is a clinical suspicion for CF, but sweat chloride testing, CFTR mutation analysis, and physiologic testing cannot rule in or rule out CF, the clinician is left with a decision.</s><s>Ultimately in these cases, if the physician believes CF therapies or CF follow-up would benefit the patient, that should outweigh equivocal, nondiagnostic, test results.</s></p><p><s>The goal must be to achieve optimal treatment, especially of lung disease, rather than to engage in an ongoing debate about the best diagnostic label.</s><s>The European CF Society Diagnostic Network Working Group has advocated for the use of the term "atypical" CF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Although these cases may not follow the "typical" path of CF, patients who do not display 2 CF-causing mutations or do not have diagnostic sweat chloride test results can still have severe, life-limiting respiratory disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>In fact, there are no CFTR mutations that can be exclusively characterized as "atypical" mutations (although some mutations may trigger more risk than others <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> ).</s><s>Thus, the diagnosis consensus committee has agreed (not universally) to recommend against the use of the terms atypical or borderline CF.</s><s>Most, although not all, of the committee has concluded that if a CF clinician feels CF therapies and follow-up would benefit the individual and other potential diagnoses are ruled out, the CF diagnosis is appropriate.</s><s>This certainly is influenced by the third-party payers in the US that may be more likely to cover expensive care if a CF diagnosis is used.</s><s>Regardless, in individuals diagnosed with CF as an adult or with milder presentations, appropriate counseling should include that the life expectancy estimates derived from mostly patients with CF diagnosed early in life are less applicable in their situation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inconclusive Result after CF NBS</head><p><s>It is important to note that the uncertain diagnostic category that can result from positive newborn screens that do not meet criteria for CF (ie, CF-related metabolic disorder/CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis) does not apply to anyone presenting with CF-like symptoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>However, individuals identified in NBS that do not have CF frequently have mutations that are seen more commonly in individuals with CFTRrelated disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>Some of these individuals identified in NBS may go on to develop a CFTR-related disorder later in life.</s><s>Future study of the likelihood of developing these conditions is needed, but this will require long-term follow-up.</s><s>In the meantime, counseling parents of CFTR-related metabolic syndrome/CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis infants about this possibility is an important component of NBS programs.</s><s>Clinicians considering CF in a nonscreened setting should ask questions about NBS history.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Special Considerations Regarding Adult Diagnosis</head><p><s>In the period from 1995 to 2005, there were 9766 new CF diagnoses, of which 811 (8.3%) were in adults, with a mean age of 34 years at the time of diagnosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s>Some examples of adult diagnoses can be found in the case studies shown in the Appendix (available at www.jpeds.com).</s><s>Most adults (70.6%) present with commonly described respiratory symptoms, such as Pseudomonas lung infections and reduced lung function.</s><s>Despite the delayed appearance of symptoms, the causes of death do not differ significantly from those experienced by patients diagnosed in childhood, with the vast majority of both caused by respiratory failure (87% following childhood diagnosis, 85% following adult diagnosis). <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>The importance of recognizing these later presentations of CF is that there is tremendous opportunity to intervene in progressive lung disease.</s><s>Unlike asymptomatic babies who are diagnosed through NBS, these patients (or their parents) are actively seeking a diagnosis to facilitate treatment.</s><s>A CF diagnosis often comes as a relief in these individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref></s><s>Beyond this, establishing the diagnosis is critical to help these individuals access the specialized care, genetic counseling, and drugs they need.</s><s>Without a CF diagnosis, there may be challenges getting insurance to pay for necessary therapies.</s><s>The "diagnostic odyssey" is prolonged, and further unnecessary testing and uncertainty will ensue.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Given the multitude of different organ systems that can be involved in CF, establishing a diagnosis in an individual presenting with symptoms does not lend itself well to protocols or algorithms, such as those used in newborn screening.</s><s>The central tenant that an individual with a clinical scenario (symptoms, signs, and/or family history) and evidence of CFTR dysfunction (sweat test, CFTR genotype, CFTR physiologic testing with NPD or ICM) has CF is true regardless of the situation, but in nonscreened individuals, the diagnosis demands different clinician recognition and judgment.</s><s>NBS has been a tremendous improvement in CF detection, but it will never eliminate the need to consider CF as a clinical diagnosis in individuals who were not screened or who were not identified.</s><s>CF was recognized as a clinical entity before the genetic cause was determined.</s><s>However, as the range of genetic variations identified in CFTR has expanded, so too must our understanding of the clinical entity.</s><s>The clinician must now look beyond traditional presentations to consider milder cases of CF and situations in which CFTR dysfunction is playing a role in lung, gastrointestinal, or reproductive tract disorders.</s><s>It is the goal of the CF community to refine these diagnostic criteria in a way that gets CF care and therapeutic advances to those that would benefit the most from them, but also to inform the clinician to help all those in whom the disease should be considered.</s><s>■ Author Disclosures P.S. receives grant funding from the CF Foundation.</s><s>T.W. is an employee of the CF Foundation.</s><s>P.F.</s><s>receives honoraria from the CF Foundation as National Facilitator for NBS Quality Improvement.</s><s>K.dB receives funding from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Ablynx, Aptalis, Galapagos, Gilead, Pharmaxis, and PTC Therapeutics.</s><s>The other authors declare no conflicts of interest.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Table I . 2015 CF Foundation diagnosis consensus conference recommendations related to diagnosis of CF in nonscreened populations*</head><label>I</label><figDesc></figDesc><table><row><cell>Statement</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>numbers*</cell><cell>Consensus statements</cell><cell>Comments</cell></row><row><cell>25</cell><cell>For individuals presenting with CF symptoms, the same diagnostic</cell><cell>This represents a change in the cut-offs for sweat chloride testing.
