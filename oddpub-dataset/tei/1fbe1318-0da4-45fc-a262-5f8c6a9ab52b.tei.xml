<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Osteopontin is a pleiotropic cytokine that is involved in several diseases including multiple sclerosis.</s><s>Secreted osteopontin is cleaved by few known proteases, modulating its pro-inflammatory activities.</s></p><p><s>Here we show by in vitro experiments that secreted osteopontin can be processed by extracellular proteasomes, thereby producing fragments with novel chemotactic activity.</s><s>Furthermore, osteopontin reduces the release of proteasomes in the extracellular space.</s><s>The latter phenomenon seems to occur in vivo in multiple sclerosis, where it reflects the remission/relapse alternation.</s><s>The extracellular proteasome-mediated inflammatory pathway may represent a general mechanism to control inflammation in inflammatory diseases.</s></p><p><s>Osteopontin (OPN), a component of bone matrix and a soluble pleiotropic cytokine, plays a pivotal role in several diseases such as tumors, myocardial and kidney dysfunctions, and autoimmune diseases.</s><s>OPN has a particular relevance in multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease in which the autoimmune response targets the myelin sheaths of the central nervous system (CNS) 1 .</s><s>Indeed, in MS secreted OPN stimulates the expression of Th1 and Th17 cytokines, inhibits apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, and regulates leukocyte adhesion, migration, and trafficking into the CNS by binding to CD44 and various integrins 2 .</s></p></div>
