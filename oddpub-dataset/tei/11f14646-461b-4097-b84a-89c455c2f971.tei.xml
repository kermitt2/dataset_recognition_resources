innovative applications in biology and medicine, have motivated theoretical modeling and experimental measurement of the dynamic response of magnetic nanoparticles in suspension.</s><s>These emerging application areas have also catalyzed the development of new actuation and sensing equipment for the characterization of magnetic nanoparticle suspensions.</s><s>The dynamic response of magnetic nanoparticles depends on their properties, the environment in which they are suspended, and the applied magnetic field.</s><s>Current research is focused on understanding and optimizing these variables for biomedical imaging, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications.</s><s>magnetic field.</s><s>AC susceptometers probe the linear response of a magnetic suspension at low applied field amplitude in frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Nikolo 1995</ref><ref type="bibr">, Fannin 2003)</ref>, with commercial systems being available (e.g.</s><s>Dynomag, Acreo).</s><s>Magnetic particle spectrometers (MPS) probe the nonlinear behavior of the suspension by applying larger magnetic field amplitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Weaver et al 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">, Biederer et al 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">, Garraud et al 2017)</ref>.</s><s>In magnetic particle relaxometers (MPR), as presented in this paper, a bias field offsets the time-varying excitation field, and the suspension behavior is probed asymmetrically <ref type="bibr">(Goodwill et al 2011</ref><ref type="bibr">, Tay et al 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The MPR described herein was primarily developed to assess the performance of magnetic tracer suspensions being developed for magnetic particle imaging (MPI) by emulating the dynamic magnetic fields created by a scanning MPI system (Gleich and <ref type="bibr">Weizenecker 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">, Goodwill et al 2012)</ref>.</s><s>MPI is a promising biomedical imaging technique that addresses drawbacks of nuclear imaging by using non-radioactive magnetic nanoparticle tracers, with theoretically higher resolution and faster scan times.</s><s>MPI functions by magnetically stimulating the nanoparticles and then probing their dynamic magnetization response.</s><s>Spatial selectivity is achieved by creating, via a non-uniform field, a "field free point" (FFP) that is scanned in three-dimensional space over the field of view (FOV).</s><s>MPI has application in real-time cardiovascular imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Weizenecker et al 2009)</ref>, probing blood clot formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Murase et al 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">, Khurshid et al 2017)</ref> and stem cell tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Zheng et al 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">, Tay et al 2016)</ref>, as well as therapeutic applications such as magnetic hyperthermia (Dhavalikar and Rinaldi 2016, Hensley et al 2017, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Murase et al 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Tay et al 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The MPR is a more compact, cheaper, and faster alternative to assess tracer performance, compared to using a full MPI system.</s><s>The MPR design allows for a large range of magnetic fields (amplitudes, offsets, frequencies, and excitation waveforms) and the system has high sensitivity for measuring the response of small volumes of nanoparticles in suspension.</s><s>Furthermore, since the entire suspension volume is subjected to a spatially uniform magnetic field, the MPR facilitates detailed analysis of the particle response at different bias field amplitudes along the magnetization curve.</s><s>In contrast, the full MPI system measures the superposition of all particles within the FOV, i.e. the cumulative response of particles that range from fully saturated (outside the FFP) to unsaturated (fully within the FFP).</s><s>Consequently, obtaining the intrinsic behavior of the tracers using a MPR can be beneficial to interpret MPI signals.</s></p><p><s>The tracer performance for MPI application can also arguably be assessed by instruments with no bias field capability, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tomitaka et al (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bauer et al (2016)</ref>.</s><s>The first drawback of using an instrument with no bias field is the difficulty to design a system applying excitation magnetic fields that are high enough to saturate the particles at high frequency.</s><s>For example, the system designed by Bauer et al (2016) applies a moderate field of 20 mT, arguably too small to effectively saturate small particles like ferucarbotran.</s><s>In comparison, the maximum field applied by a MPR with a bias field is the sum of the excitation field amplitude and the bias field, and can easily exceed 100 mT, which is high enough to saturate 5-nm magnetic particles.</s><s>The second drawback of not using a bias field is that the nanoparticles are not subjected to a magnetic field representative of the field in a MPI scanner (high ac magnetic field compared to a smaller biased ac field).</s><s>This difference can cause discrepancies in the suspension dynamic response, especially for relaxing particles with a non-negligible lag between the magnetization and the excitation field, undermining the accurate emulation of the behavior of these particles in a MPI.</s></p><p><s>Other than MPI-based applications, an MPR could be used to measure changes in the magnetic nanoparticle's local environment, for example in changes in fluid viscosity as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Utkur et al (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rauwerdink and Weaver (2010)</ref>, changes in temperature as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Perreard et al (2014)</ref>, adsorption of disease specific biomarkers as in <ref type="bibr">Gandhi et al (2016)</ref>, or changes in particle-particle interaction (colloidal stability, particle aggregation state), as has been done with MPS.</s><s>In these applications, changes in the particle's environment induce a change in their relaxation time.</s><s>Another method used to assess relaxation effects on magnetic nanoparticle suspension is called magnetorelaxometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Matz et al 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, KÃ¶titz et al 1999)</ref>.</s><s>In this method, the magnetic particles are oriented by a pulse of magnetic field and their relaxation time is characterized by recording the change of magnetization in time.</s><s>This method is well suited to determine the magnetic or the hydrodynamic diameters of the particles, or the conditions of the medium surrounding the particle (e.g., viscosity).</s><s>However, this method is limited to the characterization of relaxation times higher than 0.1 ms due to instrumentation limitations, limiting the minimum particle size that can be assessed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(KÃ¶titz et al 1999)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The MPR reported here features measurements of full time-series data and a unique method to attenuate the feed-through from the excitation signal, which otherwise would limit the measurement range of the DAQ and the sensitivity of the instrument.</s><s>One method, used by Biederer et al ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) for example, is to filter out the fundamental of the signal and analyze its other harmonics.</s><s>However, in order to fully characterize the dynamic behavior of the magnetic nanoparticles, it is crucial to measure the first harmonic by eliminating the feedthrough.</s><s>Additionally, the equipment is calibrated to obtain the instantaneous suspension magnetic moment per weight per magnetic field in 1/(mg Fe /mL) (i.e. in (emu/ g Fe )/(A/m)) from the induced voltage.</s><s>Consequently, the measured signal depends only on the magnetic suspension response and not the instrument, which allows instrument and postprocessing algorithms comparison across different research groups.</s><s>Furthermore, the proposed postprocessing allows one to retrieve the tracer response and estimate the performance of the magnetic suspension quickly.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">MPR explained</head><p><s>An MPI system detects the local response of nanoparticles excited by an alternating magnetic field (typically ~25 kHz sinusoid) (Gleich and Weizenecker 2005).</s><s>The system is composed of three magnetic sources: the excitation field (time-varying field for particle excitation), the gradient field (established by permanent magnets as in <ref type="bibr">Goodwill et al (2012)</ref> or a set of coils as in Franke et al ( <ref type="formula">2016</ref>)), and the bias fields (electronically controllable field offsets for scanning the FFP) <ref type="bibr">(Goodwill et al 2012)</ref>.</s><s>A pick-up coil system is commonly used to measure the magnetic response within the FOV.</s><s>Due to the excitation field variation, the nanoparticle magnetic moments rotate, inducing a measurable signal in a pick-up coil by induction.</s><s>The MPI spatial resolution relies on using a high magnetic field gradient source to saturate most particles in the FOV.</s><s>The signal measured in the pick-up coil is predominantly from the nanoparticles located at the FFP, since their magnetic moments rotate in response to the excitation field, while all of the particles outside of the FFP are saturated, and thus do not change in magnetization direction.</s><s>By scanning the FFP over a region of space with the bias coils, an image of the magnetic particle density can be obtained <ref type="bibr">(Goodwill et al 2012a)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The MPR emulates the fields of an MPI system, but without any spatial scanning capability.</s></p><p><s>The MPR subjects the sample to an ac excitation field H exc = H exc 0 sin 2Ï f 0 t and a slowramping bias field H bias (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>The bias field emulates the scanning of a virtual FFP through the sample, as if the sample were in an MPI system.</s><s>At large negative bias field, the particles are saturated due to the virtual FFP being away from the particles and respond weakly to the ac field.</s><s>As the bias field ramps up, the virtual FFP approaches the particles.</s><s>At zero bias field, one could imagine the sample to be located at the center of the virtual FFP and thus produce the largest signal.</s><s>At high positive bias field, the particles are again saturated due to the movement of the virtual FFP further away from the particles, resulting in a small signal.</s></p><p><s>While varying the bias field with time, the FFP position depends on both the bias and excitation fields, as depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>.</s><s>While unnoticeable for very low excitation field amplitudes, for higher excitation fields, the FFP position change must be accounted for in the signal post-processing.</s><s>Indeed, the position of the FFP moves during one cycle of the excitation field, making the FFP position dependent on the total applied field amplitude (excitation and bias) instead of solely the bias field amplitude (Goodwill and Conolly 2010, Goodwill et al 2012).</s></p><p><s>The MPR infers the response strength and the resolution that magnetic tracers would exhibit in a MPI scanner.</s><s>The actual resolution of the MPI image is highly impacted by how fast the particles saturate as a function of applied field amplitude and by how fast they respond in time to a change of magnetic field.</s><s>The particle response time, called relaxation time, depends on which relaxation mechanism (Brownian or NÃ©el) governs the particle rotational dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Rosensweig 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">, Dhavalikar et al 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">2016a)</ref>.</s><s>In Brownian relaxation, the magnetic moment is blocked within the particle, and their rotation is hindered by hydrodynamic drag due to the surrounding medium.</s><s>In NÃ©el relaxation, the magnetic moment rotates within the particle with characteristic time that depends on thermal energy and crystalline anisotropy.</s><s>In practice, the relaxation time is a combination of these two mechanisms and the faster of the two dominates.</s><s>A finite relaxation time causes a delay between the excitation and the particle response, causing a blur in MPI images and lowering MPI resolution.</s></p></div>
