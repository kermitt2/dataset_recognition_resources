<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>All skin sensation starts with the transformation of a physical stimulus into an electrical signal called a receptor potential.</s><s>The receptor potential is encoded as action potentials (AP), which convey information to the brain to initiate perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Currently pharmacological agents that modulate the first step in the transformation of light touch stimuli into an electrical signal, a process called sensory mechanotransduction, are not available.</s><s>The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo2 and its modulator STOML3 <ref type="bibr">2</ref> have both been shown to be necessary for mechanoreceptors to transduce light touch <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> .</s><s>Paradoxically, under pathophysiological conditions, intense pain can also be triggered by light touch <ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> , for example after traumatic nerve injury <ref type="bibr">9</ref> .</s><s>Nerve injury induced touch-evoked pain was found to be largely absent in Stoml3 -/mutant mice <ref type="bibr">6</ref> .</s><s>STOML3 is an endogenous regulator of the sensitivity of mechanosensitive ion channels like Piezo in sensory neurons and STOML3 self-association appears to be necessary for this function <ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, Piezo2 has an essential role in human proprioception and touch sensation <ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> .</s><s>Therefore we set out to discover and test whether small molecules that can disrupt STOML3 self-association can be used to modulate touch under normal and pathophysiological conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of small molecule STOML3 inhibitors</head><p><s>In mammals STOML3 belongs to a family of five structurally conserved membrane proteins, including Stomatin, STOML1, STOML2, and Podocin 10, <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> , all of which self-associate via their stomatin-domain (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1a</ref>) <ref type="bibr">10</ref> .</s><s>Self-association of stomatin-domain proteins can be monitored in HEK293 cells using Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) whereby N-and C-terminal halves of the YFP molecule are tagged to the prey and bait protein STOML3 <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">19</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>Irreversible association of the YFP fragments produces fluorescence that increases linearly over time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1 b</ref>).</s><s>Mutations in one STOML3 pair that disrupt oligomerization (V190P or LR89,90EE) significantly reduce the rate of signal development (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>) <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> .</s><s>We used this cellular assay in a high throughput format to screen for small molecules that significantly inhibit the BiFC signal, a measure of STOML3 self-association.</s><s>In a primary screen of about 35000 small molecules (each at 20 µM), obtained from the central compound collection of the Leibniz Institute for Molecular Pharmacology screening unit (www.chembionet.info),</s><s>21 molecules were found to reproducibly decrease STOML3 self-association based on the slope of YFP signal development.</s><s>Of these 21 molecules 19 did not pass stringent control tests (see Materials and Methods).</s><s>The two remaining inhibitory compounds were designated Oligomerization Blocker 1 and 2, (OB-1 and OB-2) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d,e</ref>).</s><s>In further BiFC assays, the STOML3 oligomerization blocker, OB-1 was an effective inhibitor of the self-association of Stomatin, STOML1, STOML2, but not Podocin (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>Lower OB-1 concentrations (2 µM) also inhibited the BiFC signal (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>).</s><s>The OB-1 molecule was also re-synthesized in house and exhibited the same activity in the BiFC assay as the commercially available sample.</s><s>The human STOML3 peptide sequence is 92% identical to that of the mouse and 100% identical in the core stomatin-domain and human STOML3 also showed self-association (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>).</s><s>More importantly for potential future clinical development self-association of the human STOML3 protein was also inhibited by OB-1 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1f</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STOML3 oligomerization dictates domain size in the plasma membrane</head><p><s>We next asked if OB-1 and OB-2 modulation of STOML3 oligomerization state influences clustering of the protein in the plasma membrane.</s><s>We used super-resolution dSTORM microscopy <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to visualize FLAG-tagged STOML3 at the plasma membrane of transfected N2a cells.</s><s>Using dSTORM we could show that STOML3 was present in microdomains at the plasma membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1g</ref>).</s><s>The size of the STOML3 clusters was variable (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 24.6 ± 2.8 nm, mean ± sem, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1h</ref>.) but these domains may contain more than one STOML3 dimer <ref type="bibr">10</ref> .</s><s>Introduction of the V190P mutation disrupts oligomerization of STOML3 and abolishes its ability to modulate the mechanosensitivity of Piezo1 channels <ref type="bibr">2</ref> .</s><s>This STOML3 variant exhibited significantly smaller clusters in the plasma membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1g,h</ref>), demonstrating that by disrupting STOML3 oligomerization we can manipulate and measure nanoscale changes in STOML3 cluster size.</s><s>Pre-incubation of N2a cells expressing STOML3-FLAG with OB-1 or OB-2 for three hours led to significantly reduced STOML3-FLAG cluster sizes compared to vehicle treated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1g,h</ref>).</s><s>The effects of OB-1 did not produce changes in Stoml3 mRNA levels in these cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>).</s><s>Thus we obtained independent support for the notion that OB-1 and OB-2 reduce STOML3 oligomerization state, an important consequence of which is a reduced STOML3 cluster size at the plasma membrane.</s></p></div>
