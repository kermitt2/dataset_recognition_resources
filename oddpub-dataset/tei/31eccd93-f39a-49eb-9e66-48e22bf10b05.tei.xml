<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) are being researched as a promising intervention strategy also in autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D).</s><s>T1D is a T-cell-mediated, organ-specific disease with several well-defined and rather specific autoantigens, i.e., proinsulin, insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), that have been used in animal as well as human intervention trials in attempts to achieve a more efficient, specific immunotherapy.</s><s>In this study, we have tested tolerogenic DCs for their effectiveness to prevent adoptive transfer of diabetes by diabetogenic splenocytes into non-obese diabetes (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) recipients.</s><s>While i.p. application of tolDCs prepared from bone marrow of prediabetic NOD mice by vitamin D2 and dexamethasone significantly reduced diabetes transfer into the NOD-SCID females, this effect was completely abolished when tolDCs were loaded with the mouse recombinant GAD65, but also with a control protein-ovalbumin (OVA).</s><s>The effect was not dependent on the presence of serum in the tolDC culture.</s><s>Similar results were observed in NOD mice.</s><s>Removal of possible bystander antigen-presenting cells within the diabetogenic splenocytes by negative magnetic sorting of T cells did not alter this surprising effect.</s><s>Tolerogenic DCs loaded with an immunodominant mouse GAD65 peptide also displayed diminished diabetes-preventive effect.</s><s>Tolerogenic DCs were characterized by surface maturation markers (CD40, CD80, CD86, MHC II) and the lipopolysaccharide stability test.</s><s>Data from alloreactive T cell proliferation and cytokine induction assays (IFN-γ) did not reveal the differences observed in the diabetes incidence.</s><s>Migration of tolDCs, tolDCs-GAD65 and tolDCs-OVA to spleen, mesenteric-and pancreatic lymph nodes displayed similar, mucosal pattern with highest accumulation in pancreatic lymph nodes inTrODUcTiOn Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated disease, in which both CD4 and CD8 T cells are necessary and sufficient in precipitating the disease by targeting very specifically relatively small volume of highly specialized beta-cells within Islets of Langerhans <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>Non-obese diabetes (NOD) mice and NOD-severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice represent well studied and frequently used animal models of T1D.</s><s>While the NOD spontaneous mouse model allows to study the natural course of the disease in its complexity, NOD-SCID mice with adoptively cotransferred diabetogenic NOD splenocytes are often used for testing regulatory/protective capacity of various cell subsets in a shorter timeframe <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly effective specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and central regulators of immune responses-they are important for induction of effector immune responses, but depending on their developmental stage or environment/culture conditions, also promote tolerance by various mechanisms: T-cell anergy, T-cell deletion, induction of different subsets of Tregs, such as CD8 + Tregs, Foxp3 + Tregs, or Tr1 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>, or even induction of a Th2 shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> or Bregs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The first animal study dealing with DCs in T1D prevention showed that DCs isolated from pancreatic and not other lymph nodes lowered diabetes incidence when reinjected to 4-week-old NOD mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that bone marrow-derived tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) generated in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 in an antigen-nonspecific manner displayed diabetespreventive properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>Antigen-nonspecific treatment with a pegylated TLR7 ligand in vivo induced tolDCs and decreased diabetes in NOD mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Administration of DCs prepared in the presence of interleukin 10 (IL-10) with <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> or without <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> antigen supply both prevented diabetes and insulitis in NOD mice.</s><s>In addition, tolDCs pulsed with apoptotic bodies containing beta-cell antigens decreased diabetes and insulitis in a transgenic NOD model of accelerated diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>While data from Pujol-Autonell et al. documented that reverting diabetes in already diabetic animals might be difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, genetically engineered bone marrow-derived DCs transduced with IL-4 were able to prevent diabetes in 12-week-old prediabetic NOD mice with advanced insulitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, tolDCs represent a promising strategy in T1D prevention at high-risk individuals or even treatment of the disease.</s><s>The first human phase I trial of autologous tolDCs in T1D was Abbreviations: cDC, control matured bone marrow-derived dendritic cell; iDC, immature bone marrow-derived dendritic cell; ILN, systemic inguinal lymph node; MLN, mesenteric lymph node; pept, GAD65-immunodominant peptide no.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref>; PLN, pancreatic lymph node; tolDC, tolerogenic dendritic cell.</s><s>completed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref> and another, based on proinsulin-loaded tolDCs, has been opened <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Apart from the efficacy of tolDCs to suppress the disease in animal models, preferably also at later stages before or even after clinical onset of T1D, several other important parameters must be taken into account, such as their stability, survival, expression of costimulatory and homing molecules, migration, dying pathway, antigen-specificity or requirement, and optimal application route <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>We have been involved in testing and optimizing tolDC protocol based on GM-CSF and IL-4 cell culture with added dexamethasone and vitamin D2 followed by activation of tolDCs by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) analog monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA).</s><s>This protocol was developed according to the good manufacturing practice standards for preparation of human tolDCs that are stable under inflammatory conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, it would be desirable to make this protocol antigenspecific by using safely a beta-cell specific antigen for targeting the pathological immune reaction more effectively, as it has been researched in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref> or experimental arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, but less clear-cut in case of T1D <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, the initial aim of this study was to test this human tolDC protocol in NOD-SCID mice in an antigen-specific manner by using mouse recombinant glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) naturally processed by tolDCs.</s><s>Surprisingly, GAD65-loaded tolDCs (tolDCs-GAD65) while keeping their surface characteristics as well as their allogeneic proliferative and cytokine induction properties lost their diabetes-preventive effect.</s><s>Diabetes incidence was also assessed in the NOD mouse model.</s><s>Some possible mechanisms, other antigens, culture conditions as well as migration patterns are addressed or excluded in this study.</s></p></div>

grade tolDCs (activated by a cytokine mix) showed that both dexamethasone and vitamin D3 produced stable tolDCs that suppressed allogeneic proliferation and IFNγ induction by T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, García-Gonzales et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref> presented data on dexamethasone and MPLA activated stable human tolDCs with reduced allogeneic proliferation and IFN-γ induction (a 5-day protocol, dexamethasone added for last 48 h, without a vitamin D, 24 h MPLA activation).</s><s>Our tolDCs, irrespective of antigen loading, displayed comparable parameters (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A,C,D and 6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Several studies documented that DC cultivation with GM-CSF and IL-4 is favorable over

+ IL-4 generated DCs transduced with IL-4 were able to prevent diabetes in NOD mice with advanced insulitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>.</s><s>Gene array analyses revealed several differences including increased expression of costimulatory molecules, CD200, Ym-1 (marker of alternative macrophage activation), and different pattern of cytokine and chemokine expression by GM-CSF + IL-4 DCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>NOD tolDCs generated by GM-CSF + IL-4 and vitamin D3 were shown to induce Foxp3 + Tregs and IL-10 expression in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our observation that antigen-loaded tolDCs are not so effective is not a complete surprise among studies dealing with tolDC therapy in animal models of T1D.</s><s>There are scattered reports of antigen-loaded tolDCs being ineffective in the disease prevention, however, these findings were not much discussed or followed up.</s><s>In 1999, Feilli-Hariri M et al. showed that tolDCs prepared in GM-CSF alone were less effective than tolDCs cultured in GM-CSF + IL-4, however in both cultures tolDCs pulsed with a mixture of 3 peptides (2 of GAD65 and 1 from hsp60 sequences) were less effective than unloaded control tolDCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Later, Machen et al. reported that tolDCs prepared in GM-CSF + IL-4 and by antisense oligonucleotides against DC's surface costimulatory molecules reduced diabetes incidence in NOD mice, but not if they were coadministered with a lysate from the NIT-1 β cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>In vivo stimulation of DCs by PEGylated TLR7 ligand (1Z1) delayed and reduced diabetes as well as insulitis when they were transferred to prediabetic NOD mice.</s><s>However, in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref> in Supplementary Material, the authors also show that 1Z1 treated DCs pulsed with GAD65 peptide 515-524 significantly increased insulitis in NOD mice (9 weeks after transfer) compared to both control animals with no transfer of cells but also compared to mice treated with 1Z1 DCs only <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, in the study addressing the effect of FBS on mechanisms of tolDC-action in NOD mice, only GM-CSF and IL-10 generated tolDCs pulsed with 2 insulin B chain peptides prevented diabetes in NOD mice.</s><s>When splenocytes from these protected animals were cotransferred with diabetogenic splenocytes to NOD-SCID recipients, they caused a more rapid 100% diabetes onset compared to controls receiving only diabetogenic splenocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed the NOD-SCID model of adoptive cotransfer of diabetes and the spontaneous NOD mouse model differ, e.g., the presence of self T and B cells or possibly a lower proportion of transferred Tregs within the diabetogenic splenocytes that may alter the effect of tolDCs in the NOD-SCID model.</s><s>Another mechanism to consider is a homeostatic expansion of transferred diabetogenic lymphocytes in immunodeficient settings.</s><s>On the other hand, Machen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> documented that NOD mice injected first with NOD T cells followed by administration of tolDCs or control DCs displayed a significant increase in the number of total splenic CD4 + CD25 + and CD25 + CD62L + regulatory cells only in the group injected with tolDCs.</s><s>This finding together with the absence of differences in the prevalence and numbers of single CD4 + or single CD8 + cells between NOD-SCID groups treated with tolDCs and control DCs argues against homeostatic expansion as the basis of the increased prevalence of the CD4 + CD25 + CD62L + cells.</s><s>Since many studies were performed in the spontaneous NOD mouse model of T1D, we also tested unloaded and antigenloaded tolDCs in NOD mice.</s><s>Similar diabetes-preventive effect of antigen-unloaded but not antigen-loaded tolDCs (not only GAD65-but also OVA-loaded tolDCs) on diabetes prevention was documented (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>The above listed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> scattered evidence about less effective or ineffective antigen-loaded tolDCs in the literature is also derived from the NOD mouse model.</s></p><p><s>We also addressed the possibility of bystander antigen presentation by APCs present within the diabetogenic splenocytes and cotransferred with antigen-loaded tolDCs to NOD-SCID recipients.</s><s>Yet, by using purified diabetogenic T cells instead of whole splenocytes, we only observed a tendency for a bit more effective diabetes prevention by unloaded tolDCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>Another mechanism to consider was killing of antigen-loaded tolDCs by autologous CD8 + or CD4 + T cells present within the diabetogenic splenocytes.</s><s>Although not statistically significant, decreased percentage of live non-apoptotic OVA-and to a lesser extent GAD65-loaded tolDCs compared to unloaded tolDCs was detected in cocultures with autologous CD8 + and CD4 + T cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>However, there is a possibility that antigens from dying antigen-loaded donor tolDCs are presented in vivo by recipient APCs (DCs) in an immunogenic fashion as reported by Smyth et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, even in autologous settings.</s><s>In NOD mice, these mechanisms could be further enhanced by a defect in tolerance induction by CD8 + DCs that express higher levels of CD40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our next experiment showed preferential mucosal migration of both unloaded tolDCs as well as antigen-loaded tolDCs-GAD65 and tolDCs-OVA with highest accumulation in PLNs (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>PLNs were shown to play a critical role in priming beta-cell-specific immune responses as, e.g., removal of PLNs prevented diabetes development in NOD mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>, T cells from BDC2.5 T cell receptor transgenic mice, that are specific for a natural beta-cell antigen, proliferate exclusively in PLNs before onset of insulitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> and increased migration of mature tolDCs generated by vitamin D3 to PLNs of NOD mice was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>NOD's PLNs were also described to harbor increased number of merocytic mcDCs that induce T-cell activation and break T-cell tolerance to beta-cell antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>.</s><s>Although we found no differences in surface expression of DC markers related to migration and mucosal homing between the unloaded tolDCs and antigen-loaded tolDCs-OVA or tolDCs-GAD65, of note is that our tolerogenic protocol as well as protocol based on dexamethasone alone followed by MPLA activation (37) led to increased CCR7 expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>It has been reported that CCR7 (51) but not CD103 ( <ref type="formula">52</ref>) is critical for mucosal (MLNs) homing of DCs.</s></p><p><s>Turner et al. have published interesting data documenting the importance of antigen dose on induction of Foxp3 + Tregs (low dose, 0.4 µM) or Foxp3 − CD4 + T cells (high dose, 40 µM) in relation to weak and strong activation of Akt/mTor TCR signaling pathway.</s><s>This effect was modulated by IL-6 and was present not only in GM-CSF + IL-4 tolDCs, but also in immature DCs cultured in GM-CSF only <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>.</s><s>The effect of a dosage might explain the decreased diabetes-preventive properties not only of GAD65-and pept-loaded tolDCs but also of tolDCs loaded with the control protein OVA (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2 and 3A</ref>).</s><s>These findings may correspond with a pattern of diabetes incidence of GAD65-loaded tolDCs presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 and 2</ref>. While the higher dose of 2 µg/mL of GAD65 led to 100% diabetes transfer and a more rapid onset of diabetes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), tolDCs loaded with the lower dose of 1 µg/mL (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) precipitated lower (seven of eight mice) and slower transfer of diabetes than Controls.</s><s>The antigen dose of 1-2 µg/mL in our experiments is, however, lower than in other studies using antigen-loaded tolDCs for T1D prevention that ranged from 10 µg/mL <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> to 3 × 60 μg/mL (9) or 10 µM <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>In animal models of EAE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) doses of peptides ranging from 5 to 50 µg/mL and 1 to 50 µg/mL, respectively, were used for pulsing tolDCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, controlling the outcome of a tolDC therapy by antigen doses alone would be a difficult task.</s><s>Less protective effect of antigen-loaded tolDCs could be also due to a combination of factors, e.g., the dose, killing by autologous CD8 + and CD4 + T cells or presentation of antigens from dying antigen-loaded tolDCs by recipient APCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> and/ or by homeostatic expansion of diabetogenic lymphocytes in the NOD-SCID model.</s></p><p><s>Although antigen-specific tolDCs are widely used in animal models of autoimmune diseases such as EAE or RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, it should be noted that T1D may differ in some aspects from other autoimmune diseases.</s><s>Development of T1D seems to be more related to impaired, "missing" regulatory immune responses in genetically predisposed individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, T1D does not fulfill one important of the Rose-Witebsky's criterions of autoimmune diseases-induction of the disease by immunization with an autoantigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, while tolDCs represent a very promising strategy for prevention or even early cure of T1D, our data together with previously published scattered evidence suggest that antigen loading decreases the disease-protective effect of tolDCs in animal models of T1D.</s><s>In vivo testing of tolDCs is important as multiple factors may influence their therapeutical effects.</s><s>Further studies are needed to shed more light on the mechanisms of antigen-specific tolDCs in animal models of T1D.</s></p></div>
