<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>K. Wahlbeck <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> convincingly argues that the prominent role of social factors in wellbeing and mental health is supported by overwhelming evidence.</s><s>He states that a series of studies have shown how evidence-based programs to prevent mental disorders can be translated into everyday practice.</s><s>However, he cautions that there is a lack of action in the most affluent countries, while there is an even wider gap between possible ways of intervention and current funding in the less affluent ones.</s><s>Furthermore, he emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary research to broaden the theory-base of programs aimed at the promotion of public mental health.</s><s>Let us briefly examine these arguments.</s></p><p><s>There is indeed an abundance of studies showing an association between poverty and social exclusion on the one hand, and poor mental health on the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>.</s><s>However, correlation is not causation, and it may be argued that variables not detected in these studiessuch as unknown familial influences including environmental and (epi-)genetic factors -may explain the observed correlations.</s><s>But they either cannot be easily targeted (such as unknown familial factors) or are not even amenable to social interventions (such as genetic factors).</s></p><p><s>Against such therapeutic nihilism, two arguments can be raised.</s><s>First, a series of animal experiments and human studies have shown that social stress factors, particularly exclusion, stigmatization and discrimination, directly impact on the neurobiological correlates of mental disorders, impair cognitive capacities and promote aggression, drug intake and negative mood states <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, even fluid IQ as a measure of complex cognitive capacities has been associated with variation in dopaminergic neurotransmission, which in turn is strongly affected by stress exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Second, most twin research has relied on the (controversial) assumption that gene-gene interactions are only additive and cannot exponentially increase similarity (e.g., when variation in multiple genes increases neurotransmitter synthesis and at the same time decreases both reuptake and metabolism).</s><s>On the other hand, the "equal environment" assumption on which most twin studies are based does not differentially capture complex genotype-phenotype interactions.</s></p><p><s>We caution that both supraadditive genetic effects as well as the presence of complex genotype-phenotype interactions could lead to an overestimation of genetic effects, which could in turn override environmental effects in twin study designs that assume only additive interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the current absence of evidence for environmental effects in many twin studies is not evidence of absence.</s><s>Moreover, there is emerging evidence that the effects of genetic variation on behavioral phenotypes are amenable to targeted behavioral interventions, such as cognitive training <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>These considerations call for study designs that look at complex genotype-phenotype interactions and assess not only genetic but also epigenetic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>With respect to Wahlbeck's argument that insufficient funds are spent on preventive programs in affluent countries and that there is a wide gap between available funds and social needs in the less affluent ones, one can only but agree and call for direct action.</s><s>Epidemiological studies suggest that mental disorders impose a huge burden on individuals and their families, which is further augmented by social exclusion and stigmatization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</s><s>It may be exactly due to this persisting stigma that, in spite of good evidence for the effectiveness of preventive programs, even rich countries do not provide sufficient funds.</s><s>For those countries that are less affluent, some tough choices have to be made: it may be less helpful to promote hospital care if there is a lack of social consultation, as we experienced in Afghanistan and Mali, while educating social workers, nurses and general practitioners may have to take priority <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Wahlbeck calls for interdisciplinary research to promote the theory basis of public health.</s><s>Indeed, we strongly agree and suggest that both quantitative and qualitative research has its place in this respect.</s><s>While animal experiments, longitudinal studies and epidemiological data can provide a quantitative account of the interaction of social and individual factors contributing to mental health and distress, qualitative studies can generate new lines of research and explore what a given situation really means for patients and their relatives as well as the general population.</s><s>Indeed, neuroscience has turned social <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> and it is time for epidemiology and social psychiatry to embrace multi-level approaches to mental health and to put viable programs into practice.</s></p><p><s>Building behavioral health systems from the ground up ROBERT E. DRAKE 1 , ROB WHITLEY 2 Wahlbeck's paper (1) provides a succinct and accurate overview of the public health approach to global mental health.</s><s>Conceptually, public health incorporates not just evidence-based interventions from high-income countries, but also significant emphases on positive behavioral health, prevention, recovery, and social, cultural and environmental factors.</s></p><p><s>Expanding global mental health to include positive behavioral healthand therefore all people -offers the advantage of attention to developmental needs, resilience, prevention, and recovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>The behavioral health field has ignored these issues and the related empirical research findings for too long.</s><s>Relatedly, shifting from "mental health" to "behavioral health" could underscore the broad focus on healthy behaviors rather than a narrower focus on mental illness.</s><s>As one ramification, mainstreaming behavioral health to the entire population may reduce stigma for those who experience the most severe disabilities.</s></p><p><s>The practical implementations of the Movement for Global Mental Health have been criticized extensively (3).</s><s>Despite its holistic and laudable rhetoric, implementation attempts have largely involved an expansion of Western evidence-based biomedical or psychological interventions delivered via lay health workers and have not been sensitive to cultures and communities.</s><s>Local communities often object to the imposition of Western models of individual mental illness when the problems are widespread, the culture is not so individualistic, and behaviors are obviously related to war, poverty, gender discrimination, lack of opportunity, and so on.</s><s>The failure to engage communities and understand cultural values and norms has sometimes worsened rather than relieved widespread community distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The use of lay health workers helps to expand services and engender trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, but these workers typically make diagnoses and dispense medications or psychological therapies following a Western medical model.</s><s>How could community engagement efforts align more closely with local culture?</s><s>One basic strategy could be to start with local people on the ground.</s><s>"Top-down" solutions (i.e., those developed by government experts) that are imposed on communities are often bureaucratic, reductionistic, overly prescriptive, and insensitive to local culture and context.</s></p><p><s>The expensive and inefficient Veterans Administration Healthcare system in the U.S. is often cited as an example of the failure of top-down systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>By contrast, "ground-up" approaches (i.e., those developed by local stakeholders and communities) may better serve the goals of public mental health by valorizing local knowledge, competence, and resources.</s><s>People on the ground -those experiencing behavioral health problems, their families, and their communities, aligned with local leaders, professionals, healers, and health workers -may in fact be in a better position to recognize local needs and resources, to understand local culture, to select and adapt appropriate evidence-based practices, and to innovate solutions.</s><s>Local culture, however, may sometimes perpetuate stigma and even violations of human rightshence the need for collaborations with professionals via mutual learning.</s><s>Learning communities (multi-disciplinary groups focused on a specific health issue) have successfully combined local stakeholders with outside experts to discuss, select, and evaluate potential solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Community engagement could be enhanced on a global basis via several strategies.</s><s>First, governments should give priority and funding to ground-up approaches.</s><s>Community engagement in</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>1 Dartmouth</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Psychiatric Research Center and Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH 03766, USA; 2 Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
