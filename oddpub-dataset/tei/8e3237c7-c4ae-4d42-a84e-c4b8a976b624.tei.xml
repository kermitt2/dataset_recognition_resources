<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We investigated whether the application of GA with EGCG would improve the therapeutic efficacy of EGCG alone in chronic neuroinflammation.</s><s>Unexpectedly, we observed that the combined therapy failed to reduce the severity of chronic EAE, despite the fact that each single therapy was effective.</s><s>Surprisingly, even a single administration of a supoptimal dose of GA had a sustained effect, interfering with the positive disease-limiting actions of EGCG.</s><s>Interestingly, the addition of GA to EGCG appears to alter the EGCG-related downregulation of the stress-inducible enzyme HO-1.</s></p><p><s>We and others have previously reported that the prophylactic administration of EGCG ameliorated the course of both relapsing remitting EAE and chronic EAE primarily by altering the inflammatory response to PLP and MOG, respectively, and by inhibiting ROS formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>These reports show evidence for a therapeutic effect of EGCG on already established EAE, although it remains unclear whether the therapeutic benefits relied on the same immunomodulatory mechanisms as in the preventative paradigms.</s><s>Here, we demonstrated by histology that in established disease in the chronic EAE model, the therapeutic benefits of EGCG (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">)</ref> were associated with prevention of demyelination and axonal injury, while the single GA dose exerted principally anti-inflammatory effects.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to our expectations, the combination treatment with EGCG with a single dose of GA had no effect on the EAE activity, probably because GA counteracts the neuroprotective effects seen under EGCG-treatment alone.</s><s>However, this result cannot be explained by a disease aggravating effect of GA in chronic EAE.</s><s>In our hands, a single subcutaneous injection of GA was sufficient to induce a transient improvement of the EAE course and a mild yet significant amelioration of the cumulative disease activity.</s><s>This corresponded with a decrease in leukocyte infiltration in the CNS of the GA-treated animals.</s><s>Although we injected only one dose of 150 μg GA, these results are in agreement with the previously reported anti-inflammatory properties of GA in mouse and rat EAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>It is also possible that EGCG might interfere with the actions of GA.</s><s>Given the oral administration of EGCG, systemic effects might interfere with the immune recognition of GA which could lead to a neutralization of its therapeutic effects.</s></p><p><s>In view of this unexpected neutralization of the positive effects of EGCG when combined with GA treatment, we further examined this treatment regime to elucidate potential molecular mechanisms behind this observation.</s></p><p><s>To explore the pathways of this interference at an earlier phase of disease, we conducted two additional EAE experiments in which mice were randomly treated with either EGCG alone or GA+EGCG, until significant differences in EAE clinical scores were observed.</s><s>These EAE mice showed a generally milder disease course, than the typical course of chronic EAE.</s><s>Nevertheless, only those mice with clinical signs were included in the treatment groups, therefore this experiment was a suitable comparison of these two treatments.</s><s>Using this setup, we showed that GA did not influence the effects of EGCG on the expression of inflammatory mediators, and did not interfere with the iron chelating activity of EGCG.</s><s>However, we showed that the application of EGCG+GA induced an increase in HO-1 gene expression in the cerebellum (but not in the cerebrum), compared to mice treated with EGCG alone.</s><s>These results were confirmed in an additional treatment experiment including a vehicle control group.</s><s>Here, we also examined the spinal cord of the treated EAE animals and demonstrated that HO-1 expression was particularly elevated in the spinal cords of animals treated with the combination of EGCG+GA.</s><s>Moreover, contrary to expectations, treatment of EAE mice with EGCG alone decreased the expression of HO-1 in cerebellum and spinal cord when compared to the vehicle control group.</s><s>In EAE, HO-1 levels correlate with clinical disability, and the enzyme is primarily expressed by inflammatory cells in CNS lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, one may speculate that levels of HO-1 are independent of the treatment, and simply reflect the degree of inflammation and clinical severity.</s><s>Nevertheless, in our model GA did not affect the extent of CNS immune cells infiltration in treated mice, as shown in <ref type="bibr">Fig 3,</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> suggesting that HO-1 modulation under different treatments is not merely a reflection of the magnitude of inflammation.</s></p><p><s>The role of HO-1 in EAE and in neurodegenerative disorders remains controversial.</s><s>While in Lewis rats inhibition of HO-1 prior to EAE onset aggravated the disease course <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, the inhibition of HO-1 in established mouse EAE had a beneficial effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>HO-1 deficient mice developed a more severe EAE course when compared with wildtype animals, and induction of HO-1 after EAE onset by cobalt protoporphyrin IX showed a therapeutic effect in both relapsing-remitting and chronic EAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>However, sustained induction of HO-1 by cobalt protoporphyrin IX <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, and overexpression of HO-1 in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> has been shown to lead to pathologic iron deposition and mitochondrial autophagy, processes that have been associated with the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and also with MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and EAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, HO-1 induction may be beneficial or detrimental depending on the disease stage.</s><s>As postulated by Stahnke et al. stress-induced HO-1 may initially play a protective role, while its chronic upregulation, might contribute to oligodendroglial cell death and to disease progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the diverse mechanisms operating in different diseases and their animal models, the contributions of genetic differences between mouse background strains should not be underestimated, as outlined by the divergent responses to EGCG+GA combination therapy in B6 mice in the present study compared with our previous studies in SJL mice.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our results highlight the complexity of HO-1 regulation and iron homeostasis in chronic neuroinflammatory processes.</s><s>Further studies on the implications of HO-1, especially in progressive EAE are clearly necessary.</s><s>This may help in the designing of novel treatment strategies for the
