<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Uncombable hair syndrome (UHS), also known as ''spun glass hair syndrome,'' ''pili trianguli et canaliculi,'' or ''cheveux incoiffables'' is a rare anomaly of the hair shaft that occurs in children and improves with age.</s><s>UHS is characterized by dry, frizzy, spangly, and often fair hair that is resistant to being combed flat.</s><s>Until now, both simplex and familial UHS-affected case subjects with autosomal-dominant as well as -recessive inheritance have been reported.</s><s>However, none of these case subjects were linked to a molecular genetic cause.</s><s>Here, we report the identification of UHS-causative mutations located in the three genes PADI3 (peptidylarginine deiminase 3), TGM3 (transglutaminase 3), and TCHH (trichohyalin) in a total of 11 children.</s><s>All of these individuals carry homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in one of these three genes, indicating an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern in the majority of UHS case subjects.</s><s>The two enzymes PADI3 and TGM3, responsible for posttranslational protein modifications, and their target structural protein TCHH are all involved in hair shaft formation.</s><s>Elucidation of the molecular outcomes of the disease-causing mutations by cell culture experiments and tridimensional protein models demonstrated clear differences in the structural organization and activity of mutant and wildtype proteins.</s><s>Scanning electron microscopy observations revealed morphological alterations in hair coat of Padi3 knockout mice.</s><s>All together, these findings elucidate the molecular genetic causes of UHS and shed light on its pathophysiology and hair physiology in general.</s></p></div>
