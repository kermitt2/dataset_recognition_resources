<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified many common variants associated with a large number of complex traits, and explained some of the estimated heritability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The refinement of high-throughput technologies and the decrease in sequencing costs now allow investigating the role of rare variants in greater depth as well.</s><s>However, despite evidence that many rare variants play a functional role in complex traits and in the regulation of biological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, only a relatively small number of rare variants have been found to be associated with complex diseases so far <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> with one likely reason that frequently used statistical tests have been underpowered.</s></p><p><s>While single-marker tests (SMTs) are often the method of choice for the analysis of common and low-frequency single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.01 or 0.005, multi-marker tests (MMTs) have attracted much attention over the last years for the analysis of rare SNVs.</s><s>Their development has been motivated by arguments that SMTs have inflated type I error and very low power when testing rare SNVs in the analysis of binary traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and might not provide valid statistical inference when testing very rare SNVs or single base-pair mutations.</s><s>MMTs use different approaches to combine the rare genetic variants' information in a given region and test the association of the region with the phenotype.</s><s>They can be broadly classified as (i) burden tests, which obtain genetic scores by collapsing rare variants in a region/gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, (ii) extensions of burden tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, (iii) variance-component tests, which collapse single-variant score statistics in a region <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, (iv) combinations of burden and variance-component tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and (v) other approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Detailed comparisons of rare variant association tests for binary traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> showed that SMTs based on likelihood ratio tests have inflated type I errors, SMTs based on Score tests, Wald tests, and Fisher's exact tests have deflated type I errors, and all of these SMTs have much lower power compared to MMTs across most of the considered scenarios.</s><s>These results have also been picked up by most recent reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For the analysis of quantitative traits, however, extensive comparisons are lacking and few studies have compared SMTs with MMTs.</s><s>Those studies that have investigated SMTs and MMTs for quantitative traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> might seem to partially confirm the results of binary traits, but they actually do not allow valid conclusions regarding which approach has the highest power due to the following reasons.</s><s>Some studies tested different sets of variants with SMTs and MMTs (SNPs versus SNVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, including versus excluding singletons and doubletons <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>) or tested different hypotheses by evaluating the power of identifying causal variants for SMTs but assessed the power of identifying causal regions for MMTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>In another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, Saad et al. compared SMTs with MMTs in their power to identify the same genetic locus and found that different methods have higher power in different scenarios.</s><s>But the results are inconclusive since very few replicates were used in the simulation study and the type I errors were not well-calibrated in their study for SMTs as well as MMTs.</s><s>Finally, most of the recent studies proposing new MMTs did not compare MMTs with SMTs but only compared the performance of different MMTs <ref type="bibr">[12-14, 16-19, 21-22, 32]</ref>, or only compared SMTs and MMTs for common SNVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which cannot be generalized to the analysis of rare SNVs.</s></p><p><s>As a result of the inconclusive previous studies, the aim of this study is to provide a comparison of SMTs and MMTs for the analysis of quantitative traits based on a clear formalization of the tested hypotheses for each approach.</s><s>Consequently, we compare an SMT (Wald-type t-test) with popular MMTs (SKAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, SKAT-O <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and a burden test <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) for testing the same hypothesis (i.e. the same causal loci) in rare variant association studies of quantitative traits under different scenarios.</s><s>Without loss of generality, we consider a gene as a causal locus in this study.</s><s>We show at first that all approaches have valid type I error rates and that in particular, single-marker analyses provide unbiased variant effect estimates and valid statistical inference even when singletons or doubletons are under consideration.</s><s>Based on extensive simulation studies, we then show that for quantitative traits, SMTs can lead to more powerful or equallypowered association tests for identifying a causal gene (i.e., a gene which includes rare/ very rare causal variants) compared to MMTs in many realistic scenarios.</s><s>More specifically, SMTs lead to more powerful association tests for identifying causal genes than MMTs when the effect sizes of causal variants in the gene are large, and less powerful tests when causal variants have small effect sizes.</s><s>For moderate effect sizes, whether SMTs or MMTs have higher power depends on the sample size and percentage of causal SNVs.</s><s>Sensitivity checks show that this is the case if all rare and non-causal common SNVs in a gene are analyzed, and also if the analysis is restricted to rare SNVs only.</s><s>The latter comparison mostly influences the results of the burden test.</s><s>We describe the situations when SMTs and when MMTs have higher power in detail, compare the power for identifying causal rare variants and causal genes using SMTs, and investigate the same scenarios for binary traits to provide a more complete description on which study designs and tests yield the highest power.</s><s>Finally, we conduct a comparison of SMTs with MMTs in a real data genetic association analysis of systolic blood pressure using the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 data.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we focused on the association analysis of rare variants with quantitative traits and first showed that standard restricted maximum likelihood estimation in a single-marker approach does provide unbiased estimates and single-marker Wald-type t-tests allow valid statistical inference even for very rare SNVs.</s><s>In the following main analysis, we compared the power of the SMT and MMTs for identifying a gene that includes causal rare variants, and demonstrated that SMTs or MMTs can be more powerful depending on the scenario.</s><s>More specifically, SMTs lead to more powerful association tests for identifying causal genes than MMTs when the effect sizes of causal variants in the gene are large, and less powerful tests when causal variants have small effect sizes.</s><s>For moderate effect sizes, whether SMTs or MMTs have higher power depends on the sample size and percentage of causal SNVs.</s><s>In our opinion, the most realistic scenarios are that at most 5% or 10% rare SNVs in a gene are causal.</s><s>Then, for moderate effect sizes, the SMT has higher power when the sample size is larger, and slightly less power for a smaller sample size.</s><s>These results seem to hold consistently for different gene sizes, different nominal α levels, different proportions of SNVs with positive/negative effect on the trait, and different corrections for multiple testing of SNVs in a gene (Bonferroni and BH correction) with SMTs.</s><s>In the data application, the SMT provided the smallest p-values in the testing of previously identified candidate blood pressure genes.</s></p><p><s>For any gene-level investigation, a very important question is which SNVs should be grouped together in a test.</s><s>Including more true causal SNVs by extending the region under consideration or by analyzing both common and rare SNVs can increase the power.</s><s>At the same time, including more non-causal SNVs adds noise and decreases the power.</s><s>Accordingly, in the simulation study, the power of all approaches increased when the analysis was restricted to rare SNVs, since only rare SNVs were chosen as causal SNVs in the data generation.</s><s>The same was observed in the real data association study-but only consistently for the SMT-where the reason might have been as well that there were not any common causal SNVs.</s><s>In the presence of causal common SNVs, including them in gene-level tests should increase the power.</s><s>The data application also showed that while the SMT, SKAT, and SKAT-O are quite robust against which sets of SNVs are investigated, the burden test is highly sensitive and can lead to vastly different results.</s></p><p><s>It should be noted that in the simulation study, the data was generated from the same model as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> where the effect size of a SNV depends on the MAF of SNVs through a specified function (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Since the weighted kernel functions in SKAT and SKAT-O are dependent on the MAF of SNVs as well, this gives SKAT and SKAT-O an advantage and allowed us to evaluate and compare the SMT in situations where the MMTs have high power.</s><s>Therefore, in real applications, the power of SMTs might compare even more favorably to these MMTs.</s></p><p><s>Our proposition to use SMTs for the analysis of rare variants is based on the fact that maximum likelihood estimation returns valid estimates under the linear regression model, even for the analysis of singletons and doubletons.</s><s>Importantly, as described in the Results section, the strategy to include singletons and doubletons in the analysis can substantially improve the power of SMTs.</s><s>Of course, this does not alleviate the need to check for genotyping errors and other biases, which are especially relevant to singletons and doubletons.</s><s>Also, while all investigated approaches rely on normality assumptions, the Wald-type t-test (SMT) was much more vulnerable to a distribution misspecification than the MMTs.</s><s>When the residuals in the genetic association test are not normally distributed for one or multiple SNVs (or when effects follow another genetic model), adapting the test statistic is warranted.</s><s>Further analyses of our study (data not shown) confirmed that for binary outcomes, standard statistical tests such as Fisher's exact test, logistic regression likelihood ratio tests, Wald tests, and Score tests, should not be directly used for testing singletons and doubletons since they do not allow valid inference.</s><s>Therefore, for each test, all assumptions including the (asymptotic) distribution assumptions and empirical type I errors have to be assessed before the analysis, and significant test results have to be cautiously investigated, especially if they are based on singletons or doubletons.</s></p><p><s>Secondary results of our study provide suggestions regarding the study design of rare variant association studies.</s><s>We observed that the power to identify causal low-frequency SNVs is almost always much smaller compared to the power to identify gene regions encompassing causal rare SNVs (S11 Table <ref type="table">;</ref> cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), except when very few SNVs in a gene are causal, have higher MAF (i.e.</s><s>MAF between 0.005 and 0.03) and higher effect sizes.</s><s>This should be kept in mind but not be considered as a power comparison between MMTs and SMTs.</s><s>Hence, the power of rare variant tests depends highly on which hypothesis is tested, the number of causal SNVs, their effect size, and whether the ultimate goal is to identify a causal gene or a causal SNV.</s><s>The comparison between SNV-level and gene-level association tests might also depend on the ratio of the number of genes to the number of SNVs, which could be further investigated in future studies.</s><s>Regarding MMTs, the results come with a loss in information because the exact position of causal variants is not revealed, and to our knowledge, the currently available methodology does not allow to obtain power estimates for identifying a causal SNV.</s><s>If the focus of the analysis is on identifying causal rare SNVs instead of genes, SMTs can be used in a genome-wide scan for variants, or alternatively SMTs/MMTs can be used in the first stage to identify target genes and followed up by SMTs of variants within these genes (S12 Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s><s>Comparisons between such 1-stage and 2-stage approaches were not the aim of this study, and could be an interesting avenue for future research by incorporating correct adjustments for multiple testing, the 2-stage testing and biases such as the winner's curse <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>For choosing the most powerful statistical test for specific situations in genetic association studies of rare variants, the locus of interest (gene or variant) should be specified first, followed then by
