Nevertheless, one has to consider that different vaccine brands were used.</s><s>We cannot completely exclude that this might explain the absence of a response in one participant since information was not available on vaccine brand in this particular case.</s></p><p><s>Hepatitis B vaccination during infancy has been shown to reduce the incidence of hepatitis B infection through the stimulation of immunological memory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>The first 2 vaccine doses typically stimulate antibody production and prime the immune system for a secondary immune response to the third dose. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>owever, anti-HBs levels decrease over time.</s><s>In two studies in Germany, Jilg et al. showed that anti-HBs decreases below 10 IU/l in 22% and 39% of vaccinees over a 4-year-period after primary vaccination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">18</ref></s><s>It has been found that anti-HBs falls to &lt; 10IU/l in 10-50% of vaccinees 10-15 y post-primary vaccination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>However, loss of detectable antibodies does not necessarily indicate loss of protection against hepatitis infection or disease, due to the presence of memory B lymphocytes that are able to rapidly produce anti-HBs soon after exposure to the virus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>ur finding of a high proportion of adolescents with anamnestic responses is in line with those by other investigators.</s><s>In an Italian study 35% of teenagers vaccinated against hepatitis B during infancy had anti-HBs levels &lt;10 IU/l at 10 y after vaccination in infancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">19</ref></s><s>After a booster was administered 17 y postprimary vaccination, 98% exhibited a strong anamnestic response, indicating the presence of immune memory despite the low antibody titers detected.</s><s>A study performed in Slovakia found that 10-11 y after a primary vaccination course with a hexavalent vaccine containing a hepatitis B component or with a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine 48% and 58% of the participants, respectively, had anti-HBs levels 10 IU/l.</s><s>After a hepatitis B challenge dose, the proportion of participants with anti-HBs levels of 100 IU/l was 94% in both groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">19</ref></s><s> recent study performed in Germany showed that 72% of children had anti-HBs levels 10 IU/l seven to eight y after vaccination with a hexavalent vaccine during infancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">16</ref></s><s>Finally, very similar to our results, only 24% of 16 to 19-year-olds in the US had anti-HBs levels 10 IU/l, but 92% responded to a booster dose. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">20</ref></s><s>n our study, we did not find associations between participant characteristics and pre-booster anti-HBs levels.</s><s>However, one has to consider the relatively small sample size of our study when interpreting these data.</s><s>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis provides more reliable and robust data on determinants of pre-booster antibody levels after primary vaccination against hepatitis B in infancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">21</ref></s><s>Analyzing 46 studies which included a total of &gt;28,000 participants, these authors found that neither vaccination schedule, nor vaccine type, exact age at first vaccination or number of doses were associated with antibody levels in the long-term.</s><s>Although preterm birth was found to be associated with low anti-HBs levels in some studies, results are inconclusive for birth weight independent of gestational age. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">22</ref></s><s>When comparing studies assessing anti-HBs persistence, the local endemicity of hepatitis B has to be taken into account.</s><s>This cohort study comprised children in an area of low hepatitis B endemicity.</s><s>Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to high-endemic regions, where repetitive exposure to the wild virus may lead to natural boosting and subsequent longer protection against the disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Other potential problems in the comparison of studies consist of the use of different vaccine formulations, dosing schedules, and different assays used for antibody quantification.</s><s>Some limitations of our study need to be taken into account.</s><s>First, our study population was rather small, comprising children from only one pediatric practice in Germany.</s><s>Therefore, it is unclear whether the results can be translated to the general population in Germany.</s><s>However, representativeness is not a necessary condition for every epidemiological study to generate valid results. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">23</ref></s><s>This argument particularly applies to risk factors analyses, as they were performed and reported in our study.</s><s>Therefore, even if our study sample was not representative, the results of this analysis are still valid and could be generalized.</s><s>Second, although 75 of 91 eligible adolescents received a booster vaccination, only 34 had returned for post-booster blood sampling which might have introduced selection bias.</s><s>To explore this issue, we performed a missing data analysis.</s><s>Comparing the baseline characteristics (gender, gestational age, birth weight, 4-dose vaccination schedule, vaccine type, age and time between vaccine doses) between those 34 patients to the remaining participants who did not return for blood sampling, we did not find significant differences (data available upon request from the authors).</s><s>Third, although we excluded children who received the first vaccine dose after the age of 12 months, study participants had received their primary immunization course at varying ages, mostly later than currently recommended by STIKO.</s><s>However, we believe that this study presents "real life" conditions in the ambulatory setting.</s><s>Moreover, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, there was no relation between age at primary vaccination and pre-booster anti-HBs.</s><s>Fourth, different hepatitis B vaccine brands were used consisting of both monovalent and hexavalent combination vaccines, and primary vaccination regimens consisted of both 3 and 4 dose schemes.</s><s>This might have affected anti-HBs levels differentially.</s><s>Still, the number of doses was neither associated with pre-booster nor post-booster anti-HBs levels.</s><s>Finally, the relatively high proportion of participants with underlying chronic illnesses might indicate selection bias.</s><s>According to a representative telephone survey which was conducted between 2009 and 2012 in the German general population, 20.6% of children aged 14 to 17 y were reported to have an underlying chronic disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">24</ref></s><s>However, our study population comprised adolescents who subsequently attended a pediatric practice due to medical reasons.</s><s>Therefore, it is plausible that the prevalence of underlying diseases in this population was higher.</s><s>Since chronic diseases are associated with decreased immunogenicity, our result could be interpreted as a rather conservative estimate.</s><s>Moreover, the analysis presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows that the presence of any of the chronic diseases was unrelated to the main outcome variable, indicating that chronic diseases did not bias the study results.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, this study shows that a large proportion of children vaccinated against hepatitis B as infants had low anti-HBs levels 10 to 16 y after primary vaccination.</s><s>However, the strong immune response detected after booster administration indicates the continued presence of immunity to hepatitis B, thus indicating long-term protection.</s><s>Since our data set was limited by its sample size and it is unclear whether the anamnestic response translates into protection against hepatitis B infection, further studies are needed to assess both long-term immunological response and long-term effectiveness of the vaccine against clinical disease.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Participant
