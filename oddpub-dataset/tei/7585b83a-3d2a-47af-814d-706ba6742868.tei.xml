<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Being able to comprehend another person's intentions and emotions is essential for successful social interaction.</s><s>However, it is currently unknown whether the human brain possesses a neural mechanism that attracts people to others whose mental states they can easily understand.</s><s>Here we show that the degree to which a person feels attracted to another person can change while they observe the other's affective behavior, and that these changes depend on the observer's confidence in having correctly understood the other's affective state.</s><s>At the neural level, changes in interpersonal attraction were predicted by activity in the reward system of the observer's brain.</s><s>Importantly, these effects were specific to individual observertarget pairs and could not be explained by a target's general attractiveness or expressivity.</s><s>Furthermore, using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we found that neural activity in the reward system of the observer's brain varied as a function of how well the target's affective behavior matched the observer's neural representation of the underlying affective state: The greater the match, the larger the brain's intrinsic reward signal.</s><s>Taken together, these findings provide evidence that reward-related neural activity during social encounters signals how well an individual's "neural vocabulary" is suited to infer another person's affective state, and that this intrinsic reward might be a source of changes in interpersonal attraction.</s></p><p><s>affective communication | confidence | intrinsic reward | multivoxel pattern analysis | human social relations F inding the "right" cooperation partner is an important task for individuals living in complex environments that require social interaction and cooperation.</s><s>To accomplish a common goal, interaction partners must understand and continuously update information about their partner's current intentions, motivation, and affect, anticipate the other's behavior, and adapt their own behavior accordingly.</s><s>From a sociobiological point of view, one thus might expect that evolution has favored a neural mechanism that permits individuals to select other individuals as their cooperation partners whose behavior and communication signals they can easily decode.</s><s>However, the neural mechanisms that control human interpersonal attraction and the selection of cooperation partners are not wellunderstood.</s></p><p><s>Several influential theories in social psychology have stressed the role of reward in interpersonal attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>The idea is that if a social encounter with another person is rewarding, then the reward will become associated with the other person, resulting in interpersonal attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>Until recently, neuroscientific research into interpersonal attraction has focused mainly on determining the neural mechanism underlying the evaluation of others based on the physical attractiveness of their faces (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>These studies consistently show that neural activity in the ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), core regions of the brain's reward system that also respond to food and money <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>, increases in response to faces that are perceived as attractive.</s><s>Other studies show that these brain regions also respond to another person's prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Although this research documents the role of the brain's reward system in interpersonal attraction, it does not explain why social encounters often result in relational effects in interpersonal attraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> such that one individual is particularly attracted to one person whereas another individual is more attracted to another person.</s><s>Here we focus on the role of nonverbal understanding in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>Specifically, we ask whether the human brain possesses a neural mechanism that permits individuals to select and approach other individuals as interaction partners whose affective behavior they can easily understand.</s></p><p><s>Recent work on perceptual learning provides a first hint that the brain's reward system might play an important role not only in signaling facial attractiveness but also in the individual adjustment of interpersonal attraction during social interaction.</s><s>This work suggests that whenever the brain evaluates sensory information, it generates a neural signal in the ventral striatum that reflects the amount of evidence available for stimulus evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and that, at the experiential level, is associated with subjective confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, it has been proposed that such intrinsic confidence signals can act as positive reinforcement signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>We hypothesized that a similar confidence signal, reflecting the amount of evidence available to decode another person's nonverbal behavior, might serve as an intrinsic reward that becomes associated with the interaction partner and thereby increases or decreases the perceiver's interpersonal attraction toward the interaction partner during social encounters.</s></p><p><s>Considering further evidence from social neuroscience, we reasoned that an individual's confidence in their understanding of the other's behavior might reflect how well the individual's "neural Significance Humans interacting with other humans must be able to understand their interaction partner's affect and motivations, often without words.</s><s>We examined whether people are attracted to others whose affective behavior they can easily understand.</s><s>For this, we asked participants to watch different persons experiencing different emotions.</s><s>We found the better a participant thought they could understand another person's emotion the more they felt attracted toward that person.</s><s>Importantly, these individual changes in interpersonal attraction were predicted by activity in the participant's reward circuit, which in turn signaled how well the participant's "neural vocabulary" was suited to decode the other's behavior.</s><s>This research elucidates neurobiological processes that might play an important role in the formation and success of human social relations.</s></p><p><s>vocabulary" is suited to decode and interpret the target's behavior.</s><s>Neurobiological accounts of social cognition suggest that when humans evaluate the inner state of another person, they implicitly use neural representations of their own states as reference (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and empirical studies have provided evidence that is consistent with this idea (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, we predicted that an individual's intrinsic confidence that they correctly understood another person's affective state would reflect how well the target's behavior matches the observer's neural representation of the underlying state.</s></p><p><s>To examine the role of mutual understanding in interpersonal attraction, we conducted two experiments, a behavioral experiment (experiment I) and a combined behavioral-fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) experiment (experiment II) with two independent samples of volunteers.</s><s>Participants in both experiments were shown short video clips of six different female targets who experienced and facially expressed two different emotions, fear or sadness.</s><s>After each video, participants were asked to judge the target's affective state (fear or sadness) and to indicate how confident they were that they had correctly understood the target's affective state (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Before and after emotion observation, we assessed the participants' interpersonal attraction toward each target at two levels.</s><s>First, we asked participants to enlarge a small picture of each target on a computer screen by repeatedly pressing a button until the picture had a size that corresponded to a subjectively pleasant conversational distance.</s><s>The number of button presses executed to enlarge the picture of a given target was taken as measure of the participant's approach behavior toward that target (modified after ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s><s>Next, participants were given three statements about each target and asked to indicate how much they agreed with each of these statements (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This way, we derived a motivational-behavioral measure (approach behavior) and a selfreport measure of each participant's interpersonal attraction toward each target before and after emotion observation.</s><s>This experimental design allowed us to link the participants' confidence that they correctly understood the targets' affective state to individual changes in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>In experiment II, we additionally measured the participants' brain activity during emotion observation.</s><s>This enabled us to identify neural activity in the brain's reward system that predicted the participants' self-reported confidence in their emotion judgments and to link this neural activity to changes in interindividual attraction.</s><s>Finally, participants in experiment II completed an emotion experience task immediately after the emotion observation task in which they were asked to experience and express the two emotions (fear and sadness) themselves, using instructions similar to those that were used when recording the videos of the targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>This permitted us to compare the patterns of neural activity elicited during emotion observation to those associated with the observer's own emotional experience.</s><s>We refer to the level of correspondence between these patterns as neural observation-experience matching (NOE matching).</s></p><p><s>Experiment I tested whether observing another person's affective behavior can lead to individual changes in interpersonal attraction, and whether these changes are predicted by the observer's subjective confidence that they correctly understood the other's affective state.</s><s>Experiment II validated the findings of experiment I and additionally investigated the neural mechanisms that might mediate between affective understanding and interpersonal attraction.</s><s>To this end, we first examined whether the participants' subjective confidence in their emotion judgments was predicted by neural activity in the reward system of their brains.</s><s>Second, we used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> to examine the relation between subjective confidence, neural confidence signals, and NOE matching.</s><s>Both analyses were performed in a cross-validated hierarchical approach, using wholebrain analyses to identify relevant brain regions, followed by region-of-interest (ROI) analyses to examine the relation between neural signals within these regions and individual changes in interpersonal attraction (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with each statement on a Likert-type 7-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (definitely).</s><s>The first statement estimated the participant's overt willingness to meet the target; the last two questions were averaged to estimate the participant's expectation that they could have an intimate communication with the target.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>Experimental design.</s><s>To measure changes in interpersonal attraction during emotion observation, the participants' attraction toward each target was assessed before (Left) and after (Right) emotion observation.</s><s>(Middle) A sample emotion observation trial is shown (time intervals and screen shots are taken from experiment II).</s><s>A trial consisted of a facial observation period during which a short video clip of the target experiencing fear or sadness was shown, followed by a fixation cross, an emotion judgment period, and a confidence rating period.</s><s>Responses were given with a button box and fed back to the observer (orange frame around the selected emotion and orange dot on the confidence scale).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Experiment I.</s></p><p><s>Emotion judgments and self-reported confidence.</s><s>In the behavioral experiment, observers (21 women, 19 men) correctly labeled the target's emotional state in the majority of trials (hit rate 74 ± 3.6% [mean ± SEM], T[39] = 21, P &lt; 0.001), and the observers' average self-reported confidence for a given target closely reflected the actual correctness of their emotion judgments for this target (mean r = 0.71 ± 0.07 [back-transformed mean of Fisher-transformed correlation coefficients], T[39] = 9.8, P &lt; 0.001).</s><s>This indicates that observers had a valid internal model that allowed them to infer the targets' affective state and to accurately estimate the correctness of their understanding.</s><s>A two-way ANOVA with between-subject factor observer (40 levels), within-subject factor target (6 levels), and the observers' self-reported confidence as dependent variable (n = 40 × 6 × 16 = 3,840 trials) revealed, in addition to a significant main effect of target (F <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">195]</ref> = 95, P &lt; 0.001, eta 2 = 0.71), a significant observer-by-target interaction (F[195,3600] = 2.4, P &lt; 0.001, eta 2 = 0.12).</s><s>This indicates that an observer's subjective confidence that they correctly understood a target's affective state did not only depend on the observer's general ability to recognize facial emotions, or the target's general ability to express their emotion, but also on how well a particular observer could "tune in" to a particular target's affect.</s><s>Changes in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>Overall, observers conducted more button presses to "approach" the observed targets after than before emotion observation (T[39] = 3.7, P &lt; 0.001; please see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> for results for self-reported interpersonal attraction).</s><s>This is in line with previous research that shows that familiarity increases interpersonal attraction (e.g., 41).</s><s>However, the critical question in the current study was whether emotion observation can lead to changes in interpersonal attraction that differ between observers, such that one observer feels more attracted to a particular target after emotion observation whereas another observer feels less attracted to the same target, even though both observers saw exactly the same behavior.</s><s>Intriguingly, this was the case.</s><s>Between-subject variability of the number of button presses observers conducted to approach a given target (measured as the width of the 66% interval of button presses for each target) was significantly larger after emotion observation (mean width of the 66% interval for each target, 7.4 ± 0.6 button presses) than before emotion observation (mean width of the 66% interval for each target, 6.2 ± 0.4 button presses) (T[5] = 2.7, P = 0.040; Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; please see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> for results for self-reported interpersonal attraction).</s></p><p><s>Self-reported confidence and individual changes in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>Next, we asked whether the observed changes in in-terpersonal attraction were predicted by the observers' confidence that they correctly understood the targets' affective state.</s><s>To test this, we computed partial correlations between each observer's confidence ratings and postobservation attraction scores for each target.</s><s>Importantly, to ensure that this correlation was not driven by the observer's initial attraction toward the targets, any variance that could be explained by preobservation attraction (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>) was removed from confidence ratings and postobservation attraction scores.</s><s>This revealed significant positive partial correlations between the observer's confidence and postobservation attraction both at the behavioral-motivational level (approach behavior) and at the level of self-report (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>To further control for potential differences between targets in physical attractiveness and facial expressivity, we removed average confidence ratings and average attraction scores for each target ("general target effects," ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref>) from each individual dataset and performed the same partial correlation analyses as above.</s><s>As predicted, partial correlations between self-reported confidence and self-reported interpersonal attraction remained significant after general target effects had been removed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that the link between confidence and changes in interpersonal attraction cannot be fully explained by a target's general attractiveness or expressivity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment II.</head><p><s>Behavioral data: Emotion judgments, self-reported confidence, and individual changes in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>Behavioral data of experiment II largely replicated those of experiment I. Observers (28 women, 24 men) correctly labeled the target's emotional state in the majority of trials (mean hit rate 75 ± 2.5%, T[51] = 30, P &lt; 0.001), and their self-reported confidence closely reflected the actual correctness of their emotion judgments for a given target (mean back-transformed r = 0.42 ± 0.01, T[51] = 4.1, P &lt; 0.001).</s><s>Furthermore, there was a significant observer-by-target interaction in self-reported confidence similar to that observed in experiment I (two-way ANOVA with between-subject factor observer [52 levels], within-subject factor target [6 levels], and the observers' confidence ratings as dependent variable [n = 52 × 6 × 16 = 4,992 trials]; main effect target, F[5,255] = 41, P &lt; 0.001, eta 2 = 45; observer-by-target interaction, F[255,4624] = 2.9, P &lt; 0.001, eta 2 = 0.14).</s><s>As in experiment I, observers conducted more button presses to approach the observed targets after than before emotion observation (T[51] = 2.7, P = 0.005), and between-subject variability of the number of button presses observers conducted to approach a given target increased significantly from preobservation (mean width of the 66% interval for each target 7.8 ± 0.5 button presses) to postobservation (mean width of the 66% interval for each target 9.1 ± 0.5 button presses) Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; please see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> for results for selfreported interpersonal attraction).</s><s>Finally, the pattern of correlations between self-reported confidence and interpersonal attraction closely reflected that of experiment I, with partial correlations between self-reported confidence and self-reported interpersonal attraction remaining significant after general target effects had been removed from each individual dataset (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Neural confidence signals in the brain's reward system.</s><s>In the first step of the fMRI data analysis, we examined whether the observers' subjective confidence that they correctly understood the target's affective state was associated with neural activity in reward-related brain regions.</s><s>For this, we used whole-brain univariate correlation analyses.</s><s>First, we computed the correlation between each observer's trial-by-trial confidence ratings and trial-by-trial neural activity during the facial observation period.</s><s>This revealed a significant positive correlation between self-reported confidence and neural activity in the right ventral striatum (x = 18, y = 6, z = −15; T[51] = 5.7, P = 0.022, familywise error [FWE]-corrected at voxel level; Fig. <ref type="figure">3 A and B</ref>).</s><s>Second, we computed the correlation between each observer's trial-by-trial confidence ratings and trial-bytrial neural activity during the emotion judgment period.</s><s>This revealed a significant positive correlation between self-reported confidence and neural activity in the mOFC (x = −3, y = 39, z = −18; T[51] = 4.9, k = 503, P &lt; 0.001, FWE-corrected at cluster level; Fig. <ref type="figure">3 E and F</ref>) (please see Table <ref type="table">S3</ref> for brain regions outside the reward system where neural activity increased significantly with increasing subjective confidence).</s></p><p><s>ROI analysis: Neural confidence signals in the brain's reward system and individual changes in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>Having shown that the observer's self-reported confidence reflected neural activity in the brain's reward system, we next asked whether these confidence-related neural signals would predict changes in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>For this, we averaged the neural activity within the two clusters in the ventral striatum and mOFC, separately for each observer and target, and performed a partial correlation analysis between this neural activity and the observer's postobservation attraction scores for each target (with variance explained by preobservation attraction removed from both variables).</s><s>This revealed significant positive partial correlations between confidence-related neural activity and the observer's approach behavior in both clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> C and G and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Again, these partial correlations remained significant when general target effects (i.e., average levels of confidence-related neural activity and average attraction scores for each target across all observers) were removed from each individual dataset (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> D and H and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The only brain region outside the reward system that showed a similar pattern of partial correlations was the lingual gyrus (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To ensure that the observed partial correlations between confidence-related neural activity and postobservation attraction were not due to the fact that we used the observer's confidence ratings (which we already knew predicted changes in interpersonal attraction) to identify clusters in the reward system that showed confidencerelated neural activity, we performed a split-half cross-validation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref> (see SI Materials and Methods for details).</s><s>This analysis replicated the significant partial correlations between confidence-related neural activity and postobservation attraction in the ventral striatum and mOFC (ventral striatum, mean back-transformed r = 0.17, T[51] = 1.9, P = 0.033;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The goal of this study was to examine whether the human brain possesses a neural mechanism that attracts individuals to other individuals whose nonverbal signals they can easily understand.</s><s>To pursue this goal, we conducted two experiments.</s><s>In line with our first prediction, data of experiment I and behavioral data of experiment II show that an individual's interpersonal attraction toward another person can change after a few minutes of emotion observation, depending on the individual's subjective confidence that they correctly understood the other's affective state.</s><s>fMRI data from experiment II provide an initial understanding of the neural processes that mediate between subjective understanding and interpersonal attraction.</s><s>First, we found that individual changes in interpersonal attraction were predicted by confidence-related neural signals in the ventral striatum and the mOFC, core regions of the brain's reward system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</s><s>Second, we found that both the observer's subjective confidence and neural confidence signals in the mOFC covaried with the degree of similarity between patterns of neural activity elicited during emotion observation and those associated with the observer's own emotional experience (NOE matching).</s><s>This suggests that an individual's confidence in their interpersonal judgments of affect, and ensuing changes in interpersonal attraction, is partly determined by how well the other person's affective behavior matches the observer's neural representation of the underlying state.</s></p><p><s>Confidence Signals in the Brain's Reward System.</s><s>The first important finding of the current study is that confidence-related neural activity in the brain's reward system can act as an intrinsic reward signal, predicting individual changes in interpersonal attraction.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that neural activity in the ventral striatum signals internal confidence when subjects make perceptual judgments about physical stimuli such as circles, lines, and moving dots <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>.</s><s>The current study shows that neural activity in the ventral striatum/mOFC covaries with subjective confidence when participants try to infer another person's current affective state from their facial expression.</s><s>This underlines a modality-independent role of the ventral striatum/mOFC in signaling confidence.</s><s>Furthermore, confidence-related neural activity in the ventral striatum/mOFC predicted changes in the observer's interpersonal attraction toward the target, providing behavioral evidence that confidence-related activity in the brain's reward system can act as a positive reinforcement signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Three details of these findings are worth further discussion.</s><s>First, we observed a temporal dissociation of neural confidence signals in the ventral striatum and in the mOFC: Confidence-related neural activity in the ventral striatum occurred during the facial observation period of each trial, whereas confidence-related neural activity in the mOFC occurred later, during the emotion judgment period.</s><s>This is in line with previous work that has shown a similar temporal dissociation of neural activity in the ventral striatum/mOFC during face evaluation, which has led to the suggestion that the mOFC has a particular role in holding the outcome of stimulus evaluations online for further processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Second, neural confidence signals in both the ventral striatum and the mOFC were more closely associated with subsequent changes in the observer's approach behavior toward the target than with changes in self-reported interpersonal attraction, whereas the observer's subjective confidence that they correctly understood the target's affective state was more closely associated with changes in self-reported interpersonal attraction.</s><s>This is in line with previous studies that have stressed the role of the ventral striatum in motivated behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and suggests a partial dissociation between neural processes underlying motivationalbehavioral and cognitive components of interpersonal attraction.</s></p><p><s>Third, confidence-related activity in the mOFC, but not in the ventral striatum, reflected the degree of similarity between patterns of neural activity elicited during emotion observation and those associated with the observer's own emotional states (NOE matching).</s><s>Again, this supports a particular role of the mOFC in holding the outcome of stimulus evaluations online for further processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>"Common Coding" and Success of Affective Communication.</s><s>The second important finding of the current study is that both the observer's subjective confidence and neural confidence signals in the mOFC reflected the level of correspondence between patterns of neural activity elicited in the anterior insula during emotion observation and those associated with the observer's own emotional experience (NOE matching).</s><s>This extends previous studies that observed overlapping activity in the anterior insula when participants experienced and observed pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>, disgust <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, or joy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and more recent studies that used MVPA to examine whether one's own pain and emotional experience and another person's pain and emotional experience are encoded in similar patterns of neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the results of the current study not only provide evidence that confidence can signal correspondence, they also indicate that confidence and correspondence covary across individual observer-target pairs.</s><s>This provides empirical evidence for theoretical models of social interaction and communication that propose that the more similar the observer's and the target's internal model of a given behavior, the easier it should be for the observer to understand the target's inner state and to react accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A similar link between correspondence of neural activity and success of communication has been observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).</s><s>A study using pseudohyperscanning (a technique where a "sender" and a "perceiver" are scanned one after the other in the same scanner but are connected by audio or video recordings such that their brain activity can be temporally aligned after scanning) showed that neural activity in the mPFC is time-locked between speakers and listeners involved in verbal communication.</s><s>Strikingly, the listener's semantic understanding of the story told by the speaker varied as a function of the degree to which neural activity in the mPFC of the listener's brain at time point t 1 predicted the speaker's neural activity in that region at time point t 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</s><s>However, in that study, all stories were told by a single speaker, so it remains unclear whether there was a specific listener-by-speaker interaction, similar to the observer-by-target interaction observed in the current study.</s></p><p><s>Success of Communication and Interpersonal Attraction.</s><s>Until recently, neuroscientific research into interpersonal attraction has been guided by the view that an individual's primary goal when evaluating other individuals must be to identify potential mating partners who possess high genetic fitness and fertility (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>.</s><s>This research builds on a large literature that links physical attractiveness to genetic fitness (for a review, see, e.g., ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref>).</s><s>However, for species that live in complex environments that require social interaction and cooperation to maximize reproductive success, being able to identify the right cooperation partners might be equally important.</s><s>The current study provides evidence that potential cooperation partners qualify as right not only by their willingness and competence to cooperate (14-17) (for a theoretical account see, e.g., ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref>) but also by the degree to which their communication signals can be reliably decoded by the other individual.</s><s>Importantly, unlike interpersonal attraction due to a target's fitness-signaling physical features, which seems to be fairly consistent across perceivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>, the confidence-dependent adjustment of interpersonal attraction found in the current study seems to be specific for specific interaction partners.</s><s>Indeed, observers showed more disagreement about which target they felt attracted to after than before emotion observation.</s><s>In social psychology it has long been recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> that attraction between individuals is not only determined by general target effects (e.g., a target's physical attractiveness) but also by specific perceiver-bytarget effects (relational effects) such as the match between a target's affective behavior and a perceiver's neural vocabulary we describe here.</s><s>Interestingly, it has been suggested that such interaction partner-specific effects could underlie the forming of social cliques within larger groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>.</s><s>The current study provides evidence that the brain's reward system, signaling how well one's neural vocabulary is suited to decode another person's behavior, might play an important role in these social processes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion.</head><p><s>In sum, we have shown that subjective understanding during social interaction can modulate interpersonal attraction.</s><s>Interestingly, the findings of the current study suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying individual adjustments of interpersonal attraction during social encounters might act through internal reward signals that are partly independent of external feedback, which makes them perhaps less prone to cheating by potential cooperation partners.</s><s>To investigate the interaction between intrinsic confidence signals and other-honest or manipulative-signals sent back and forth between communication partners and to examine the neural determinants of the dynamics of human social relations in larger groups ("social connectomes") remain challenging tasks for future studies.</s><s>The current study suggests that mutual understanding is an important factor in interpersonal attraction, and that further research into the role of a common neural vocabulary in interpersonal attraction will lead to a better understanding of the neurobiological factors that define human social relations.</s></p></div>

trials were intermixed with a total of 96 short presentations (200 ms) of still pictures of each target (16 presentations per target) and targets were fully balanced over arrows and words, so that

was reached.</s><s>This task is a modified version of a task originally introduced by Aharon and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> to measure the reward value of faces, except that the task used in the current study additionally mimics approach behavior by increasing the size of the target with each button press.</s></p><p><s>Second, to assess the participants' self-reported attraction toward each target, they were shown a still picture of each target (1 s) followed by three statements about their interpersonal attraction toward the target.</s><s>The statements were adapted from the "social attraction" items in <ref type="bibr">McCroskey and McCain (58)</ref> and related to the participant's subjective motivation to meet the target in real life (willingness to
