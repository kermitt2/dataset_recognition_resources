mainstay of the treatment of RA.</s><s>Combination therapy with MTX and anti-TNF biologics has been demonstrated to inhibit structural damage and improve disease activity to a greater extent than monotherapy with either the biologic or MTX alone. <ref type="bibr">3 4 15 16</ref></s><s>The coadministration of MTX can improve efficacy by suppressing the formation of antidrug antibodies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> which are associated with reduced serum levels and clinical response. <ref type="bibr">18 19</ref></s><s>he increased efficacy could also be attributed to MTX and TNF inhibitors acting on different molecular pathways, thus providing additive effects.</s><s>However, some patients may experience MTX-related toxicities, with some discontinuing MTX as a result.</s><s>Here, we examined the prevalence, onset and severity of MTX-related toxicities (specified in the label) in relation to the efficacy of combination therapy with ADA+MTX, in two different trial populations: MTX-na√Øve patients with early RA, and patients with established RA and an inadequate response to MTX.</s><s>These trials were unique in design, since the patients were blinded to the dose of MTX, and thus for instance did not know if they took 2.5 or 20 mg.</s></p><p><s>In both study populations, the majority of AEs to MTX were mild and led to discontinuation in only 0.5% (CONCERTO) or 1.3% (MUSICA) of patients.</s><s>The rate of MTX-related toxic events remained steady (around 20%), while efficacy increased over time.</s><s>Consistent with this observation, the proportion of patients who achieved efficacy as measured by an ACR50 response increased over time.</s><s>Few patients experienced toxicity without efficacy, and in general this proportion decreased over time, concomitant with an increase in the proportion of patients who achieved efficacy.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, in both populations, efficacy was achieved despite reported MTX-related toxicity, which remained stable.</s><s>Across both trials, approximately 40% of patients experienced a toxic event before achieving an ACR50 response.</s><s>Of the MTX-related toxic events, infections were the most frequent.</s><s>Although not specified on the MTX label, hepatotoxicity is a commonly noted MTX-related AE; however, in both trial populations included here, hepatotoxic events were infrequent (0.5% and 0.6% in CONCERTO and MUSICA, respectively) and cytopaenias occurred at a low rate in CONCERTO (0.5%), and not in MUSICA.</s><s>This may reflect continuous folate administration required in both trials.</s></p><p><s>In CONCERTO, but not MUSICA, there was an increased incidence of MTX-related AEs in groups receiving higher MTX doses.</s><s>Efficacy showed MTX dose dependence, with the 2.5 mg dose and 5 mg MTX dose appearing to have similar efficacy, as did the 10 mg and 20 mg MTX doses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref></s><s>In MUSICA, ACR50 as well as ACR20/70 responses, were numerically slightly higher for the 20 mg/week MTX group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref></s><s>TX is modified in bone-marrow erythrocytes, by the addition of glutamate moieties to form chains of 1-2 (short chain), 3 (long chain) or 4-5 (very long chain) PG derivatives. <ref type="bibr">20 21</ref></s><s>These intracellular MTX-PG derivatives persist long after the decrease of serum levels of MTX, and have been shown to be associated with treatment efficacy in RA. <ref type="bibr">10 11 22</ref> In CONCERTO, but not MUSICA, there was a dose-dependent increase in MTX-PG1+2, 3 and 4-5.</s><s>Preliminary analysis (not shown) demonstrated that weight was not a significant covariate for the accumulation of MTX-PG1+2 in either trial.</s><s>In a Japanese cohort, MTX-PG accumulation was shown to be dependent on body mass index rather than body weight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref></s><s>MTX-related toxicity did not appear to be driven by MTX-PG, in patients from either trial, as indicated by the similar pattern of PG accumulation in patients who experienced or did not experience MTX toxicity.</s><s>However, it is possible that the MTX-PG is not the sole contributor to MTX-related AEs.</s><s>In MUSICA, the apparently higher MTX-PG1+2 levels at baseline for the 20 mg/week MTX group in patients with AEs compared with patients without AEs was due to one of the two patients in this group having a relatively high MTX PG1+2 concentration, contributing to the high mean MTX PG1+2 for this group.</s></p><p><s>MTX-related toxicity and ADA+MTX treatment efficacy showed similar patterns in both the early and established RA populations examined here.</s><s>We used the ACR50 response, which indicates a substantial improvement over baseline, to measure efficacy.</s><s>An inherent limitation is that due to the lack of monotherapy comparator arms, AEs due to ADA cannot be separated from those due to MTX alone, and the 6-month period over which both populations were assessed for toxicity and efficacy is relatively short.</s><s>As opposed to CONCERTO, patients included in MUSICA were already treated with MTX and thus represent a selected group who had not experienced intolerance to MTX.</s><s>Additionally, the mean disease duration for patients in MUSICA and CONCERTO was 5.3 years and 0.3 years, respectively.</s><s>These differences in study design and disease duration may explain why toxicity was observed in the same proportion in 7.5 mg/week and on May 17, 2022 by guest.</s><s>Protected by copyright.</s><s>http://rmdopen.bmj.com/</s><s>RMD Open 20 mg/week in MUSICA, whereas toxicity occurred in a higher proportion among patients receiving the highest doses of MTX in CONCERTO (online supplementary figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Although the route of administration has been reported to impact the tolerability of MTX, patients in both studies included here only received orally administered MTX, so this could not be evaluated.</s><s>As opposed to a clinical setting with most likely, lower drug adherence, all the patients in this analysis were enrolled in a clinical trial, which may have contributed to a cleaner safety profile for MTX.</s><s>Conversely, target dosing is often achieved more rapidly in a trial versus clinical setting, which may have accentuated some minor MTX-related AEs.</s><s>The observations in MUSICA are possibly closer to a real-world clinical setting, where ADA plus MTX combination treatment is not administered to MTX-na√Øve patients.</s><s>Monotherapy versus combination therapy with MTX has been studied for biologics with other mechanisms of action.</s><s>Patients with early RA receiving abatacept plus MTX had greater benefits than those on MTX monotherapy, with a similar safety profile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref></s><s>MTX-inadequate responders receiving tocilizumab (TCZ) plus MTX experienced a similar level of disease control but reported more events of elevated liver transaminases versus patients receiving TCZ monotherapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s>n summary, treatment with MTX, especially in combination with TNF inhibitors, offers many benefits over monotherapy.</s><s>Our study shows that significant MTX-related toxicity was low, did not preclude the development of a clinical response to ADA+MTX treatment and did not appear to be driven by MTX-PGs.</s><s>In patients with both early and established RA, most MTX-related toxic events were mild and remained at steady rates while efficacy continued to increase.</s><s>Overall, out of 704 patients in the two studies, only 6 (&lt;1%) discontinued due to MTX toxicity.</s></p></div><figure
