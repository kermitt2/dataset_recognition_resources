<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social support from primary networks: family and friends</head><p><s>The family occupies a predominant position as a source of social support in old age <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chappell &amp;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present study</head><p><s>This article focuses on analyzing perceived social support from several sources and its association with QoL.</s><s>The majority of studies tend to analyze the role of intimate or close social support networks in well-being.</s><s>However, few studies identify community as a significant dimension of analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gracia &amp; Herrero, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Heinze, Kruger, Reischl, Cupal, &amp; Zimmerman, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>For this reason, the present research includes personal (primary) and community (secondary) support.</s></p><p><s>In specific terms, we analyze the association between social support from personal/primary social networks (social support from partner, children, grandchildren, siblings, other family members, and friends) and community social networks (social support from neighbors and neighborhood, group companions and formal social support networks) with QoL for a sample of older Chilean adults.</s><s>Specifically, the following hypotheses are formulated:</s></p><p><s>1. Support from primary groups: 1a.</s><s>Family social support.</s><s>It is expected that social support from partner, children, and other family members will be positively associated with QoL.</s><s>This hypothesis is based on the proximity and importance of interaction with these sources in the case of older persons.</s><s>This proximity means that the nuclear family (partner/children) is clearly central, as well as potentially those extended family members who live or interact daily with the older person.</s></p><p><s>1b. Social support from friends.</s><s>A positive relationship is hypothesized between this variable and QoL.</s><s>As stated, support from this source tends to be functionally equivalent to that received from other sources of support whose importance falls as a person ages (children, grandchildren, etc.) during old age.</s></p><p><s>2. Support from secondary groups: social support from community.</s><s>Social support from community sources is expected to be positively associated with QoL.</s><s>In this same regard and as the empirical evidence shows, integration in the community increases feelings of well-being in old age.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p><s>The sample was made up of 777 older Chilean adults living in the region of Arica and Parinacota, in the far north of Chile.</s><s>Use was made of a sample stratified by sex, ethnicity and place of residence (rural and urban) to ensure representativeness.</s><s>The fundamental characteristics of the sample are set forth in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Notable among these data are the average age (69.93 years; SD = 7.12) and the presence in the sample of a percentage of older adults belonging to an indigenous ethnicity (30%), the Aymara ethnicity being the most common (88% of cases).</s><s>The research was conducted in five different places: Arica, Putre, Socoroma, Visviri, and Codpa.</s><s>Participants were contacted via two procedures.</s><s>When possible and desirable, the research team made first contact directly and arranged an appointment to perform the interview.</s><s>When first contact entailed greater difficulty, it was made via key social agents, including council personnel (mainly social workers) and the most important neighborhood leaders (priest, president of the neighborhood board).</s><s>In both cases, the interviewer attended the place indicated for the interview, which took 40 min to complete.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our results show that having social support from primary and secondary networks is related with higher levels of QoL, showing the importance of considering social support on the basis of where it has come from (the source).</s></p><p><s>In this regard, the coexistence of significant effects for support from primary and secondary groups suggests that heterogeneity in network composition could enable older persons to access support in a more flexible and QoL-enhancing fashion.</s><s>This interpretation is consistent with previous studies concluding that diversely or heterogeneously composed sources of support are linked to better well-being in old age, since they permit broader social integration and access to various types of support <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Nguyen, 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our hypotheses relating to primary groups were to a large extent confirmed.</s><s>This statement is particularly true when describing support from friends.</s><s>Along the lines of previous research, this source of support is of great significance for QoL in our sample.</s><s>The available empirical evidence suggests that the aging process increases the importance of friends in the context of primary groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Faquinello &amp; Silva, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Li, Ji, &amp; Chen, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In terms of the analysis of support from primary groups, where our results are of special note is their significance for the consideration of the family group.</s><s>In this vein, it is important to note that not all sources of family support analyzed influence QoL.</s><s>In this vein, support from grandchildren, siblings and extended family members did not reach significance in our last model (model 4).</s><s>Several implications can be stated.</s><s>Firstly, this finding invites a discussion of the specific role of social support from family in Latin American family-oriented contexts (such as Chile) in the promotion of QoL in old age.</s><s>It is absolutely necessary to take into account that in Chile as in many other Latin American countries, family is changingand the family's role of caring for older adults is also changing as a result <ref type="bibr">(Melchiorre et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Though the debate over well-being in old age may revolve around family composition and the possibility of substitution of its members (robust network), the scientific literature proposes that the possibility of enjoying well-being in old age will depend on the capacity of the older adult to be flexible in seeking support and optimizing the social resources available to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Jopp &amp; Rott, 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Secondly (and in related fashion), the particular findings of this research show how the inclusion of social support from secondary groups (model 4) increases the explanatory capacity of the model in a particularly significant manner.</s><s>In fact, the inclusion of the variables evaluating social support from the community increases the explanatory capacity of the model to almost 26% of variance in QoL, while the variables measuring support from primary groups (model 3) account for 14.5%.</s><s>These findings underline the importance of the surrounding community as a source of support (and especially of neighborhood relationships and those occurring within the context of voluntary groups) in the promotion of QoL at advanced ages.</s><s>Our results are in line with recent studies showing how the creation of social support networks with neighbors and the promotion of social participation in older persons' groups prevent loneliness and are positively associated with QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Coll-Planes et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thirdly, it is necessary to note that the importance in our results of social support from secondary networks has both a quantitative and qualitative dimension.</s><s>A careful comparison of our models 3 (support from primary and secondary groups) and 4 (support from primary groups) reveals that informal support from the community and community integration explain the effect obtained in model 3 for support from extended family.</s><s>This result means that the only two family sources that contribute to the improvement of QoL in our sample are partner and children.</s><s>The significant effect of support from friends is maintained.</s><s>As a whole, this pattern of results suggests a specificity of primary and secondary networks in the generation of social support, on one hand, and the key role of community as a source of support in the case of older persons, on the other.</s><s>This conclusion is reinforced if we examine a second particularly significant variation in our model 4. As may be observed, the inclusion of the variables measuring social support from community explains the statistically significant association of the size of support network present in model 3.</s><s>These results suggest that the role of the community does not derive from its influence on extension of the network in structural terms, but rather from the capacity of that network to create feelings of belonging and integration and to increase the perception of social support among older persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Herrero &amp; Gracia, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sánchez-Moreno, 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Social support from primary and secondary groups can operate through several mechanisms for enhancing QoL: social influence/social comparison, social control, role-based purpose and meaning (mattering), selfesteem, sense of control, belonging and companionship, and perceived availability of support <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Thoits, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Given the results obtained in this study, these mechanisms may differ depending on the source of support (primary or secondary).</s><s>Specifically, partner, children, and friends exercise social control in the daily lives of older adults, since they attempt to supervise, monitor, persuade or even pressure the person to maintain positive practices.</s><s>The most concrete example is support in the medical treatment of chronic illnesses <ref type="bibr">(Penninx et al., 1999)</ref>, but also promoting physical or mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mui, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Seeman, 2000)</ref> and improving the sense of being loved and cared for.</s><s>All these mechanisms would be characteristic of intimacy, of a confidence-based relationship.</s><s>On the other hand, social support from members of the neighborhood community or group peers act in areas such as influence/social comparison.</s><s>In other words, they influence the behavior associated with healthy lifestyleswhether promoting physical activity or maintaining a balanced diet <ref type="bibr">(Brown et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>They are also associated with a feeling of belonging and companionship; this recognition implies acceptance by and integration within a group, which not only guarantees security but also forms part of a circuit of reciprocal social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Herrero &amp; Gracia, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Future research can be oriented to the clarification of potential different mechanisms implied in the promoting effect on QoL of social support from Though this research focuses on perceived social support, it is also worth mentioning some implications for the study of social networks.</s><s>It would seem that the availability of heterogeneous social networks provides access to a more flexible, open and dynamic support system for older adults.</s><s>This type of network can be more versatile in providing social support during crisis situations or merely in daily life.</s><s>Available evidence suggests that there are four kinds of networks identified in terms of composition in old age: diverse, family-focused, non-kin-focused, and restricted <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Nguyen, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Those relying on restricted networks were more likely to be lonely and isolated compared to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Burholt &amp; Dobbs, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, diverse social networks offer greater social integration to older persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Nguyen, 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Along these lines, the results of our research suggest a significant role for support from the community, which in turn appears important for the design of social work intervention programs.</s><s>The importance of aging in the living space <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(McDonough &amp; Davitt, 2011)</ref> implies that it is appropriate to adjust the community environment to the support needs of older adults, in order to reduce loneliness and increase contexts of social interaction (Prieto-Flores, <ref type="bibr">Fernández-Mayoralas, Forjaz, &amp; Martinez-Martin, 2011)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>This study presents certain limitations that must be taken into account.</s></p><p><s>First and most importantly, the study is cross-sectional in design, which impedes establishing causal relations among variables.</s><s>Analysis of the theoretical and empirical background and the literature examining the relationship between social support and well-being in general suggest that our general approach, hypotheses, strategic analysis and interpretation of results represent a contribution to the knowledge of QoL among older persons.</s><s>However, certain elements of QoL may be at the root of differences in levels of perceived social support, especially when the sources of that support are secondary groups.</s><s>This is the case for physical and mental health problems.</s><s>It is hence necessary to conduct research designed in a manner that permits clarification of the meaning of the causal relationship, taking into account the possibility that such relationship between QoL and social support may be bidirectional.</s><s>Secondly, future research should examine possible differences on the basis of disadvantaged groups, especially those defined by sex and ethnicity.</s><s>Both groups have experienced tougher life pathways in Chile, which translate into an old age with greater likelihood of social risk and vulnerability.</s><s>It is hence important for social policy in Chile to retrieve information and generate knowledge in order to discuss the dynamics of positive discrimination in favor of socially disadvantaged groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications</head><p><s>In summary, social support from secondary groups is a key factor in understanding QoL at advanced ages.</s><s>Perhaps the main contribution of this study relates to the understanding of social support from secondary groups (specifically, the community) in the case of older persons.</s><s>In this regard, our results emphasize the importance of informal supportbeyond the support generated in formal institutionsand of community integration and a sense of belonging,beyond the direct participation of older persons in matters affecting their community.</s><s>The role played by community support complements and contributes to promote well-being among elderly people when support from primary groupsespecially familyreduces its intensity.</s><s>In Chile and in various cultural contexts, there has been a change in the close networks of older adults toward a combination of family members and friendships.</s><s>In a further step, our results suggest that networks open to a broader composition are related with increased well-being in old age <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fiori, Antonucci, &amp; Cortina, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gray, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Li &amp; Zhang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Pahl &amp; Pevalin, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>In Latin American contexts such as Chile where there is a lack of a robust social protection system for the elderly, the work performed by these secondary networks is important.</s></p><p><s>It is hence necessary to continue to conduct studies analyzing the specific role of the benefits of social networksand in specific terms, the buffering mechanisms in terms of social support offered by these social networks.</s><s>It is important to emphasize that our results indicate a notable level of importance for informal community support, but not for support from formal/institutional organizations.</s></p><p><s>This suggests that intervention in this respect should be oriented not only toward strengthening the role of public or formal institutions, but rather toward the development of informal community associations and links.</s></p><p><s>There are social policies in Chile such as the Vínculos (Links) program aimed at strengthening the contact networks of older adults.</s><s>Specifically, social workers are the professionals who integrate older adults within various community networks and peer groups (National Service for Elderly People).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>The questionnaire was applied via personal interview, having first obtained the informed consent of participants.</s><s>Qualified social work and psychology professionals administered it between June and August 2015.</s><s>The Ethics Committee of Taracapá University and the National Council for Science and Technology of Chile approved and monitored the ethical aspects of the study.</s><s>All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
