<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a world-wide health concern and risk factor for cardio-metabolic diseases.</s><s>Citrate uptake modifies intracellular hepatic energy metabolism and is controlled by the conserved sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter solute carrier family 13 member 5 (SLC13A5, mammalian homolog of INDY: mINDY).</s><s>In Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans INDY reduction decreased whole-body lipid accumulation.</s><s>Genetic deletion of Slc13a5 in mice protected from diet-induced adiposity and insulin resistance.</s><s>We hypothesized that inducible hepatic mINDY inhibition should prevent the development of fatty liver and hepatic insulin resistance.</s><s>Methods: Adult C57BL/6J mice were fed a Western diet (60% kcal from fat, 21% kcal from carbohydrate) ad libitum.</s><s>Knockdown of mINDY was induced by weekly injection of a chemically modified, liver-selective siRNA for 8 weeks.</s><s>Mice were metabolically characterized and the effect of mINDY suppression on glucose tolerance as well as insulin sensitivity was assessed with an ipGTT and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.</s><s>Hepatic lipid accumulation was determined by biochemical measurements and histochemistry.</s><s>Results: Within the 8 week intervention, hepatic mINDY expression was suppressed by a liver-selective siRNA by over 60%.</s><s>mINDY knockdown improved hepatic insulin sensitivity (i.e.</s><s>insulin-induced suppression of endogenous glucose production) of C57BL/6J mice in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.</s><s>Moreover, the siRNA-mediated mINDY inhibition prevented neutral lipid storage and triglyceride accumulation in the liver, while we found no effect on body weight.</s><s>Conclusions: We show that inducible mINDY inhibition improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and prevented diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adult C57BL6/J mice.</s><s>These effects did not depend on changes of body weight or body composition.</s></p></div>

function.</s><s>Along these lines, mINDY KO mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity, IR and FLD <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, the contribution of single organs and tissues is difficult to discern in constitutive whole-body KO animals.</s><s>Our data reveal that the effect of mINDY on liver fat and insulin sensitivity can be dissociated from an effect on adiposity.</s><s>Specifically, our siRNA-based experiments show improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and prevention of FLD, although body weight is unchanged in the treated animals.</s><s>Thus, a liver-specific phenotype does not require changes of wholebody fat or body weight.</s><s>Recent data from another study using RNAi in rats to inhibit mINDY showed similar results <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>However, that study did not demonstrate specificity or liver-selectivity of the investigated siRNA.</s><s>Therefore, it remained unclear, which effects can be observed by liver-specific knockdown.</s><s>Additionally, the authors did not provide further data on the inhibition.</s><s>We evaluated our modified siRNA in vitro (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1AeC</ref>) and tested the efficacy, specificity, and liverselectivity by screening mINDY expression in liver, kidney, and muscle as well as the hepatic expression of other family members (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D,E and 2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Considering the results of the KO and the fact that mINDY is predominantly expressed in liver, we found the lack of any difference in body weight somewhat surprising and speculated that eventually our experiment was too short to induce changes of body weight.</s><s>We suggest that conditional KO experiments should investigate the role of e.g.</s><s>neuron-specific mINDY expression in the brain on energy homeostasis.</s><s>It should also be noted that the knockdown resulted in approximately 35% remaining mINDY activity and that we here investigated an acute inhibition of mINDY while the genetic KO has a complete deletion of mINDY activity over the whole period of life, including prenatal development, which may also explain differences between the genetic KO model and the here observed findings.</s></p><p><s>For the siRNA-treated mice we assessed the insulin sensitivity using the HE clamp.</s><s>Comparable to the KO experiments, we observed improved hepatic insulin sensitivity with a strongly reduced EGP even though the knockdown efficiency was not 100% such as with the mINDY KO.</s><s>We showed that none of the other presumably relevant transporters compensated for mINDY knockdown or was targeted by the liver-selective mINDY-specific siRNA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>).</s><s>The siRNA appeared to affect also whole-body insulin sensitivity, although these effects were not significant.</s><s>Mice exhibited a higher GIR during the HE clamp and a more substantial reduction of NEFA in reaction to hyperinsulinemia during the HE clamp.</s><s>Specific 2-DG uptake into peripheral tissues (SKM and WAT) was not affected by mINDY inhibition during the HE clamp (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4F</ref>).</s><s>Notably, the KO showed a significantly increased glucose uptake into SKM during a HE clamp <ref type="bibr"

not target SKM, which most likely explains the lacking effect on glucose uptake into SKM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>).</s><s>Our experimental setting did not include overt

relevant for triglyceride metabolism.</s><s>Decreased activity of mINDY (or its orthologs) in D. melanogaster and C. elegans increased longevity similarly to caloric restriction and was associated with reduced lipid accumulation in those organisms <ref type="bibr">[11,20e22,40,41]</ref>.</s><s>mINDY deletion in mice decreased HFD-induced adiposity, lipid accumulation into liver and SKM, and improved insulin sensitivity without affecting caloric intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to those data, we now show that mINDY inhibition has a considerable therapeutic potential and that effects on local lipid accumulation are unlikely to depend on changes in the degree of adiposity.</s><s>Some limitations of our study should be mentioned.</s><s>Our approach has a considerable risk of off-target effects.</s><s>Although we aimed to establish a rather specific approach, some of those effects are likely to exist.</s><s>Array data from control and siINDY-treated mice did not show any altered regulation or off-target effects (data not shown).</s><s>Thus, the findings described here are likely to result from mINDY inhibition rather than non-specific effects.</s></p><p><s>Although we demonstrated that our siRNA inhibited mINDY predominantly in the liver and did not affect expression in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, or kidney, we cannot entirely exclude that other organs may have been affected such as central nervous system.</s><s>Considering our modifications, the siRNA should not have crossed the bloodebrainbarrier.</s><s>However, this has not been analyzed directly and future experiments on the role of mINDY in the brain are desirable.</s><s>HFD in C57BL/ 6 mice usually does not induce substantial hepatitis within the given time period <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless mINDY and HFD may modify infiltration of specific immune cells.</s><s>Due to the radioactive state of the material after clamp, a detailed immune cell phenotyping of the liver was not performed within our study and would be desirable in future studies.</s></p><p><s>Our findings suggest that mINDY inhibition is a reasonable therapeutic option to prevent FLD.</s><s>However, our data are restricted to rodents, and it is unclear whether comparable effects can be observed in humans.</s><s>Despite this uncertainty, notably comparable findings on lipid accumulation were observed in C. elegans and D. melanogaster <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr"

investigate the potential of this therapeutic approach.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that mINDY is involved in regulation of liver fat metabolism.</s><s>Its inhibition by a liver-specific siRNA is a reasonable approach to prevent FLD in C57BL/6J mice on WD; however, it had no effect on body weight.</s><s>Our data support that effects on hepatic lipid accumulation occur independent of body weight changes or whole-body fat content.</s><s>We suggest that non-liver mINDY effects, such as brain activity, may mediate potential effects on body weight.</s><s>Future
