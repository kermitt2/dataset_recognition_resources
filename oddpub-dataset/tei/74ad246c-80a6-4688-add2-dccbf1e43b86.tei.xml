<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study aimed to investigate whether adult hippocampal neurogenesis in CADASIL can be influenced in short-and long-term by physiological stimuli, which have been shown to robustly enhance it in healthy animals and neuropathological disease models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s><s>We found that the long-term survival of new neurons was reduced in Notch3 overexpressing but not CADASIL mice under STD cage conditions compared to WT.</s><s>Moreover, shortand long-term neurogenic stimulation by RUN or ENR apparently failed in both transgenic mouse lines.</s></p><p><s>The decreased neurogenesis in Notch3 overexpressing mice of the long-term group replicates the finding of our previous study in six-months-old TgN3 WT mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>The fact that the decreased neurogenesis already observed four weeks after BrdU cell labeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> is still evident after five more months, shows that this is really due to a suppression of cell proliferation by Notch3 overexpression, as suggested in our previous work, rather than an influence on cell  survival.</s><s>Notch3 and Notch1 are possibly co-expressed in proliferating hippocampal precursor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, Notch1 has been shown to be essential for progenitor pool maintenance and regulation of proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, it can be assumed that the suppression of cell proliferation by Notch3 is usually counteracted by Notch1-activated cell proliferation leading to a balanced cell proliferation rate.</s><s>Overexpression of Notch3 clearly shifts the balance towards a down-regulation of precursor cell proliferation.</s><s>Surprisingly, neurogenesis is not suppressed in TgN3 WT mice under short-term STD conditions.</s><s>This might indicate an age-dependency of Notch3-dependent suppression of hippocampal neurogenesis with a counteracting mechanism being effective in younger mice of the short-term group but being lost during ageing in the long-term group.</s></p><p><s>In CADASIL mice, neurogenesis is not decreased as in Notch3 overexpressing mice.</s><s>However, more newly generated cells differentiate into astrocytic cells in the long-term than in WT mice.</s><s>As astrocytes are critical for neurogenesis and the neuronal long-term survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , an increase in their portion here could represent a counteracting mechanism for a disturbed neurogenesis due to mutated and imbalanced Notch3.</s><s>In support of this hypothesis, we also found an increased amount of astrocytic cells in WT animals induced by short-term RUN, which is similar to our previous findings showing different stimuli selectively affecting distinct subpopulation of newly generated hippocampal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>This may point towards the need for an intact microenvironment in the DG for a functional neurogenesis, as the generation of astrocytes is enhanced by RUN in parallel to neurogenesis.</s></p><p><s>Usually, RUN and ENR of short-or long-term durations are robust neurogenic stimulants in healthy or aged animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and in various rodent models of neuropathological diseases such as Alzheimer's 29 and Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Here, RUN and ENR cage conditions increased hippocampal neurogenesis in healthy WT mice as expected.</s><s>Although Notch3 overexpressing mice of the short-term group ran more in the running wheel than WT mice, despite a reduced motor coordination tested on the Rotarod, neurogenesis remains unaffected.</s><s>This suggests that although neurogenesis is not yet reduced in younger TgN3 WT mice, it is already disturbed due to Notch3 overexpression as it could not be stimulated by RUN and ENR.</s><s>In support of this, we have demonstrated in our previous work using a KCl-activation neurosphere assay that the proliferative activity of neural precursor cells was potentially reduced by Notch3 overexpression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>This might have prevented the activation by RUN or ENR.</s><s>In contrast to the present results, Ables and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> have been able to restore neurogenesis by RUN in a Notch1 knock-out mouse.</s><s>Knock-out of Notch1 specifically diminished the undifferentiated cell pool in the SGZ causing a decreased neurogenesis.</s><s>RUN rescued the number of differentiated but not undifferentiated cells, indicating that this neurogenesis stimulation might not be mediated by Notch1.</s><s>To clarify, if Notch3 may be involved instead, as suggested by the present results, a similar knock-out model but for Notch3 or a Notch3 antagonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> could be used in follow-up studies.</s></p><p><s>In CADASIL mice, hippocampal neurogenesis was similarly not increased by RUN or ENR.</s><s>In contrast to Notch3 overexpressing mice, CADASIL mice showed reduced physical activity in the running wheels throughout both durations.</s><s>Motor coordination on the Rotarod was also impaired.</s><s>This might be interpreted as the level of physical activity in RUN, and probably also in ENR, being insufficient to stimulate neurogenesis under this  <ref type="figure">and c</ref>), during the first five days (d) under running wheel cage condition (RUN) and on Rotarod performance in transgenic mice corresponding to the 28 days group (e).</s><s>Running wheel activity is reduced in TgN3 R169C mice and duration-dependently decreased in TgN3 WT mice (a-d).</s><s>Motor coordination on the Rotarod is impaired in both transgenic mouse lines (e).</s><s>Results of pairwise comparisons following a significant one-way ANOVA are displayed in the graphs.</s><s>Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. *p &lt; 0.05, ***p &lt; 0.001.</s><s>neuropathological condition.</s><s>However, running wheel activity of less than 2000 m covered distance per day during 6 months has been shown to enhance neurogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>In the present study, CADASIL mice ran mostly more than 2000 m per 24 h.</s><s>Therefore, we suggest that the overexpression of mutated Notch3 disturbed the micromilieu of hippocampal precursor cells, which may have prevented these cells from reacting to RUN or ENR.</s><s>This implies that not only functional Notch3 is crucial for the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis but also its available amount in precursor cells itself and in the vascular neurogenic niche.</s><s>This is of particular importance from a therapeutic point of view as it suggests that in CADASIL mutated Notch3 not only needs to be replaced but also the balance needs to be maintained.</s></p><p><s>Similar to CADASIL mice, Notch3 overexpressing mice also showed reduced physical activity (&gt; 2000 m distance covered) in the long-term and no stimulation of neurogenesis by RUN or ENR.</s><s>But as they ran even more than WT mice in the short-term with still no change in neurogenesis levels, physical activity may not function as an adequate supportive therapy unless the amount of (functional) Notch3 is regulated at the same time.</s><s>In ENR, however, physical activity is only one stimulation aside from visual, social and olfactory interaction with numerous other mice in a diversified equipped large cage.</s><s>As the neurogenic stimulation by ENR was impaired to the same extent as by RUN, other functions than solely physical fitness could have been affected by mutated Notch3.</s><s>Possible candidates are motivation, curiosity or anxiety, all of which might have been reduced in the transgenic mice, thus preventing the full experience of and benefit from ENR.</s><s>This needs to be further investigated in these transgenic mouse lines.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we found that adult hippocampal neurogenesis per se is not altered in mice of the short-term group overexpressing wild type Notch3 or Notch3 with a CADASIL mutation.</s><s>However, neurogenesis could not be stimulated by RUN or ENR of either duration, which may indicate a disturbed neurogenic process that is not reflected on the basal neurogenesis level.</s><s>Considering this can be observed while no deficits in microcirculation or the vascular network have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , it suggests an additional independent role of Notch3 in hippocampal function.</s><s>We conclude that cell intrinsic deficits in Notch3 signaling contributing to changes in
