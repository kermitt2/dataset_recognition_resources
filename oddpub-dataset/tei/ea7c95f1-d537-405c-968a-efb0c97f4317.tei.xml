Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The hypothesis was also tested using the autologous serum skin test (ASST) <ref type="bibr">7</ref> in which 50 mL of fresh undiluted autologous serum was injected intradermally into the volar forearm.</s><s>Similar volumes of 0.9% NaCl saline and 100 mg/mL histamine were used as negative and positive controls.</s><s>The ASST was taken to be positive when the serum-induced wheal had a diameter at least 1.5 mm greater than the saline-induced wheal at 30 minutes.</s><s>For clinical reasons, the ASST was performed on 51 patients only.</s><s>Twelve of the 33 fast responders were ASST positive, whereas 10 of the 13 slow responders showed a positive ASST result (P 5.012; Fisher exact test; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, E and F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>There were no statistical differences between fast and slow omalizumab responders with respect to age, body mass index, or disease activity or duration.</s><s>Similarly, pretreatment IgE levels, neutralization rates of IgE, and free IgE and omalizumab levels posttreatment were not significantly different between slow and fast responders to omalizumab (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>).</s></p><p><s>When comparing BHRA with ASST, it must be realized that BHRA is more specific in that it was designed to identify serum IgG antibodies to FcεRI.</s><s>However, it is time consuming and may not be available in all clinics.</s><s>In contrast, the ASST is easy to perform clinically but is less specific, because it will also detect IgG antibodies against mast cell-bound IgE, and may contain other histamine-releasing factors that can lead to a positive ASST response. <ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s>Even so, there was a significant relationship between BHRA and ASST results (Spearman r 5 0.448, P &lt; .01).</s><s>All BHRA-positive patients were ASST positive.</s><s>BHRA-positive and ASST-positive omalizumab responders are 4.5 and 5.5 times more likely to have a slow response to treatment compared with BHRA-negative and ASST-negative responders; the relative risks with 95% confidence limits were 4.54 for BHRA (2.42-8.53,</s><s>z test P &lt; .001)</s><s>and for ASST 5.50 (1.37-22.11,</s><s>z test P &lt; .05).</s></p><p><s>The strength of this study is the highly significant correlation between the length of time to the onset of activity of omalizumab and BHRA, strongly suggesting that a positive BHRA may predict a slow response to omalizumab.</s><s>Limitations of the study  are that all the data are derived from an open observational study without controls.</s><s>A further weakness is that the story is not entirely black and white.</s><s>For example, 1 patient with positive BHRA and ASST became symptom free within 1 day of the first omalizumab injection.</s><s>Also, there were 9 BHRA-negative patients in the slow responder group.</s><s>However, 5 of these did have a positive ASST result.</s><s>These apparent anomalies suggest that in some patients, CSU may have more than 1 mechanism. <ref type="bibr">8</ref></s><s>n conclusion, there are significant correlations between a positive BHRA and ASST and the time to symptom relief with omalizumab.</s><s>The fact that a positive BHRA is predictive of a slow response to omalizumab suggests that omalizumab works via reducing FcεRI expression in these patients.</s><s>Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these preliminary observations.</s></p></div>
