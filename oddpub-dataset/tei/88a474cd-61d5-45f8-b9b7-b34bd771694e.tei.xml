variation in the relationship may be partially explained by an inability to adjust for total energy intake, differences in the categorisation of fruit and vegetable intake and the accuracy of measures, differences in the types of foods and preparation method, and differences in adjustment strategy. <ref type="bibr">26 27</ref></s><s>besity prevalence was significantly lower among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal adults in better physical health and mental health; we observed the strongest associations between obesity and these measures.</s><s>For example, obesity prevalence was around twofold for Aboriginal participants and threefold for non-Aboriginal participants with poor/fair versus excellent/very good self-rated health, and with disability versus no disability.</s><s>No sociodemographic or health risk factor variables were associated with an obesity PR of this magnitude.</s><s>The strong associations between obesity and health status factors may reflect the fact that many of these relationships are bidirectional and reinforcing in nature.</s><s>Illness and disability both contribute to and are consequences of obesity.</s><s>Physical impairment that reduces physical activity is known to increase BMI.</s><s>At the same time, high BMI itself, and consequences such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, can further impair physical functioning.</s><s>Given these bidirectional and reinforcing relationships, calculating the burden of obesity attributable to poor health status is difficult, but it is likely to have a contribution in this direction.</s></p><p><s>There were generally similar (and often strong) relationships between factors and obesity for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants.</s><s>However, the majority of obesity risk factors were more commonly observed in the Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal sample.</s><s>It is well established that Aboriginal people experience a higher burden of these factors, particularly disadvantage, illness and disability, stemming at least in part from inequalities in upstream determinants and Australia's history of colonisation. <ref type="bibr">8 9 28</ref></s><s>Overall, 45.0% of the excess prevalence of obesity in the Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal sample was explained by a select set of indicators of socioeconomic position and health behaviours.</s><s>This is a substantial proportion, particularly when allowing a reasonable margin of error for the measurement of each included factor and considering limited number of factors included; we did not adjust for measures of health status given the potential for reverse causality.</s></p><p><s>For some variables, obesity PR was attenuated in the Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal group.</s><s>However, in many of these cases, absolute difference in obesity prevalence (unadjusted) across exposure categories was similar, or even greater, in the Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal group.</s><s>For example, among Aboriginal participants, obesity prevalence was 51.9% among those with moderate/severe limitation versus 29.5% among those with no functional limitation (absolute difference: 22.4%); respective prevalences were 35.9% and 13.5% (absolute difference: 22.4%) among non-Aboriginal participants.</s><s>Despite equivalent absolute prevalence difference, the relative difference in obesity prevalence was significantly larger for the non-Aboriginal (PR=3.32,</s><s>95% CI 3.24 to 3.40) versus Aboriginal group (PR=1.80,</s><s>95% CI 1.50 to 2.16).</s><s>This is largely due to the lower base prevalence in the non-Aboriginal sample.</s><s>This may explain the observed differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants in the relationships of obesity to education, functional limitation, disability and self-rated health.</s></p></div>
