<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Chronic Hyperthyroidism on TH Responsive Gene Expression in Liver of Young and Old Mice</head><p><s>To examine TH status in liver under chronic T 4 excess, mRNA transcription levels of genes proposed to respond to TH, namely Spot14 (thyroid hormone-responsive Spot14 homolog, Thrsp), Tbg (TH-binding globulin) and Dio1 (deiodinase 1), were assessed in young and old mice after T 4 treatment over 7 weeks <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9]</ref> .</s><s>Spot14 showed the smallest variations with regard to mRNA levels with upregulation of 1.5-fold under T 4 treatment in young (p &lt; 0.01) and old (p &lt; 0.05) mice.</s><s>In both age groups, Dio1 was highly expressed in the hyperthyroid state (10-fold increase; p &lt; 0.0001) while Tbg expression was downregulated to very low levels in young and old mice (p &lt; 0.0001; fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> ).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We examined changes of TH transporter expression during aging in a euthyroid as well as a hyperthyroid state in the TH target organ liver.</s><s>T 4 treatment was chosen as the preferred TH for induction of hyperthyroidism since T 4 has been the most widely used iodothyronine in (hyperthyroid) animal experiments, allows for the assessment of T 4 to T 3 conversion in a living organism and is standard in patients requiring TH substitution.</s></p><p><s>To assess the effects of chronic T 4 exposure and aging on TH serum status, TH serum parameters were determined in euthyroid controls and T 4 -treated animals.</s><s>We could confirm significantly lower fT 4 concentrations in old male mice (20 months) compared to young male (4 months) mice.</s><s>A decline in fT 4 values has been reported in male mice during development from 2 to 20 weeks   <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[16]</ref> .</s><s>However, in our study the extent of regulation of both transporters remained in a significant range in livers of old mice only.</s></p><p><s>Oatp1a1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[17]</ref> , Oatp1b2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[18]</ref> and Oatp1a4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[19]</ref> were downregulated in a comparable fashion in hyperthyroid young and old mice, with marked downregulation found for Oatp1a1 .</s><s>As secondary TH transporters, they mainly transport organic compounds, amino acids and hormones <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">20]</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, their lower expression levels might result in lower levels of amino acids available for protein synthesis in hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[21]</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, Lat1 and Lat2 were upregulated to high levels and in a signifi-cant manner.</s><s>Because Lat1 is known to be highly expressed in hepatocytes under limited amino acid availability, these results are in line with the observed downregulation of Oatp s.</s><s>The Lat1 response is believed to explain how hepatocytes can still grow under limiting amino acid availability, and thus acquire a survival advantage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">23]</ref> .</s><s>While Lat1 prefers large neutral amino acids, Lat2 has a broader specificity mediating transport of small neutral amino acids as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[24]</ref> .</s><s>Thus an upregulation of Lat2 might reflect the liver's need for small amino acids.</s><s>NTCp as a multispecific organic anion transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[13]</ref> remained unaltered during hyperthyroidism.</s></p><p><s>The most surprising finding of our observation is perhaps the upregulation of most investigated TH transporters with aging.</s><s>This effect was seen in euthyroid and hyperthyroid old animals, suggesting that the liver may react similarly to TH excess in young and old age, at least at the TH transporter level.</s><s>This is also in agreement with the observed age-independent effect of T 4 on TH-responsive genes Spot14 , Dio1 and Tbg in the liver of hyperthyroid old and young mice.</s><s>Age-independent expression levels of Mct8 may underline its importance in maintaining TH transport across the hepatocyte plasma membrane in TH-challenging conditions.</s><s>Finally, our findings suggest a response to increased needs for amino acids and hormones in aging hepatocytes through the upregulation of, for example, Lat1 and other secondary TH transporters like Lat2 .</s><s>Presently our findings rely on mRNA expression studies and it is unknown whether  In summary, we report changes in TH transporter mRNA expression in liver as a classical TH target organ in response to TH excess but also aging, whereby the first effect pertained in young and old age.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.1.</s><s>Serum levels of TH in euthyroid and T 4 -treated young and old male mice.</s><s>TT 4 ( a ), fT 4 ( b ) and fT 3 ( c ) were determined in sera by ELISA at the start and after 5 weeks of T 4 treatment (1 μg/g BW T 4 i.p. every 48 h).</s><s>A significant increase of TT 4 , fT 4 and fT 3 serum parameters was found in T 4 -treated young (4 months) and old (20 months) mice as compared to the euthyroid start group.</s><s>The</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
