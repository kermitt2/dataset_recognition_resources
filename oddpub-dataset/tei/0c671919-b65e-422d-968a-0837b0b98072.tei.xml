with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sLAM.</s><s>Renal angiomyolipoma response continued to improve from 41.8% in the core phase (median exposure, 8.8 months) to 58% in the extension phase (median exposure, 46.9 months) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Clinically relevant renal angiomyolipoma reductions persisted over time as shown by the longitudinal data analysis which demonstrated an important reduction in the first 3 months of treatment and a continuous but less marked reduction later on.</s><s>Low rates of renal angiomyolipoma progression were observed.</s></p><p><s>Over the 4-year duration of everolimus treatment, angiomyolipoma-related complications or procedural interventions were uncommon, and no treated patient experienced an angiomyolipoma-associated hemorrhage, whereas one-third of the patients experienced major renal interventions before entering the trial.</s></p><p><s>Everolimus was also associated with sustained reductions in SEGA volume and improvement in skin lesions.</s><s>In the subset of patients with TSC-associated LAM, a lower than expected rate of decline in pulmonary function was reported.</s><s>A 12-month, placebo-controlled, doubleblind study in patients with LAM reported an annual decline in FEV 1 of 10% in patients taking placebo (n = 43) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, whereas the current study reported a decline of 5.9% after nearly 2 years of everolimus treatment.</s><s>Together, the evidence supports a multisystem clinical impact of everolimus on various manifestations of TSC.</s></p><p><s>The longer-term safety profile of everolimus was consistent with that previously reported in TSC-associated clinical settings with everolimus <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>AEs occurred in most patients but were managed by dose adjustment in the majority.</s><s>After the placebo arm was discontinued, it was difficult to distinguish between true everolimus side effects and AEs due to TSC (eg, infections were just as common in the placebo as in the everolimus group in the double-blind phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</s><s>Some AEs, however, were predictable or known effects of mTOR inhibitors, often attributed to downregulation of cellular turnover (eg, amenorrhea, mouth ulcers).</s><s>Nearly threequarters of the patients completed this long-term study as per protocol.</s><s>Stomatitis, an event known to be associated with everolimus, was the most frequent AE.</s><s>While infections were common and mostly mild to moderate in severity during the study, it should be noted that severe life-threatening infections have been reported in patients treated with everolimus for TSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>The frequency of emergent AEs of all types decreased over time.</s><s>Renal function remained stable in most patients, and no angiomyolipoma-related bleeding events were reported.</s><s>Immediate surgical intervention with embolization was performed in one patient (during the study period), and nephrectomy was performed in another (after treatment discontinuation).</s><s>The observation of a single embolization while on everolimus over a median exposure of approximately 4 years indicates that treatment was successful and suggests a need for longer-term mTOR inhibition to continue to prevent or slow tumor regrowth, preserve renal function, and reduce the need for future embolization.</s><s>This reduction in hemorrhage frequency could be due to restoration of a more appropriate mTORC1 axis in the TSC mutant vascular pericytes, thus preventing vascular remodeling and aneurysm formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Better angiographic data are required to assess the vascular effects on therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Patients included in this study were at high risk for long-term renal deterioration because most of them had large, bilateral angiomyolipomas at baseline.</s><s>Sustained clinical responses to everolimus in angiomyolipoma and other lesional manifestations of TSC-such as skin lesions, SEGA, and LAM-support everolimus as a viable treatment option for TSC and its potential to be a disease-modifying therapy in these patients.</s></p><p><s>Given the magnitude of effect with everolimus in the primary analysis, maintenance of an untreated arm was unethical, thus justifying the omission of the placebo arm in the extension phase.</s><s>A planned noninterventional follow-up of EXIST-2 will provide longer-term data to determine angiomyolipoma characterizations for up to 1 year after the discontinuation of everolimus.</s><s>Results of EXIST-2 demonstrate that everolimus is a safe and effective longer-term therapy for patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC or sLAM not requiring immediate surgical intervention.</s><s>Early treatment with everolimus may prevent progressive damage to renal tissue, reduce renal-related complications and the need for renal intervention, and improve patient outcomes.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1
