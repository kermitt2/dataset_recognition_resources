<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative colonization properties of MDR P. aeruginosa and commensal E. coli in secondary abiotic mice</head><p><s>We next addressed whether the intestinal colonization properties of the applied MDR P. aeruginosa strain differed from those of a commensal murine Gram-negative strain such as E. coli that had been isolated from feces of a conventionally colonized wildtype mouse previously.</s><s>Therefore, after a 3-day antibiotic washout period, secondary abiotic mice were either perorally associated with 10 9 CFU MDR P. aeruginosa or commensal E. coli by gavage and the bacterial loads were determined in fecal samples thereafter.</s><s>Whereas until day 7 p.i. intestinal E. coli loads were approximately one order of magnitude higher as compared to P. aeruginosa (p &lt; 0.01-0.001;</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), respective fecal bacterial burdens were comparable thereafter until the end of the experiment (i.e., 10 8 CFU per gram at day 28 p.i.; n.s., Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Hence, MDR P. aeruginosa displayed virtually comparable intestinal colonization properties like a commensal Gram-negative strain such as E. coli.</s></p></div>

(p &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Hence, both MDR P. aeruginosa and commensal E. coli association resulted in distinct innate and adap- tive immune cell responses in the intestines of secondary abiotic mice, whereas a pronounced increase in macrophages and monocytes could be observed in the small as well as large intestines upon MDR P. aeruginosa challenge only, which also applied to colonic T lymphocytes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intestinal cytokine secretion following peroral MDR P. aeruginosa association of secondary abiotic mice</head><p><s>Next, we addressed whether the observed intestinal immune cell responses upon bacterial challenge were accompanied by pronounced local secretion of pro-and anti-infl ammatory cytokines.</s><s>At day 28 following MDR P. aeruginosa, but not commensal E. coli association of secondary abiotic mice, colonic TNF concentrations were more than two-fold higher as compared to uninfected controls (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>), whereas higher TNF secretion could be determined in MLN of E. coli associated versus non-associated mice (p &lt; 0.001, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>).</s><s>At day 28 following challenge with either E. coli or P. aeruginosa, increased IFN-γ secretion could be measured in MLN as compared to naive controls (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>) with even higher concentrations in the former as compared to the latter associated mice (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>).</s><s>Notably, secretion of the antiinfl ammatory cytokine IL-10 was virtually unchanged in the colon and MLN at day 28 following either bacterial association.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Systemic cytokine secretion following peroral MDR P. aeruginosa association of secondary abiotic mice</head><p><s>We fi nally addressed systemic pro-and anti-infl ammatory sequelae upon bacterial association of secondary abiotic mice.</s><s>Remarkably, P. aeruginosa but not E. coli challenge induced a multifold increased secretion of pro-infl ammatory cytokines such as TNF and IFN-γ in the spleen at day 28 (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001 versus naive, respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5C</ref>), whereas anti-infl ammatory IL-10 concentrations were downregulated in spleens of P. aeruginosa associated mice far below baseline levels (p &lt; 0.001 versus naive; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Hence, association of secondary abiotic mice with MDR P. aeruginosa but not commensal E. coli resulted in pronounced systemic pro-infl ammatory sequelae, whereas anti-infl ammatory responses were dampened.</s></p></div>

challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In subjects who had a 4-day course of oral ampicillin treatment, however, P. aeruginosa persisted for 14 days.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, under continuous broad-spectrum antibiosis, P. aeruginosa could stably establish within the intestinal tract rather late (i.e., after 2 to 3 weeks) p.i., but finally reached comparably high fecal loads as compared to mice in which the antibiotic cocktail had been withdrawn before bacterial challenge.</s><s>Even though tested resistant against each antibiotic compound in our in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility assays, the nadir in fecal P. aeruginosa loads between day 3 and day 14 p.i. in addition to the abundance of small colony variants point toward synergistic antimicrobial properties of the components within the quintuple antibiotic cocktail.</s><s>Remarkably, neither antimicrobial treatment nor respective bacterial colonization was associated with any clinical symptoms in challenged mice.</s><s>This is in line with an earlier study by Hentges et al. who did not report any clinical symptoms in mice upon treatment with fi ve different antibiotic compounds and subsequent P. aeruginosa infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, which also held true for healthy volunteers subjected to P. aeruginosa with or without preceding ampicillin treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, following peroral application of the clinical isolate or the commensal E. coli strain in our study, secondary abiotic mice (with withdrawn antibiosis) harbored comparable fecal bacterial loads indicating that the clinical P. aeruginosa isolate exhibited intestinal colonization like a murine commensal Gram-negative strain.</s></p><p><s>In line with lacking macroscopic (i.e., clinical) sequelae, P. aeruginosa colonization was neither associated with histopathological nor apoptotic responses affecting the intestinal mucosa and epithelial cells in particular.</s><s>Interestingly, either bacterial association, however, resulted in increased proliferating/regenerating epithelial cell numbers in both small and large intestines thereby counteracting potential cell damage.</s><s>Remarkably, MDR P. aeruginosa colonization induced pronounced innate as well as adaptive immune cell responses as indicated by elevated numbers of macrophages/monocytes as well as T lymphocytes, Treg and B cells, respectively, in intestinal mucosa and lamina propria at day 28 p.i., that were accompanied by multifold increased pro-infl ammatory cytokine concentrations such as TNF and IFN-γ in colon and MLN, respectively.</s><s>Strikingly, P. aeruginosa carriage induced not only immune responses in the intestinal tract but also systemically as indicated by increased splenic TNF and IFN-γ secretion at day 28 p.i., whereas anti-infl ammatory IL-10 concentration was virtually undetectable by then.</s></p><p><s>Preceding antibiotic treatment facilitates intestinal P. aeruginosa colonization, which in turn bears a 15-fold increased risk for a nosocomial infection on ICU <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Whereas the pathogenic potential of P. aeruginosa is well known, its potential in initiation and perpetuation of immunopathologies, particularly within the intestinal tract, is only incompletely understood.</s><s>In a very recent study, we were able to show that acute ileitis facilitated infection with MDR P. aeruginosa in mice harboring a human gut microbiota, but the infl ammation model was too acute to decipher additional infl ammatory sequelae induced by the MDR bacterial strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We conclude that upon preceding broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment a clinical MDR P. aeruginosa isolate is capable of colonizing the intestinal tract like a commensal Gram-negative strain such as murine E. coli.</s><s>Already mere MDR P. aeruginosa carriage, however, is associated with both intestinal and systemic immune responses that might be potentiated in concert with other comorbidities.</s><s>Further studies need to unravel the orchestrated interplay of MDR Gram-negative strains including P. aeruginosa, host micro biota and immunity, particularly under infl ammatory conditions.</s></p></div><figure
