<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>A priori, this retrospective single-center case-control study, emphasizing the comparison of coagulation factors and platelet counts, was unlikely to identify a single major risk factor for PH, but we aimed to add our data to the ongoing discussion on preventive strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Based on our data and other studies, the following avenues for further clinical recommendations and research might become more obvious.</s><s>Data are presented as median (range) or number (%). a Comparison of all three categories.</s><s>PH, Pulmonary hemorrhage; FFP, fresh frozen plasma.</s></p><p><s>Our study underlines the beneficial effects of antenatal steroids beyond fetal lung maturation.</s><s>As in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, we found a protective effect of antenatal steroids for PH prevention.</s><s>Antenatal steroids might not have been given due to the necessity of rapid delivery as a result of maternal illness or fetal distress.</s><s>Although not reflected by higher CRIB scores, the reduced incidence of PH in response to steroids may result, on the cellular level, from enhanced microvascular maturation and premature focal capillary fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The lower rate of fetal lung maturation is also reflected by the higher concentration of supplemental oxygen on the day of admission in infants with later PH.</s><s>However, at the time point of PH, the ventilation mode did not differ between infants with PH and case-controls.</s><s>Therefore, we assume that mechanical ventilation associated with micro trauma of the lung alone does not seem to be a major risk factor for PH.</s><s>Severe IVH was detected in 10 out 11 infants after PH occurred and is thought to be a consequence of clinical deterioration during PH.</s><s>However, other bleedings were only detected in infants with PH.</s><s>Although small for gestational age (SGA) has been described as a risk factor for PH, and SGA infants are prone to coagulopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we did not find a correlation between SGA and the occurrence of PH.</s></p><p><s>The follow-up analysis of the trial on indomethacin prophylaxis in preterms (TIPP) indicated that prophylactic indomethacin reduced the rate of early serious PH <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Rates of infants with PH who had received prophylactic indomethacin were only 25% of those in controls, but this difference was not significant.</s><s>In another recent casecontrol analysis, infants who received indomethacin were less likely to die, particularly in the PH group, in which moderate-to-large PDA was attributed to PH <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In order to avoid side effects, such as decreased cerebral blood flow, prophylactic indomethacin might be administered according to a risk score for major PH or IVH.</s></p><p><s>Although COX inhibitors, such as indomethacin and ibuprofen, are known to impair platelet function <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, their use for the prevention and therapy of PDA did not increase the occurrence of IVH in very low birth weight infants with platelet counts &gt; 100/nL <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>However, Brunner et al. showed that ibuprofen treatment significantly increased the risk for IVH in infants with platelet counts of 50-99/ nL <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In our study cohort, the rate of ibuprofen or indomethacin treatment did not differ in infants with PH and case-controls.</s><s>Therefore, we assume that impaired platelet function due to COX inhibitor exposure does not play a significant, or plays only a minor, role in the pathophysiology of PH in non-thrombocytopenic infants.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the implication of platelet and coagulation data on the individual risk for PH should be revisited for the following reasons: First, platelet counts and INR and fibrinogen concentration at birth did not differ between infants with PH and case-controls.</s><s>The aPTT was significantly longer in infants with later PH, and there was a trend towards a higher proportion of abnormal aPTT and fibrinogen concentration.</s><s>This finding might explain the higher rate of FFP usage in infants with PH.</s><s>Second, platelet counts at onset of PH were lower than those at birth and also lower than the lowest values observed in controls during the first 96 h after birth.</s><s>We assume that the decreased platelet count is a result of platelet consumption during acute hemorrhage.</s><s>However, platelet counts &lt; 50/nL, widely thought to define severe thrombocytopenia, was seen not only in 10% of infants with PH, but also in 7.5% of controls.</s><s>This finding is in line with the outcome study on very low birth weight infants with platelet counts &lt; 60/nL (PlaNet1), in which 9% of children developed major hemorrhage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Finally, infants with PH received more transfusions of FFP than controls.</s><s>FFP transfusion was an independent risk factor associated with PH.</s><s>It is tempting to speculate that the receipt of FFP is merely a marker of critical illness, but this cannot be concluded from other parameters such as requirement of mechanical ventilation, CRIB score, or surfactant treatment, as well as diagnosis of early-onset infection (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, treatment with blood products deserves more attention.</s><s>In 1996, a randomized controlled multicenter trial including 776 infants born before 32 weeks of gestation compared early FFP transfusion vs. maintenance glucose infusion (controls) with the primary outcome measure survival without disability.</s><s>This trial provided no evidence that FFP transfusions affect the risks of death, IVH, or other major disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, the transfused plasma derived from adult donors may negatively interfere with neonatal platelet function, and hyporeactivity of neonatal platelets may be required for balancing primary hemostasis.</s><s>Significant effects on platelet aggregation have been detected after 'developmental mismatch in vitro transfusions': the addition of adult platelets to cord blood plasma of thrombocytopenic neonates resulted in shorter clotting times, which in turn increased the bleeding risk as a consequence of prothrombotic effects.</s><s>In the opposite approach, the addition of adult donor plasma to platelets of preterm infants led to prolonged bleeding time parameters.</s><s>In line with this, no evidence is given that in preterm neonates, prophylactic plasma transfusion based on coagulation screens improved clinical outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, routine screening of coagulation in neonates leads to increased use of plasma for transfusion in neonatal intensive care <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, our analysis of blood coagulation screens did not indicate significant differences between ELBW infants with regard to fibrinogen and INR in infants with PH and age-matched controls.</s><s>As indicated by prolonged aPTT in infants with later PH and occurrence of other bleeding symptoms, some patients might suffer from temporarily deranged coagulation, which contributes to the occurrence of PH.</s></p><p><s>Several, somewhat obscure, findings might be of particular interest for further research on bleeding disorders of very premature infants.</s><s>Platelet counts dropped significantly more often after birth in patients with PH than in controls.</s><s>The exact time point of the decrease in platelet count can only be estimated between birth and onset of PH.</s><s>Platelet count might be decreased at onset of PH due to platelet consumption during clotting in the bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma.</s><s>On the other hand, the platelets might be involved in the pathogenesis of PH.</s><s>Besides their primary role in coagulation, activated platelets mediate pulmonary neutrophil tethering and activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In the developmental-stage-dependent balanced coagulation system, changes in platelet counts and function (eventually related to their granula content, e.g.</s><s>platelet-released Dickkopf-1 [Dkk1] or chemokines such as CCL5/RANTES <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>) could contribute to damage the pulmonary endothelial barrier with subsequent bleeding.</s><s>Such mechanisms for the response to local pulmonary inflammatory processes and other mechanisms for the augmented tension in the capillary wall (e.g.</s><s>PDA, intrauterine growth restriction) deserve further experimental research in animal models for lung diseases in prematurity.</s></p><p><s>In summary, antenatal steroids are associated with a reduced risk for PH.</s><s>We cannot conclude whether the abnormal coagulation or the transfusion of FFP is causative for PH.</s><s>However, as transfusion of adult plasma was associated with later PH, clinical trials on laboratory based values as transfusion criteria are justified.</s><s>In vivo experiments remain needed to understand suggested adverse effects on primary hemostasis by transfusing adult plasma to ELBW infants.</s></p></div><figure
