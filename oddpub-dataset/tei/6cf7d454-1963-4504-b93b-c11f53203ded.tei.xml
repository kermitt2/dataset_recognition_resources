<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data source</head><p><s>Clinical and sociodemographic data were prospectively collected in an observational study evaluating an integrative outpatient treatment model for seriously mentally ill patients in Berlin, Brandenburg, and Lower Saxony.</s><s>Patients entered the study on July 1, 2004, or at the time of their entry into the integrative outpatient treatment model, whichever occurred later.</s><s>All patients were followed up until the end of their membership in the integrative outpatient treatment model, death, or the end of the study period <ref type="bibr">(December 31, 2009)</ref>, whichever came first (see <ref type="bibr">Fischer et al.</ref> for details regarding the study design and participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>).</s><s>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA1/088/08).</s><s>All patients analysed were insured under the same statutory health insurance (Deutsche Angestelltenkrankenkasse, 'DAK') so that claims data could be used for this study.</s><s>Permission to use the claims data was obtained from the statutory health insurance.</s><s>Available data included demographics, clinical information from psychiatric diagnoses, and information on all reimbursed outpatient prescriptions.</s><s>Prescription data included the anatomical-therapeutic chemical (ATC) code, which is used to classify substances, and the prescription date for every prescribed drug.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of a potential interaction</head><p><s>To define possible inhibitors, inducers and substrates of CYP450 enzymes from the prescription data, David Flockhart's clinically relevant drug interaction table for CYP450 interactions was used, as it is one of the most commonly employed data sources for identifying drug interactions via CYP450s and their clinical relevance (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/clinical-table/)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>All CYP450-relevant drugs in Flockhart's table are classified into inhibitors, inducers or substrates of specific isoenzymes (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4, 5, 7).</s><s>Some drugs act as substrates or inhibitors of CYP450 enzymes, depending on the interactions of the victim drug.</s><s>These drugs were classified as both a substrate and an inhibitor.</s><s>We searched all prescriptions successively in chronological order to identify DDEs in the data.</s><s>Each entry successively served as the perpetrator drug.</s><s>We extracted the prescription date, the CYP450 isoform, and whether the drug acts as a substrate, inducer or inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes from each perpetrator drug.</s><s>A DDE was defined as the prescription of an perpetrator drug (e.g., inhibitor) of a specific CYP450 isoform (e.g., 2D6) between prescriptions of a DDE victim drug (e.g., substrate) of the same CYP450 isoform if the time-span between the prescription of the two drugs did not exceed 4 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>).</s><s>The 4-week timeframe is consistent with other claims data studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref> and we are certain that the probability of both drugs taken concomitantly is relatively high.</s><s>Therefore, an perpetrator drug must be bracketed by a victim drug ('victim drug'-'perpetrator drug'-'victim drug').</s><s>One exception to this definition is same-day prescriptions in which the perpetrator drug was not bracketed by the victim drug (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 b</ref>).</s><s>The prescription scheme was not defined as a DDE if the time-span between the prescriptions exceeded 4 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c I-II</ref>).</s><s>Our DDE definition that an perpetrator drug must be prescribed between prescriptions of a victim drug was important to exclude changes in drugs (switches), which were defined as changes to a medication plan for a patient (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 d</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key results</head><p><s>Our analyses revealed that 15 % of patients were prescribed a combination of drugs imposing a risk of DDI at least once; in approximately 5 % of patients, this combination included a strong inhibitor.</s><s>Several of the drug combinations that we identified may cause relevant interactions.</s><s>The data suggests that in most of our patient cases the intended effect of the drugs will be strengthening.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretations</head><p><s>Other studies have indicated that the proportion of psychiatric patients at risk of potential DDIs via DDE ranges from approximately 23 % (Guo et al.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> to 28 % (Davies et al.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In our sample, 15.3 % of the patients were prescribed at least one drug combination classified as a DDE.</s><s>The differences in these numbers may be attributed to the different methodologies used in these studies.</s><s>Davies et al. performed a cross-sectional study in an inpatient psychiatric ward, while Guo et al. used Medicaid claims data over 4 years and primarily focused on the antipsychotics haloperidol, perphenazine, and chlorpromazine.</s><s>However, these authors did not include a longitudinal analysis.</s><s>The proportion of DDEs per person-year in our analysis was approximately onethird.</s><s>Therefore, our assessment of potential DDEs in mentally ill patients suggests that the prevalence of DDIs in our sample is not alarmingly high.</s><s>However, several of the identified DDEs are known to lead to clinically relevant DDIs that should be avoided.</s><s>Psychiatric patients are often treated across care sectors, which may result in a lack of communication and information transfer.</s><s>This lack of communication may lead to changes in medication plans and inappropriate drug prescriptions that increase the patients' risk of DDIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>One Swiss study noted that patients are often discharged from hospitals with prescribed drug combinations that may lead to DDEs or DDIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>One survey indicated that adverse effects due to DDIs are frequently encountered in the outpatient sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>German GPs do not act as gatekeepers, and patients can contact their preferred specialists themselves.</s><s>A GP prescribing clarithromycin to a patient might not know that the patient's long-term medication plan includes diazepam prescribed by a mental health specialist.</s><s>This lack of communication may increase the patient's risk for relevant DDIs.</s><s>Therefore, our analyses of psychiatric patients are relevant for the estimation of DDEs, despite the fact that we only covered outpatient care.</s><s>Notably, we identified several combinations of DDEs prescribed by the same mental health specialist, which is in accord with the findings of Guo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Initially, we would have assumed that most DDEs arise from drugs of different classes that are prescribed by several physicians who are unknown to the other prescribing physicians.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>One particular strength of our secondary data analyses is that we were able to analyse data from many patients using their complete prescription records for a long observation period.</s><s>The comprehensiveness of these data provides a complete picture of drug prescriptions for each insured person, which results in a precise picture of DDEs.</s><s>The numbers of identified DDEs were not alarmingly high in our sample, but our analyses only covered estimations of pharmacokinetic DDEs caused by drugs that are metabolised by CYP450 enzymes.</s><s>Therefore, the number of DDEs and potential DDIs that are not due to CYP450 enzymes in our sample is likely to be even higher and more relevant than we estimated.</s><s>A major limitation of our analyses is that we do not have available data to establish the real linkage between DDEs and DDIs in the patients.</s><s>This is because the health claims data only included information about the medication prescribed and the prescription date.</s><s>Hence, the actual intake of the drugs, effects on biological availability and possible medical outcomes could not be assessed.</s><s>Therefore, it is unclear whether the DDEs identified based on our definition led to actual simultaneous intake of the drugs and eventually to DDIs.</s><s>However, even with available medical outcome data, it would be difficult to identify DDIs beyond severe reactions that require medical treatment, as patients experiencing a DDI might not consult a physician but instead stop taking one of the drugs.</s><s>A further limitation is that the estimation of DDEs might be imprecise because data on drug use during inpatient stays and on drugs bought over the counter are missing.</s><s>Moreover, specific information on the dosage form or packaging size of the prescribed drugs was not available.</s><s>Dosage information might be important for estimating the clinical relevance of DDIs more precisely.</s><s>In future studies, use of the 'Pharmazentralnummer' (PZN; central pharmaceutical number) could allow more accurate calculations of exposure dates to be made based on the packaging size, as compared with ATC codes.</s><s>A US study postulated that patients must be exposed to two drugs in parallel for at least ten days to identify potential DDIs in pharmacy claims data <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, we were unable to verify this constraint because the PZN was not included in the claims data that we received for the study patients.</s><s>However, the use of a time constraint of only 4 weeks and the fact that many psychiatric patients constantly on medications increases our confidence that our analyses provide indications of potential DDIs.</s><s>The specific disease profiles in our sample limit the generalisability of our results to the general population, and similar analyses in other high-risk groups (e.g., patients with chronic conditions or the elderly) are needed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook</head><p><s>DDEs are potentially hazardous to patient health in fragmented health care systems because of the lack of information sharing among care sectors.</s><s>Secondary data analyses seem promising for the identification of DDEs and potential DDIs across care sectors, which could reduce health care utilisation and costs as a result of (avoidable) drug interactions.</s><s>However, DDIs are difficult to identify in claims data unless an adverse event occurred and was documented.</s><s>Claims data must be merged with patient outcome data to validate whether our definition of DDEs can be used to identify other DDIs beyond events requiring hospitalisations.</s><s>Case managers of health insurance organisations could use the DDE definition to screen the prescription data of their insured persons and determine who is at risk of experiencing DDIs.</s><s>These insured persons (or their physicians) could then be advised of possible drug alternatives to avoid DDEs.</s><s>Costs of outpatient care or hospital admissions due to DDIs could potentially be reduced, which would be of (financial) interest to health insurance companies.</s><s>Claims data that include relevant prescription information could be stored on health insurance cards.</s><s>The health insurance card could also store long-term use of over-the-counter drugs if the GP or pharmacy records these drugs.</s><s>This information should be linked with existing interaction databases on a regular basis to recognise potential DDIs.</s><s>A comprehensive picture of drug use could prevent clinically relevant DDIs if data protection can be fully ensured.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Our data suggest that the numbers of patients with clinically relevant DDIs in our sample is not alarmingly high.</s><s>Nevertheless, some prescribed drug combinations are to be avoided as they might lead to serious adverse consequences.</s><s>An improved utilisation of claims data would allow for an examination of DDEs in routine clinical practice and provide an opportunity to potentially implement warning systems for DDIs in real-life settings to optimally minimise the number of patients at risk.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Title: Definition of a DDE.</s><s>Legend: Dotted line represents the victim drug A.
