relation to ESCC risk in Kenya.</s><s>Overall, we found progressively increased ESCC risks associated with drinking 'hot' and 'very hot' beverages (predominantly tea) relative to 'warm' beverages.</s><s>This trend held true across subgroups of age, sex and tobacco/alcohol consumption.</s><s>However, uncertainty remains over the magnitude of risk due to difficulties in participant self-recall and drinking temperature categorisation.</s></p><p><s>There was no evidence that the thermal injury-ESCC risk differed by ESCC anatomical sub-location.</s></p><p><s>Our findings are consistent with numerous previous investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> into the role of hot beverage consumption and ESCC risk, such as a case-control study conducted in Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and a cohort study in China. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>While habitual hot tea consumption is widespread in Kenya and other parts of East Africa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> the volumes reported in the present study, a mean of ~750 ml/day, were considerably lower than those typically found in Iran, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> where hot beverages may play a larger role in the local burden.</s><s>Nevertheless, the findings provide further evidence that hot beverage consumption likely contributes to ESCC risk, including in East African populations.</s></p><p><s>Our study was subject to several commonly cited limitations.</s><s>Firstly, as with all questionnaire-oriented case-control study designs, recall bias may have influenced outcomes.</s><s>Assessments of hot beverage consumption may be particularly susceptible to recall bias due to the subjective nature of what is perceived as 'very hot', 'hot' or 'warm', which may vary between individuals even at the same temperature and possibly also due to the pre-perceived risk intuitively associated with this exposure.</s><s>Similarly, the retrospective exposure assessment may have led to difficulties in the recall of past exposures, particularly for cases who no longer drink hot beverages due to dysphagia.</s><s>Self-reported drinking temperature classifications, such as those used in the present study, have also been questioned previously and were a limitation cited in the IARC Monograph carcinogenicity evaluation of very hot beverages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>he non-objective nature of this exposure assessment was also of particular concern in the present study, potentially resulting in uncertainty in the magnitude but not direction of the association.</s><s>Difficulty in distinguishing more than two exposure categories, i.e. the difference between 'very hot' and 'hot', led to different exposure profiles between interviewers, unless this was due to chance.</s><s>This reiterates a considerable limitation in this method of exposure assessment.</s><s>Other question variations should be included in future studies, such as asking participants to estimate how long they wait before drinking, with shorter waiting times having been associated with increased ECCC risk in a previous case-control study.</s><s>In considering whether our findings are biologically plausible, we note the apparent lack of association in under 50 year olds, though that stratum had few participants (107 cases and 135 controls).</s><s>A defining characteristic of the African EC burden is the relatively high number of young (i.e.</s><s>&lt;50 years) cases and we have observed an early onset of hot beverage consumption in both a previous cross-sectional study of measured tea temperatures in Tanzania (mean 2 years at first drinking) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and in similar ongoing fieldwork in western Kenya.</s><s>However, in the latter study, we observed a practice called 'poesha', whereby a child's hot beverage is poured back and forth between two cups in long streams to cool the liquid before it is drunk.</s><s>The abovementioned findings suggest that the onset of exposure to thermal injury may occur later in life in this setting; an exposure duration not sufficient to increase ESCC risk at young ages, but further studies will be needed to address these questions.</s><s>Furthermore, larger pooled studies will be required to address whether hot tea is a stronger risk factor in drinkers, as found in a Chinese cohort, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> given that a large contribution to the Kenyan ESCC burden is attributable to alcohol, namely consumption of locally produced beer 'busaa' and spirits such as 'changaa' in men.</s><s>Investigating the possible interaction of hot beverages with other carcinogens is also warranted.</s></p><p><s>The present findings have profound implications for public health and cancer prevention in Kenya, the wider East African region and beyond.</s><s>They are particularly pertinent in highrisk ESCC populations where hot beverage/food consumption is habitual and widespread, e.g.</s><s>where tea is consumed to stay warm at high altitude in Rift Valley communities; 3 and daily consumers of hot porridge-'genfo'-a dietary staple in Ethiopia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>Hot beverage consumption exemplifies a risk factor that is potentially modifiable in the community through effective communications strategies aimed at encouraging people to wait for a sufficient time for their beverages to cool.</s><s>What constitutes 'sufficient' is a subject of future research as a required element of any prevention strategy is to define 'sufficiently cool' to avoid harm, while at the same time remaining sufficiently hot to maintain the benefits of keeping warm.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study provides further evidence of the role of hot beverage consumption-a potentially modifiable risk factor-in ESCC from the first comprehensive analytical study to be conducted in the East African EC corridor.</s><s>Further important research avenues will be to seek mechanistic evidence of hot beverage carcinogenicity and develop objective exposure assessment protocols for use in case-control studies.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Demographic and exposure
