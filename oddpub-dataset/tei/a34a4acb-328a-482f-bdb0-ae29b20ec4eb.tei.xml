<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>H9B-MC-BCDV (FLEX V; NCT01202773) was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comprised of a screening period of 7-28 days, a 24-week treatment period and post-treatment follow-up for up to 48 weeks.</s><s>Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to treatment groups by a computer generated random sequence using the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS); the randomisation code was held by the vendor performing IVRS functions.</s></p><p><s>This study evaluated two subcutaneous (SQ) tabalumab doses: 120 mg every 4 weeks (120/Q4W) or 90 mg every 2 weeks (90/Q2W), versus placebo.</s><s>At week 0, patients assigned to a tabalumab regimen received a SQ loading dose that was twice the treatment dose (ie, 240 mg or 180 mg).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient eligibility</head><p><s>Eligible patients were in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) functional class I, II, or III; had at least 8/68 tender and at least 8/66 swollen joints; had been treated at approved doses with at least 1 biological TNF inhibitor therapy; and stopped prior anti-TNF treatment due to either (1) insufficient efficacy or loss of efficacy after ≥90 days of treatment or (2) intolerance to treatment regardless of treatment duration.</s><s>If patients were on conventional DMARDs, they were required to have been on a stable dose for ≥8 weeks prior to study baseline.</s></p><p><s>This study was conducted in accordance with local institutional review board ethical standards, good clinical practices and the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent before study participation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study assessments</head><p><s>The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of either tabalumab regimen over placebo as measured by a 20% response rate in a core set of measures (ACR20) after 24 weeks of treatment.</s></p><p><s>Secondary efficacy end points were to demonstrate superiority of either tabalumab regimen over placebo after 24 weeks of treatment as measured by ACR50 and ACR70 (ie, 50% and 70% ACR response rates), ACR-N ( per cent improvement on the ACR), individual components of the ACR core set, Disease Activity Score based on a 28-joint count (DAS28) and C reactive protein (CRP) level (DAS28-CRP), time to ACR20 response and European League Against Rheumatism Responder Index based on the 28-joint count (EULAR-28).</s></p><p><s>Health utilisation and outcomes evaluated as secondary end points included the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Brief Pain Inventory Modified Short Form (BPI-SF modified), duration of morning stiffness and the use of concomitant medications specifically for RA taken during the treatment period.</s></p><p><s>Biological activity of tabalumab was assessed over time via changes in serum immunoglobulins, CD20+ B-cell absolute counts and relative percentages ( percentages of the total lymphocyte population), compared between each treatment regimen and placebo.</s></p><p><s>Safety assessments were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs of special interest, clinical laboratory tests including immunogenicity testing, vital signs and concomitant medications.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological activity</head><p><s>In the safety population, both tabalumab groups showed an expected initial increase in mean CD20+ B-cell absolute counts at week 1 (median per cent change from baseline: 37.6-56.3%)</s><s>compared with placebo (−2.6%), followed by a subsequent decrease back to baseline or lower starting at week 4 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>At week 24 (excluding week 16 non-responders), CD20+ B-cell absolute count median per cent change from baseline was −43.2%, −53.2% and −1.1% for 120/Q4W, 90/Q2W and placebo groups, respectively.</s><s>Significant differences were observed at week 24 (mLOCF) in tabalumab groups versus placebo for mean CD20+ B-cell count change from baseline (−62.0 cells/µL, −65.2 cells/µL, and −3.8 cells/µL; p&lt;0.001 vs placebo for each comparison) and change from baseline in CD20+ B cells as percentage of total lymphocytes (−3%, −3.4%, and 0.1%; p&lt;0.001 vs placebo for each comparison).</s></p><p><s>For week 16 non-responders initially randomised to tabalumab, the patterns of absolute CD20+ B-cell count median percent change from baseline and median time to B-cell nadir were similar with B-cell changes observed for the responders.</s></p><p><s>For this study, B-cell recovery was defined as &lt;43 cells/ µL and &lt;50% of B-cell baseline values.</s><s>Fifteen patients (excluding week 16 non-responders) had 1 or more low B-cell counts: 8, 5 and 2 patients, respectively.</s><s>These patients were further evaluated to determine the time from nadir to recovery.</s><s>The median time from B-cell nadir to recovery (Kaplan-Meier estimates, excluding week 16 non-responders) was 11.9 weeks (95% CI 8.4 weeks to not available) for 120/Q4W group and 12.3 weeks (95% CI 12.1 weeks to 22.4 weeks) for 90/Q2W group.</s></p><p><s>In the safety population, both tabalumab groups demonstrated decreases in mean serum immunoglobulins over the 24-week treatment period (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B-D</ref>).</s><s>At the week 24 end point (mLOCF), the IgA mean per cent change from baseline was −9%, −9% and +1.6%, respectively ( p&lt;0.001 vs placebo, each comparison); IgG mean per cent change from baseline was −7.2%, −7.9% and +1.4%, respectively ( p&lt;0.001 vs placebo, each comparison); and IgM mean percent change from baseline was −15%, −14.8% and +0.2%, respectively ( p&lt;0.001 vs placebo, each comparison).</s></p><p><s>No correlation was observed between immunoglobulin changes from baseline to the week 24 mLOCF end point and number of treatment-emergent infections or antidrug (tabalumab) antibodies (ADA) for either tabalumab group versus placebo during the treatment and follow-up periods.</s></p></div>

however, this study was a global study, while some of the phase 2 studies enrolled patients from less diverse geographic regions and were smaller in size.</s><s>In terms of study drug administration, in one phase 2 study of patients with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors, tabalumab was administered as either a 30 mg or 80 mg intravenous infusion at weeks 0, 3 and 6, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> while the current phase 3 study evaluated two subcutaneous (SQ) tabalumab doses of 120 mg every 4 weeks (120/Q4W) or 90 mg every 2 weeks (90/Q2W), versus placebo.</s><s>A separate phase 2 tabalumab study of patients with inadequate response to methotrexate, which also applied intravenous administration and the same dosing frequency, demonstrated that all tabalumab doses were significantly more effective than placebo through week 24. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>It is notable that clinical efficacy corresponded to peak drug concentrations following infusion of tabalumab.</s></p><p><s>The current phase 3 study of patients with moderate-to-severe RA and prior treatment failure or intolerance to 1 or more TNF inhibitors did not meet its primary objective, as tabalumab treatment was not superior to placebo for the primary end point of ACR20 response at week 24 and did not meet any secondary efficacy objective.</s><s>The efficacy of tabalumab in special patient subgroups (eg, prior prednisolone use, smoking status, RF/anti-CCP seropositivity status and number of previous TNF inhibitor treatment failures), was inconclusive because data were insufficient due to early termination of the trial.</s><s>The findings in this study corroborate preliminary reported data from other BAFF inhibitor trials in patients with RA showing a lack of significant efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> or efficacy that was restricted to a bDMARD-naïve subgroup. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref></s><s>Despite the lack of efficacy, the biological activity of tabalumab was confirmed, but did not differ between the 2 dosing regimens in all parameters tested.</s><s>Over the 24-week treatment period, CD20+ B-cells initially increased then gradually and significantly declined in response to tabalumab but not placebo administration, and without total B-cell depletion.</s><s>This was expected, based on the mechanism of action of tabalumab: binding and neutralising BAFF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> an essential B-cell survival signal, and has also been reported for other BAFF/B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) inhibiting agents (belimumab, atacicept). <ref type="bibr">20</ref></s><s>otably, these other BAFF blocking agents also showed a lack of correlation between different dosages and biomarker changes. <ref type="bibr">21 22</ref></s><s>In the current study, B-cell decline correlated with significant decreases in circulating IgA, IgG and IgM levels after tabalumab treatment.</s><s>Despite decreases in biological parameters, there was no difference in infection rates for either tabalumab group compared with placebo.</s><s>Tabalumab treatment was associated with a low incidence of ADA, and there was no association between treatment-emergent ADA and any reports of AEs.</s></p><p><s>Frequencies of TEAEs and SAEs were similar across tabalumab and placebo groups, and the incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation was low across all treatment groups.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> Compared with prior phase 3 studies of other biological therapies in patients with RA, the present study of tabalumab had a similar incidence of TEAEs (range: 51.7-59.5%),</s><s>discontinuations due to TEAEs (range: 2.6-2.7%),</s><s>infections (range: 23.5-25.9%)</s><s>and SAEs (range: 3.9-4.6%). <ref type="bibr">6 23-26</ref></s><s>here were limitations to the design and interpretation of results of this study, which was terminated early.</s><s>The effects of background DMARD treatment, and prior and concomitant RA medications, may limit interpretation of results.</s><s>In addition, patients were previously treated with 1 or more TNF inhibitors and had discontinued due to treatment failure or intolerance;
