the postanaphylaxis group, n 5 18).</s><s>Anaphylaxis was established clinically by routine patient evaluation.</s><s>Patients were stratified into 4 severity groups according to Ring and Messmer 5 based on clinical reaction patterns (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">E1</ref>).</s><s>Control groups consisted of patients with a history of anaphylaxis but without symptoms at the time of blood sampling (the anaphylaxis-prone group, n 5 27; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">E2</ref>) and a group with acute cardiovascular or febrile reactions (the other diseases group, n 5 12, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">E3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Baseline serum samples were available for 9 of 18 patients from the postanaphylaxis group and served to compare basal mediator levels with corresponding levels during acute anaphylaxis in the same patients.</s><s>Levels of histamine (LDN, Nordhorn, Germany), cys-LTs (LTC 4 , LTD 4 , and LTE 4 ), and 9a,11b-PGF 2 (both from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich) were measured by means of ELISA, according to the manufacturer's instructions.</s><s>Tryptase levels were quantified by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Freiburg, Germany) using the UniCAP-Tryptase fluoroimmunoassay technique.</s><s>According to the manufacturer, tryptase levels greater than 11.4 mg/L can be regarded as increased.</s></p><p><s>Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif) by using nonparametric ANOVA with the Dunn posttest.</s><s>Pairwise comparisons were conducted with the Wilcoxon matched pairs test.</s><s>Correlations were analyzed by using the Spearman rank correlation test.</s><s>Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to establish the predictive power of single mediators as standalone diagnostic tools and compared with mediator combinations in an adjunctive setting.</s><s>An AUC equal to 1.0 indicates that the diagnostic test discriminates perfectly between anaphylactic and nonanaphylactic responses; that is, there are no false-positive or false-negative results.</s><s>An AUC equal to 0.5 indicates that the results of the diagnostic test are purely random.</s><s>A P value of less than .05</s><s>was considered statistically significant.</s></p><p><s>Focusing on histamine first, we found no difference between the anaphylaxis-prone and the postanaphylaxis groups (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref>), which is consistent with the short biological half-life of histamine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Anaphylactic episodes can occur anywhere, and a considerable period of time typically passes before the patient with anaphylaxis is actually seen by an emergency physician.</s><s>Time seems decisive in the case of histamine because patients with food allergy (n 5 11) undergoing controlled challenges show slight yet significant (P 5 .005)</s><s>increases (maximum increase, 35%) in serum histamine levels after approximately 15 minutes, despite their mild symptoms (unpublished results).</s></p><p><s>Tryptase is less labile and most sensitively detected at 0.5 to 2 hours after anaphylaxis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>Baseline tryptase levels vary from 1 to 11 ng/mL in most healthy subjects but can be increased in patients with various other conditions, including mastocytosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>In our postanaphylaxis group the median tryptase level was unaltered compared with that of the anaphylaxis-prone group (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1,  B</ref>), although single values were increased (&gt;11.4 mg/L).</s></p><p><s>MCs also quickly generate arachidonic acid metabolites on stimulation, in particular prostaglandin (PG) D 2 and leukotriene (LT) C 4 , 2 which are rapidly metabolized in vivo to 9a,11b-PGF 2 and LTE 4 , respectively, with these metabolites being more stable in body fluids.</s><s>Their measurements in the context of allergic conditions, such as anaphylaxis and asthma, typically have been reported in urine.</s><s>When measured in sera, we found significant increases in levels of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys-LTs;  compared with the differences between the anaphylaxis-prone and postanaphylaxis groups, indicating that their increase was specific for anaphylaxis and not found in patients with other acute conditions (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous evidence suggested a correlation between histamine 7 or tryptase <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> levels and anaphylaxis severity.</s><s>To examine whether this was true for our cohort, patients were stratified by severity grade, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and mediator levels were plotted in relation to the severity of anaphylaxis (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, E-H</ref>).</s><s>Histamine and tryptase levels showed little correlation with severity (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, E and F</ref>), and both turned out to be poor biomarkers of anaphylaxis by using ROC curve analysis with the postanaphylaxis and anaphylaxisprone groups as positive and negative samples, respectively (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">E1</ref>   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">E4</ref>).</s><s>The preceding analyses concentrated on a comparison between groups of unrelated patients to derive anaphylaxis-related mediator profiles, even without knowledge of their baseline levels in the patient, because such information might not be available in emergency settings.</s><s>We wondered whether the above conclusions would prove reproducible if only anaphylaxis-triggered changes in the same patient were considered.</s><s>Matched data sets were available for 9 patients.</s><s>As shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, median concentrations of histamine in the baseline and acute anaphylaxis groups were not significantly different, whereas concentrations of acute tryptase, cys-LTs, and 9a,11b-PGF 2 were significantly higher than baseline values (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">E5</ref>), supporting their use as biomarkers of anaphylaxis.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our data revealed that the assessed mediators vary in their utility as serum biomarkers of anaphylaxis.</s><s>An appropriate timing of blood withdrawal might increase the sensitivity of each mediator.</s><s>Histamine seems inadequate under most circumstances because of its short half-life and might only be able to detect anaphylaxis when assessed early after anaphylaxis onset.</s><s>Tryptase is more stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and can be used to detect anaphylaxis in subgroups of patients, but it is crucial to know the baseline level of the patient in accordance with previous observations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Metabolites of LTC 4 and in particular PGD 2 seemed most useful: while the parent mediators are rapidly degraded, cys-LTs and 9a,11b-PGF 2 are more stable, and increased levels are detectable in serum up to 2 hours after onset of anaphylaxis.</s><s>The particular advantages of 9a,11b-PGF 2 are (1) its very low baseline level, (2) little variability in the basal concentration among patients, (3) its profound increase after anaphylaxis (approximately 8-fold), (4) its relative stability and persistence in the circulation, and (5) its correlation with severity, making it a robust candidate biomarker.</s><s>Cys-LTs seem to constitute a supportive marker, but they correlate less well with severity and show more heterogeneous baseline levels.</s><s>However, because levels of 9a,11b-PGF 2 and cys-LTs are not correlated (pairwise comparisons revealed no significant correlation among the mediators investigated, see Fig E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org),</s><s>we assumed that their combination could result in superior sensitivity/specificity compared with each molecule alone.</s><s>ROC curve calculations and associated AUC values revealed that a combination of cys-LTs with 9a,11b-PGF 2 improved the diagnostic power of 9a,11b-PGF 2 (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">E1</ref>).</s><s>Further investigations are needed to verify the generalizability of these findings because only a small cohort could be considered by this study.</s><s>However, the clear increase in serum cys-LT and 9a,11b-PGF 2 levels during anaphylaxis, combined with their relation to anaphylaxis severity and predictive power, imply that these molecules might prove to be highly suitable serum markers to assist in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.</s></p><p><s>Maria Nassiri, PhD a * Oliver Eckermann, MD b * Magda Babina, PhD a G€ unter Edenharter, PhD c Margitta Worm, MD a</s></p></div>
