<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>AlloHCT is used as part of consolidation treatment of adults with ALL with intention to reduce the risk of relapse.</s><s>However, this benefit may be counterbalanced by NRM.</s><s>Results of the UK ALL XII/ECOG 2993 trial revealed that, among standard-risk patients with a sibling donor, the cumulative incidence of NRM was 19.5%, compared with 35.8% in the high-risk group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>onsequently, survival advantage could be demonstrated for standard-but not high-risk ALL.</s><s>In the HOVON studies, NRM among patients with a sibling donor was lower: 16% for standard-risk and 15% for high-risk ALL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Collectively, it has been concluded that patients with an over 50% risk of relapse and a less than 20%-25% risk of NRM are most likely to benefit from alloHCT performed in CR1.</s><s>Therefore, assessing the risk of transplantationrelated mortality is imperative in the decision-making S. Giebel et al.   process and there is a need for estimates related to procedures performed in the most recent era. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> In the current study, we focused on alloHCT performed in the period of 2008-2012, which reflected current clinical practice with regard to supportive care, HLA typing and other factors potentially influencing outcome.</s><s>Results were compared with preceding periods.</s><s>We were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in OS and LFS over time, which for the major part was related to reduced risk of NRM, and to a lesser extent the risk of relapse.</s><s>For the entire population of adults between 18-55 years old treated between 2008 and 2012, the cumulative incidence of NRM at two years was 14.7% after MSD-HCT and 22.4% after URD-HCT.</s></p><p><s>The improvement over time has already been reported by Gooley et al. who compared results of transplantations performed between 2003 and 2007 with those performed between 1993 and 1997.</s><s>In a heterogeneous population including 13% patients with ALL in various disease phases, the authors demonstrated reduction of the NRM rates from 41% to 26%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Hahn et al. reported general survival improvement for patients with hematologic malignancies observed over the period 1994-2005; however, the analysis included children, and data on NRM were not reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>In the previous analysis of the ALWP of the EBMT, we demonstrated that, for patients with acute leukemia treated with MSD-HCT in Eastern European countries, the rates of NRM decreased from 22% between 1990 and 2002 to 15% in the period 2002 and 2005. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>   (1990-1994 and 1995-1999). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>In a study by Wood et al., reduction of NRM from 43% between 1990 and 1995 to 31% between 2002 and 2007 was reported among adolescents and young adults, i.e. patients 18-40 years old. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>n the current analysis, the estimated rates of NRM were lower compared to most previously reported results.</s><s>This may reflect further improvement which occurred in the most recent time period.</s><s>As suggested by Gooley et al., reduction of NRM may be dependent on improving supportive care, but also on the reduction of the incidence of graft-versus-host disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>The latter could be a consequence of more accurate HLA typing, and in particular, the introduction of high resolution techniques in the process of unrelated donor search. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>On the other hand, it may be speculated that decreased NRM may be a consequence of more appropriate patient selection and that toxicity of conventional-dose chemotherapy decreased in parallel, positively affecting biological status of the transplant S.
