<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This qualitative focus group study was embedded within a larger study on quality of life and quality of care as experienced by patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (eQuiPe study (NTR6584)), conducted in the Netherlands.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were diagnosed with colorectal cancer (stage IV and at least two metastasis in liver, peritoneum or lung), lung cancer (stage IV), breast cancer (stage IV with at least visceral or brain metastasis), prostate cancer (stage IV and castration resistant), nonresectable pancreatic cancer, or non-resectable esophageal cancer.</s><s>Both patients and informal caregivers were eligible if they were 18 years or older and understood the objective of the study.</s><s>An informal caregiver could participate regardless of patient participation and vice versa.</s><s>Patients and informal caregivers were not eligible for inclusion if they had a poor expression of the Dutch language, they suffered from dementia, or they had a history of severe psychiatric illness.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment</head><p><s>Patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers were informed about the study by their treating physician to participate between January 2017 and June 2017 in six Dutch hospitals.</s><s>The physician asked permission for a research team member to call the patient to give detailed information about the study, address questions, and invite them to participate.</s><s>Subsequently, when patients and/or informal caregivers agreed to participate, they were invited for a focus group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study procedure</head><p><s>Participants were assigned to a focus group based on their availability, and patients and informal caregivers participated in separate focus groups to minimize response bias.</s><s>A focus group was approximately 90 min and was facilitated by two researchers (JvR and LB).</s><s>A moderator (JvR) asked the questions, probed, and made sure that all participants were heard, and an observer (LB) listed the proceedings during each focus group (supplement 1).</s><s>Consecutively, all participants completed a selfadministered questionnaire regarding socio-demographics.</s><s>If participants were not willing to participate in a focus group, an individual interview was offered.</s><s>Interviews were also conducted separately for patients and informal caregivers.</s><s>Two patients only wanted to participate with their informal caregiver present during the interview.</s><s>All focus groups and interviews were audiotaped.</s><s>After data saturation was reached, no additional focus groups and interviews were organized.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>All focus groups and interviews have been transcribed verbatim and analyzed with content analysis using Atlas.ti</s><s>version 7.5.15.</s><s>Two researchers (NR and JvR) independently coded a randomly selected transcript and compared results to evaluate consensus.</s><s>Transcripts were coded by the qualitative thematic analysis approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Data was analyzed by the open coding procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The procedure to confirm uniformity across researchers was repeated four times during data analysis phase.</s><s>Quotes reflecting social consequences as experienced by patients and informal caregivers were included in the further analysis.</s><s>Two researchers (JvR and NR) clustered the subcategories to identify main themes.</s><s>To illustrate important results from the analysis, quotes have been presented followed by an alphanumeric code in brackets where P = patient, C = informal caregiver, FG = focus group, and IV = interview.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>In total, 18 patients and 15 informal caregivers participated in a focus group (n = 23) or in an interview (n = 10) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Most patients had lung or colorectal cancer and informal caregivers were most often the patients' partners (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>I have never been prepared for the social consequences.</s><s>I found them much bigger and much more seriousso much more all-encompassing than I could ever have imagined.</s><s>(P7-IV).</s></p><p><s>Social consequences of advanced cancer mentioned by patients and informal caregivers were categorized in three main themes: Bsocial engagement,^Bsocial identity,^and Bsocial network^(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consequences for social engagement</head><p><s>Struggle to proceed with social life as normal Both patients and informal caregivers emphasized the importance of continuing life prior the cancer diagnosis as much as possible; to strive for normality.</s><s>BWhat it means to me is that I want to live my life just as I used to.</s><s>And I want to make as few concessions as I possibly can to changing the way of life that I had.</s><s>[...].The only thing I would want to change about my former life, is to fit more nice things into the way I live now.^(P3-IV).</s><s>Patients explained that normality distracts them from the dominant feeling of being a patient.</s><s>Being able to do the same things also gave them a feeling of control, satisfaction, meaning, and social embeddedness.</s><s>Many patients mentioned adding more fun activities to their life as a consequence of prioritizing and the urge to escape from the situation.</s><s>However, some informal caregivers mentioned that patients interpreted going on holiday with their children as a farewell because the reason for initiating this activity was their advanced cancer.</s></p><p><s>Many informal caregivers were aware that they would outlive the patient, and some informal caregivers felt the need to invest in a life after the patients' death.</s><s>Informal caregivers often explained how hard it was to combine their caregiving role with other responsibilities such as work and social activities: BAt that time I made a conscious decision to continue playing golf; it is something that enables me to clear my head, and that is extremely important to me.</s><s>But it is difficult, because you are away for four or five hours at a time which is often rather too long for [PATIENT] […]At the beginning you stop going for a while.</s><s>But I realise that if I don't go…, you really need to make some time for yourself.</s><s>You can't be joined at the hip 24/7.^(C7-IV).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Missing out</head><p><s>Patients' diagnosis and treatments interfered with their social life by physical or psychological complaints and medical appointments, and they often missed out on social events and resigned or reduced their job.</s><s>Patients also explained how society is rushing by, while they were struggling with the uncertainty regarding their limited life expectation.</s><s>Some patients planned social events ahead regardless of their condition, while others put their social life on hold, as illustrated here: BAnd even if it is just a weekend away or something like that... but I do find it difficult, everything is difficult actually, we are now planning a few things... you do try some things, but I can't promise anything because I don't know where I will be up to after the end of March.^(P24-FG).</s><s>Missing out on social events made patients feel socially excluded, as well as missing out on conversations about these events.</s></p><p><s>For informal caregivers, there were also major social consequences.</s><s>Some resigned their job to spend as much time as possible with the patient, while others kept working as long as possible.</s><s>Reasons for informal caregivers to continue working were financial pressure, satisfaction, and distraction.</s><s>Many working informal caregivers mentioned that their career was on hold and that their professional functioning was negatively affected because their situation pushed them to their limits.</s><s>Many found it difficult to continue work because they felt to be of more use at home.</s><s>Others also mentioned that social relations were sometimes judgmental about continuing work.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The value of social activities</head><p><s>Many patients explained how daily activities in life gained value, the cancer diagnosis appeared to change the perspective on daily activities: BDo you know what you never do any more when you are as sick as I am?</s><s>You don't just pop out to the shops on your own, or have a rummage in the bargain basement of a department store and end up buying a lipstick that you don't really need.</s><s>I miss that.^(P7-IV).</s><s>One patient called it the Bnoise^or Bplayfulness^of life.</s><s>Some informal caregivers emphasized the increased value of social activities.</s><s>However, most informal caregivers spend less time on social activities for multiple reasons: lack of time and energy due to the experienced caregiving burden, difficult to leave the patient due to feelings of selfishness, shame, worries, or being judged by others.</s><s>Some also explained that social activities did not result in positive energy as it used to do.</s><s>They explained how their current life did not feel as their own, and social activities became associated with freedom and self-control.</s><s>Most patients stimulated their caregivers to engage in social activities: BIt is very important to me that she continues to live her own life as far as possible.</s><s>We do a lot of things together, but you don't have to do everything together.</s><s>If she fancies going to town to buy a new dress or if she wants to have lunch with a friend, although actually she doesn't really want to go out and leave me.</s><s>But I push her to go, I'm fine staying at home.^(P21-IV).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consequences for social identity</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cancer is central</head><p><s>Patients and informal caregivers often explained how cancer has become central to their social identity.</s><s>Conversations with social relations were often focused on the illness and its treatments: BIt got to the point where I was beginning to find it rather strange to be the focus of so much attention, I felt like a freak or something; all of a sudden everyone wanted to know all about how things were going.^(P39-FG).</s><s>Some patients were also troubled when random people would ask them intimate questions about their health status.</s></p><p><s>Informal caregivers emphasized that many social relations feel uncomfortable to address the patient directly.</s><s>Informal caregivers received many cancer-related questions from social relations that were tiresome.</s><s>Some mentioned that social events were often a burden to them because of the confrontation with people asking questions about their situation.</s><s>BI don't want to be the main attraction.</s><s>Of course people look at you, and they do look at you.</s><s>Or ask you things [..].There is always a moment of hesitation, although not with the inner circle if you know what I mean.</s><s>It is more with those people who aren't quite so close.</s><s>There comes a time when you don't feel always feel comfortable with it, or strong enough.</s><s>Or you really don't want to discuss it.</s><s>You perceive it differently.</s><s>It is a very serious business, not some light-hearted social occasion.^(C32-IV).</s><s>As a consequence, some informal caregivers mentioned that going on holiday would temporarily relieve them from their new social identity because they would be anonymous there.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Being confronted with assumptions regarding cancer patients</head><p><s>Many patients and informal caregivers emphasized that the patient's appearance can be misleading because people often assume you feel good when you look good.</s><s>Many patients and informal caregivers found it confronting when people complimented the appearance of the patient or spoke negatively about it.</s><s>Some informal caregivers mentioned that patients were keeping up appearances, because patients did not want to feel like a burden to others.</s><s>According to informal caregivers, this behavior of the patient misrepresented their situation and made informal caregivers feel misunderstood by social relations.</s></p><p><s>Many patients found it difficult that their social identity changed due to cancer.</s><s>Some informal caregivers also said that they were treated differently by social relations since the cancer diagnosis.</s><s>BI've noticed that most people, my really good friends, find it difficult to disagree with me.</s><s>Do you know what I mean?</s><s>They treat you with kid gloves.</s><s>And I am the type who always says 'Come on then!</s><s>If you have a different opinion -come on, let's talk about it!</s><s>But nowadays they are very guarded, and not happy with me tackling things head on.</s><s>It isn't really helpful to me.</s><s>So I invite them over and do it anyway.^(C32-IV).</s><s>Many patients also mentioned feelings of isolation due to exclusion from conversations about events.</s><s>BAnd people just don't tell you things any more.</s><s>Like accidently discovering that your brother has been to Italy.</s><s>Then you ask them why they didn't tell you, and they reply because you can't go on holiday anymore and they thought it might upset you.^(P7-IV).</s><s>Most informal caregivers mentioned that they helped their social relations to stop avoiding the patient and instruct them how to treat the patient and themselves.</s><s>Some informal caregivers were very accepting towards socially awkward responses of their social relations, while others could not grasp the misconception of others.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consequences for social network</head><p><s>The value of social relations Most patients and informal caregivers spoke about an increased importance of social relationships.</s><s>For patients, social connectedness has been giving meaning to their lives and brought support and enjoyment, but this was hindered by experienced social exclusion.</s><s>BMy friend has been to Spain recently and I told her how much I enjoy hearing her stories</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This qualitative study shows that social consequences are substantial for patients with advanced cancer and their informal caregivers.</s><s>Major consequences have been found regarding social engagement, social identity, and social network.</s><s>Several findings deserve particular attention.</s><s>Firstly, patients and informal caregivers often mentioned their struggle to proceed with social life as prior to cancer, with an increased focus on fun activities.</s><s>However, our study also reveals that patients and informal caregivers experience barriers in doing so.</s><s>This coincides with Hasegawa et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> findings that the top unmet need in advanced cancer patients was not being able to do the usual things.</s><s>Patients in our study mentioned symptom burden and lack of time due to medical appointments as barriers.</s><s>This coincides with previous research showing that the diagnosis of advanced colorectal cancer takes a big part of life, leaving little time for patients to continue normal life activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, informal caregivers experienced less joy from social activities, and both patients and informal caregivers felt socially excluded to some extent.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Knox et al.</ref> showed that young adults with advanced cancer became socially isolated because they felt misunderstood and alienated from the rest of the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, patients, but especially caregivers, often provided instructions to social relations to reduce feelings of social isolation.</s></p><p><s>Thirdly, both patients and informal caregivers emphasized that the illness had become central in their social life.</s><s>The social identification process appeared to be influenced by the strive for normality and social isolation.</s><s>Many patients and informal caregivers resisted self-identification with cancer because they do not want to be treated differently by others and strive for normality.</s><s>When patients and informal caregivers failed to reach normality, it appeared to be more likely that they are viewed and treated as cancer patients by their social network.</s><s>Consequently, this further enhanced the selfidentification with cancer.</s><s>Harwood and Sparks <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> suggested that cancer identification also may have positive effects, such as the cognitive representation of a cancer patient as a strong and positive person <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>However, such positive associations were not found in our study.</s></p><p><s>Fourth, patients and informal caregivers experienced structural changes in their social network.</s><s>Mosher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> also described similar social network changes among patients with advanced colorectal cancer and their informal caregiver, including closer relationships, greater appreciation for life, and clarified priorities.</s><s>In our study, the perceived support was greater than anticipated.</s><s>However, patients also reported a decrease in experienced support over time, while informal caregivers experienced the opposite.</s><s>It is known that the absence of a supportive context has negative health consequences for patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and informal caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and that social support also has beneficial effects in patients with advanced cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> and informal caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is important to differentiate between types of social support as in our study patients, and informal caregivers reported sufficient practical support but a lack of emotional support.</s></p><p><s>Lastly, our study shows that many social consequences were partly equivalent to experiences of other cancer patients or cancer survivors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Some similarities in social consequences are changes in social relations, problems with social support, and feelings of social isolation.</s><s>However, some social consequences appear to be specific for advanced cancer; patients in our study worried greatly about leaving behind their loved ones.</s><s>This affected them more than worries regarding their illness or impending death.</s><s>Patients were worried about the emotional impact of their death and about the financial consequences for their loved ones.</s><s>Many patients were also worried about being a burden to others.</s><s>Previous research found that the perception of being a burden to others can have negative health effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Social consequences specific for informal caregivers of advanced cancer patients were the struggle to combine the caregiving role with normal life activities due to an increased responsibility regarding their own and, sometimes, their children's future after the patient's death.</s><s>They also feel less supported, because the patient already checked-out of life which made them feel less supported.</s></p><p><s>A strength of this study is that both advanced cancer patients and their informal caregivers were included.</s><s>Nevertheless, our study has some limitations.</s><s>First, selection bias is present because most participants were highly educated and no non-western patients participated in the study.</s><s>It is known that there are barriers in including minorities in studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Due to this selection bias, cultural and educational differences regarding beliefs about cancer may be absent, while it is known that these differences exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Second, the focus groups were smaller than anticipated (two to six participants per focus group), mainly due to death or decreasing health.</s><s>Guidelines advise at least six participants in a focus group, because it may be difficult to get the group conversation going <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>However, considering our vulnerable study population, our participants felt more comfortable to discuss private topics in a smaller group with plenty opportunity to contribute to the conversation.</s><s>Furthermore, this number of participants appeared to have provided sufficient variation in experiences.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p><s>It is ironic that cancer is able to undermine the powerful resource of social relationships to cope with the illness, which may actually cause additional distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Empowering patients and their informal caregivers to discuss their feelings regarding social consequences may be beneficial.</s><s>Suggestions to empower patients and their informal caregivers are via psychological support and by increasing societal awareness, via national campaigns or websites.</s><s>Also, creating awareness among healthcare professionals regarding the social impact of advanced cancer is essential as they are able to address the topic, anticipate on social problems, and provide social support.</s><s>Also, informing social relations regarding the impact of advanced cancer and effective support methods may empower social support systems and reduce feelings of isolation.</s><s>Furthermore, a quantitative study should map the extent of social consequences among these patients and their informal caregivers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Our results suggest that advanced cancer has substantial impact on social engagement, social identity, and social networks.</s><s>Many patients and their informal caregivers engage less in social activities, their social identity shifts towards the disease, and they perceive many changes in their social network.</s><s>Feelings of social exclusion appear to be inevitable.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,178.02,440.90,366.41,269.07" type="bitmap" /></figure>
