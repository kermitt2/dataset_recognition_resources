<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Il-11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure, whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 protects against disease.</s><s>Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli.</s><s>These results reveal a central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose that inhibition of IL-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases.</s></p><p><s>Trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into activated myofibroblasts, which express α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, is a defining feature of fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8</ref> .</s><s>We automated the quantification of myofibroblasts and ECM production in primary human cardiac fibroblast cultures (n = 84; Extended Data Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on paired unstimulated and TGFβ1-stimulated samples (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>).</s><s>Genes were ranked on the basis of the magnitude and significance of their differential expression and their correlation with myofibroblasts.</s><s>Typical fibrosis genes such as COMP and NOX4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9</ref> were among the mostupregulated genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Gene set enrichment analysis showed upregulation of genes important for protein secretion (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Notably, IL11 expression showed the most positive correlation with myofibroblast numbers (r = 0.47, P adjusted = 6.44 × 10 −6 ; Spearman's correlation) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1a</ref>) and upregulation of IL11 expression (8.5-fold, P adjusted = 6 × 10 −218 ; DESeq2 10 ) defined the dominant transcriptional response of cardiac fibroblasts to TGFβ1.</s><s>IL11 expression is highly specific to fibroblasts, especially when stimulated, but is undetectable in most healthy human tissues and cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>).</s><s>To further explore the biological context of IL-11, we examined the expression of its receptor (IL11RA) compared to the receptor of IL-6 (IL6R), a close family member, across 512 cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref> .</s><s>IL6R was present at high levels in immune cells, whereas IL11RA was most highly expressed in fibroblasts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To investigate Il11 expression in vivo, we performed single-cell RNA-seq of hearts from a Pln R9C/+ mouse, which has a cardiac fibrosis phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> , and a wild-type control mouse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>).</s><s>Both Il11 (P = 5.6 × 10 −8 ) and Il11ra1 (P = 2.2 × 10 −16 ) were enriched in fibroblasts and Il11 was highly expressed in fibroblast subpopulations that had transcriptional features of TGFβ1 activation or ECM production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1d</ref>).</s><s>Il11expressing cells were most common in fibrotic Pln R9C/+ hearts and we confirmed Il-11   protein upregulation in this model (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>IL11 has been linked to haematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref> and tumorigenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> , among other roles.</s><s>In contrast to a previous cardiac study <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> , we found that recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) is strongly pro-fibrotic in cardiac fibroblasts, increasing myofibroblasts and ECM production, motility, contraction and invasion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1e</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>).</s><s>To better understand the apparent contradiction between our data and the previous work in which rhIL-11 was used in mouse models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> , we tested whether rhIL-11 could activate mouse cardiac fibroblasts.</s><s>rhIL-11 was mostly ineffective in mouse cardiac fibroblasts, whereas recombinant mouse Il-11 (rmIl-11) activated mouse cardiac and renal fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>).</s><s>rhIL-11 strongly activated human renal fibroblasts.</s></p><p><s>Our findings implicate a pro-fibrotic role for IL-11 downstream of TGFβ1.</s><s>In the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-11 antibodies, the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ1 were greatly diminished across a wide range of fibrosis assays (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1f</ref>-i and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>).</s><s>We made ligand traps by fusing IL11RA and gp130 (IL11RA:gp130) and these traps inhibited the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ1 in a dose-dependent manner.</s><s>The specificity of IL-11 inhibition was further confirmed through inhibition of IL11RA using receptor-blocking antibodies or by short interfering RNA (siRNA), all of which attenuated the effects of TGFβ1.</s><s>By contrast, anti-IL-6 antibodies had no effect on TGFβ1-induced cardiac fibroblast activation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next investigated the consequences of IL-11 signalling in cardiac fibroblasts using RNAseq.</s><s>Surprisingly, the effect of IL-11 on the transcriptome was negligible, whereas TGFβ1driven transcriptional regulation in cardiac fibroblasts from the same patients remained profound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2a, b</ref>).</s><s>We repeated the experiment using cardiac fibroblasts from multiple patients and consistently observed very little effect of IL-11 on mRNA levels but, in the cell culture supernatants of identical samples, we reproducibly documented pro-fibrotic protein secretion.</s><s>Therefore, the effects of IL-11 on cardiac fibroblasts are mainly at the protein level and are unrelated to transcriptional changes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>This differs from effects of IL-11 on cancer cells, in which JAK-STAT signalling is involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>IL-11 can bind to free IL11RA, which is shed from cardiac fibroblast membranes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and signal in trans in cells that express GP130 (also known as IL6STP1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> .</s><s>We generated an IL11RA:IL-11 fusion protein (hyperIL-11), which mimics the transsignalling complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> .</s><s>Concentrations of hyperIL-11 as low as 0.2 ng ml −1 activated cardiac fibroblasts (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), supporting a role for IL-11 trans-signalling in fibrosis.</s></p><p><s>We found that both IL11 and IL11RA are expressed in fibroblasts, which implies that an autocrine signalling loop exists.</s><s>Using hyperIL-11, which is not detected in an IL-11 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we confirmed the existence of autocrine IL-11 signalling in cardiac fibroblasts.</s><s>This autocrine, feed-forward loop of hyperIL-11induced IL-11 secretion is dependent on de novo IL-11 protein synthesis and secretion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), but is independent of IL11 RNA levels.</s><s>In separate experiments, rhIL-11 (not detected by IL-11 ELISA) cis-signalling also strongly induced endogenous IL-11 secretion, and this also occurred in the absence of changes in IL11 mRNA levels (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>TGFβ1 activation of non-canonical ERK signalling in fibroblasts is important for fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> and we observed that IL-11 also activated ERK in cardiac fibroblasts and that both TGFβ1 and IL-11 required ERK to induce pro-fibrotic phenotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Because the effects of IL-11 on pro-fibrotic gene expression are post-transcriptional, we suggest that this phenomenon may be driven, in part, by activation of ERK and its downstream substrates (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We therefore investigated the activation of STAT, SMAD, ERK and kinases that are important for protein synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts in response to stimulation by a range of pro-fibrotic factors.</s><s>These factors included established stimuli for cardiac fibrosis (endothelin-1 (END1), angiotensin II (AngII) and PDGF) and other key pro-fibrotic cytokines (OSM, bFGF, CTGF and IL13) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> .</s><s>IL-11 activation of STAT in cardiac fibroblasts was negligible, consistent with its lack of transcriptional effects in this cell type.</s><s>As expected, TGFβ1 activated SMAD, but the only pathway that was consistently activated by all stimuli was the ERK pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2e</ref>).</s><s>All pro-fibrotic stimuli that were tested induced changes in IL-11 protein levels but not mRNA; only TGFβ1 increased SMAD-dependent IL11 transcription (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2f</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Remarkably, as seen with TGFβ1, fibroblast activation in response to all pro-fibrotic stimuli that were tested was dependent on IL-11 signalling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2g</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We studied the fibrotic response of cardiac fibroblasts from Il11ra1 −/− mice 20 .</s><s>TGFβ1induced transcriptional regulation in Il11ra1 −/− cardiac fibroblasts was maintained and similar to that of Il11ra1 +/+ (wild-type) cardiac fibroblasts (R 2 = 0.94, P &lt; 2.2 × 10 −16 , Spearman's correlation; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>However, protein-based assays showed that cardiac fibroblasts from Il11ra1 −/− mice did not increase synthesis of ECM proteins or become myofibroblasts upon stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2h</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), again demonstrating the effect of IL-11 at the protein level.</s></p><p><s>We investigated the role of Il-11 in a mouse model of myocardial infarction, but rather than injecting rhIL-11, as had been done in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> , we administered rmIl-11.</s><s>We measured epicardial activation, a defining feature of active fibrosis in myocardial infarction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> and found that rmIl-11 robustly stimulated fibroblasts in the epicardium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a-c</ref>) and caused ventricular impairment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3d, e</ref>).</s><s>We then tested the effects of rmIl-11 injection in healthy mice using regimens similar to those used for rhIL-11 in patients with cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> .</s><s>rmIL-11 injection in Col1a1-GFP reporter mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> resulted in specific activation of fibroblasts in the epicardium and renal interstitium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3f</ref>).</s><s>rmIl-11-treated mice had high circulating levels of TGFβ1, but not of other pro-inflammatory factors and features of cardiac and renal impairment along with cardiovascular fibrosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3g</ref>-i and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To investigate the effects of autocrine Il-11 signalling in fibroblasts in vivo, we generated rmIl-11-transgenic mice, which we crossed with inducible Col1a2-Cre mice (Il-11-Tg; see Methods).</s><s>Il-11 was expressed after induction with tamoxifen and within two weeks, there was widespread activation of cardiac and renal fibroblasts and accumulation of collagen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3j, k</ref>).</s><s>This was accompanied by a reduction in cardiac function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3l</ref>), increased serum TGFβ1 and an increase in serum urea and creatinine, which are biomarkers of renal failure (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Il-11 expression was found to be increased in three preclinical models of cardiovascular fibrosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4a</ref>, e, i).</s><s>Therefore, using knockout and wild-type mice we determined whether inhibition of Il-11 could reduce fibrosis in these models.</s><s>After either AngII infusion or transverse aortic constriction, less fibrosis occurred in the hearts of knockout mice compared to wild-type mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4b, c</ref>, f, g).</s><s>This effect was independent of loading conditions (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, after folateinduced kidney damage, knockout mice had reduced renal fibrosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4j, k</ref>).</s><s>Deletion of Il11ra1 signalling resulted in reduced ERK signalling across all models tested, whereas p38 signalling was unaffected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4d</ref>, h, l and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>IL-11 was discovered owing to its ability to sustain an IL-6-dependent haematopoetic cell line when secreted from fibroblastic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref> , but was later found to be redundant for haematopoiesis 20 .</s><s>Here we show that IL11 is a crucial fibrosis gene acting downstream of TGFβ1 and many other pro-fibrotic factors.</s><s>We believe that the importance of IL-11 in fibroblasts may have gone unnoticed because its effects are apparent only at the posttranscriptional level (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>We highlight that IL11RA is not only expressed in fibroblasts but also in other cells and that IL-11 signalling may therefore be important in other cell types.</s></p><p><s>We note that rhIL-11 has been given to patients with myocardial infarction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref> and it is possible that the use of rhIL-11 in cancer patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> causes fibrosis-related side effects.</s><s>We therefore suggest that the use of rhIL-11 in humans should be reviewed.</s><s>IL11 is highly upregulated in fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or systemic sclerosis, by a 100-fold and 30-fold, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26</ref> ; this suggests a role for IL-11 in fibrotic human disease beyond the cardiovascular system.</s><s>IL-11 inhibitors may be particularly effective in treating fibrosis, because they would target a nodal point of pro-fibrotic signalling.</s><s>Because of these results, and target safety data from human <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27</ref> and mouse knockouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> , we propose that IL-11 is a potential therapeutic target.</s></p><p><s>Online Content Methods, along with any additional Extended Data display items and Source
