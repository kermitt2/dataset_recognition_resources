<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical features of ischemic patients for whom cigarette smoking was the sole risk factor for ischemic stroke.</s><s>Methods Among the 1,329 patients (male, n=833; female, n=496) with acute ischemic stroke who were admitted to our hospital between April 2005 and September 2016, 346 (26%) were smokers [male, n=308 (36.9%); female, 38 (7.6%)].</s><s>In 42 (3.1%;</s><s>male, n=41; female, n=1) cases, cigarette smoking was considered to be the sole risk factor for ischemic stroke.</s><s>Data regarding gender, age, the clinical type of ischemic stroke, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at the admission, the modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores before the onset and at discharge, the progression of symptoms, and the recurrence of infarction were investigated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The mean age of the 42 patients was 63.2Â±12.4 years (range, 26-86 years).</s><s>The clinical types of ischemic stroke included atherothrombosis (n=19), lacunar (n=17), other type (n=2) and undetermined type (n =4).</s><s>The median NIHSS score at the time of admission for ischemic stroke was 2 (interquartile range: IQR 1-4.25).</s><s>The median mRS scores before the onset and at the discharge were 0 (IQR 0-0) and 1 (IQR 0-2), respectively.</s><s>One patient had symptoms of progression; no patients had recurrence of infarction.</s><s>Conclusion Our findings suggest that cigarette smoking alone may induce ischemic stroke; moreover, patients for whom smoking was the sole risk factor for ischemic stroke showed milder symptoms in comparison to patients with other risk factors; however, ischemic stroke was induced from youth.</s><s>Since cigarette smoking has detrimental effects on the central nervous system, we suggest that people be encouraged to quit smoking in order to maintain good health.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The statistical analyses were performed using the PASW Statistics software program (version 18, SPSS Science, Chicago, USA).</s><s>The NIHSS score at admission, and the mRS before the onset and at discharge were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Bonferroni correction.</s><s>Ratios were compared using the chi-squared test.</s><s>In all of the analyses, a p value of &lt;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.</s><s>The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Saitama Medical University (application no.</s><s>17-012).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Cigarette smoking is regarded as a "silent killer" and a risk factor for stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>No previous reports have investigated the clinical features of ischemic stroke in patients in whom cigarette smoking was considered to be the sole risk factor.</s><s>Regarding gender bias, Kubo et al. reported that the rate of ischemic infarction in men tended to be higher than that in women (1.4-1.8 odds) (7).</s><s>In the present study the incidence of ischemic stroke in men in whom cigarette smoking was considered to be the sole risk factor was higher than that in women.</s><s>We hypothesized that the arteriosclerotic changes and cardiac load in men are greater in comparison to those in women.</s><s>Moreover, the patients in the smoking alone group were younger at the onset of ischemic stroke.</s><s>This may be due to the fact that many of the cigarette smokers had smoked since young adulthood without hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or atrial fibrillation.</s><s>Arteriosclerosis and cardiac loading may start at a young age.</s><s>Actually, the smoking rate in Japan is high in individuals who range from their thirties to fifties, and decreases among individuals in their sixties (8).</s><s>Moreover, since smoking has been associated with increased hematocrit levels, platelet activation and aggregation, vasoconstriction, increased circulating levels of fibrinogen, thrombin generation and an impaired endogenous fibrinolytic capacity (9-11) -in smokers -vascular occlusion may be induced by thrombogenic factors rather than atherogenic factors.</s><s>Thus, it is expected that smoking-associated ischemic infarction may occur at a younger age.</s><s>However, we need to consider that the smoking population in Japan is comprised of younger individuals.</s><s>The younger age of the patients was considered to be the reason why the NIHSS scores at admission and the mRS scores at discharge were lower in the smoking group.</s><s>Thus, we considered that their younger age would have been associated with a good recovery.</s><s>However, in addition to causing stroke and major coronary events (7), cigarette smoking also causes arrhythmia (12, 13).</s><s>The patients had no history of atrial fibrillation and atrial fibrillation was not detected by repeated Holter monitoring on admission.</s><s>However, this does not preclude the possibility of cigarette smoking-induced arrhythmias.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .
