<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Tumors rarely arise during the first month of life.</s><s>In the U.K., only 303 neonates with cancer were reported over a 3-decade period <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the largest cohort of neonatal cancers ever studied.</s><s>Nevertheless, the increasing number of patients over time is related to the fact that the 17  registries are enrolled in the SEER program over the period between 1973 and 2000 and pooled their patients gradually to the database <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Neonates with tumors experienced significantly inferior outcome compared with that of older patients who had the same disease, except for those with neuroblastoma.</s><s>We believe the one cause of this difference could be treatment denial for newborns.</s><s>This hypothesis is supported by the higher rate of death due to causes other than cancer among neonates in our study (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>In our study 50.1% of children died of causes other than cancer (27% from congenital anomalies and 23.1% from perinatal conditions as defined in ICD-10-CM Guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>).</s><s>This highlights another limitation of SEER data and our study and makes concrete conclusions difficult but it also underscores again our plea for further support and wider access to detailed data from patients reported on SEER.</s></p><p><s>Many neonates with tumors probably die of cardiac and/or respiratory dysfunction secondary to their untreated cancer.</s><s>One possible explanation is that these infants are treated in neonatal intensive care units, and the decision to not treat their disease is occasionally made without consulting a pediatric oncologist.</s><s>This explanation requires further investigation and conducting wider retrospective and prospective studies.</s><s>Unfortunately, the SEER does not provide public access to information (to the time of writing this article) on chemotherapy regimens, so we cannot conclude anything about the prevalence of that approach to treating neonates.</s></p><p><s>Other studies have documented withholding therapy from neonates with cancer.</s><s>In Isaacs' study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> of 154 children with CNS tumors, 120 were not offered any treatment, but the 34 who received any kind of therapy experienced superior outcome.</s><s>However, no quality-of-life data were provided.</s></p><p><s>We are not proposing aggressive treatment of all neonates, especially those with CNS tumors, without consideration of quality of life, or in patients with serious comorbidities or congenital anomalies (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>) as this may cause more harm than benefit.</s><s>In a study from Japan, 76% of neonates who survived CNS tumors suffered mental retardation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>We propose that special attention be given to neonates to determine the optimal therapy with minimal toxicity (e.g., differentiating agents) that can be administered <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As reported by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, we found a disturbing lack of improvement in outcome over the last 34 years in all of the neonatal tumors we investigated.</s><s>The fact that even with the major advances in medicine, oncologic treatment, supportive care, and neonatology care the outcome in the third period is not much different than 30 years earlier underscores that the major hindrance is related to age group and not other external factors.</s><s>In older children, survival of every tumor type improved every decade.</s><s>We believe the lack of outcome improvement, despite all the medical advancements, could result from depriving many neonates effective (or any) therapy.</s><s>For each tumor group, the outcome of neonates was worse than that of older children.</s><s>A similar observation was made in the U.K. neonatal cohort, even in cases in which the tumors were associated with a good prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, neuroblastoma was the most common neonatal tumor.</s><s>Most other neonatal cancer studies have reported teratomas as the most common neoplasm, followed by neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>This difference may reflect the fact that the SEER registry does not report mature teratomas.</s><s>The 5-year OS in our study was 76.8%, which is comparable to that in other studies (74% <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and 88.3% <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</s><s>In addition, Isaacs reported improved survival between cases before 1983 and those diagnosed thereafter.</s><s>Era did not affect survival in our study.</s></p><p><s>The second-most common tumor in our study was germ cell tumors.</s><s>The SEER database does not include mature or benign tumors before 2004; therefore, it is difficult to compare the outcome of those diseases with that of such tumors in other studies.</s><s>Acute leukemias are rare in neonates, compared to their incidence in older children <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The distinction between congenital and neonatal leukemia is arbitrary, and most reports discuss congenital, neonatal, and infantile leukemias as a single group <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>Our study confirmed that patients with neonatal leukemias have a much poorer prognosis than older patients and less improvement in outcome, especially for those with ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>AML was the more common diagnosis than ALL in neonates, which was the case in earlier reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>The prognosis of neonates with AML was also better than that of neonates with ALL, which supports results from all other reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> and contradicts what is seen in older children.</s><s>This difference might reflect the fact that neonatal AML is closely related to transient myeloproliferative disorder, which shows spontaneous remission in most of cases.</s></p><p><s>Recently, an update for WHO Classification for Pediatric Brain Tumors has removed PNET as an entity from the classification and it was integrated in embryonal tumors.</s><s>The diagnoses of this group became dependent on the presence C19MC amplification <ref type="bibr"
