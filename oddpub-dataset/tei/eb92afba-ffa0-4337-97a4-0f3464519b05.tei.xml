50%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>%EWL is calculated using the following formula: (postoperative weight loss)/(preoperative excess weight) × 100.</s><s>BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 is recognized as the lowest limit of overweight, and therefore excess weight is calculated relative to a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>However, the dichotomous classification into success versus failure, with an arbitrarily defined cut-off at 50% EWL, does not reflect the considerably wide individual variation in postoperative weight loss that has been described in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Approximately 15% to 20% of all bariatric surgery patients fail to achieve adequate %EWL <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>; inadequate weight loss is considered to be EWL &lt; 25% according to the Reinhold criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Surprisingly little is known about the factors that promote or hinder weight loss after bariatric surgery.</s></p><p><s>Given the background of a multifactorial etiology of obesity, a multidisciplinary evaluation before bariatric surgery is recommended, and the assessment of psychosocial factors in addition to the medical examination has become highly relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>However, although the number of bariatric procedures performed is rising <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, conclusive empirical evidence about the impact of psychosocial factors on postoperative weight loss outcomes is still lacking.</s></p><p><s>Psychological factors and mental disorders have been associated with weight loss results after bariatric surgery.</s><s>Notably, up to 70% of obese patients considering bariatric surgery present with high rates of mental comorbidities, with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders being the most prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Within the current medical-theoretical framework, causal pathways between obesity and mental disorders are likely to be bidirectional.</s><s>On one hand, being a target of weight-based discrimination and stigmatization might lead to depressive symptoms with feelings of worthlessness, social anxiety, and isolation, especially in extremely obese patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, depression and anxiety disorders might contribute to weight gain by interfering with healthy eating behaviors and might complicate weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Eating in response to negative emotions might have an anxiolytic effect, and an increased appetite extending to overeating can be a symptom of depression.</s><s>Furthermore, stress might play an important intermediating role in the association between obesity and mental disorders: under conditions of chronic stress, the activity of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis, which responds to stress by releasing cortisol and hormones that modulate sympathetic nervous system activity, becomes dysregulated, a state that has been implicated in depression and anxiety disorders as well as in obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Obese patients with comorbid mental disorders might have difficulties in adhering to the behavioral changes required to benefit from bariatric surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However, the predictive value of preoperative depression and anxiety disorder for weight loss outcomes after bariatric surgery is controversial; different studies have shown a negative influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a positive influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, or no effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, there is evidence that the severity rather than the types of mental disorders appears to be more relevant for weight loss outcomes; that is, a greater overall psychological burden is associated with less weight loss after bariatric surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Coping strategies, used when confronting difficult situations in daily life, and the motivation to undergo surgery might also be related to different weight loss outcomes; however, research is scarce.</s><s>Recent studies have reported more avoidant and (delegated) active coping in patients seeking bariatric surgery versus patients seeking conservative treatment options <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or more avoidance and depressive coping reactions in a subgroup of emotional dysregulated/undercontrolled versus resilient/high-functioning prebariatric women <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Although maladaptive coping behavior might complicate postbariatric weight loss, clear associations have not been established yet.</s></p><p><s>To date, most research on the role of prebariatric psychological variables in treatment success has focused on gastric bypass surgery.</s><s>Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) as a restrictive single-stage procedure is relatively new in the field of bariatric surgery but has already proven its efficacy in weight reduction with low surgical risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>To our knowledge, no studies have systematically assessed the relationship between postoperative %EWL and preoperative psychological burden (as a broader construct comprising "perceived stress," "depression," "anxiety," and "mental impairment"), coping style, and the motivation to undergo surgery in a clinical sample of LSG patients.</s></p><p><s>Hence, assessing a broad range of preoperative patient characteristics might be useful to identify homogeneous subgroups of LSG patients with different needs to tailor interventions and optimize postoperative weight loss outcomes and well-being.</s><s>Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to characterize patients with low, moderate, and high postoperative %EWL retrospectively using betweengroup comparisons to examine whether LSG patients with different %EWL levels after surgery differed preoperatively in (1) their psychological burden in terms of the levels of "perceived stress," "depression," "anxiety," and "mental impairment," (2) coping style (e.g., "active coping"), and (3) their motivation to lose weight.</s><s>As a secondary aim, we wanted to study whether the %EWL groups differed on a range of preoperative patient characteristics, such as (a) weight and BMI, (b) sociodemographic status, (c) clinically diagnosed comorbidities including eating disorders, and (d) the use of psychotherapy.</s><s>To do so, LSG patients were evaluated approximately 12 months before surgery and on average 20 months after surgery.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In the present study, we employed a retrospective approach to examine associations between preoperative factors and the amount of %EWL achieved on average 20 months after bariatric surgery in 64 patients who underwent LSG.</s><s>Patients were classified into groups with low, moderate, and high postoperative %EWL based on tertiles to identify homogeneous subgroups of LSG patients for group comparisons.</s></p><p><s>Our results showed that LSG patients with high %EWL had a lower weight and BMI prior to surgery compared with patients with moderate %EWL, but no significant weight and BMI differences compared with patients with low %EWL were found.</s><s>This initially counterintuitive finding is in line with previous studies of gastric bypass surgery reporting that patients who were preoperatively less obese have a higher postoperative %EWL <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s><s>One possible explanation is that patients who were preoperatively more obese (i.e., BMI ≥ 50 kg/m 2 ) tend to stagnate earlier in their weight loss process and begin to regain weight as early as 12 months after surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Although early weight stagnation and weight regain might play a role, our prepost study design masks the time course of weight change, and therefore explanations remain speculative at this point.</s><s>Longitudinal data are necessary to assess the course of weight after LSG in more detail.</s></p><p><s>The preoperative psychological burden and motivation to lose weight were not associated with the amount of %EWL in patients following LSG intervention.</s><s>However, more self-reported "active coping" behavior (assessed by the following items: "I have been concentrating my efforts on doing something about the situation I am in"; "I have been taking action to try to make the situation better"; "I have been trying to come up with a strategy about what to do"; and "I have been thinking hard about what steps to take") seemed to be beneficial for treatment success in terms of more favorable weight loss outcomes.</s><s>In summary, a more "active coping" style might be predictive of higher postoperative weight loss outcomes.</s><s>However, the results provided no clear evidence of a clinically important role of preoperative mental health and the motivation to lose weight in the weight-related treatment success of LSG.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have identified psychological predictors of weight loss outcomes after bariatric surgery; for example, some have observed less weight loss in patients with mood and anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>However, across reviews of the prebariatric predictors of postbariatric weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, relationships between psychological factors and weightrelated surgery outcomes seem inconsistent and appear to vary by study design and sample.</s><s>On one hand, obese patients receiving bariatric surgery constitute a highly selective group.</s><s>Bariatric surgery patients must meet certain criteria to be eligible for surgery (e.g., they must meet a certain BMI requirement, be free of potential contraindications, and obtain approval from health care team members), which evidently results in a homogenized sample of medically and mentally healthier patients.</s><s>Therefore, the variability within our sample of patients who underwent LSG surgery might be reduced, which could in turn lower the magnitude of %EWL group differences and underestimate the impact of psychological factors on weight loss outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, static factors such as sociodemographic status assessed prior to bariatric intervention might have limited practical value for predicting weight loss because they do not capture patients' flexibility in adapting to changing circumstances after the intervention.</s><s>In fact, some studies suggest that postbariatric factors such as the (re)occurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> or the loss of control over eating <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> have a much stronger impact on weight loss outcomes after bariatric surgery than prebariatric factors do.</s><s>How might those possibilities be applicable to our findings?</s><s>While suggesting tailored interventions to optimize treatment success, our results demonstrate the difficulty of preoperatively identifying patients who are at risk for more unfavorable postoperative weight-related outcomes.</s><s>However, our results might also indicate that more active coping behavior is a marker of higher postoperative weight loss.</s><s>As discussed by Ahnis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, active coping behavior in obese patients seeking a bariatric intervention might include the preoperative search for information about surgical treatment options on the internet, in support groups, in informative meetings, or during medical visits and examinations.</s><s>This behavior may in turn contribute to patients developing a more informed and educated perspective on the possibilities and limitations of LSG surgery and the necessary lifestyle modifications (e.g., following dietary advice and physical activity recommendations) to achieve higher and sustained weight loss after surgery.</s></p><p><s>However, because bariatric surgery leads to a profound change in patients' gastrointestinal and whole-body physiology, it is important to also consider potential physiological mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, such considerations might be complex, and psychological and physiological factors might actually combine and interact in influencing outcomes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Strengths and Limitations.</head><p><s>The strength of our study is that it was conducted in a naturalistic clinical setting.</s><s>In addition, whereas the majority of previous research in this area focused on Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, we had access to a homogeneous clinical sample of patients undergoing LSG.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that systematically assessed the relationship between postoperative %EWL on average 20 months after surgery and the preoperative psychological burden (as a broader construct comprising "perceived stress," "depression," "anxiety," and "mental impairment"), coping style, and motivation to undergo surgery in a sample of LSG patients.</s><s>The size of our sample was comparable to that of other small-scale studies in the field of bariatric surgery.</s><s>Moreover, the attrition rate in our study was rather small, and our attrition analyses showed no significant differences in preoperative variables between patients who provided data at follow-up compared with those who did not.</s><s>However, from a statistical perspective, the sample size is still small, allowing for only a few statistical tests in addition to a large set of exploratory analyses.</s><s>The patients' postoperative weight was self-reported, which might undermine the validity of the %EWL classification scheme.</s><s>However, self-reporting of weight is relatively common in obesity studies, and there is evidence that objectively measured and self-reported weights are not significantly different in bariatric surgery patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, it can be argued that the generation of "psychological burden" as a broader construct comprising "perceived stress," "depression," "anxiety," and "mental impairment" might be questionable.</s><s>However, all these variables proved to be strong determinants of patients' psychological burden, with high intercorrelations and high loadings on a single factor, thus supporting the use of the combined variable to capture the construct of psychological burden.</s></p></div>
