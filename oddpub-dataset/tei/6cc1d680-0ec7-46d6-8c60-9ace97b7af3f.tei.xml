<ref type="bibr">Treadway and Zald, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Preclinical data suggest these symptom dimensions depend on distinct neurobiological circuits, and clinically they have different implications for outcomes and treatment <ref type="bibr">(Treadway and Zald, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vrieze et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Several lines of evidence suggest anhedonia is particularly important to use of stimulants such as cocaine.</s><s>In a large, population-based sample of adults with stimulant use disorder, anhedonia was uniquely associated with lifetime stimulant use and stimulant dependence, even after controlling for depressed mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Leventhal et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>This relationship could be due to differential responses to cocaine, as anhedonia was also associated with more positive hedonic responses to cocaine in cocaine users, while depressed mood did not predict subjective responses to cocaine.</s><s>This suggests individuals with anhedonia may experience enhanced addictive effects of cocaine, leading to greater use and poorer treatment outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Wardle et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, a failure to distinguish between anhedonia and other symptoms of depression such as negative mood may contribute to the generally weak relationship between overall measures of depression and indicators of cocaine use.</s></p><p><s>Although the distinction between negative mood and anhedonia represents a theoreticallydriven parsing of depression symptoms with apparent relevance to addiction, there have also been a number of data-driven attempts to identify depression dimensions or sub-types.</s><s>This includes a prior investigation in individuals with cocaine use disorder, which utilized the Beck Depression Inventory, 2 nd Edition (BDI-II; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beck et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Conner et al., 2008)</ref> to identify three symptom dimensions: Cognitive, Affective and Somatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Seignourel et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Another analysis in patients with depression utilizing multiple depression measures, including the BDI-II, found eight factors: Depressed Mood, Tension, Negative Cognition, Impaired Sleep, Suicidal Thoughts, Reduced Appetite, Anhedonia and Amotivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ballard et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>There has also historically been a distinction between "Melancholic" and "Atypical" subtypes of depression, with "Atypical" presenting with more fatigue and anxiety <ref type="bibr">(APA, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, there are multiple possible ways to parse depressive symptoms into groups or dimensions, and it is unclear which of these dimensions might best explain heterogeneity in the relationship between depressive symptoms and cocaine use.</s><s>Therefore, our goal was to use data-driven modeling to establish which symptoms of depression most strongly relate to frequency of cocaine use in the last 30 days in a sample of current cocaine users.</s><s>We utilized frequency of use in the last 30 days as our primary outcome because it is a parsimonious measure of severity that shows stronger predictive ability for treatment outcomes compared to other measures such as years of use or the Addiction Severity Index drug composite score <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Reiber et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>However, we secondarily examined Cocaine Dependence diagnosis and severity of diagnosis in supplemental analyses as additional indicators of severity, to test the generality of the identified predictors.</s><s>To measure depressive symptoms, we used the items of the Beck Depression Inventory, 2 nd Edition.</s><s>The BDI-II includes items related to depressed mood (e.g., sadness and crying), somatic symptoms (e.g., sleep and appetite), cognitive symptoms (e.g., being unable to make decisions), and anhedonia, including items for loss of pleasure, loss of interest in activities, loss of energy, and loss of interest in sex that have previously been identified as composing an anhedonia sub-scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Joiner et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pizzagalli et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>We utilized tools from the field of data science to build a model predicting the proportion of the last 30 days on which an individual used cocaine from individual items on the BDI-II.</s><s>Data science blends features of computer science, machine learning, and statistics to provide efficient, data-driven exploration of the relationships between variables and optimized prediction of outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hastie et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, we chose Generalized Additive Modeling.</s><s>The generalized nature of GAM allows estimation of non-Gaussian outcome distributions, such as the proportion outcome used here.</s><s>The additive nature of GAM allows for non-linear relationships between BDI-II items and cocaine use.</s><s>For example, some theories posit that both very high and very low levels of reward sensitivity may contribute to addictive behaviors, suggesting a possible quadratic relationship between anhedonia items and addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Davis and Fox, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Additive models use a machine learning algorithm to fit predictors using smoothing functions across the range of each predictor's possible values; in essence allowing non-linear data-driven functions to be estimated, rather than fitting a single straight line through predictor values <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hastie et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Each item on the BDI-II is measured on a 4-point Likert-type scalefitting these items as smoothed (nonlinear) predictors enables investigation of the shape of the relationship to cocaine use over each of the four points on that scale.</s><s>Previous studies (i.e., those reported by the meta-analysis in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Conner et al., 2008)</ref> have examined the relationship between cocaine use and depression using total scale scores, rather than itemlevel data; such total scale scores may mask nonlinear contributions of individual items.</s><s>Our hypothesis was that items previously identified as part of the BDI-II Anhedonia sub-scale would be the most strongly related to frequency of current cocaine use; however, our approach allowed extraction of the optimal combination of items for predicting cocaine use.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Measurements</head><p><s>Depression symptoms were measured using the 21-item BDI-II, which was administered within a battery of computerized self-report questionnaires.</s><s>Cocaine use frequency was determined from the Addiction Severity Index (ASI).</s><s>The ASI is a semi-structured interview that assesses seven problem areas (drug use, alcohol use, legal status, medical status, employment and support, family and social status, and psychiatric status) in individuals with current (last 30 days) and past (lifetime) substance use history, and was completed by the trained licensed professional counselor as part of the interview portion of the screening protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(McLellan et al., 1980)</ref>.</s><s>This measure is where the proportion (0-1) of self-reported days of cocaine use over the last 30 days was captured.</s><s>Supplemental analyses examined dichotomous presence vs. absence of cocaine use disorder based on Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 th Edition (SCID-IV; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">First et al., 1996)</ref> as well as categorical mild/moderate/severe ratings of severity of cocaine dependence completed as a part of the SCIDIV for the n = 551 individuals with a diagnosis of cocaine dependence.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Significance</head><p><s>The present analyses explored the strength and shape of the relationships between cocaine use frequency and depressive symptoms.</s><s>The set of strongest predictors did not conform to a previously hypothesized depression "subtype", as they consisted of Crying, Pessimism, Changes in Appetite, Indecisiveness, and Loss of Interest.</s><s>Relevant to our hypothesis, although the anhedonia item "Loss of Interest" was a strong predictor of use, the selected top items also included some generally thought of as representing negative mood (e.g., "Crying") and excluded the other anhedonia scale items.</s><s>The presence of Loss of Interest but absence of other anhedonia scale items could indicate key differences among the anhedonia items on the BDI-II.</s><s>One possibility is that they differentially represent "pleasure" vs. "motivation," two reward-related functions thought to have separable neural substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berridge et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, this is difficult to conclude based on single items, particularly when little is known about the relationship between these items and underlying reward-related functions.</s><s>Primarily, this again points out that no previously hypothesized subtypes or subscales captured the most important symptoms for predicting cocaine use frequency.</s></p><p><s>We also found broad evidence for the importance of nonlinear effects over and above strictly linear effects.</s><s>These stronger quadratic and cubic effects suggest the response options on the BDI-II deviate from the purported monotonically increasing ordinal scale of the instrument.</s><s>For example, for the Crying item, we saw a strong positive linear trend between the second and third response options that reversed at the tails.</s><s>The strongest effect of Crying, related to more severe cocaine use, was found at response option two, "I cry over every little thing."</s><s>Endorsing the highest response option (three) "I feel like crying, but I can't" may not constitute an increase in magnitude of the construct "crying" as a symptom of depression.</s><s>These nonlinear relationships have practical consequences for using individual items from this instrument to indicate strength of specific symptoms: higher order response options do not necessarily mean higher level effects.</s><s>Note that this does not necessarily change the use of summary scores, including total scores and clinical cut-off values, as these have welldemonstrated utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dozois et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Rather, care should be taken in extrapolating higher BDI-II scores on individual items as necessarily indicating higher levels of a symptom.</s><s>Future efforts in the use or further development of the BDI-II should investigate nonlinearity across response options.</s></p><p><s>Interpretation beyond the strongest items focused on the strongest "local" effects for specific response options.</s><s>Such effects were found in items related to Crying ("I cry over every little thing"), Suicidal Thoughts ("I would kill myself if I had the chance"), Worthlessness ("I feel utterly worthless"), and Pessimism ("I feel my future is hopeless and will only get worse") and Loss of Interest ("I have lost most of my interest in other people or things").</s><s>Qualitatively, these strongest individual response options describe emotional volatility and a disregard for the future, particularly in comparison to less-predictive items such as Sadness or Irritability.</s><s>Interventions designed to target cocaine use may benefit from particular focus on depressive symptoms related to emotional volatility and a foreshortened or constricted perception of the future and world.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Limitations</head><p><s>Although use of a standard, short depression scale along with reliance on self-reported drug use allowed efficient collection of a large sample and improved ability to model complex effects, this approach also presents some limitations.</s><s>First, the BDI-II items may not adequately cover all relevant symptoms of depression.</s><s>Indeed, one previous analysis of multiple depression scales including the BDI-II suggested a higher number of sub-factors than analyses restricted to the BDI-II <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ballard et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Inclusion of scales purposely designed to capture anhedonia, or even specific facets of anhedonia such as pleasure vs. motivation (e.g., the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Sacle; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gard et al., 2006)</ref> might provide greater clarity about the contribution of this construct.</s><s>Second, our primary measure of cocaine use severity consisted of self-report of frequency of use in the past 30 days.</s><s>This measure and timeframe are commonly used to capture use frequency, generally yield greater accuracy than longer periods (e.g., 90 days; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McLellan et al., 1992)</ref>, and have better predictive validity for the clinically important outcome of treatment success than some other measures of severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Reiber et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>However, it can only be considered a onedimensional "snapshot" of severity.</s><s>Further, although information was collected by a trained interviewer in a situation in which participants had no systematic reason to downplay or exaggerate cocaine use, biochemical verification would be preferable.</s><s>This is particularly the case as depression might systematically influence reporting of prior drug use through biases in recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rotteveel and Phaf, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>To partially address these issues, we conducted several supplemental follow-up analyses.</s><s>First, we repeated our analysis of use frequency in a subsample of patients who submitted at least one biochemically verified positive urine during intake, indicating they had definite cocaine use during the period queried.</s><s>Results from this subsample were highly similar to the primary findings reported here; however, this still does not fully address the issue with reliance on self-report for the primary outcome.</s><s>Second, GAM was used in two models to explore the relationships between the BDI-II items in subsamples with available data on the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">First et al., 1996)</ref> measuring (a) dichotomous cocaine dependence (yes vs. no) and (b) categorical cocaine use severity (mild vs. moderate vs. severe), to explore convergence between our model and these other measures of severity.</s><s>These models were more conservative, removing 12 predictors each, and did not find as many nonlinear relationships as the primary results reported in this manuscript.</s><s>This may be because dichotomous cocaine dependence or categorical severity is an extreme coarsening of the same concept tapped by the primary frequency outcome; alternatively, the dichotomous and categorical outcomes may be too different qualitatively from frequency to be directly comparable to the primary outcome.</s><s>However, it should be noted that each model supported better fit for the GAM than a corresponding GLM fit to the same outcome, continuing to emphasize the importance of non-linearity.</s><s>Further, some evidence for convergent validity was supported by certain predictors (crying, self-criticalness, worthlessness, and changes in appetite) being retained by each model.</s></p><p><s>The type of applied data science research using machine learning algorithms undertaken here may also be limited by issues related to overfitting and generalizability.</s><s>The GAM algorithm utilized by the present study utilized internal mechanisms to minimize overfitting (here, restricted maximum likelihood).</s><s>However, the ultimate standard of generalizability would be to fit the algorithm to new data.</s><s>Future research using the BDI-II should test for nonlinear relationships between individual depression items and outcomes using GAM, including the cocaine use outcomes examined here for purposes of replication.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, the study was cross-sectional, so the direction of influence between cocaine use frequency and depressive symptoms is not clear.</s><s>Although our interest is in identifying potentially modifiable factors influencing drug use, depressive symptoms could also represent an outcome of more severe use, in the form of withdrawal.</s><s>The withdrawal syndrome for cocaine features anhedonia and depressive symptoms, so it may have been the case that individuals with more severe use were also more likely to be experiencing withdrawal during the time period reported on by the BDI-II.</s><s>A separate measure of withdrawal severity/frequency should be included in future research to address this question.</s><s>There may even be reciprocal causation between cocaine use and depression such that they are related in a self-reinforcing feedback loop.</s><s>We are not able to disentangle the direction of these effects here.</s><s>Finally, our sample was a convenience sample of individuals self-referring for treatment, and men and African-Americans were over-represented compared to the general cocaine-using population (SAMHSA, 2017).</s><s>Expression of depressive symptoms differs between males and females <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Altemus et al., 2014)</ref>, so examination of sex differences may be particularly important in future work, as specific items may be more or less predictive in the context of different overall reporting patterns.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Conclusions</head><p><s>This study demonstrates substantial heterogeneity in the extent to which individual symptoms of depression relate to cocaine use frequency, suggesting that the constellation of symptoms associated with depression has a complex relationship with cocaine use.</s><s>The findings support the use of data science techniques like generalized additive modeling to examine predictors of cocaine use; traditional linear models provided significantly worse fits for the data and would have obscured important non-linear relationships.</s><s>Further, although aspects of anhedonia (specifically loss of interest in other activities) predicted cocaine use frequency, the items selected did not neatly conform to prior theories about sub-types or scales of depression.</s><s>This was contrary to our hypothesis that anhedonia scale items would be the most predictive.</s><s>We tentatively identified a pattern predicting cocaine use in the symptoms related to extreme emotional volatility and a constricted world-view that disregards the future, but this should be considered preliminary, and in need of replication and confirmation.</s><s>Future research should examine the extent to which these same items predict or covary with treatment outcomes, covary with other measures of anhedonia and mood dysregulation, and ultimately whether treatment targeting these symptoms is more effective than addressing depression generally.</s><s>Ultimately, the goal is to use data-driven approaches to both identify and efficiently target treatment to the most important modifiable factors associated with cocaine use.</s><s>Additional estimated partial effects of BDI-II items predicting cocaine use frequency.</s><s>These items were chosen for having strong local effects that may have been dampened by weak effects elsewhere in the prediction space of the item.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
