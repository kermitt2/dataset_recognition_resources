<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demonstration of intracardiac EGM fidelity</head><p><s>The accurate detection of cardiac electrical activity is difficult in the MR environment in part due to the presence of time variable gradient fields and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects.</s><s>Intracardiac electrograms may be high-pass and low-pass filtered, often requiring a further notch filter to reduce gradient signal-induced noise of intracardiac electrograms.</s><s>Elbes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> found that the 'noise' amplitude inside the MR environment varied according to the type of sequence, slice orientation, gradient amplitude, and switching times with a peak-to-peak noise amplitude ranging from 0.025 to 0.700 mV.</s><s>Nazarian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> reported a filtered ventricular electrogram SNR of 71.6 compared with an unfiltered SNR of 3.7 in the endocardial RV apex using active catheter tracking in mongrel dogs.</s></p><p><s>To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating intracardiac EGM fidelity during epicardial mapping under realtime MRI guidance solely with active catheter tracking.</s><s>Epicardial substrate mapping is arguably more challenging than endocardial  mapping due to the presence of epicardial fat and low-voltage areas along the course of large coronary arteries and the atrioventricular (AV) groove, affecting the reliability of electrograms recorded. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Our study demonstrates that it is feasible to detect a good signal quality during epicardial mapping in the MR environment with an acceptable noise level and a &gt;10:1 signal-to-noise ratio for low-voltage signals.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real-time lesion visualization</head><p><s>There has been significant interest in the development of MR tools to assess ablation lesions in real time.</s><s>Direct monitoring of tissue temperature using MR-thermometry and dosimetry offers an exciting means of exploiting acute physiological changes and could potentially be used to improve the safety and efficacy of catheter ablation.</s><s>Kolandaivelu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> first described the use of MR-thermometry using the proton resonance frequency (PRF) shift technique to quantify tissue temperature changes that lead to ablation lesion formation.</s><s>In mongrel dogs, the maximum ablation lesion extent during endocardial RF ablation on MR-thermometry corresponded well to the lesion location, depth on LGE-MRI, and pathological examination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Lesion transmurality with MR-thermography was within 20% of that measured by pathology and LGE-MRI.</s><s>Recently, in an ovine model, Toupin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> demonstrated that endocardial ablation lesion dimensions on TD images correlated well with 3D T1-weighted images acquired immediately after ablation and during gross pathological examination.</s><s>The precision of lesion extent in the myocardium was in the region of 1 mm-potentially offering a useful MR tool in real time to guide the safety and efficacy of RF ablation.</s><s>Our report extends the use of this technique to provide an assessment of epicardial lesion extent during RF ablation.</s><s>Further work is still needed, however, to assess how real-time lesion imaging relates to chronic transmural lesions-a porcine recovery model of ventricular ablation could be used to confirm long-term efficacy in future studies.</s><s>In our study, the TD model was used for the prediction of ablation lesions.</s><s>Other approaches have also been proposed such as using the maximum temperature peak for each voxel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Further work is needed to establish the most accurate model for the prediction of permanent ablation lesions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hyper-acute and acute lesion visualization</head><p><s>Our data indicate that within minutes of RF ablation, there is a decrease in native T1 time in the lesion core and an overall localized elevation in native T1 times at the surrounding areas of ablation lesions compared with areas of non-ablated tissue.</s><s>Although there are few studies investigating the use of native T1 mapping to visualize the effect of RF ablation within this time frame, it has been suggested that catheter ablation induces changes in native tissue T1 time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>ollowing catheter ablation, there may be several types of tissue injury present within the lesion core and surrounding areas including necrotic tissue, haemorrhage, oedema, and thrombus.</s><s>Recent work suggests that in vivo MOLLI measurements show different T1 times at the lesion core (decreased T1) and lesion periphery (increased T1) when imaging is performed within 2 h of ablation in a porcine model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Due to the different types of tissue injury involved, it may be inappropriate to evaluate ablation lesions using an overall mean native T1 time in ablated zones.</s><s>Further, native T1 mapping may also be inappropriate to assess ablation lesions in patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy where differences in T1 times may exist between relatively healthy and diseased segments of myocardium due to the underlying cardiomyopathy making interpretation difficult following ablation.</s><s>Further work is required in this area to assess the effects of RF ablation on native T1 times at different time-points after ablation with histopathological validation.</s></p><p><s>Of the different approaches described in this study, to assess acute ablation injury (thermometry/dosimetry, native T1 mapping, and LGE), thermometry remains the only technique with the ability to assess lesions in real-time.</s><s>To facilitate the real-time MR-guided ablation, thermometry would be our preferred approach for lesion assessment.</s><s>However, there are several limitations to the technique in its current form that need to be overcome (described below).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>There are several important limitations to this work.</s><s>The purpose of this preliminary study was to demonstrate the feasibility of performing epicardial mapping and ablation under real-time MRI guidance with active catheter tracking in a pre-clinical setting.</s><s>As such, the epicardial electroanatomical maps generated were of a low resolution (101 and 56 points) and only obtained in normal hearts.</s><s>Further work is required to assess the procedural time of high-resolution epicardial activation and voltage maps under real-time MRI guidance, ideally in an animal model with areas of scar and low voltage.</s><s>Following ventricular RF ablation, large animal models frequently become tachycardic and/or develop ventricular arrhythmias that may affect the quality of the myocardium, blood, and phase signal during MR-thermometry.</s><s>MR-thermometry in the presence of irregular heart rhythm was not evaluated in this study, and its feasibility remains to be established.</s><s>Further refinements in the thermometry technique may be needed to overcome these limitations.</s><s>We did not evaluate chronic ablation injury in this model; therefore, further work is needed to evaluate whether TD achieved during acute lesions corresponds to permanent lesion formation in a recovery model.</s><s>The sensitivity and specificity of MR-thermometry for lesion monitoring during ablation was not assessed, while the limited number of lesions delivered precluded our ability to assess whether the extent of temperature rise could be predictive of lesion transmurality-these areas could be an important focus of future work.</s><s>The thermometry data required post-processing offline to generate the data on lesion dimensions.</s><s>For the data to be useful to the electrophysiologist, a realtime pipeline with visualization of the TD onto an anatomical shell and demonstration of lesion dimension needs to be developed to guide catheter ablation although this was beyond the scope of this preliminary work.</s><s>To facilitate VT ablation under MRI guidance in patients, there are still significant hurdles to overcome such as the availability of MRI-conditional defibrillation systems and MR-compatible 12-lead ECG systems.</s><s>Patients undergoing VT ablation frequently require defibrillation-the time delay associated with removing a patient from the scanner bore before delivery of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation could potentially increase the risk of mortality.</s><s>Although there are prototype MR-compatible defibrillation systems currently undergoing testing, until there are robust systems that are shown to be successfully able to defibrillate patients without increasing the time needed for defibrillation, the uptake of higher risk MR-guided interventions is likely to be limited.</s></p></div>
