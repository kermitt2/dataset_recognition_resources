<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The main finding of our study was a decrease in oscillatory beta activity that occurred during passive viewing of emotionally salient but not neutral pictures.</s><s>The power decrease was more evident in unpleasant trials; a larger and more sustained suppression of beta activity in a broad frequency range from 14 to 30 Hz was observed, compared to pleasant stimuli that showed a smaller beta power decrease in the 20-30 Hz range.</s><s>The modulation in oscillatory beta band activity correlated with the subjective rating of the emotional valence of the stimuli in our patients, but not with the severity of depressive symptoms.</s><s>Neutral stimuli induced a power increase (ERS) reflected by a large cluster including frequencies up to 18 Hz from stimulus onset until 3000 ms after (2.5-18 Hz, red cluster, 294 bins).</s><s>ERD, event-related desynchronization; ERS, event-related synchronization; FWE, family-wise error corrected.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. (A) Time course of spectral power changes in the beta frequency band (14-30 Hz) illustrated as cumulative sums (cusums).</s><s>The cusums are sensitive to changes from baseline activity which is reflected by a deflection from a zero gradient (i.e.</s><s>horizontal curve).</s><s>Note that the most steep and sustained decline occurred after presentation of unpleasant stimuli (light red curve) followed by pleasant stimuli (light blue curve).</s><s>Neutral stimuli (light brown curve) showed only a minor positive deflection from baseline activity.</s><s>(B) Bar chart showing the main effect

activity quantified as z-scores.</s><s>Error bars reflect the standard error of the mean (SEM).</s><s>Only pleasant (0.17 60.08, P &lt; 0.05) and unpleasant (-0.40 60.12, P &lt; 0.01) stimuli induced a significant change from baseline activity (based on one samples t-tests).</s><s>The strongest decrease of spectral power was evident for unpleasant stimuli (-0.40 60.12) compared to pleasant (0.17 60.08, P ¼ 0.041) and neutral stimuli (0.09 60.13, P ¼ 0.021, all Bonferroni corrected).</s></p><p><s>The sgACC area, which is part of the ACC, comprises BA24 and BA25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Drevets et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The latter has been implicated as a key node in a limbic network that shows metabolic hyperactivity in TRD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Greicius et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sacher et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In healthy subjects, induction of sadness led to the most robust activation of BA25 in the sgACC area, according to a metaanalysis of functional imaging studies of basic emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Vytal and Hamann, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>It was concluded that the sgACC area is critically involved in regulating negative affect and sgACC-area hyperactivity may be responsible for maintaining a depressed mood state in patients with TRD.</s><s>Consequently, treatment response to sgACC-area DBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mayberg et al., 2005)</ref> or pharmacotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Mayberg et al., 2000)</ref> is reflected by a decrease of local metabolic hyperactivity in the sgACC area in TRD.</s><s>However, according to a large meta-analysis of imaging studies on brain representations of discrete emotions, activation of the sgACC area is not confined to negative emotions but has also been shown during induced happiness or passive emotion tasks (specifically BA24) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Vytal and Hamann, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In line with previous imaging studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Phan et al., 2002)</ref>, stimuli of negative valence induced the most robust response in our patients, i.e. the strongest and most sustained decrease of beta band activity (BBA).</s></p><p><s>To date, most knowledge of BBA has been gathered from studies on sensorimotor and-to a lesser degree-on cognitive or emotional processing.</s><s>In scalp EEG studies, Pfurtscheller and colleagues found a decrease of BBA (termed event-related desynchronization, ERD) over cortical motor areas during finger movements, followed by an increase of BBA (i.e.</s><s>event-related synchronization, ERS) upon movement offset <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pfurtscheller and Lopes da Silva, 1999)</ref>, suggesting that the ERD reflects an activated cortical area <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Neuper et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Engel and Fries (2010)</ref> have proposed a more general hypothesis that sustained BBA in motor and frontal areas relates to the maintenance of the current state (i.e. the current cognitive or motor set or 'status quo'), whereas changes of the current state, such as perception of externally delivered salient stimuli, induce a decrease of BBA and a concomitant local increase in gamma power is often found.</s><s>Accordingly, beta oscillations play an important role in facilitating multimodal interaction between distant cortical areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Senkowski et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Varela et al., 2001)</ref>, thus enabling stimulus integration and response preparation.</s><s>A recent study illustrated this integrative aspect of beta oscillations during multimodal processing, combining visual stimuli of emotional and neutral faces with painful tactile stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Senkowski et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>They found a more pronounced suppression of BBA in the sensorimotor cortex for painful stimuli, which were accompanied by emotional faces compared to neutral faces or compared to painful stimuli alone.</s><s>In their seminal  review on cortical oscillation patterns, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Donner and Siegel (2011)</ref> corroborate this integrative aspect of beta oscillations.</s></p><p><s>Our findings of a decreased BBA in response to emotional stimuli are compatible with the interpretation of an activated cortical area, or more generally representing a multimodal integrative process related to later stages of emotional processing.</s><s>After appraisal of an emotional stimulus, which occurs in an earlier time window during the first hundreds of microseconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kawasaki et al., 2001)</ref>, later processing includes the generation of affective states, somato-motor responses and conscious emotional feelings (cf.</s><s>review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Phillips et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Based on patterns of connectivity and imaging studies, Bush and colleagues described an affective-cognitive gradient along the ventro-dorsal axis of the ACC (2000).</s><s>The sgACC area, which is part of the affective ACC division, belongs to a network with numerous connections to subcortical and cortical regions essential for emotional processing such as the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus and the orbitofrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Johansen-Berg et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Among other functions mentioned above, the sgACC area is activated during detection of salient internal or external emotional triggers, as well as during generation and regulation of affective states <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Devinsky et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bush et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Seeley et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The former may be mediated by a decrease of BBA, as shown in our study, representing conscious stimulus elaboration and the generation of emotional feelings.</s></p><p><s>The possible relationship between modulation of BBA in the sgACC area and stimulus evaluation is further illustrated by the significant correlation between stimulus valence and BBA.</s><s>The time window of the relatively late (750-2500 ms) and sustained BBA modulation in our study is similar to the time window reported in previous M/EEG studies on emotional processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kemp et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Popov et al., 2012)</ref>, and has been hypothesized as expression of ongoing conscious elaboration and semantic integration, possibly by triggering recall of stimulus congruent content of semantic memory.</s><s>The higher sensitivity of the sgACC for negative stimuli may also be interpreted as a correlate of a negativity bias, which is discussed as a diseaseinherent feature in patients with MDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gotlib et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>From the same point of view, one could argue that the reduced modulation in response to pleasant stimuli reflects a deficit of processing positive information.</s><s>This may resemble the clinical symptom of anhedonia, which is a common feature in depressed patients.</s><s>However, we did not find a correlation with disease severity (as measured by the BDI and HAMD) and modulation of BBA.</s><s>Instead, we found support that BBA may index the degree of emotional valence of stimuli.</s><s>The larger BBA with unpleasant stimuli is in line with recent observations from multi-unit activity recordings in the sgACC area in patients with TRD <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Laxton et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We speculate that the sgACC area is involved in conscious stimulus elaboration rather than in direct orchestration of a visceromotor arousal reaction, in which case we would have expected an early neuronal response that correlates with stimulus arousal (as shown for gamma synchronization in the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease patients; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huebl et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, in a different cohort of TRD subjects who underwent DBS of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)-an output nucleus of the extended amygdala-this very correlation between gamma band activity and stimulus arousal has been found <ref type="bibr">(Neumann et al., unpublished data)</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, in patients with intractable epilepsy intracranial recordings of oscillatory activity in the amygdala revealed the strongest gamma band activity for stimuli with negative valence and high arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Oya et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>It is noteworthy that in our study, the only significant gamma ERS also occurred after presentation of unpleasant stimuli.</s></p><p><s>In our previous studies on emotional processing using intracranial recordings in PD patients, we found modulations of alpha band activity during emotional processing whereas no valence-specific changes occurred in the beta band <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ku ¨hn et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huebl et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The different origin (subthalamic nucleus in PD; sgACC area in TRD) of the recorded activity may explain the observed differences in frequency band power changes between these studies.</s><s>Importantly, excessively increased BBA is a pathophysiological hallmark of PD, which may preclude or substantially limit physiological modulation of BBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jenkinson and Brown, 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We are aware of several limitations of our study.</s><s>First, our study was performed in patients with severe and treatment resistant types of MDD in whom all prior therapies have failed.</s><s>Therefore, the results can only be interpreted with caution with respect to physiological sgACC function.</s><s>Nonetheless, the response pattern with predominant reactivity upon unpleasant stimuli fits well with the existing literature of emotional processing in patients with TRD.</s><s>Second, emotionally evocative stimuli capture more attention than neutral stimuli.</s><s>Therefore, we cannot distinguish whether the differences in the magnitude and direction of BBA modulations are due to emotional stimulus elaboration or are a mere byproduct of increased allocation of attention.</s><s>However, previous studies that examined parameters of attention implicated gamma-band activity (GBA) in an earlier time window as a correlate for attentional demands (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jensen et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Third, patients were on different types of anti-depressive, neuroleptic and/or sedative medication, which may potentially bias the results.</s><s>However, we did not find any significant interaction between spectral power changes and type of medication when we included medication as a factor in the rmANOVAs.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our data extends current knowledge on the functional role of the sgACC area in patients with TRD through direct recordings of neuronal activity.</s><s>Our findings suggest that beta oscillations may index the conscious processing of emotional stimuli, which was most pronounced for unpleasant stimuli in TRD.</s><s>DBS of the sgACC area may influence stimulus perception by interfering with emotion-induced beta band activity.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.
