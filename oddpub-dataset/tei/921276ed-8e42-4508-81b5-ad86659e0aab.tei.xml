<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background.</s><s>Gliomas with mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) produce high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) that can be quantitatively measured by 3D magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI).</s><s>Current glioma MRI primarily relies upon fluidattenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity for treatment planning, although this lacks specificity for tumor cells.</s><s>Here, we investigated the relationship between 2HG and FLAIR in mutant IDH glioma patients to determine whether 2HG mapping is valuable for radiotherapy planning.</s></p><p><s>Methods.</s><s>Seventeen patients with mutant IDH1 gliomas were imaged by 3 T MRI.</s><s>A 3D MRSI sequence was employed to specifically image 2HG.</s><s>FLAIR imaging was performed using standard clinical protocol.</s><s>Regions of interest (ROIs) were determined for FLAIR and optimally thresholded 2HG hyperintensities.</s><s>The overlap, displacement, and volumes of 2HG and FLAIR ROIs were calculated.</s></p><p><s>Results.</s><s>In 8 of 17 (47%) patients, the 2HG volume was larger than FLAIR volume.</s><s>Across the entire cohort, the mean volume of 2HG was 35.3 cc (range, 5.3 -92.7 cc), while the mean volume of FLAIR was 35.8 cc (range, 6.3 -140.8 cc).</s><s>FLAIR and 2HG ROIs had mean overlap of 0.28 (Dice coefficients range, 0.03 -0.57) and mean displacement of 12.2 mm (range, 3.2-23.5</s><s>mm) between their centers of mass.</s></p></div>

mutations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>The excess 2HG accumulated in vivo is thought to contribute to the formation and malignant progression of gliomas through epigenetic modifications of chromatin. <ref type="bibr">6 -10</ref></s><s>imultaneous with excess 2HG accumulation there is concomitant depletion of NADPH, which plays an important role in replenishing glutathione to maintain the redox balance in these cancer cells.</s><s>Because IDH enzymes are the primary source of NADPH in the brain, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> mutation of IDH may significantly impair the overall ability of tumor cells to neutralize free radicals.</s><s>As a consequence, it has been proposed that reactive oxygen species generated during radiotherapy could have a more deleterious effect on mutant IDH cells than on wild-type cells.</s><s>Indeed, it has been shown in cell cultures that glioma cells transfected with mutant IDH alleles are more sensitive to radiation compared with their wild-type counterparts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref></s><s>Consistent with this proposal, analysis of anatomical MRI in glioblastoma patients has also shown that changes in postradiation 3D volumes of contrast-enhanced T1 and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) correlate with IDH mutation status, supporting increased radiosensitivity of mutant IDH glioblastoma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref></s><s>ptimizing radiation therapy planning is particularly important in the case of mutant IDH glioma patients and has been the main motivation in our current investigations.</s><s>IDH glioma patients have prolonged overall survival (3 -5 times longer) compared with wild-type patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> hence reducing adverse effects of radiation or neurotoxicity and improving quality of life in these patients is highly relevant. <ref type="bibr">14 -16</ref></s><s>On the other hand, increased radiosensitivity of mutant IDH tumor cells underscores the importance of techniques to better target radiation dosing both spatially and temporally in this group of patients, to optimize the clinical benefit of treatment.</s><s>MRI T2-weighted (T2w) FLAIR hyperintensity has traditionally proven to be a neuroimaging method of primary importance for glioma target definition in surgical <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and radiotherapy planning and assessment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s>In particular, this has been the case for mutant IDH gliomas which are typically nonenhancing tumors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s>Of course, there are several important nuances that play a role in target definition for gliomas.</s><s>First and foremost is the recognition that gliomas are infiltrative cancers, with tumor cells that extend well beyond the radiographic margin of disease, however defined or thresholded.</s><s>Thus, radiation treatment plans are routinely extended beyond a delineated lesional volume by a defined margin.</s><s>This therapeutic margin extension must be balanced against the normal brain irradiation and late toxicity risk in these more sparsely tumor-infiltrated areas.</s><s>Furthermore, quantification of FLAIR hyperintensity can be problematic because the relation between edema probed by FLAIR and the density of cancer cells is ambiguous and can vary between individual cases.</s><s>This variability limits the specificity of FLAIR to identify true tumor extent and to optimally guide treatment planning. <ref type="bibr">19 -21</ref></s><s>s an opportunity to improve this situation, 2HG overproduction is highly specific to IDH mutation and therefore represents an ideal biomarker that can be imaged and quantified to assess tumor burden and monitor treatment response. <ref type="bibr">22 -27</ref></s><s>The level of 2HG in the tumor correlates with the number of tumor cells producing 2HG, hence we hypothesized that 2HG imaging holds the potential to be more specific and quantitative than FLAIR for radiotherapy planning of mutant IDH glioma patients.</s><s>The utility of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) for tumor target definition has been previously demonstrated for gliomas using common brain metabolites such as N-acetylaspartate, choline, and lactate. <ref type="bibr">28 -30</ref></s><s>In the work described here, we extend this concept to the special case of 2HG.</s></p><p><s>A new 3D MRSI sequence has been recently developed to image 2HG signal in the brain to detect oncogenic IDH1 mutations and monitor treatment response. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s>In this work, we investigated the potential value of 2HG imaging for tumor definition, compared with traditional FLAIR imaging.</s><s>We analyzed the relationship between spatial extent and intensity landscape of 2HG and FLAIR images in a group of mutant IDH glioma patients.</s><s>We describe a normalization technique for 2HG signal relative to the level of creatine in the healthy-appearing white matter of the contralateral hemisphere.</s><s>Using histogram analysis, we derived a reproducible and optimal threshold for the ratio of 2HG over healthy creatine (2HG/hCr) that can be used to segment tumor region of interest (ROI).</s><s>We quantified the agreement between ROIs obtained from 2HG and FLAIR images using 3 metrics: ROI volumes, ROI overlap, and ROI displacement.</s><s>Strikingly, we found that in a substantial number of patients, the 2HG volume is larger than FLAIR volume, with only a partial overlap and an asymmetric displacement between centers of mass of 2HG and FLAIR ROIs.</s><s>These results suggest that 2HG imaging can have a role in refining the definition of tumor extent with potential implications for radiotherapy planning and for subsequent treatment monitoring.</s></p></div>

mass of the 2HG/hCr and FLAIR ROIs.</s><s>In general the regional agreement of 2 ROIs is dominated by the size of the 2HG/hCr ROI.</s><s>Thus, higher Dice coefficients and lower intercenter distances were found for patients that had the volume of 2HG/hCr larger than the volume of FLAIR.</s><s>The mean Dice coefficient for patients who had 2HG/hCr volume larger than FLAIR volume was 0.34 versus 0.24 (P ¼ .09)</s><s>for the opposite patients, while the intercenter distances were 10.8 mm versus 13.3 mm (P ¼ .3),</s><s>respectively, for the same 2 groups of patients.</s><s>There was more variation (58%) for Dice coefficients when FLAIR volume was larger than 2HG/hCr volume versus variation (37%) for the opposite scenario.</s><s>In addition, we investigated the potential relation between SNR of 2HG, tumor grade, tumor volume, and mismatch of 2HG and FLAIR volumes.</s><s>Results presented in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> indicate a trend for correlation between SNR and tumor volume (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>) or tumor grade (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</s><s>A trend for increased Dice coefficients for higher-grade tumors is also shown by our data (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C</ref>); however, no correlation reached statistical significance.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> illustrates the type of additional information that may be available from 2HG/hCr volumetric assessment, using 2 opposing scenarios from one patient treated with proton beam therapy (upper row) and another patient treated with photon radiation therapy (lower row), respectively.</s><s>In the   Jafari-Khouzani et al.: 2HG-FLAIR relation in mutant IDH glioma patients case of the proton beam therapy patient with a grade II glioma, it can be seen that high 2HG/hCr is limited to only 1 of the 2 FLAIR hyperintense areas, while high radiation dose covers the entire FLAIR ROI, including areas of low 2HG/hCr.</s><s>On the other hand, in the case of the patient treated with photon radiation therapy who had a large glioblastoma tumor, it can be seen that areas of high 2HG/hCr extend superiorly in the coronal/sagittal views into regions of low radiation dose (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, lower row).</s><s>Note that 2HG/hCr levels are comparable between the low-grade (patient 13) and high-grade (patient 15) glioma patients.</s><s>Although this seems to contradict the trend and expectation that 2HG levels may be larger in higher-grade tumors due to increased cell density, in this case the similar results are explained by the fact that noncanonical mutations such as IDH1-R132G in patient 13 are more efficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> in producing 2HG compared with canonical IDH1-R132H mutations in patient 15, hence compensating for cell density.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>A mainstay of treatment for gliomas is radiation therapy, which in the modern era is administered using carefully modulated techniques to optimize target coverage and minimize normal brain exposure.</s><s>However, target definition is a challenge for radiation planning and there are known limitations to the specificity of anatomical MRI such as FLAIR for characterizing the extent of these infiltrative tumors.</s><s>Hence molecular imaging methods are needed to more specifically evaluate gliomas for improved tumor definition and to facilitate better treatment planning and monitoring.</s><s>To investigate this potential, we compared 2HG and FLAIR imaging and evaluated their regional and global agreement in mutant IDH glioma patients.</s></p><p><s>In the case of mutant IDH gliomas, a potential imaging biomarker is the 2HG/hCr ratio, for which we determined an optimal normalization and thresholding.</s><s>The normalized 2HG values to the mean value of healthy creatine (2HG/hCr) may be used to distinguish mutant versus nonmutant IDH brain tissue intrasubject and segment mutant IDH tumor volume.</s><s>Using the normalized 2HG images, we obtained the cutoff value of 0.13 for 2HG/hCr above which the tumor classification error was minimized compared with healthy tissues.</s><s>Assuming a total creatine (creatine + phosphocreatine) level of 5-10 mM in the healthy brain, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> the 0.13 threshold for the 2HG/hCr ratio corresponds to a minimum 2HG level that is in good agreement with the minimum concentration detectable by in vivo MRSI.</s><s>The 0.13 threshold corresponded to a z-score of 1.34 for 2HG/ hCr tumor volume mapping.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, we observed that 2HG/hCr and FLAIR do not completely agree on the spatial distribution and characteristics of the tumor.</s><s>In general, there was more agreement in the global measures such as mean tumor volumes.</s><s>There was more disagreement in the regional measures of tumors, suggesting that there are substantial opportunities for improvement in target definition.</s><s>This disagreement was evident from the relatively small values of Dice coefficients and comparatively large values of distance between the centers of masses of the 2 ROIs.</s><s>There was a trend for more disagreement when FLAIR volume was larger than 2HG/hCr volume, which may be explained by the fact that FLAIR probes a mixture of tumor and peritumoral edema.</s><s>There was also a trend for higher SNR of 2HG for larger and higher-grade tumors, with a trend for more overlap between 2HG/hCr and FLAIR volumes for higher-grade tumors.</s><s>Although not statistically significant, these trends suggest increased 2HG production throughout the entire FLAIR volume for higher-grade tumors.</s><s>Visual analysis revealed also that the level of 2HG/hCr was not uniform within the FLAIR ROI, often with a high-intensity area in an eccentric position and extending beyond the FLAIR margin.</s><s>Similar results have been recently reported for choline hyperintensity extending outside FLAIR volume in an MRSI study on glioblastoma patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s>hese findings have significant implications and may be relevant for treatment planning by radiotherapy as well as for treatment monitoring.</s><s>Conventionally, radiation therapy is planned with substantial reliance on FLAIR images.</s><s>Areas of hyperintensity are outlined in the FLAIR images and radiation plans are designed in such a way that the FLAIR ROI and an isotropic expansion margin around it receive uniform and high levels of radiation.</s><s>The use of FLAIR images for radiation planning may not be ideal because the intensity of FLAIR images may not correspond to the concentration of cancer cells.</s><s>On the other hand, recent results have been reported showing that 2HG levels detected by single-voxel MRS correlate with tumor cell density determined by histopathology on biopsies. <ref type="bibr">43</ref></s><s>To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the relation between 2HG levels in our multivoxel MRSI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a surrogate imaging biomarker for cell density (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>We found an inverse correlation between 2HG levels and ADC values, with tumor areas that have low ADC (hence higher cell density) showing larger 2HG levels.</s><s>With nonuniform levels of cancer cells within a tumor, uniform irradiation may not be an optimal approach.</s><s>On the other hand, multiple-region biopsy sampling of the brain tissues in order to specify the concentration of tumor cells within and around the tumor is not practical for brain tumors.</s><s>Thus, other imaging biomarkers are needed for radiation therapy planning.</s></p><p><s>In particular, on closer inspection it appears that for some patients (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), molecular imaging by 2HG/hCr may be valuable in refining radiotherapy planning.</s><s>Assuming the 2HG/hCr map represents the most metabolically active component of the tumor, these cases suggest that the radiation therapy target may be suboptimally defined by FLAIR alone and could be improved by incorporating the 2HG/hCr map.</s><s>Hence, the 2HG/ hCr maps have the potential to guide modulation of the radiation dose according to the underlying molecular biology of the tumor, in addition to anatomical imaging sequences.</s><s>Conversely, there is clearly a threshold effect with 2HG/hCr identifying areas of higher tumor cell density, and the optimal contribution of each sequence for tumor target delineation remains to be determined.</s></p><p><s>Mutant IDH glioma are nonetheless an important test case for the convergence of radiation genomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> and imaging genomics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref></s><s>Integrating 2HG/hCr and FLAIR maps into radiation therapy has 2 potential benefits: (i) radiation dose can be increased to regions of greater tumor cell density as determined by areas of high 2HG/hCr, and (ii) regions of FLAIR hyperintensity having low 2HG/hCr signal may be spared high-dose radiation and thereby reduce the potential adverse effects of radiation therapy.</s><s>The increased radiosensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> and particular imaging phenotype 3 of mutant IDH glioma might also suggest different radiation strategies <ref type="bibr">46 -48</ref> compared with wildtype patients.</s></p><p><s>Despite the potential advantages, there are several important practical limitations for 2HG imaging that are related to MRSI data acquisition, such as brain coverage, data quality, spatial resolution, and sensitivity.</s><s>MRSI protocols often use limited brain coverage to avoid large artifacts from subcutaneous and bone marrow lipids of the head.</s><s>Current 2HG imaging protocols using this type of acquisition may not cover the entire tumor, especially if the tumor is peripheral in the brain.</s><s>The quality of MRSI data is not homogeneous across the brain, in particular spectral resolution and SNR are reduced in regions with inhomogeneous B 0 magnetic field from air -tissue interfaces around sinuses, bullae, and ear canals.</s><s>Because of the generally lower concentration of metabolites, the spatial resolution in MRSI is lower compared with anatomical MRI, and typically the minimum concentration of metabolites that can be detected by in vivo MRSI in humans is around 1 mM.</s><s>Thus, patients who have tumors with unfavorable location, small size, lower tumor cell density, and less efficient 2HG production may not be adequately imaged with 2HG MRSI.</s><s>However, technical improvements are possible for data quality and spatial resolution to expand the usage of 2HG imaging into these patients.</s><s>One other limitation today is that our real-time 3D MRSI methodology for 2HG editing was implemented and operational only on Siemens scanners, though porting it to other platforms is certainly possible.</s><s>Thus, at the moment, 2HG imaging clearly cannot replace anatomical imaging such as FLAIR for radiotherapy planning, but it may provide valuable further information that could guide spatiotemporal modulation of the radiation dose.</s><s>Further investigation is required to determine how treatment planning can be optimally modified having the 2HG/hCr maps.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we demonstrated that a 2HG/hCr map provides molecular assessment of mutant IDH tumors, which is complementary to FLAIR, and may provide significant additional utility for tumor definition in treatment planning and subsequent monitoring.</s><s>We anticipate that this approach may have a significant impact on the management and outcome of mutant IDH glioma patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1
