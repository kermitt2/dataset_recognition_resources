<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of SVD</head><p><s>The presence of SVD such as CMBs, leukoaraiosis, silent infarction was determined using the baseline MRI.</s><s>All MRI examinations were performed using a 3.0T MRI system (Achieva 3.0T, Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands or MAGNETOM 3.0T, Trio A Tim System, Siemens, Germany).</s><s>Brain MRI images were obtained parallel to the orbitomeatal line using the following parameters: TR/TE 9000/120 ms, pixel spacing 0.449 mm/0.449</s><s>mm, FOV 230×230 mm, and slice thickness 5 mm for fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR); TR/TE 9000/ 100 ms, pixel spacing 0.240 mm/0.240</s><s>mm, FOV 230×230 mm, and slice thickness 5 mm for T2 weighted images (T2); and TR/TE 600/16 ms, pixel spacing 0.449 mm/0.449</s><s>mm, FOV 250×250 mm, and slice thickness 5 mm for gradient recalled echo (GRE) imaging.</s></p><p><s>CMBs were defined as punctuate hypointense lesions &lt;10 mm in size and located in lobar (cortex, subcortex, and white matter), deep (basal ganglia and thalamus), or infratentorial (brain stem and cerebellum) regions on GRE MRI images, based on previously reported methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Hypointense lesions on GRE MRI images located in cerebral vessels, calcifications, airbone interfaces, and partial volume artifacts at the edges of the cerebellum were excluded.</s></p><p><s>Small hypointense lesions on GRE MRI images &lt;3 mm in size were also excluded because these lesions could be dilated perivascular spaces, demyelination areas, or gliosis.</s></p><p><s>We also determined the severity of leukoaraiosis and silent infarction in our study sample.</s><s>The extent of leukoaraiosis was investigated on FLAIR images of periventricular white matter or deep white matter according to the Fazekas scoring system <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Leukoaraiosis in periventricular white matter was categorized as: grade 0, absent; grade 1, caps or pencil-thin lining; grade 2, smooth halo; or grade 3, irregular periventricular hemorrhage extending into deep white matter.</s><s>Leukoaraiosis in deep white matter was categorized as: grade 0, absent; grade 1, punctuate foci; grade 2, beginning confluence of foci; or grade 3, large confluent areas.</s><s>Silent infarctions were defined as high signal intensity on FLAIR or T2-weighted images and iso-or low signal intensity on T1-weighted images in participants without previous clinical stroke, based on a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Lesions with &lt;3 mm diameter were not considered as silent infarctions because of the risk of misdiagnosis with dilatation of the perivascular space, demyelination, or gliosis.</s></p><p><s>The presence of CMBs, leukoaraiosis, and silent infarctions on MRI images was investigated by two neurologists (Y.D.K. and D.S.) blind to participant clinical information.</s><s>Final classifications were made by consensus between the two neurologists.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We found that the prevalence of mild and significant liver fibrosis was 15.0% and 4.0%, respectively, and that greater liver fibrosis, as reflected by higher LS values, was independently associated with the presence and burden of CMBs in healthy, asymptomatic individuals undergoing a comprehensive medical health check-up.</s><s>Leukoaraiosis or silent infarctions, which are  ischemic types of cerebral SVD, were not associated with the degree of liver fibrosis.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing a positive association between the degree of liver fibrosis and the burden of CMBs.</s></p><p><s>Although the exact mechanism is unclear, one possible explanation for the relationship between liver fibrosis and CMBs is that liver and brain may share common risk factors.</s><s>Indeed, because cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndromes are the major driving forces for liver fibrosis and cerebral SVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>, liver fibrosis and cerebral SVD can exist simultaneously.</s><s>However, we found that the association between CMBs and fibrotic burden was maintained even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.</s><s>Furthermore, previous studies show that chronic liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases with a potential to progress to liver cirrhosis are independently associated with arterial stiffness, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in other organs which are also related to the development of CMBs <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>These findings indicate that liver fibrosis may be a significant risk factor for the development of CMBs and that a direct link may exist between the liver and the brain.</s></p><p><s>In our study, leukoaraiosis and silent infarctions were not associated with the degree of liver fibrosis.</s><s>However, previous studies suggest a close relationship between liver dysfunction and leukoaraiosis.</s><s>For example, liver transplantation can reduce white matter lesion volume and lessen cognitive impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>.</s><s>However, white matter lesions associated with liver cirrhosis are more widespread in later stages of the illness and might be caused by edematous changes rather than arteriosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our results suggest that the subclinical stage of liver fibrosis has no impact on ischemic types of cerebral SVD.</s><s>However, because the sample size of our study was relatively small, future large-scale studies are required to resolve this issue.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in terms of the location of CMBs, the degree of liver fibrosis was associated with the burden of not only non-lobar CMBs but also lobar CMBs, which may be a marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.</s><s>Liver cirrhosis may be a risk factor for ICH due to coagulation abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, and low serum cholesterol, but these abnormalities are not sufficient for fully explaining the development of ICH in liver dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Although there are no reports showing the association between the location of CMBs and liver dysfunction, previous reports show that the incidence of lobar ICH is more common than subcortical region in patients with liver cirrhosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</s><s>However, further studies are required to determine the association between the degree of liver fibrosis and lobar CMBs.</s></p><p><s>Together with the degree of liver fibrosis, statin use remained an independent predictor of CMBs within our study sample.</s><s>Previous studies show that statin use may increase the risk of ICH <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Considering that CMBs are a prerequisite for ICH, the relationship between statin use and ICH suggests that statin use may be associated with CMBs before clinical ICH occurs.</s></p><p><s>Several issues in the present study remain unresolved.</s><s>Although we consecutively enrolled participants, our study was a retrospective analysis and therefore may involve selection bias.</s><s>Also, because most participants included in our study were healthy, asymptomatic individuals, thus resulting in a low rate of detection of high grade types of SVD such as leukoaraiosis, our results should be interpreted cautiously.</s><s>However, using this study sample, we were able to investigate early connections between brain and liver pathology during the preclinical stage.</s><s>Furthermore, although TE is an accurate tool for assessing the degree of liver fibrosis, histological information was not available in this study.</s><s>Because all participants in our study were asymptomatic, it was not feasible to perform liver biopsy.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we demonstrated that harder livers are associated with a higher burden of CMBs.</s><s>Understanding the link between the brain and the liver may advance research on the pathomechanism of CMBs and help establish optimal screening and treatment strategies.</s></p><p><s>Supporting Information S1 File.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">A</ref>.
