<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This systematic review was conducted following a pre-defined protocol, which was informed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search strategy</head><p><s>The academic literature was systematically searched using a comprehensive search strategy to identify all RCTs in pediatric oncology (Additional file 1: Appendix A).</s><s>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group Specialized Register through CENTRAL from inception to July 2016.</s><s>Our search strategy was developed by initially using the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health search filter to identify RCTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and subsequently adapted to identify RCTs in pediatric oncology using the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Search Filter, which has been validated by Leclercq et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>We also assessed the reference lists of the studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria to identify additional studies.</s><s>Our search was restricted to studies in English and was inclusive of the published literature.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility criteria</head><p><s>Studies were deemed eligible if the study adhered to a RCT study design (i.e., did not included a non-randomized component or a historical control), where the study population consisted of pediatric patients diagnosed with cancer and the primary outcome of the trial was a relevant cancer treatment outcome (e.g., a treatment regimen assessing overall survival, event-free survival, etc.), and the trial was a phase III trial that did not stop early due to futility.</s><s>This did not include studies wherein the primary outcome was treatment complications or side effects, pharmacokinetic trials, toxicity trials, non-clinical interventions, or drug safety profile trials.</s><s>Only studies that reported a sample size calculation where a delta value was reported or could be calculated for the randomized question were included.</s><s>Trials that were long-term follow-up studies were excluded and only studies that reported the most recent trial results were reported.</s><s>Only phase III trials that were not stopped early due to futility were eligible for inclusion.</s><s>RCTs where the study population consisted of both pediatric and adult patients were deemed eligible if adults were less than or equal to 25 years of age.</s><s>We chose this age range to reflect norms in pediatric oncology treatment research wherein trials most often include participants up to 21 years of age, though many have also included participants up to age 25 years because of the potential benefit for these slightly older patients.</s><s>Restricting the age limit to 21 years would result in the exclusion of a number of trials where the majority of participants were aged less than 21 years.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study identification</head><p><s>Two investigators (HH and KN, non-independently) screened the title and abstracts based on the specified inclusion criteria.</s><s>The full text was retrieved and reviewed if the title and abstract was insufficient to determine fulfillment of inclusion criteria.</s><s>Subsequently, one investigator (HH) conducted a full-text review to assess all of the studies that passed through the first round of title and abstract for inclusion eligibility.</s><s>The principal investigator (AFH) was available to resolve any discrepancies or disagreements encountered during study selection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data extraction</head><p><s>A standardized data extraction template was developed to collect attributes relevant to clinical and statistical significance in addition to general characteristics.</s><s>The data extraction template was initially piloted on a sample of 15 included studies to ensure that pertinent information was captured and subsequently finalized based on the results of the pilot.</s><s>Data was collected by one investigator (HH) based on each of the randomized questions within all RCTs, thereby capturing each outcome and the corresponding reported sample size calculation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of included studies</head><p><s>The characteristics of the studies included in our systematic review included: journal, region, and year of publication; source of funding; whether the RCT included exclusively children or adults and children; the disease site of focus of the RCT (hematological, central nervous system, non-central nervous system solid tumor); RCT study design (2 × 2 factorial, greater than two arms; parallel-group); trial group; primary outcome defined as time-to-event or dichotomous; primary outcome intervention (chemotherapy, multimodal therapy, hematopoietic stem-cell transplant, radiation therapy).</s><s>This analysis was based on studies and stratified by RCT type (non-inferiority or superiority).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reporting of methodological attributes associated with clinical significance</head><p><s>The selection of methodological attributes related to clinical significance were informed by evidence from the literature and the expertise of the research team <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>These attributes consisted of: explicitly identifying the expected magnitude of difference as the MCID and providing justification for why this MCID was selected, whether it be based on clinical relevance or methodological; reporting the delta value as an absolute and/or relative difference stratified by primary outcome type (time-to-event or dichotomous); reporting anticipated control and experimental values for which the delta value was derived from and providing the rationale for why the assumed control value was selected; type 1 error (α value) and number of sides of p value; power (1 − β value); reporting statistical significance of the primary outcome via a p value; reporting a confidence interval (CI) or standard error around the experimental and control estimates for the primary outcome; reporting treatment effect (i.e., experimental valuecontrol value); reporting, within the discussion, an assessment of the clinical importance of the results of the primary outcome through an interpretation of the results based on the delta value specified in the sample size calculation.</s><s>As methodological attributes are relevant to the primary outcome, this analysis was restricted to randomized questions stratified by RCT type (non-inferiority or superiority).</s><s>Therefore, studies that involved multiple primary outcomes (e.g., 2 × 2 factorial trials, etc.), would have more than one randomized question.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical significance</head><p><s>Clinical significance was determined based on the guidelines proposed by Man-Son-Hing et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> which considers the relationship between the MCID of the treatment effect and the CI and designated to one of the following four different levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): (1) Definitethe MCID is smaller than the lower limit of the CI of the treatment effect, (2) Probablethe MCID is greater than the lower limit of the CI of the treatment effect, but smaller than the treatment effect, (3) Possiblethe MCID is less than the upper limit of the CI of the treatment effect, but greater than the treatment effect, and (4) Definitely Notthe MCID is greater than the upper limit of the CI of the treatment effect.</s><s>The CI should be based on the α value specified in the sample size calculation.</s></p><p><s>We restricted this analysis to randomized questions in superiority trials because these guidelines are intended to be applied to superiority trials.</s><s>For each study, the delta value was assumed to be the MCID irrespective of whether explicitly stated by the authors.</s><s>This assumption was applied in an earlier study by Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and is a pragmatic approach in the context of pediatric oncology.</s><s>This is based on the premise that the delta value must be reflective of the MCID to the extent that it will result in strong evidence to change standard of care, while also feasible to achieve in a rare disease population.</s><s>A traditional approach to surveying clinicians and patients to determine a MCID is not realistic in the scope of rare diseases and thus the delta value must follow a definition, which is pragmatic yet clinically relevant and evidence-based.</s><s>This analysis was restricted to randomized questions to account for studies with multiple primary outcomes.</s><s>Additionally, only randomized questions were included where the treatment effect and its CI were reported or could be calculated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The CI of the treatment effect for each randomized question was determined with the methodology outlined by Hackshaw <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and Altman and Anderson <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for dichotomous and time-to-event primary outcomes respectively when the CI of the treatment effect was not reported.</s><s>The CI of the treatment effect for time-to-event outcomes could be calculated only if the CI associated with the experimental and control estimates were reported or a Kaplan-Meier curve with patients at risk was reported.</s><s>The time point specified in the sample size calculation was used and if it could not be inferred from a Kaplan-Meier curve, or was not reported, the time point reported was used.</s><s>If the aforementioned was not provided, the CI for the treatment effect could not be calculated and the randomized question was excluded from this analysis.</s><s>The treatment effect CI was calculated based on the design α value if reported in the sample size calculation and if not reported an alpha of 0.05 was assumed.</s><s>In the event the primary outcome of the sample size calculation included both an absolute and relative difference, the absolute difference was used.</s><s>The level of concordance between statistical and clinical significance was assessed through descriptive statistics.</s><s>Descriptive statistics were calculated to assess the reporting of methodological attributes associated with clinical significance.</s><s>SAS (Statistical Analysis Software) version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to perform all analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Our search identified 3750 unique studies from Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group Specialized Register accessed through CENTRAL.</s><s>Following title and abstract screening, 406 studies were evaluated for eligibility based on full-text review.</s><s>Of these studies, 329 studies were excluded and 77 studies were included in the systematic review (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) (Additional file 1: Appendix B).</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the characteristics of the included studies.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> summarizes the methodological attributes relevant to assessing clinical significance for all included studies by randomized questions stratified by RCT type (non-inferiority and superiority RCT, herein, respectively).</s><s>Only 4.2% (15.4 and 2.4%) of randomized questions explicitly identified that the delta value was based on the MCID, while 22.1% (76.9 and 13.4%) of randomized questions discussed the clinical importance in relation to the delta value specified in their sample size calculation.</s><s>The majority (95.6% overall; 100.0 and 95.1%) of randomized questions reported the delta value in the sample size calculation as an absolute value and the minority in relative terms (e.g., relative risk reduction, relative hazard rate, etc.).</s><s>Almost three quarters reported (76.8% overall; 76.9 and 76.8%) the estimate assumed for the control group, of which only 18.9% (46.2 and 14.6%) reported justification for why the estimate was assumed.</s><s>The statistical significance of the primary outcome was reported using a p value in 83.2% (100.0 and 80.5%) of randomized questions, while over half (67.4% overall; 92. 2 errors in their sample size calculations; however, only 12.6% (46.2 and 7.3%) reported the treatment effect in the results.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> summarize the level of clinical significance in superiority trials, determined when examining the relationship between the MCID of the treatment effect and its associated CIs, in relation to the reporting of statistically significant findings for superiority RCTs that satisfied the criteria.</s><s>Of the 71 randomized questions that reported statistically insignificant findings, 25.5% (n = 12) were found to have possible clinical significance.</s><s>Of the 24 randomized questions that reported statistically significant findings, 8.3% (n = 2) were found to have clinical significance categorized as "Definitely Not," 83.4% (n = 20) as "Probable or Possible," and 8.3% (n = 2) as "Definite."</s><s>Of the total 71 randomized questions, only 2.8% (n = 2) were found to have definite clinical importance while 45.1% (n = 32) were found to have "Probable or Possible" clinical significance and the remaining 52.1% (n = 37) were "Definitely Not" clinically significant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this systematic review, we demonstrated that only a minority of the 77 RCTs (11 non-inferiority and 66 superiority RCTs) in the published pediatric oncology treatment literature reported methodological attributes related to clinical significance.</s><s>A notable portion of RCTs reporting statistically insignificant results was found to have possible clinical significance and likewise for those reporting statistically significant results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and weaknesses</head><p><s>The strengths of this study stem from the inclusion of all pediatric oncology RCTs, from database inception to July 2016, that evaluated a range of cancer treatments for various cancer types.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess clinical significance in the rare  disease context of pediatric cancer RCTs.</s><s>A limitation is that the search was restricted to studies in English and was inclusive of the published literature, and was thus, prone to language and publication bias.</s><s>The assessment of clinical significance was based on the delta value in the published report and not the trial protocol and, therefore, it is possible that information recorded as not reported was reported in the trial protocol.</s><s>However, the parameters used in this review comprise of CONSORTmandated items and thus should be reported in the published report.</s><s>A limitation associated with assessing clinical significance as per Man-Son-Hing et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is that the weight for each level of clinical significance will vary depending on the research question.</s><s>However, the definitions applied to classify the level of clinical significance are arbitrary and not meant to be adhered to strictly.</s><s>For example, in the context of a disease with no available effective treatments, a treatment found to be statistically significant but that only shows possible clinical significance would likely warrant implementation in the clinical setting.</s><s>This is of particular relevance to pediatric cancer, where some cancer subtypes still have dismal survival and high relapse rates.</s><s>Conversely, demonstrating superiority to a well-established treatment would require adherence to a strict definition of clinical importance because changes to recommended treatment should not proceed unless definite clinical significance is demonstrated.</s><s>In interpreting the study findings, it is also important to note that only 13 of the 95 randomized questions were from non-inferiority trials, representing a small minority.</s><s>Thus, it is critical that the assessments of these non-inferiority trials in this research not be over-interpreted or generalized to the superiority trials.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with existing literature</head><p><s>Based on our analysis, the majority (77.9%) of randomized questions did not describe the clinical importance of their findings in relation to the delta value of the interventions in question.</s><s>The minority (4.2%) of randomized questions explicitly identified the delta value as the MCID with justification.</s><s>These findings are in line with the limited number of previous studies investigating clinical significance reporting, wherein under-reporting was found <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>Chan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> found that, among a random sample of 27 RCTs in major medical journals, 20 articles included sample size calculations, 90% of which reported a delta value but only 11% stated that the delta value was chosen to reflect the MCID of the intervention.</s><s>Study results were interpreted from the perspective of clinical importance in 20 of 27 (74%) articles, with only one article discussing clinical importance in relation to a reported sample size MCID.</s><s>In a review of 57 dementia drug RCTs, Molnar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> found that 46% discussed the clinical significance of their results, and no studies used formally derived MCIDs.</s><s>These results are in line with our review findings.</s></p></div>
