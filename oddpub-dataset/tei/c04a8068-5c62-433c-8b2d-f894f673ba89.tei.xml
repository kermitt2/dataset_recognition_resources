with preadipocytes and monocytederived macrophages as well as a comparison of adipose and liver tissue showed that adipocytes are likely to be a major source of WISP1 released into the circulation.</s></p><p><s>WISP1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in a broad spectrum of neuronal, musculoskeletal, immunologic, and cancer diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Studies have shown that other CCN family members are closely linked to adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11)</ref>, but no data exist about the role of WISP1/CCN4 in obesity and associated diseases.</s><s>We found that WISP1 gene expression and WISP1 protein production is upregulated during human adipocyte differentiation.</s><s>Furthermore, we conducted a systematic investigation of WISP1 gene expression in human paired SAT and VAT samples from a cohort of healthy glucosetolerant subjects with varying degrees of body weight.</s><s>In contrast to another CCN family member, WISP2 (12), WISP1 was highly expressed in VAT and moderately expressed in SAT.</s><s>Of note, WISP1 expression correlated negatively with insulin sensitivity, circulating adiponectin levels, and visceral fat content as measured by MRI, suggesting that WISP1 may be a useful marker of visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance.</s><s>In support of this hypothesis, we observed only borderline association of WISP1 expression in SAT and VAT with BMI and waistto-hip ratio.</s><s>Moreover, we observed a positive correlation of WISP1 with macrophage infiltration in both SAT and VAT.</s><s>On the basis of a possible contribution of macrophages to the effects described for adipose tissue, we were unable to detect WISP1 expression in cultures of primary human monocytes and macrophages.</s></p><p><s>Cultured macrophages stimulated with WISP1 notably displayed a dose-dependent increase in proinflammatory cytokine production, whereas this was not the case in adipocytes.</s><s>Moreover, WISP1 modulated macrophage polarization toward the inflammatory M1 phenotype, as was evident from the induction of the expression of M1 markers CCR7 and COX2, whereas expression of antiinflammatory M2 markers was decreased.</s><s>Furthermore, WISP1 caused a dose-dependent increase in extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme mRNA expression, such as that measured for ADAMTS-4 and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, adipocyte-derived WISP1 might in this way participate in the control of macrophage function and migration in fat tissue.</s><s>Because WISP1 is associated with insulin sensitivity, it may be characterized as an adipokine that participates in the control of macrophage function.</s></p><p><s>We observed reduced WISP1 gene expression in SAT and decreased circulating WISP1 levels after weight reduction in female subjects, who had more body fat and higher WISP1 plasma levels before weight loss than male subjects.</s><s>Although human white adipose tissue displays a high adipocyte turnover, the total number of adipocytes in adults remains constant even after weight reduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(27)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the observed downregulation in SAT likely reflects a decreased expression of WISP1 in adipocytes but not a decreased adipocyte number.</s><s>Additionally, WISP1 expression in liver was moderate and not upregulated in the subjects with NAFLD in the present study, and we observed no association between various biochemical and anthropometrical markers of obesity and hepatic gene expression of WISP, suggesting that WISP1 is not involved in hepatic fat accumulation.</s><s>Thus, the weight loss-induced changes in circulating WISP1 most likely originated from adipose tissue rather than from the liver or other organs.</s><s>Another CCN family member, NOV, also is associated with obesity, and NOV levels in circulation are decreased after weight reduction due to bariatric surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(11)</ref>.</s><s>In line with the present data, circulating NOV levels are higher in women than in men <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the sex differences in the changes of WISP1 concentration after weight loss in the present study might reflect regulation of CCN peptide production by sex hormones (28) and needs further investigation.</s><s>The reduction in circulating CCN proteins after weight loss could reflect downregulation of the WNT signaling pathway in various tissues, such as adipose tissue and muscle.</s><s>WISP1 increase has been found in a variety of cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref>, and the novel variant of WISP1 is associated with invasion of cholangiocarcinomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Central obesity and the metabolic syndrome are independent risk factors for cancer (29).</s><s>The effects of circulating WISP1 on tissue regeneration and proliferation are not studied in vivo, but given the proliferative properties of WISP1, they may be a marker of malignancy risk in obesity, which deserves further investigation.</s></p><p><s>Insulin is an important regulator of adipocyte differentiation and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(30)</ref>, and the cross talk between insulin and the WNT signaling pathway occurs at multiple levels in murine preadipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(31)</ref>.</s><s>Antiapoptotic and proliferative effects of WISP1 are mediated through the PI3K/ Akt pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(14)</ref>, suggesting that WISP1 may affect insulin signaling.</s><s>We did not, however, observe such an impact of WISP1 in vitro, whereas we did find that insulin signaling increases WISP1 gene expression in human adipocytes.</s><s>This finding could not be easily translated to the in vivo situation because short exposition of patients/subjects to hyperinsulinemia during clamp experiments had no effect on WISP1 expression in SAT.</s><s>Several causes may explain the observed discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo experiments.</s><s>First, the systemic insulin concentration during clamp experiments does not reflect the local intratissue insulin concentration, which was possibly lower compared with the insulin concentration in cell experiments.</s><s>Second, insulin induces multiple metabolic changes in the body, which can influence WISP1 expression and/or production and minimize the direct effect of insulin on adipocytes.</s><s>Third, the subjects investigated were moderately insulin resistant and, thus, permanently exposed to elevated insulin levels during the clamps, whereas cell cultures were insulin deprived and then exposed to much higher doses of insulin.</s><s>Because the cell culture data demonstrate the ability of insulin to augment WISP1 expression, in vivo effects are probably affected by chronic exposure and are slower and depend less on dosage.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, the present data show that WISP1 is a novel adipokine that is substantially overexpressed in visceral fat from obese subjects and reflects insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation.</s><s>Weight changes regulate circulating WISP1 levels and WISP1 expression in adipose tissue.</s><s>Therefore, we propose that WISP1 is a novel link between obesity and inflammation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
