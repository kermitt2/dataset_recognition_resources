<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Theory of mind (ToM) is an aspect of social cognition that describes the ability to understand the feelings, thoughts and intentions of oneself and of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brüne 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The term was originally introduced in 1978 by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Premack and Woodruff (1978)</ref> in an article that discussed the ability of chimpanzees to infer mental states that are not directly observable (for example, intentions, knowledge or beliefs) and that can serve to predict the behavior of others.</s><s>The article sparked a wave of research on ToM that has been increasing ever since.</s><s>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schaafsma et al. (2015)</ref> point out, the original definition of ToM referred to a variety of processes which led to heterogeneity in the scientific methods approaching ToM.</s><s>Thus, as research on the topic is growing, attempts to clarify the construct are advancing.</s></p><p><s>In psychological terms, ToM has recently been described as dual-process schemes that distinguish either between mental state reasoning (social-cognitive processes) and mental state decoding (social-perceptual processes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Samamé et al. 2012)</ref> or between cognitive and affective ToM <ref type="bibr">(Shamay-Tsoory et al. 2007</ref>).</s><s>The identification of particular ToM processes is directly related to the interpretation of different tasks designed to measure ToM abilities.</s><s>Tasks that request subjects to understand the beliefs or false beliefs of other persons to detect hidden intentions, indirect meaning, or inappropriate social communication are assumed to account for cognitive ToM or mental state reasoning.</s><s>On the other hand, tasks that demand of subjects to infer the feelings or affective mental states of others are regarded as measures to assess affective ToM and also mental state decoding abilities if visual information such as facial expressions needs to be decoded.</s><s>These dual-process schemes are supported by evidence from imaging studies that have reported taskspecific differences in brain activation patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kalbe et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schurz et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shamay-Tsoory and Aharon-Peretz 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The ability to understand the mental or affective states of others has been found to be impaired in some developmental and mental disorders.</s><s>ToM deficits have consistently been observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Frith 2012</ref>) and schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Savla et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Bipolar disorder (BD) is often discussed in relation to schizophrenia and much research is done comparing the two conditions.</s><s>In BD, ToM deficits have been less consistently shown than in schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mitchell and Young 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Studies on ToM in BD vary widely in how ToM has been operationalized, hence rendering the collective findings difficult to interpret.</s><s>This may be related to possible moderating variables such as subsyndromal symptom severity, indicators of illness burden, and basic neurocognitive functions not always being taken into account.</s><s>Indeed, the association between these factors and ToM abilities has, to date, not been explicitly clarified.</s></p><p><s>Recently, two task-specific meta-analyses were conducted to synthesize the heterogeneous results yielded so far in this field.</s><s>A meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Samamé et al. (2015)</ref> reported small-to-medium effect sizes for tasks measuring cognitive ToM and small effect sizes for tasks measuring affective ToM in favor of healthy controls (HCs) versus euthymic bipolar patients (eBPs).</s><s>Based on a slightly extended data pool, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bora et al. (2016)</ref> specifically investigated the relationship between ToM deficits and mood state.</s><s>Pooling all studies irrespective of task modality or content, they found stable moderate effects in strictly euthymic BD samples, as well as in subsyndromal samples, favoring HCs.</s><s>In acute BD samples, a strong effect favoring HCs was found, which was significantly more severe than the effect found for remitted or subsyndromal samples.</s><s>ToM deficits seem to be more reliably present in acute BPs than in strictly euthymic samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kerr et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ioannidi et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The first prospective study to assess the effect of remission on ToM performance in BPs has found patients to recover nearly all of their neurocognitive and social-cognitive abilities during remission, with the exception of performance on the Faux Pas Task, verbal memory, and visuospatial working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ioannidi et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In the meta-regression analyses performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bora et al. (2016)</ref>, clinician-rated manic symptoms were significantly related to the severity of ToM impairment, but not clinician-rated depressive symptoms.</s><s>No significant effects of gender, age, education, illness duration, or age at illness onset on ToM performance in remitted or subsyndromal BPs were found.</s><s>In contrast, global cognitive impairment was significantly associated with ToM deficits in the whole sample and in remitted and subsyndromal samples only.</s><s>In previous studies, ToM performance in bipolar-only and mixed samples (i.e., with both eBPs and HCs) has been found to correlate with general intellectual functioning, attention, memory and executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ioannidi et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bora et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Purcell et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wolf et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Martino et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Donohoe et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Performing a path analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Van Rheenen et al. (2014)</ref> found that neurocognition (a composite score) directly predicted variance in ToM performance, concluding that neurocognition and social cognition are related in BD.</s><s>As ToM performance seems to correlate with a variety of neurocognitive functions, it should also be considered that BD may be characterized by consistent deficits across almost all basic neurocognitive domains (for a comprehensive review of recent data, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fountoulakis (2015)</ref>).</s><s>Deficits have most consistently been shown for executive functions (particularly response inhibition) and verbal memory, both of which have been discussed as possible cognitive endophenotypes for BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fountoulakis 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Few studies, so far, have examined secondary measures of ToM, such as reaction times or task completion duration, and findings have conflicted.</s><s>Two studies have reported eBPs to perform more slowly than HCs on an affective ToM task and a cognitive ToM task, respectively, while accuracy was the same for both groups in both studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kim et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Olley et al. 2005</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, another study found eBPs to show faster reaction times than HCs in a computerized affective ToM task with accuracy again being consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Purcell et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In that study, quicker responding was related to lower life functioning at a 1-year follow-up.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we aimed to specifically investigate visual cognitive and visual affective ToM abilities in eBPs and to explore their relationship with basic neurocognitive functions, subsyndromal symptom severity, and indicators of illness burden.</s><s>As primary outcome measures, we chose the Mental State Attribution Task (MSAT; Brüne 2003) to measure visual cognitive ToM, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Baron-Cohen et al. 2001)</ref> to measure visual affective ToM.</s><s>Next, we were interested in the difference of time taken to complete the ToM tasks in patients versus controls.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that euthymic bipolar patients would perform worse than healthy controls on both the MSAT and the RMET.</s><s>Further, we hypothesized that patients would differ in the time they would take to complete the tasks compared to the controls, but made no predictions about the direction of the effect.</s><s>Correlations between variables were tested exploratively.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>A recent meta-analyses indicates the occurrence of a ToM deficit in bipolar patients across all mood states, with remitted or subsyndromal patients showing stable modest deficits, albeit less severe than during acute episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bora et al. 2016</ref>).</s><s>Nevertheless, the variability in effect sizes between studies is large and the role of possible confounding factors such as neurocognitive functions and clinical variables has not been established conclusively.</s><s>Also, differential patterns of impairment might exist depending on task area (cognitive or affective) and task modality (verbal or visual).</s><s>In the present study, we aimed to exclusively examine the performance of euthymic bipolar patients in visual cognitive and affective theory of mind in comparison to healthy subjects, as deficits in those domains have been less consistently shown for remitted than for acute patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kerr et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ioannidi et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Olley et al. 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Contrary to our hypotheses, patients did not differ in a statistically significant way from controls on our measures of visual cognitive and visual affective ToM.</s><s>Also in disagreement with our hypotheses, we did not find statistically significant differences between patients and controls regarding their time taken to complete either of the ToM tasks.</s><s>In terms of effect sizes, our findings were also below the effect sizes reported in recent meta-analyses.</s><s>While <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Samamé et al. (2015)</ref> have reported effect sizes in the small-tomedium range for cognitive ToM, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bora et al. (2016)</ref> have reported effect sizes in the moderate range pooling across ToM tasks, we observed only a small effect in favor of controls on the performance of our cognitive ToM task.</s><s>On our visual affective ToM task, there was even a small effect favoring the performance of patients.</s><s>With respect to ToM task completion time, we found controls to be faster than patients with a small effect size on the cognitive ToM task.</s><s>A large effect in favor of controls was found for the time taken to complete the affective ToM task.</s></p><p><s>In direct comparison to studies that also used a cartoon task to measure visual cognitive ToM, our finding is in contrast with the results of the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wolf et al. (2010)</ref> that found a statistically significant difference between patients and controls, with a large effect in favor of healthy participants.</s><s>On the other hand, our results are in line with findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kerr et al. (2003)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Olley et al. (2005)</ref> that reported similar performance for patients and controls.</s><s>Importantly, patients in our study and in the study by <ref type="bibr">Olley et al.</ref> presented with a high level of neurocognitive functioning, whereas they showed pronounced deficits in executive functioning relative to controls in the study by Wolf and colleagues.</s><s>In our study, none of the group differences on neurocognitive measures were statistically significant.</s><s>Further, our effect sizes were on the lower edge of or below the effect sizes reported in the previous literature.</s><s>Notably, we did not find the typically reported medium-to-large or large effect sizes in the domains of verbal memory and cognitive inhibition, which are currently discussed as possible cognitive endophenotypes of BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fountoulakis 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the remitted group in the study by <ref type="bibr">Wolf et al.</ref> showed slightly elevated levels of subsyndromal symptoms; in particular a higher level of manic symptoms.</s><s>In the meta-regression analysis performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bora et al. (2016)</ref>, clinician-rated manic symptoms were significantly related to the severity of ToM deficits.</s><s>Moreover, the patients in the study by <ref type="bibr">Wolf et al.</ref> were remitted in the course of the last 4 weeks prior to testing, while they had to be remitted for at least 4 weeks in the study by <ref type="bibr">Olley et al.</ref>, and for at least 6 weeks in our study.</s><s>It is possible that not only the decrease of symptoms, but also the time passed since remission is important for the recovery of neurocognitive and social-cognitive abilities.</s><s>In a longitudinal study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Volkert et al. (2016)</ref> that employed a within-subjects pre-post design, cognitive performance in bipolar patients had considerably improved after 3 months of euthymia.</s></p><p><s>Our finding of patients performing in line with controls on the RMET is in contrast with effect sizes in the small-to-medium range favoring controls reported for this visual affective ToM task in the abovementioned meta-analyses.</s><s>Nonetheless, some studies that directly compared affective ToM and cognitive ToM in eBPs have found differential patterns of impairment, with affective ToM abilities being preserved or less affected than cognitive ToM abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Samamé et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Montag et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barrera et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Shamay-Tsoory et al. 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, as with cognitive ToM, neurocognitive functioning seems to be related to affective ToM performance, and this may, therefore, partly explain the diversity of findings.</s><s>This hypothesis is supported by evidence from a recent study that has suggested the existence of several neurocognitive subgroups within the population of bipolar patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Burdick et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, the group of patients, which was on the same level of neurocognitive functioning as the HCs, outperformed the HCs on a measure of affective social cognition, while the other two patient subgroups performed worse than the controls on that measure.</s><s>This finding suggests that in a subgroup of bipolar patients with preserved neurocognitive functioning, affective ToM abilities might even be elevated compared to the general population.</s></p><p><s>Considering that we chose to measure cognitive and affective ToM abilities based on visual material, our findings do correspond with results of the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Olley et al. (2005)</ref>, where a ToM deficit was observed in the verbal cognitive ToM task, but not in the visual cognitive ToM task.</s><s>This pattern has also been found in unaffected first-degree adult relatives (FDRs) of individuals with BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Reynolds et al. 2014)</ref>, where FDRs performed worse than HCs on a cognitively demanding verbal ToM task, but showed no deficits on either the cognitive or affective visual ToM tasks.</s><s>Thus, our results also support the hypothesis of these authors that ToM deficits in BD might represent a modality-specific disturbance, with visual social perceptual skills being preserved or less affected than verbal social cognitive skills.</s></p><p><s>Through the comparison of studies with diverging results on ToM in BD, it has become apparent that basic neurocognitive functioning might be decisive for ToM performance.</s><s>In our study, only the correlation between performance on the MSAT and verbal learning reached statistical significance.</s><s>Nonetheless, correlations between both ToM tasks and several measures of verbal memory, attention and reasoning were in the small-to-moderate range and could indicate existing relationships and practical significance.</s></p><p><s>Results concerning the effect of illness burden and subsyndromal symptoms on ToM abilities are more ambiguous.</s><s>In our sample, neither variables of illness burden nor measures of subsyndromal symptoms were significantly related to ToM performance.</s><s>However, this finding might be due to the low level of current symptoms and the high level of neurocognitive functioning and ToM performance in our sample.</s><s>Interestingly, ToM performance was negatively correlated with age in the bipolar group but not in the control group.</s><s>In the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wolf et al. (2010)</ref>, age was also found to correlate negatively with performance on ToM tasks.</s><s>An explanation for this finding might be that age by itself represents an indicator of illness severity that bundles factors such as illness duration and number of episodes which might be related to a decline in cognitive abilities.</s><s>Yet, there is also evidence pointing to a null relationship between age and ToM abilities and BPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Donohoe et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Inoue et al. 2004)</ref>, and the effect we found could be spurious.</s><s>In sum, the correlations reported in the current study are in line with the literature where the link between ToM performance and basic neurocognitive functions has more consistently been emphasized over and above the relationship between ToM performance and clinical variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mitchell and Young 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bora et al. 2016</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Yet, neurocognitive functions themselves seem to be vulnerable to clinical variables which might, therefore, also be relevant for social cognition, albeit indirectly.</s></p><p><s>Preliminary findings indicate that illness severity factors such as age at illness onset, number of episodes (especially manic episodes) and absence of remission could be related to a progressive neurocognitive decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Fountoulakis 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Similar findings have emerged from recent studies that have suggested the existence of several neurocognitive subgroups within the population of BPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Burdick et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Martino et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>In one of these studies, neurocognitive impairment was related to the total number of affective episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Burdick et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>Another study showed a higher number of hospitalizations in the subgroup of cognitively impaired BPs compared to the subgroup of cognitively preserved patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Martino et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Volkert et al. (2014)</ref>, where BPs were divided into two subgroups according to their neurocognitive performance, the group that showed deficits in at least one neurocognitive domain reported more sub-threshold depressive symptoms, more sleep disturbances, and, more often, a comorbid anxiety disorder compared to the group that was on the same level of neurocognitive functioning as HCs.</s><s>Our sample of patients that did not show deficits in neurocognitive and social-cognitive functioning might, thus, be interpreted as representing the subgroup of BPs with preserved neurocognitive functions.</s><s>This sample composition might be due to our strict criteria of euthymia and time elapsed since remission, or due to effective prophylactic treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pfennig et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>What may be even more important than the clinical stability of our patients is their relatively high level of education: While there is no evidence to support this hypothesis to date, it is plausible that education levels may be related to neurocognitive performance.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our study supports the notion that visual cognitive and visual affective ToM abilities are not impaired in bipolar patients with a high level of neurocognitive functioning.</s><s>However, our results indicate that patients might take more time to complete ToM tasks which by itself could be relevant for psychosocial functioning.</s><s>It might be that not only the level of performance is relevant to social communication, but also the speed at which inferences about mental states can be drawn.</s><s>Future studies are warranted to investigate the different facets of ToM abilities in neurocognitive subgroups of BD, and to identify factors associated with neurocognitive and social-cognitive impairments in BD, e.g., clinical variables like single symptoms and recovery time.</s><s>In view of the variability of findings reported across studies, it seems too early to draw conclusions about the stability of ToM deficits in BD.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations of our study have to be considered.</s><s>First, as we only assessed measures of visual cognitive and affective ToM, no comparisons could be made with performance on measures of verbal cognitive and affective ToM.</s><s>Furthermore, our measure of visual cognitive ToM showed a ceiling effect which might mean that the task was too easy to detect an effect.</s><s>Further limitations to our study are the small sample size which is associated with low statistical power, and the possible influences of psychotropic medication on the performance of patients.</s><s>Also, our patient sample was characterized by a higher level of neurocognitive functioning than is often reported in the literature.</s><s>Moreover, our samples were not matched for age.</s><s>Yet, as age was negatively correlated with ToM performance in the bipolar sample, we considered it unlikely that the result of patients performing similarly to controls on neurocognitive and ToM tasks should be due to their higher age.</s><s>Taken together, the current study controlled for a range of important variables and showed the importance of considering basic neurocognitive and clinical variables when examining ToM abilities in BD.</s><s>Future research should address the problems outlined above by developing ToM tasks that are difficult enough to produce sufficient variance and by examining larger samples.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table"
