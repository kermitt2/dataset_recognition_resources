<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p><s>There is a clinical need for new biomarkers to allow for a more accurate and timely detection of AKI in order to improve short and long-term outcome.</s><s>In septic AKI, with no clear timing of renal insult, a panel of biomarkers might be more appropriate to capture this complex pathophysiological process and to allow for a more accurate and early diagnosis compared to serum creatinine and urinary output.</s><s>We identified a marker panel of 39 peptides that was highly predictive of AKI in sepsis by using a MALDI-MS platform.</s><s>Establishment of the MALDI peptide marker panel was based on a SVM learning algorithm.</s><s>Briefly, SVMs for supervised learning recognize patterns, which they can transform to numerical membership values.</s><s>Given a set of training data, marked as belonging to one of two classes (here the AKI case and the AKI control group), the SVM training algorithm builds a high-dimensional parameter space with one dimension represented by one peptide marker (n peptides thus equals n dimensions).</s><s>Within this n-dimensional space, the samples are ordered according to the peptide's log-transformed amplitudes and a separation hyperplane is drawn by maximizing the margin between opposite positions of the case and control data points.</s><s>After establishment of the SVM classifier, new samples are assigned to either the case or control group according to the degree of similarity in their peptide marker profiles.</s><s>SVM-based multimarker models have shown promising results, and we previously demonstrated that by using a panel of 20 peptides we could improve classification of AKI versus non-AKI ICU patients with high sensitivity and specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, the CE-MS platform used in this study is currently not suited for daily clinical practice.</s><s>MALDI-MS theoretically offers the advantage of high throughput, is fast and cost effective and does not require highly trained staff to operate it.</s></p><p><s>MALDI-MS has previously been used to detect biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of a range of clinical disorders such as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, and pancreatic cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, MALDI instrumentation is becoming more widely available in clinical settings for rapid identification of pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>However, a number of studies have identified a range of problems with data quantification and reproducibility of results in protein studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, questioning the advantages of this platform for clinical proteomics use.</s></p><p><s>We have previously reported on a method to improve the relative quantification of MALD-MS analysis for proteomic biomarker assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>A further development on the method used in the original MALDI study was the elution of the peptides from the desalting columns in 0.1% TFA, allowing direct spotting onto the MALDI plate for immediate analysis.</s><s>The technique of spotting a range of dilutions of the sample onto the MALDI plate and then using an algorithm to identify the linear range of individual peptides for quantification provides a simple solution to the aforementioned problems.</s><s>In addition, the software for quantitative analysis by MALDI was further developed to allow automated data evaluation.</s><s>In AKI samples from patients with sepsis, we developed a biomarker model made up of a panel of 39 urinary peptides.</s><s>Applying this model to the test set containing 44 cases and 17 controls produced an AUC of 0.82 (p &lt; 0.0001) with a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 76%.</s><s>Although CE separation of peptides prior to MS analysis would result in higher numbers of detected peptides and would allow via lower interference of signal peaks for a better relative quantification of single peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, the MALDI-MS biomarker developed here compares well alongside the state of the art CE-MS biomarkers.</s></p><p><s>During development of the MALDI test, it became obvious that replicates of AKI case and non-AKI control sample pools had to be included to ensure reproducibility in sample classification.</s><s>This was a crucial step in respect to identify the most robust peptide markers and to variance stabilize the multimarker model in the SVM learning phase.</s></p><p><s>Also of great interest was to determine how well classification by the MALDI-MS marker pattern is associated to the assessment of the patients on admission with their RIFLE scoring.</s><s>With a cut-off value of -0.05, the MALDI-MS marker is correctly predicting AKI even when the RIFLE assessment score is at stage 1.</s></p><p><s>Only seven out of the 39 peptides making up the model had sequence information available.</s><s>The identified peptides are fragments from the collagen chains alpha-1(I) (COL1A1) and alpha-1(II) (COL1A2), alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), and fibrinogen alpha chain (FGA).</s><s>In comparison to the 20-peptide marker pattern for AKI prediction in CE-MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, COL1A1, SERPINA1, B2M, and FGA could be reproduced by MALDI as AKI-specific peptide marker source.</s><s>Direct comparison of the two marker patterns revealed identity of the SERPINA1-derived peptide SERPINA1[Thr363-Phe376], whereas the COL1A1-, B2M-, and FGA-derived AKI peptide markers in MALDI are for the most part smaller fragments of the previously described CE-MS-identified peptide markers.</s><s>This accounts for the peptides B2M[Asn62-Lys68], COL1A1[Ser546-Ala559] and FGA[Asp605-Lys620] in MALDI with B2M[Leu60-Ser81], COL1A1[Thr541-Gly560], and FGA[Asp605-Arg621] as CE-MS counterparts.</s><s>In this context, it must be noted that the detected mass range in MALDI-MS is generally more restricted to smaller sized peptides (0.8-3.2 kDa) compared to the one in CE-MS (0.8-16.0 kDa).</s></p><p><s>The seven MALDI AKI peptide markers known by sequence were also compared to the 273 CKD-peptide markers described by Good et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>In this case, there was an overlap of three peptides affecting the peptides SERPINA1 [Thr363-Phe376], COL1A1[Ser546-Ala559], and FGA[Asp605-Lys620].</s></p><p><s>In accordance to our previous study on AKI peptide markers in urine by CE-MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, further support is given to the hypothesis that increased urinary levels of peptide fragments derived from the blood proteins B2M and SERPINA1, and decreased urinary levels of FGA are early signs of AKI.</s><s>With regard to the collagen alpha-1(I) and alpha-1(II) chain structural proteins, peptide fragments thereof were found to be either down-or upregulated in AKI compared to non-AKI sepsis patients.</s><s>Differential excretion of collagen alpha chainderived peptide fragments was already described in a number of other proteomic studies on CKD and AKI <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>Alterations in extracellular matrix turnover in turn were interpreted as a possible trigger factor in the development of CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the peptides identified in this study link particularly well to the current pathophysiological concept of AKI that might explain their good performance-as a panel-to predict AKI.</s></p><p><s>Efforts are now underway to resolve the amino acid sequence of all remaining unidentified peptide markers by postsource decay mass spectrometry.</s><s>If the multimarker model is only restricted to the sequence identified peptide markers this resulted in only moderate classification performance with the AUC being 0.72 (95% CI: 0.59-0.83)</s><s>demonstrating the requirement to also include the yet unidentified peptides in the classification model.</s></p><p><s>The use of MALDI-TOF analysis for clinical biomarker assessment has not previously been possible due to the poor quantitative nature of the technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>We previously presented methodology and software solution to these problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and now present data on their application to biomarker model development.</s><s>The 39-peptide marker panel of sepsisinduced AKI provides a significant improvement in sensitivity and selectivity over single marker tests.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the MALDI AKI peptide marker pattern, our previously established 20-peptide marker pattern for AKI prediction of CE-MS peptide profiles failed to reliably detect AKI in this cohort of sepsis patients.</s><s>Since when applying CE-MS a CKD-specific peptide marker profile enabled better differentiation of AKI from non-AKI, we hypothesize that in the study cohort of sepsis patients those with AKI more likely contain features related to the CKD rather than the AKI CE-MS peptide profile.</s><s>Even in the initial phase, pathways related to CKD might therefore be active in this sepsis patient collective.</s><s>According to the finding that the combination of the MALDI and CKD CE-MS tests by logistic regression significantly improves classification accuracy, a strategy where MALDI-positive patients are subsequently reassessed by the CKD CE-MS classifier might be considered in the future to further improve diagnosis of septic AKI and its progression to CKD in the clinical setting.</s></p><p><s>The limitation of the study is that it describes a proof-ofconcept study on a relatively small population of 95 sepsis patients evaluating if an AKI-specific peptide marker pattern with performance characteristics similar to the one already established for CE-MS is also possible for MALDI-MS peptide profiles.</s><s>For this specific aim, the group of selected patients is well defined and the diagnosis of AKI by RIFLE is based on both the serum creatinine and the urinary output criterion.</s><s>A historical baseline serum creatinine value was available for all patients.</s></p><p><s>The analytical reproducibility of MALDI analysis in a clinical setting has been questioned and discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>To access the long-term stability of the biomarker model and also to address the MALDI instrumentation reproducibility we undertook to analyze pools of samples over an 11-week period.</s><s>In this series, we correctly classified all of the AKI case pool replicates.</s><s>Two AKI control replicates in the 11-week series were classified positive, which resulted in a false-positive rate of 18%.</s><s>Although this is still evaluated to be in an acceptable range, efforts were made to identify the reason for this tendency toward false-positive classification.</s><s>We found that despite frequent calibration checks, the laser output power in the instrument varied over time and was not consistent at the settings selected within the method file.</s><s>An increase in laser output can increase the noise level in the signal to a point where "noise" peaks were recorded as real peptide signals leading to a higher false-positive rate.</s><s>Inclusion of the laser output power in the calibration method that is currently under nonmodifiable software control is in our opinion an essential step to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of our MALDI test for its use in a daily clinical setting to repeatedly monitor AKI progression in sepsis patients.</s></p></div>
