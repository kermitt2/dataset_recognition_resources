<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Research in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) has predominantly focused on delayed cerebral ischaemia and vasospasm.</s><s>These complications arise between Days 5 to 14, are accompanied by new onset neurological deficits and cerebral infarction, and are therefore attractive targets for early detection and timely intervention to improve outcomes.</s><s>However, delayed cerebral ischaemia accounts for only 13% mortality, in contrast to 86% of deaths associated with the initial injury before this period <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Broderick et al., 1994)</ref>, termed acute cerebral ischaemia (ACI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sarrafzadeh et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>ACI describes the initial neurological deficits after SAH, which are important determinants not only of initial survival but also morbidity and long-term outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lagares et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Claassen et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sarrafzadeh et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sakowitz et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An important aspect of ACI is the presence of acute ischaemic brain lesions frequently observed in patients who present with poor grade <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hadeishi et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wartenberg et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Marchis et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>For instance, up to 85% of patients with Hunt-Hess classification of 4-5 had cortical lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) within 96 h of SAH onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Wartenberg et al., 2011)</ref>, and the presence of early lesions (548 h) is associated with worse neurologic status on admission and also worse long-term outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Marchis et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These lesions typically are bilateral, patchy, and multifocal, occur in laminar cortical patterns, are often present in the anterior cerebral artery territory, and are not related to intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).</s><s>Autopsy studies reveal similar findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Neil-Dwyer et al., 1994)</ref>.</s><s>Early ischaemic lesions are under-appreciated, as they often cannot be observed on CT scans <ref type="bibr">(Dreier et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Schmidt et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wartenberg et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>ACI and cortical ischaemic lesions have been hypothesized to result from increased intracranial pressure and intracranial circulatory arrest at the time of aneurysm rupture, ultra-early vasospasm, or local vessel thrombosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sehba and Bederson, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Lee et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Wartenberg et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Terpolilli et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Another concept is based on the observation that patchy, laminar infarcts show 'a preference for the circumvolutions in the area of the subarachnoid haemorrhage' <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Stoltenburg-Didinger and Schwarz, 1987)</ref> and occur in band-like patterns around sulci and fissures <ref type="bibr">(Dreier et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, several studies have observed cortical infarcts in regions of subarachnoid blood accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Weidauer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wagner et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, a proposed mechanism is that erythrocyte breakdown products provoke waves of spreading depolarization in the cortex and, by disrupting normal neurovascular coupling, also cause a pathologic vasoconstrictive response to depolarization known as spreading ischaemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dreier et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dreier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ayata and Lauritzen, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>It was shown that application of haemolysis products to rat cerebral cortex results in laminar infarcts through the spreading depolarization and spreading ischaemia mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dreier et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>This concept was translated to patients by documenting a delayed period (Days 5-9) of repetitive spreading depolarizations that predicted the onset of delayed cerebral ischaemia, including neurologic deficits and new cortical lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dreier et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dreier et al., , 2009;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Drenckhahn et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, an earlier peak of spreading depolarizations is also observed on Days 0-2 in SAH patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dreier et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we hypothesized that spreading depolarizations may also be involved in the development of early cortical infarction in the period of ACI.</s></p><p><s>Here we used a swine model to determine whether focal accumulation of subarachnoid blood is a sufficient insult to acutely induce repetitive spreading depolarizations, as first suggested by <ref type="bibr">Hubschmann and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kornhauser (1980, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to commonly used rodent models, the gyrencephalic swine brain more closely models the subarachnoid spaces of sulci and fissures in humans, where blood accumulates, clots, and persists in substantial volumes.</s><s>We find that sulcal subarachnoid clots not only induce repetitive spreading depolarizations, but also cause infarction of adjacent cortex in patterns similar to those observed clinically.</s><s>In a focused clinical study, we further found a robust association between the occurrence of spreading depolarizations and cortical lesions in the acute phase after aneurysmal SAH.</s><s>Together, these results suggest spreading depolarization as a marker and mechanism of developing ACI.</s></p></div>

body of literature suggesting that spreading depolarizations are a ubiquitous and requisite mechanism of cortical infarction across a variety of diseases and animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hartings et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The causal role of spreading depolarization is proven in focal ischaemic stroke, where initial terminal spreading depolarization triggers the persistent loss of ion homeostasis, intracellular Ca 2 + loading, glutamate efflux, and cytotoxic oedema in the ischaemic core, and spreading depolarizations arising spontaneously in the penumbra over subsequent hours induce the progressive expansion of terminally depolarized, and eventually infarcted, cortical tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(von Bornstadt et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, when high K + and haemoglobin are topically applied to the cortex to mimic haemolysis as a model of delayed cerebral ischaemia after SAH, the occurrence of spreading depolarization, and consequent spreading ischaemia, are determining factors in infarct development <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dreier et al., 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dreier et

findings to the early period of ACI after SAH.</s></p><p><s>In early infarct development after SAH, we hypothesize that spreading depolarizations induce vasoconstriction (spreading ischaemia) and persistent cortical depolarization as requisite mechanisms leading to infarction.</s><s>As direct evidence, we observed anecdotally in both swine and patients the delayed onset of persistent depolarization, which developed in a spreading pattern and was preceded by prolonged spreading depolarizations and the progressive, persistent deterioration of spontaneous cortical activity <ref type="bibr">(Figs 4 and 7A)</ref>.</s><s>These patterns are hallmark, real-time diagnostic markers of lesion growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hinzman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"

et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bosche et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, a limitation of our swine study is that we did not specifically monitor the tissue fated for infarction to systematically investigate persistent depolarization and vasoconstriction.</s><s>Electrodes rather were placed more remotely on the brain surface where cortex usually remained viable.</s><s>On the other hand, this use of clinical methodology provided further evidence that detection of spreading depolarizations even in viable cortex signals the development of remote ischaemic zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dreier et al., 2017)</ref>, since spreading depolarizations were associated with infarction both experimentally and clinically.</s><s>Spreading depolarizations are presumed to originate in or create these ischaemic zones, and their spreading nature allows their remote detection by ECoG strips that sample broad regions of cortex at high risk.</s><s>Apart from this diagnostic advantage, it should not be neglected that spreading depolarizations have a strong effect on cellular function when they invade remote, viable cortex, as demonstrated here by COX-2 upregulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>The widespread lobar or hemispheric effects of propagating spreading depolarizations are diverse and may include transient neurologic deficits, inflammation, neuroprotective preconditioning and neurogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gehrmann et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kobayashi et al.,

infarcts adjacent to subarachnoid clots is the causal relationship between spreading depolarizations and tissue ischaemia.</s><s>One possibility is that SAH directly induces ischaemia through deprivation of blood flow, as in the endovascular puncture model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Busch et al., 1998)</ref>, and that spreading depolarization follows as a consequence.</s><s>In our swine model, we similarly observed petechial cortical haemorrhage, which is likely caused by pressure from clots with sufficient volume and likely caused focal ischaemic hotspots.</s><s>A purely compressive ischaemia is also possible, as suggested by the association of clot thickness with infarcts Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> Continued spreading depolarizations were coupled to transient decreases in P bt O 2 as well as a stepwise cumulative decrease in baseline oxygenation from 21 to 55 mmHg.</s><s>Large amplitude negative ultraslow potentials developed following persistent spreading depolarization at Electrodes 4-6 and returned to baseline levels after 2-3 h.</s><s>(B, bottom) Only 1 of 11 patients without focal brain pathology showed a single spreading depolarization during Days 0-3 after the initial haemorrhage while the remaining 10 patients had no spreading depolarizations.</s><s>By contrast, all but one patient with an early infarct and all but one patient with an initial ICH showed spreading depolarizations.</s><s>Results were quantified by comparing the peak number of spreading depolarizations/day (top) and depression durations (PTDDD; middle).</s><s>(C) Representative MRI on Day 2 of a patient with early infarct but not ICH.</s><s>The CT displays the location of the electrode strip.</s><s>DWI shows early band-like infarcts (hyperintensities) of the cortex and underlying white matter in the medial frontal area bilaterally (anterior cerebral artery territories), close to the ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysm, as well as distant band-like infarcts in the left middle cerebral artery territory where the electrode strip was located.</s><s>The fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image shows hyperintensities in these areas and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map shows hypointensities.</s><s>and spreading depolarizations.</s><s>As evidence against this mechanism, experiments using thick fibrin clots to produce a sulcal mass effect did not cause infarcts significantly greater than saline controls.</s><s>We note, however, that compressive ischaemia may require the presence of erythrocytes as a source for extravascular congestion and microvessel obstruction.</s><s>This is suggested by observations in the blood clot model of erythrocyte infiltration into the perivascular space of arterioles and venules, in some cases causing complete vessel collapse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D and E</ref>).</s><s>By comparison, models of acute subdural haematoma suggest that both compression from mass effect and blood constituents are required for cortical lesion development <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Karabiyikoglu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baechli et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, small cortical lesions were present in saline and fibrin clot control groups, demonstrating the presence of some ischaemic or iatrogenic injury even when spreading depolarizations did not occur.</s></p><p><s>Another possibility is that SAH directly triggers spreading depolarization by chemical mediators and that ischaemia develops primarily through spreading depolarizationinduced spreading ischaemia.</s><s>Spreading ischaemia is commonly observed in the human brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dreier et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr"

2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dreier et al., , 2013))</ref>.</s><s>It is known that acutely haemolysed blood can directly trigger spreading depolarizations, an effect attributable to the high K + concentration of $57 mM as shown, e.g. in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Oka et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>In rats, the threshold concentration of subarachnoid K + inducing spreading depolarization is $35 mM (causing a rise of intracortical extracellular K + from 3 to 6-9 mM) when blood is haemolysed at least partially, because extracellular haemoglobin scavenges nitric oxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dreier et al., 1998)</ref> and decline in nitric oxide availability causes a marked reduction in the K + threshold for spreading depolarization in vivo and in brain slices <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Petzold et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Here, free haemoglobin concentration of fresh and clotted blood at the time of injection was estimated at $0.4-0.5 g/dl, corresponding to 250-310 mM, which is within the range sufficient for increasing the susceptibility to spreading depolarization and spreading ischaemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Major et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Haemolysis may further accelerate in the in vivo environment after injection.</s><s>For instance, the haemoglobin concentration peaked in subarachnoid haematomas both in humans and monkeys on the day of haemorrhage, with concentrations up to 30 g/dl (19 mM) in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ohta et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pluta et al., 1998)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It should finally be considered that chemical and ischaemic induction of spreading depolarization are not exclusive alternatives, but in fact are complementary <ref type="bibr">(Dreier et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Ischaemia reduces the threshold for chemical mediators to induce spreading depolarization, and vice versa, and these triggers may act in synergy without distinct boundaries.</s><s>Furthermore, the relative roles of chemical and ischaemic mediators in inducing spreading depolarization, and of spreading depolarization-mediated vasoconstriction in creating tissue ischaemia, may vary through time and across the spatial gradient of developing lesions.</s><s>In this regard, we note that in the swine model pannecrotic lesions can extend beyond the sulcal clot location and also occur in regions where petechial haemorrhage and vessel collapse were not observed, suggesting a key role of spreading depolarization and spreading ischaemia in expanding infarcts to the full extent observed.</s><s>At the least, monitoring spreading depolarization provides a direct functional readout, useful for interventional studies and clinical translation, of the net effect of a variety of factors involved in damage evolution following SAH <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dreier et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hartings, 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the swine studies establish a novel model of ACI after SAH.</s><s>Typical experimental models of SAH use cisternal injection or vessel puncture but fail to replicate the time course of ACI and delayed cerebral ischaemia in patients, including ischaemic lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marbacher et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Ischaemic neuronal injury was identified previously in a canine model of SAH, but did not constitute the extensive infarction observed here and was only observed after a week or longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jadhav et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Lesions in the nonhuman primate model can be similar to those in the swine model <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Schatlo et al., 2010)</ref>, but ethical restrictions have precluded their further investigation.</s><s>Furthermore, spontaneous spreading depolarizations do not appear to occur in rodent SAH models using cisternal blood injection, which presents a challenge for experimentalists <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chung et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Oka et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>This is most likely because the small lissencephalic brains of rodents do not allow the focal accumulation of sufficient volumes of subarachnoid blood required for cortical infarction.</s><s>Indeed, our results demonstrate that clot thickness is associated with greater risk and extent of infarction and suggest the importance of fissures and sulci for replicating the patho-anatomy of clinical SAH.</s><s>The lesions observed in the swine sulcal clot model
