<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>allows the identification of targets that are essential for the pathogen but not for the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5</ref> .</s><s>At safe doses, however, inhibitors rarely cause 100% inhibition.</s><s>The resulting residual enzyme activity makes chemical inhibition essentially different from a gene knockout, as is implicitly acknowledged by the use of IC 50 rather than IC 100 values for drug efficacy.</s><s>This means that when identifying effective drug targets we must consider additional criteria besides essentiality.</s></p><p><s>The overall effect of an enzyme inhibitor on cell function depends on multiple factors.</s><s>Classically, the focus is on the efficiency of inhibitor uptake by the cell and on the binding affinity of inhibitors for their target enzyme.</s><s>These factors may be optimized by altering the chemical structure of inhibitors, resulting in structure-based drug selectivity (see e.g.</s><s>ref. 6).</s><s>In vivo, however, two other important factors must be taken into consideration.</s><s>First, the direct effect of the inhibitor on enzyme activity also depends on concentrations of intracellular metabolites that act on the target enzyme.</s><s>Thus, competitive inhibitors may be competed away by rising substrate concentrations, while uncompetitive inhibitors become more effective at high substrate concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">7</ref> .</s><s>Second, the control exerted on cell function (i.e. the extent to which an enzyme is rate-limiting) differs considerably between putative target enzymes, and even between sequential and essential enzymes in a single metabolic pathway (e.g.</s><s>ref. 8).</s><s>Some very important enzymes are present in excess and need to be inhibited almost completely before cell function is affected, while others are present in limiting amounts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">9</ref> .</s><s>These two factors -interacting metabolite concentrations and the target enzyme's degree of control over cell function -depend on the kinetic properties of the metabolic network as a whole and are important for the efficacy and selectivity of drugs in vivo.</s><s>These network properties should therefore be included when ranking putative drug targets.</s><s>They constitute the basis for network-based drug selectivity.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we developed the concept of network-based drug selectivity and applied it to glycolysis in Trypanosoma brucei -the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness -and glycolysis in the erythrocytes of its human host.</s><s>We aimed to identify targets that are essential in both organisms but -when inhibited -target the parasite more effectively than the erythrocytes.</s><s>Sleeping sickness is a deadly infectious disease for which new drugs are urgently needed.</s><s>Current drugs have limited effectiveness, are highly toxic, and are experiencing rapidly increasing resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10</ref> .</s><s>Older drugs, such as suramin and melarsoprol have multiple targets, among which metabolic enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11</ref> .</s><s>Eflornithine, a relatively recent drug, targets ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme within the polyamine synthesis pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11</ref> .</s><s>T. brucei is a eukaryotic parasite that is transferred between mammals by bites of the tsetse fly.</s><s>Before it eventually enters the central nervous system, the parasite proliferates extracellularly in the mammalian bloodstream.</s><s>During this stage of its lifecycle, glycolysis is essential for survival as it is the only source of ATP.</s><s>Only 50% inhibition of glycolysis is sufficient to kill trypanosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12</ref> , which makes it a potent target pathway for antitrypanosomal drugs.</s><s>Structural differences between human and trypanosome glycolytic enzymes make some of them attractive as drug targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">13</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, since glycolysis is also vital for the human host's cells, drug selectivity remains a critical challenge.</s><s>Notably, the erythrocytes that co-localize with T. brucei in the bloodstream also depend exclusively on glycolysis for their ATP and all their glycolytic enzymes are essential.</s><s>Insufficient drug selectivity might therefore result in anemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">14</ref> .</s><s>These aspects make erythrocytes well-suited for testing the validity of the concept of network-based drug target identification.</s></p><p><s>We here analyzed two validated, data-driven kinetic models of glucose metabolism, one of the clinically relevant long-slender bloodstream stage of T. brucei <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15</ref> and the other of human erythrocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">16</ref> .</s><s>We quantified the network-based efficacy and selectivity of its enzymes as drug targets.</s><s>Subsequently, we proved theoretically that the network-based component of drug selectivity is equally important as its structure-based component.</s><s>Finally, we experimentally validated one of the most highly ranked drug targets: the plasma membrane glucose transporter.</s><s>We showed in specially designed co-culture experiments of trypanosomes and erythrocytes that glucose-transport inhibitors do not need structural selectivity to target parasite metabolism and survival selectively.</s><s>Finally, mammalian neuronal cells and hepatocytes were much less affected by such inhibitors than trypanosomes or malaria-infected erythrocytes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Ranking drug targets by kinetic modelling.</s><s>To identify potent, network-selective drug targets, we used two equally detailed computer models of glycolysis, one for T. brucei <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15</ref> and one for the human erythrocyte <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">16</ref> .</s><s>The common glycolytic pathway with cell-type specific differences is schematically depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>.</s><s>For each of the glycolytic enzymes in this pathway, we simulated the effect of competitive inhibitors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Both computer models consist of ordinary differential equations that describe how metabolite concentrations change over time.</s><s>In these models the enzyme rates depend on the concentrations of substrates, products and effectors.</s><s>The models contain mechanism-based enzyme-kinetic rate laws and have experimentally determined parameters.</s><s>We used the models in the steady-state mode, when concentrations and fluxes have reached a time-independent, stable state.</s><s>First, we investigated the effect of competitive inhibitors, since they represent the majority of existing mechanism-and structure-based inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>A competitive inhibitor I affects an enzyme through its Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) for the competing substrate and product according to the formula</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ⋅ + K I K K I K ([ ]/ ) ( 0) (1 [ ]/ )<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">m i m i</formula><p><s>Here K i is the inhibition constant of the inhibitor for the enzyme and K m (0) is the K m in the absence of the inhibitor.</s><s>An [I]/K i of 1 effectively doubles the K m for the specific competing substrate, which means a 33% reduction in enzyme activity at half-saturating substrate concentration.</s><s>The lower the K i , the stronger the inhibitor affects the enzyme.</s><s>The K i depends on the structural affinity of the inhibitor for the active site of the enzyme.</s></p><p><s>Varying the [I]/K i ratio rather than the inhibitor concentration itself ensures that the simulations are independent of this structural affinity and hence independent of the actual inhibitor used.</s></p><p><s>Antitrypanosomal drugs that target glycolysis should in the first place exert a strong effect on the ATP production flux, which is exclusively glycolytic in the trypanosome.</s><s>The effect of inhibitors on the T. brucei ATP production flux depended strongly on their target enzyme: e.g. an inhibitor of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or glucose transport reduced the ATP synthesis flux more than an inhibitor of hexokinase, which in turn was more effective than an enolase inhibitor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>We used these titrations to calculate -for each combination of enzyme and competing substrate/product -which [I]/K i was required to reduce the T. brucei  <ref type="table">S1</ref>), and ranked on the basis of the amount of [I]/K i needed to inhibit by 90%.</s><s>The HXK inhibitor affected both the cytosolic and the glycosomal HXK fraction.</s><s>Glc: glucose.</s><s>See also Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>ATP production flux by 90% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) and sorted them from lowest to highest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>The lower the [I]/K i ratio needed for 90% inhibition of glycolytic flux, the lower the dose that will be required to kill the parasites and thus the more potent the target.</s><s>The 90% cut-off is a safe choice, since already 50% inhibition is sufficient to start killing trypanosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">12</ref> .</s><s>Qualitatively, the ranking was hardly affected by the precise cut-off, as can also be seen from the complete titration curves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>For inhibitors of GAPDH -which compete with the enzyme's substrate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and with its product 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (13BPGA) -a concentration of 35 times the K i was sufficient to reduce the flux by 90%.</s><s>In contrast, a competitive inhibitor of enolase required a dose of more than 10 6 times its K i to achieve the same effect.</s><s>For some enzymes with multiple substrates the choice of the competing substrate affected the outcome: an inhibitor of pyruvate kinase (PYK) that competed with ADP and ATP achieved 90% flux inhibition at a markedly lower concentration than one that competed with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>According to our predictions, the three best competitive inhibitors acted either on GAPDH (competitive with either GAP/13BPGA or NAD + / NADH) or on the glucose transporter in the plasma membrane (GlcT).</s></p><p><s>To avoid toxicity, putative drugs should have minimal effect on erythrocyte glycolysis.</s><s>We therefore used the same competitive inhibitors for titrations in the erythrocyte model and the trypanosome model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Inhibition of the most potent targets in T. brucei -GAPDH and glucose transport -had only a limited effect on erythrocyte glycolysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-c</ref>), classifying them as highly selective network-based targets.</s><s>The next most potent T. brucei inhibitor -acting on phosphofructokinase (PFK) and competitive with fructose 6-phosphate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) -conferred unwanted network selectivity: a greater effect on erythrocyte glycolysis than on trypanosome glycolysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>For the [I]/K i values that inhibited 90% of the T. brucei glycolytic flux (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) we calculated how the flux would be affected in erythrocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>This confirmed that the three competitive inhibitors that were most effective in reducing T. brucei flux (the two GAPDH inhibitors and the GlcT inhibitor) did not affect erythrocyte flux.</s><s>There were three other inhibitors that had moderate or negligible effects on erythrocyte glycolysis.</s><s>However, for these inhibitors, 10-to 1000-fold higher doses (or lower K i ) are needed to inhibit the trypanosome flux by 90% (cf.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>), making them less suitable as potential drugs.</s></p><p><s>Network-based selectivity is just as important as structure and pharmacokinetics for the overall drug selectivity.</s><s>We then studied the general principles underlying drug selectivity by adopting the framework of metabolic control analysis (MCA) (reviewed in ref. 18).</s><s>The overall effect of a drug on cell function depends on: (i) the drug concentration to which the target enzyme is exposed, and which depends on pharmacokinetics; (ii) the structural affinity of the target enzyme for the drug; (iii) the local environment of the enzyme (e.g.</s><s>competing metabolite concentrations) which affects the in vivo affinity of the target enzyme to the drug; and finally (iv) to which extent the target enzyme limits a vital metabolic process.</s><s>MCA addresses perturbations in the mathematical limit to infinitely small parameter changes and provides therefore an approximation of real drug effects.</s><s>The advantage is that we can apply it to integrate network-based and structure-based selectivitiy in general, mathematical terms.</s><s>In MCA the effect of a small change in
