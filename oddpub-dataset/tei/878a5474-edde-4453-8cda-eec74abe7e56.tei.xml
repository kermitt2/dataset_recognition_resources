<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1, synonym: crotonase, EC 4.2.1.17),</s><s>encoded by ECHS1 (cytogenetic location: 10q26.3;</s><s>GenBank accession number: NM_004092.3;</s><s>OMIM*602292), is a mitochondrial matrix enzyme that catalyzes the second step of the b-oxidation spiral of fatty acids, that is, the hydration of chain-shortened a,b-unsaturated enoyl-CoA thioesters to produce b-hydroxyacyl-CoA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> For each turn of this spiral pathway, one acetyl-CoA molecule is released and utilized for either the formation of citrate (tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) or ketone bodies (ketogenesis).</s><s>Decreased activity of mitochondrial b-oxidation of fatty acids thus decreases the formation of important energy substrates.</s><s>Decreased formation of acetyl-CoA results in increased susceptibility to energy deficiency during catabolic states and to the dysfunction of organs that particularly rely on fatty acids and ketone bodies as their energy source (e.g., cardiac tissue).</s><s>In addition, decreased formation of acetyl-CoA, and hence limited availability of acetate, hampers myelination because acetate is required for cholesterol biosynthesis.</s><s>Moreover, decreased formation of acetyl-CoA may hamper posttranslational acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, a mechanism that is emerging as a critical regulator of mitochondrial function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Evidence is increasing that ECHS1 has a wide substrate specificity and thus also plays an important role in amino acid catabolism, in particular of valine, where it converts methacrylyl-CoA to (S)-3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypro-pionyl-CoA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the fourth step of valine oxidation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>ccumulation of toxic methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA, two highly reactive intermediates that spontaneously react with sulfhydryl groups of, for example, cysteine and cysteamine, is suspected to cause brain pathology and biochemical phenotype in b-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) deficiency, a disorder of the fifth step of valine oxidation with a Leigh-like phenotype and deficiency of multiple mitochondrial enzymes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Very recently, ECHS1 mutations were reported in two siblings with Leigh disease and remarkable clinical and biochemical similarities to HIBCH deficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Both presented soon after birth with generalized hypotonia, poor feeding, respiratory insufficiency, and developmental delay.</s><s>They suffered a severe clinical course and died at the age of 4 and 8 months.</s></p><p><s>Here, we report 10 unrelated individuals, identified by exome sequencing, who carry compound heterozygous or homozygous ECHS1 mutations and present with a combination of (Leigh-like) mitochondrial encephalopathy, deafness, epilepsy, optic nerve atrophy, and cardiomyopathy.</s><s>This work confirms ECHS1 mutations as a cause of mitochondrial disease, and defines the broad phenotypic spectrum of this new disorder which ranges from fatal neonatal courses to survival into adulthood.</s></p></div>

normal 1.8 mmol/L), but metabolic profiling (amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis, acylcarnitine analysis) was unremarkable.</s><s>Brain MRI at day 8 showed low intensity in cerebral white matter, and moderate brain atrophy at day 58.</s><s>She died at the age of 4 months and autopsy was performed.</s><s>Respiratory chain analysis showed mild deficiency of complex I in liver, but normal

diet.</s><s>The diet was stopped after a few months as no clinical response was observed.</s><s>At 5 months of age, he had severely delayed motor development, hardly any head control, severe truncal hypotonia and intermittent episodes of opisthotonus.</s><s>There was no reaction to visual or auditory stimuli.</s><s>Despite gastric tube feeding, the child was severely underweight (À2.8 SD), of short stature (À3.4 SD), and microcephalic (À4.9 SD).</s></p><p><s>Laboratory investigation revealed persistently elevated lactate (2.4-6.0 mmol/L), mildly elevated CK and repeatedly normal

movements of the head and trunk, swallowing problems, and episodes of inconsolable crying.</s><s>He depended on tube feeding and suffered from epilepsy with hypsarrhythmia and multifocal epileptic activity in the EEG at the age of 1 and 3 years.</s><s>On physical examination, he was unable to make contact or follow objects, showed virtually no spontaneous movements, but only dystonic movements of arms and legs.</s><s>Over the course of the disease axial hypotonia and hypertonia of the limbs persisted, dystonic movements diminished, and he did not make any developmental progress.</s><s>Laboratory tests showed chronic iron deficiency leading to anemia.</s><s>Physical examination at the age of 6 years showed microcephaly, scoliosis, and muscular hypotonia.</s><s>The child died at the age of 7.5 years due to respiratory insufficiency in the course of a pulmonary infection.</s></p><p><s>Brain MRI at the age of 1 year showed atrophy of caudate nuclei, corpus callosum, mesencephalon, and pons.</s><s>These changes were progressive at age 4 years showing extensive white and gray matter brain atrophy, mainly in frontal and temporal lobes bilaterally with
