<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STATISTICS AND METHODS Patients and events of interest</head><p><s>The present study was conducted using data from the German biologics register RABBIT, which is an ongoing observational cohort study.</s><s>Since May 2001, patients with RA have been eligible for enrolment at the start of treatment with a bDMARD or csDMARD after failure of at least one csDMARD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">20</ref></s><s>A total of 12 097 patients were enrolled in RABBIT by 30 October 2013.</s><s>The focus of this paper is the outcome of SIs.</s><s>Therefore 947 patients who developed one or more infections that were classified as serious according to International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">21</ref> were included.</s><s>In the main analysis we excluded 108 SIs in 88 patients with incomplete information on the SI.</s><s>The main analysis is therefore based on all separable SIs (n=1017) of 859 patients.</s><s>Patients were considered to be exposed to a particular DMARD when the SI occurred during active treatment with that DMARD, that is, no missed dose before the SI.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments and follow-up</head><p><s>Clinical status was assessed at baseline, months 3 and 6, then every 6 months for 5-10 years.</s></p><p><s>Rheumatologists reported DMARD exposure (start and stop dates, doses), adverse events, disease activity (including components of the disease activity score based on a 28-joint-count (DAS28)) and comorbidities.</s><s>Patients reported among other items on physical function using the Hannover Functional Status Questionnaire (FFbH).</s><s>Its scores can be transformed to the Health Assessment Questionnaire values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">22</ref></s><s>If serious adverse events were reported the rheumatologist was asked to provide detailed clinical information including hospital discharge letters.</s></p><p><s>Adherence to scheduled follow-ups was monitored and investigations of dropouts or the reasons for the discontinuation of study participation were performed.</s><s>This includes inquiries to local administration offices regarding patients' vital status and cause of death.</s><s>For further details see. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">20</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective</head><p><s>The objective was to examine the impact of patients' clinical characteristics and RA treatment with TNFi, other bDMARDs, csDMARDs and glucocorticoids on the risk of developing sepsis or a fatal outcome of SI.</s><s>Three approaches were applied.</s><s>Approach A (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) investigates the risks of sepsis and death after SI simultaneously and thus includes validated cases of fatal and non-fatal sepsis plus all deaths within 90 days after SI.</s><s>With this approach we addressed possibly undetected and fatal cases of sepsis after SI.</s><s>In approach B, the risk of death due to sepsis was investigated.</s><s>The overall risk of death after SI, with and without sepsis, was addressed in approach C.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model-based analyses</head><p><s>Units of investigation in this analysis were SIs.</s><s>In approach A two possible outcomes of SI, sepsis (including death from sepsis) and mortality without known sepsis, were investigated simultaneously.</s><s>4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[25]</ref> It was crucial to include overall mortality in the analysis in order not to miss undetected cases of sepsis.</s><s>In approach A (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) we applied a recently introduced generalised estimating equations model for longitudinal and multinomial responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref> to investigate the risks of sepsis and death as outcomes of SI simultaneously.</s><s>This model class takes dependencies of subsequent SI in one patient into account.</s><s>It is implemented in the statistical software R <ref type="bibr">27 28</ref> .</s><s>A similar approach was applied in time-discrete analyses of competing risks of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections by Barnett et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">29</ref> A generalised estimating equations model with the binary outcome mortality yes/no was used in approach C.</s><s>However, since only two patients developed sepsis twice, in approach B the analysis was restricted to the last sepsis per patient and multiple logistic regression was applied.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analyses</head><p><s>The consistency of results was investigated in four different sensitivity analyses.</s><s>Analysis I comprised the subset of patients with pneumonia.</s><s>In a second analysis we aimed to detect the influence of bDMARD discontinuation and therefore restricted the group of patients on csDMARD treatment at the time of SI to those naïve to biologics.</s><s>The third sensitivity analysis addressed the impact of incomplete data and uncertain DMARD exposure and included 108 additional SIs with incomplete information.</s><s>Approach A examined the risks of sepsis and death after SI simultaneously; this approach accounts for possibly undetected but fatal cases of sepsis (see: objectives &amp; methods).</s><s>Approach B focuses on the mortality risk of sepsis.</s><s>Overall mortality after SI was examined in approach C. All sensitivity analyses were applied in the setting of approach A. GEE, generalised estimating equations; SI, serious infection.</s></p><p><s>In these patients we assumed that the last known DMARD exposure during follow-up in RABBIT persisted at the time of SI.</s><s>Analysis IV comprises dropouts with no reported events of sepsis or death and a follow-up of less than 180 days after the last SI.</s><s>In this most conservative approach, we assumed that dropout occurred due to sepsis only for bDMARD-treated patients and artificially imputed these events to the data.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mortality after SI and sepsis</head><p><s>Adjustment in the analyses of mortality after sepsis was restricted to age, sex, treatment with bDMARDs and comorbid heart failure because of the low number of fatal outcomes of sepsis.</s><s>Treatment with TNFi, but not with other bDMARDs, was significantly associated with a lower case fatality rate of sepsis (approach B).</s><s>All-cause mortality after SI, irrespective of the development of sepsis, was significantly reduced for the use of TNFi and other bDMARDs (approach C, table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analyses</head><p><s>ORs of the risk of sepsis and death for exposure to bDMARDs compared with csDMARDs remained consistently below 1 throughout all four sensitivity analyses (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The reduction of the study population in analyses 1 and 2 produced wider CIs but consistent estimates.</s><s>Analysis 3, incorporating 108 SIs with incomplete information, strengthened the results.</s><s>In the most conservative analysis 4 we imputed the event of sepsis only to those 29 out of 50 dropouts who were exposed to bDMARDs (TNFi: n=17, other bDMARDs: n=12).</s><s>However, the overall protective effect of bDMARDs remained significant.</s></p></div>

they found for TNFi versus csDMARD an adjusted OR of 0.50 (95% CI (0.3 to 0.8)).</s><s>We also found that mortality after sepsis was significantly lower when patients were exposed to bDMARDs at the time of SI.</s><s>These findings are consistent with experimental studies in animals <ref type="bibr">6 7</ref> which suggest that TNFi effectively prevents sepsis.</s><s>A secondary but important result of this study addresses the impact of discontinuing bDMARD treatment on the risk of sepsis and death after SI.</s><s>It is common knowledge that initiation of bDMARD therapy increases the risk of SI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[19]</ref> Further, discontinuation of bDMARDs is supposed to decrease the risk of SI.</s><s>Regarding the risks of sepsis or death after SI our results suggest a different mechanism: adverse outcomes of SI (sepsis and death) were more likely in biologic-naïve patients than in patients exposed to bDMARDs at the time of SI (see online supplementary table S5, Sensitivity analysis 2) which could indicate a protective effect of bDMARDs.</s><s>This double-edged effect of bDMARDs has been described very recently as the 'dual' role of TNFi regarding septic arthritis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">31</ref></s><s>The authors referred to an experimental study which showed protective effects of TNFi against septic arthritis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">32</ref></s><s>In our study the protective effect receded when bDMARDs were discontinued: the risk of developing sepsis or of dying after SI was similar in patients who had discontinued bDMARDs at least 30 days before the SI and in biologic-naїve patients (see online supplementary table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We performed four sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results.</s><s>The most conservative, or worst-case scenario, which assumed that all bDMARD-treated patients with insufficient follow-up had developed sepsis (Sensitivity analysis 4, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) did not reveal diverging results.</s></p><p><s>A strength of our study is the simultaneous investigation of sepsis and mortality after SI.</s><s>This approach prevented the omission of cases which died from undetected sepsis.</s><s>Furthermore, we adjusted for possible imbalances between DMARD groups in all analyses (age, sex and important risk factors).</s></p><p><s>There are possible shortcomings of our study.</s><s>We have found a similar spectrum of SIs across bDMARDs and csDMARDs (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), but a residual chance remains that subtypes of SI are differentially distributed.</s><s>To minimise this bias we performed a subanalysis of patients with pneumonia which showed consistent results.</s><s>However, our data do not comprise sufficient pathogen classification to investigate bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia separately.</s><s>Additionally, the numbers of patients and events did not permit discrimination between effects of particular bDMARDs.</s></p><p><s>Another uncertainty rests with the complexity of the clinical course, the symptoms and the severity of SI and sepsis.</s><s>There could be a suspicion bias, meaning that patients treated with bDMARDs who develop an SI could be hospitalised faster than those on csDMARDs.</s><s>This would lead to earlier detection and treatment and thus better outcome of sepsis.</s><s>We have no indication of such bias since the hospitalisation rates and the spectrum of SIs were equal among the treatment groups.</s><s>In addition, in RABBIT all diagnoses and serious adverse events are validated and classified by the study physician in a blinded manner, that is, unaware of the DMARD exposure of the respective patient.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study suggests that patients exposed to bDMARDs at the time of SI have a reduced risk of sepsis and mortality.</s><s>The effective immunosuppression via bDMARDs may prevent an unregulated host response to SI and the development of sepsis.</s><s>Discontinuation of bDMARDs seems to shift the risk from an increased susceptibility to SI to more severe outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Nonetheless, we cannot conclude from our study that bDMARDs should be continued in case of an SI since this is the first study showing these results.</s><s>They have to be confirmed by other studies before any clinical consequences can be drawn.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Investigation of SI outcomes.</s><s>Boxes in colour indicate the outcomes of interest and boxes in black indicate the reference population.Approach A examined the risks of sepsis and death after SI simultaneously;
