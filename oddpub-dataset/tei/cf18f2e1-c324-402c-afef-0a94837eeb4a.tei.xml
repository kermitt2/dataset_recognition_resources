<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Morphometric and histologic characteristics.</s><s>The auditory ossicles analysed in this study were already completely developed at birth and had their typical shape as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A,B</ref>.</s><s>A central cavity in the malleus, incus and the base of the stapes could be identified in high-resolution micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) and histology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B,C</ref>).</s><s>Length measurements revealed that the ossicles' size did not change after birth (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C-F</ref>).</s><s>A fibrous capsule surrounded the ossicle bone, with primary occurrence at the incumalleolar and incustapedial joint, as well as at the stapedial footplate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1G</ref>, toluidine blue staining, black arrows).</s><s>These small "joints" were not covered by typical articular (hyaline) cartilage.</s><s>Only the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes) belonging to the subjects at the age of 0 and 3 months were subject to both endochondral (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1H</ref>) and intramembranous ossification with visible osteoblasts on the endosteal bone surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1I</ref>).</s><s>In the remaining specimens no osteoblasts or osteoclasts could be identified.</s><s>In fact, no tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) or cathepsin K-positive osteoclasts were detected in any of the biopsies.</s></p><p><s>Mineralization and osteocyte parameters of the stapes.</s><s>In the histological analyses, as well as in quantitative backscattered electron imaging (qBEI) of the stapes, we detected a high number of both empty and hypermineralized (micropetrotic) osteocyte lacunae from very young age (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>,B, Supp. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Some of the micropetrotic lacunae were not homogenously filled with mineralized material, but rather showed a heterogeneous accumulation of calcified nanospherites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>).</s><s>A highly mineralized line (i.e., "cement line") was seen as a boundary between the internal and external portion of the crura of the stapes, indicating that they have two distinct embryological parts (i.e., superior, inferior) that arise from a separate anlage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>, white arrows).</s></p><p><s>There was an age-dependent trend of decreasing thickness of the anterior crus of the stapes; the most dramatic thinning occurred already during the first year and only minor changes occurring afterwards (logarithmic regression: r 2 = 0.351, p = 0.033) (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C, 3</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, we could demonstrate a significant age-related decline in osteocyte numbers.</s><s>Specifically, number of osteocyte lacunae per bone area showed an age-dependent decline that was best and highly explained by logarithmic fitting (r 2 = 0.854, p &lt; 0.001), considering that the most dramatic reduction occurred during the first postnatal months followed by a more gradual reduction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>).</s><s>Lacunar area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2E</ref>) also demonstrated a reduction with age that was most prominent during the first year (logarithmic fit: r 2 = 0.559, p = 0.003).</s><s>The number of viable osteocytes per bone area as assessed by histology decreased in an analogous manner (logarithmic fit: r 2 = 0.964, p &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2F</ref>), so that lacunar occupancy also decreased (logarithmic fit: r 2 = 0.774, p &lt; 0.001, not shown).</s><s>Backscattered electron imaging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) revealed that mineralized osteocyte lacunae were present already at birth, but unlike other osteocyte related parameters, their number showed a linear increase with age (r 2 = 0.941, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</s><s>Backscattered electron imaging of healthy femoral diaphyseal biopsies revealed a considerably lower increase in the number of micropetrotic lacunae with aging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>-red line <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>Quantitative backscattered electron imaging revealed a high bone matrix mineralization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Calcium weight percentage values increased with age remarkably during the first three years, followed by minor changes after that age (logarithmic fit: r 2 = 0.925, p &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Further correlation analysis showed that an increase in Calcium mean values (Ca mean) correlates significantly with accumulation of mineralized lacunae per bone area (positively) and negatively with other parameters (crus thickness, osteocyte lacunae, lacunar area, osteocyte number, lacunar occupancy).</s></p><p><s>Mineralization and osteocyte parameters of the malleus.</s><s>Quantitative backscattered electron imaging showed a significant trend of increasing mineral content of the bone matrix with age (logarithmic fit: r 2 = 0.559, p = 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>Examination with high magnification revealed that malleus had a frame of highly mineralized bone tissue in the peripheral zones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>These zones showed disorientated collagen orientation as seen by polarized light microsopy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A, insets</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the peripheral zones of the malleus were significantly higher mineralized than central zones adjacent to the central blood vessel (p = 0.029) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B,C</ref>).</s><s>While both the peripheral and central zones showed a significantly increased mineral content in aged cases (peripheral p = 0.014; central p = 0.046), the mineralization discrepancy between the peripheral and central zones showed a tendency to decline (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B,C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Viable osteocytes were highly frequent in young cases compared to older cases, where almost no osteocytes were found in the remaining non-mineralized lacunae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>, toluidine blue staining).</s><s>Regression analyses revealed a logarithmic decline in osteocyte lacunar number (r 2 = 0.752, p &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4D</ref>) as well as osteocyte lacunar size (r 2 = 0.779, p &lt; 0.001, not shown) as a function of age.</s><s>Number of mineralized lacunae increased with age in a linear manner (r 2 = 0.753, p &lt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Canalicular connections and osteocyte apoptosis.</head><p><s>Next to the detected age-related trends in osteocyte lacunar number, mineralization and micropetrosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5;</ref> 1.-3.), acid etching and subsequent scanning electron microscopy revealed a high connectivity among osteocytes (i.e., number of osteocyte canaliculi per osteocyte lacuna) during the first year of life, in comparison to poorly connected osteocyte lacunae evident later during lifetime (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5, 4.</ref>).</s><s>Equally, the mean canalicular length declined from 16.2 ± 6.8 µm at birth to 13.3 ± 4.2, 7.9 ± 2.4 and 6.5 ± 3.1 µm at 0.5, 22 and 60 years.</s></p><p><s>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL staining) allowed us to detect the amount of osteocytes undergoing apoptosis related to the total cell number (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>; 5., Supp. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), confirming a highly dynamic osteocyte apoptosis process that occurs at an early age leading to large numbers of dying osteocytes.</s><s>Apoptotic nuclear fragmentation and nuclear blebbing were identified by TUNEL staining procedure under FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) and DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) filters (Supp.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 C, D</ref>).</s><s>The relative amount of osteocyte apoptosis increased until to age of 22 years, while at the age of 60 years we found essentially no osteocytes undergoing apoptosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>; 5.).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reference point indentation of mallei.</head><p><s>Reference point indentation of the mallei allowed the extraction of parameters indicating local bone material properties (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>).</s><s>A significant age-dependent decline in the first cycle indentation distance (ID 1 st ) was detected (logarithmic fit, r² = 0.47, p &lt; 0.01) indicating a higher resistance to deformation with increasing age (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref>).</s><s>Consistently the total indentation distance (TID) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref>) decreased with age (r² = 0.505, p &lt; 0.001) supporting the ID 1 st data.</s><s>The indentation distance increase (IDI) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6D</ref>) appeared to decrease with age (p &lt; 0.001, r² = 0.594).</s><s>The average unloading slope (Avg US) and average loading slope (Avg LS) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6E,F</ref>) increased with an increasing tissue age (p &lt; 0.001, r² = 0.525 and p &lt; 0.01, r = 0.391 respectively).</s><s>Higher Avg US suggests an increasing stiffness of the bone material with age.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The natural lifespan of osteocytes is believed to be about 25 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Our results in the auditory ossicles show a dramatic decrease in viable osteocytes already in early childhood, which indicates that the lifespan of osteocytes might be highly site-specific.</s><s>Our results indicate that high-frequency vibration in auditory ossicles goes along with osteocyte apoptosis.</s><s>It is generally known that viable osteocytes provide anti-resorptive signals, while osteocyte apoptosis (such as due to dendrite transection by a microcrack) normally attracts osteoclasts to resorb the bone at the site <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>However, the pronounced osteocyte death and subsequent massive accumulation of dead osteocytes without increased bone resorption suggest that there is a factor inhibiting bone resorption in the ossicles, which could be of major interest for the treatment of human bone loss syndromes i.e., osteoporosis.</s><s>Another reason for the absent bone resorption could be that the osteocyte-derived proteins triggering bone resorption such as RANKL <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> cannot get to the bone surface due to an early decline in the number, length and size of osteocyte canaliculi.</s><s>While further research is necessary to reveal the exact nature of an osteoclasts-inhibiting signal, such signal could be perceived as a factor conserving the overall architecture of the ossicles to maintain optimal sound transmission.</s><s>The subsequent excessive formation of hypermineralized lacunae represents a unique feature in auditory ossicles, as no other skeletal site (e.g.</s><s>human cortical bone, iliac crest biopsies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ) has shown micropetrotic lacunae in this order of magnitude.</s></p><p><s>Recently, it was shown that nanospherites can grow and fuse until complete occlusion of the lacuna <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Such nanospherites were also frequently found within various osteocyte lacunae in the analysed ossicles.</s><s>Along with osteocyte apoptosis, nanospherite formation and micropetrosis, the ossicle's bone matrix becomes very highly mineralized during the first years of age with calcium weight percentages of up to 31 wt%.</s><s>These are the highest reported levels for mean mineralization in the human skeleton in comparison to weight percentages of 22 to 25 wt% in human cortical or trabecular bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, the mean calcium content in the ossicles increased logarithmically with age, while the number of micropetrotic lacunae increased linearly, which shows that matrix hypermineralization and formation of micropetrotic lacunae are not directly related or occur in a time-delayed manner.</s></p><p><s>Both mineralization and aging are known to influence the bone's material properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>We have conducted reference point indentation on the mallei to find out whether the mechanical properties change comparably to age-related changes in mineralization pattern and osteocyte parameters.</s><s>Our data suggest that the resistance to deformation (i.e., ID 1 st , TID) of ossicles in infants (&lt;1 year) corresponds to that of cortical bone in individuals of around 52 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, our results strongly underline that the age-dependent changes in auditory ossicles do not only include highly dynamic changes in osteocyte number and mineralization but also an increasing resistance as testified by decreasing indentation depths.</s><s>Furthermore, early age-related increases in the average unloading slope suggest stiffening of the material at higher mineralization levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>The indentation distance increase (IDI), which can be interpreted a measure of plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , revealed a significant, logarithmic decrease with aging, which may seem contradictory to previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>However, it was also shown that a decrease in IDI is linked to increasing mineral content and aging in early stage, which is indeed the case in the ossicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>In fact, the IDI reached an early plateau phase and no significant changes took place after the of 1 year.</s><s>Since all parameters extracted from the RPI load-displacement curves followed a similar development during aging as osteocyte parameters and overall matrix mineralization, it can be proposed that both have a major influence on the mechanical properties of bone.</s><s>These mechanical properties reflecting a stiff and hard material may be physiologically ideal to transfer the vibrations of sound with losing as little energy as possible.</s></p><p><s>In general, the concept of the osteocyte's involvement in maintaining bone quality through proper bone remodelling, which is substantially declining in skeletons of older individuals making them possibly more prone to fracture, is well-accepted.</s><s>Our study on osteocyte lacunar morphology in auditory ossicles highlights that bone tissue can be altered without the need of viable osteocytes.</s><s>In addition, otosclerosis is a disease, which is characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear with high bone turnover in the ossicles leading to conductive hearing loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Although the causality for pathological bone growth in ossicles has not been described, misdirected osteocyte apoptosis with subsequent failure to prevent excessive bone remodelling might play a role in otosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>As impaired vibration of the ossicles was found in osteopetrotic mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , and the deficiency of the osteocyte-secreted fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been associated with ossicles malformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , it is most likely that the well-known and bone-specific regulatory pathways are present in the ossicles.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, the pronounced osteocyte death in the auditory ossicles implicates new insights in the pathogenesis of bone loss syndromes regarding osteocyte apoptosis, since osteocyte activity influences the balance between bone formation and resorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>Namely, in the ossicles, the co-occurrence of dying osteocytes and maintained structural integrity represent a unique feature.</s><s>Indeed, lack of bone remodelling conserves the architecture of the auditory ossicles, which is of high importance for consistent sound transmission.</s><s>Further studies are needed to investigate the exact chemical nature of inhibitor of bone resorption, i.e., by immunohistochemistry.</s><s>Moreover, it has not been clear whether micropetrosis is exclusively associated with diseased bone and fracture risk, or it may also display structure-preserving effects due to stoppage of bone resorption.</s><s>For this purpose, it is now required to analyze the ossicles of other mammalian species, also to put our findings in an evolutionary context.</s><s>Furthermore, the analysis of immobilized bones at other skeletal sites may help in understanding whether the observed processes are a result of an absence of high impact loads, aging or rather the exclusive anatomy of the ossicles that keeps them adapted optimally to the sound transmission function.</s></p></div>
