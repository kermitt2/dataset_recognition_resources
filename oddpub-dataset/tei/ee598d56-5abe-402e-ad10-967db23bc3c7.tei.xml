<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intra-arterial therapy</head><p><s>All procedures were performed by one experienced interventional radiologist (J.F.G. with 16 years of experience in hepatic interventions).</s><s>A consistent approach according to our standard institutional protocol was used.</s><s>Initially, all patients underwent multiple angiographic steps to define the hepatic arterial anatomy and to determine portal venous patency.</s><s>For cTACE, patients were treated with selective (lobar or segmental) injections.</s><s>A solution containing 100 mg of cisplatin, 50 mg of doxorubicin and 10 mg of mitomycin C in a 1:1 mixture with Lipiodol (Guerbet, France) was infused and followed by administration of 100-to 300-μm-diameter microspheres (Embospheres, Merit Medical, USA).</s><s>Substantial arterial flow reduction to the tumour was defined as the technical end point of the procedure.</s><s>For radioembolization, all patients were subjected to angiographic evaluation and, if required, embolization of collateral arteries was performed.</s><s>In order to evaluate the degree of hepato-pulmonary shunting and to detect gastrointestinal deposition, 5-6 mCi of 99mTClabelled macroaggregated albumin was injected into the hepatic artery.</s><s>This shunt study preceded the treatment by at least 1 week.</s><s>Depending on the extent of the disease within the liver, patients received either unilobar or bilobar (right and left) treatment in multiple sessions and no whole liver infusion was performed.</s><s>The infusion of Y90 microspheres (TheraSpheres®, MDS Nordion, Ottawa, Canada) was performed in accordance with institutional radiation safety guidelines.</s><s>All patients who received cTACE were admitted overnight.</s><s>Patient who received Y90 radioembolization were discharged the same day of the procedure after clinical monitoring in the recovery area.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The main finding of this study identified qEASL as an early predictor of patient survival after IAT when assessing the dominant target lesion in patients with mCRC of the liver.</s><s>In addition, all anatomic methods (RECIST, WHO, vRECIST) failed to stratify patients according to tumour response and did not predict patient survival.</s><s>While achieving stratification between R and NR, the enhancement-based EASL and mRECIST failed to predict patient survival based on early follow-up MRI.</s></p><p><s>The ultimate goal of all imaging biomarkers of tumour response is the identification of NR after IAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In light of the overall dismal prognosis and a short life expectancy in the setting of salvage therapy, clinical decisions on whether or not to retreat a patient are frequently based on early imaging follow-up.</s><s>A fundamental precondition for a successful stratification between R and NR is the diagnostic accuracy of the utilized technique.</s><s>The most commonly used surrogate markers (EASL, mRECIST) have been primarily designed to simplify the assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma lesions before and after IAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>A direct translation of these techniques onto metastatic liver disease, specifically in patients with mCRC, proved inaccurate in our study and elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>This can be mainly explained by the distribution of lesion enhancement and the nature of 1D and 2D measurements.</s><s>These methods assume that 3D response to treatment occurs in a symmetrical, spherical manner.</s><s>However, most liver tumours are prone to asymmetry and frequently demonstrate inhomogeneous patterns of necrosis induced by IAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>This is particularly the case in mCRC to the liver as most patients present after several lines of systemic chemotherapy.</s><s>In these patients, baseline MRI typically demonstrates central necrosis as well as rim and segmental enhancement with scattered foci of remaining viable tumour tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>These characteristics underline the weaknesses of 1D and 2D techniques, providing the rationale for the use 3D quantitative approaches that are able to assess the entire extent of early tumour changes.</s></p><p><s>The 3D quantitative technique used in this study has several methodological strengths: First, this approach is based on a semiautomatic tumour segmentation, which enables a reproducible, radio-pathologically validated and accurate volumetric lesion assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, as opposed to fully automated segmentation techniques, a semiautomatic concept brings about the dual benefit of fast, software-based segmentation while allowing for a radiological reader to make adjustments, if necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the image subtraction step allows for the quantification of true enhancement and facilitates an accurate quantification on the enhancing tissue on portal venous phase images.</s><s>In addition, the use of an enhancement-based, 3D quantitative technique allows for this system to be translated onto other cross-sectional imaging modalities, such as cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) as well as multi-detector CT (MDCT).</s><s>This is particularly important in light of the advent of 3D quantitative intraprocedural tumour assessment on CBCT and may help overcome the limitations of inter-modality variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The patient population included in this analysis is representative of comparably designed studies regarding baseline characteristics (unresectable, liver-dominant or liver-only, chemorefractory disease) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>As for the size of the cohort, the majority of published outcome studies for this subset of patients demonstrated similar or even smaller numbers of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>The necessary exclusion criteria further reduced the sample size because they were considered pivotal for a diagnostically accurate imaging analysis.</s><s>These requirements outbalanced the desire for a slightly larger study population.</s><s>In our study population, the median OS was 7.5 months, while no significant difference in OS between cTACE and radioembolization was observed.</s><s>This result is in agreement with the available literature for this subset of patients, showing no modality-dependent differences of median OS and ranging from 6.9 to 10.5 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>As for tumour response, no consistent data is available with criteria-dependent response rates ranging from 0 to 90 % <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, all enhancement-based criteria used in our study demonstrated slightly higher response rates for radioembolization, supporting the mounting evidence for the capability of this modality to achieve local tumour control <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</s><s>However, this result must be confirmed with a prospective randomized trial in a significantly larger collective of patients.</s><s>Overall, the inclusion of patients treated with both radioembolization and TACE into the analysis underlines the strength of the 3D quantitative technique to assess treatment response in a clinically realistic cohort and validates this analysis for both modalities.</s><s>In our study, a volumetric quantification of tumour response required a definition of thresholds in order to correctly classify the patients.</s><s>Accordingly, the parameters defined for mRECIST were translated onto vRECIST and qEASL <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>However, this approach has been proven correct for hepatocellular carcinoma lesions only and lacks proper validation in metastatic liver disease.</s><s>It must be therefore noted that additional studies that will use a split-sample cross-validation approach in larger cohorts are warranted in order to identify the ultimate cut-offs.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some limitations: First, the retrospective character of this analysis prevented us from enrolling a more homogenous patient population with regard to MRI protocol, treatment modality and history of the disease.</s><s>However, this has been countered with reasonable exclusion criteria and a thorough multivariate analysis.</s><s>The multivariate analysis was even more important in a non-therapy-naïve cohort in order to exclude potential bias through other treatment modalities when predicting survival based on image analysis.</s><s>Second, our study protocol did not include the assessment of multiple target lesions.</s></p><p><s>However, several recent reports did not confirm the benefits of a multi-lesion assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, it was decided to follow a clinically practicable approach in keeping the effect of radiological measurements as low as reasonably achievable.</s><s>Third, the relatively short interval between IAT and tumour response assessment on MRI in patients treated with radioembolization can be seen as a double-edged sword with regard to the study design.</s><s>There is evidence that tumours treated with radioembolization might exhibit the maximum of imaging response after 3 months.</s><s>This happens because of the delayed and prolonged effects of radiation-based cytotoxicity and applies primarily to size-based criteria such as RECIST <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</s><s>However, tumour necrosis after radioembolization is frequently seen at earlier time points which can then result in a significant reduction of lesion enhancement, as measured in our study.</s><s>Overall, measuring tumour response after 3 months did not concur with the goal of our study which aimed at providing a technique for an early assessment of treatment response in a patient cohort with a relatively short OS.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the ability of qEASL to predict overall patient survival early after IAT provides initial evidence for the potential advantage of 3D quantitative tumour analysis in mCRC patients treated with TACE or radioembolization.</s><s>The enhanced diagnostic performance of qEASL, which leads to an improved stratification between R and NR, may very well help achieve consensus on the highly debated topic of tumour response assessment in this subset of patients.</s></p></div>
