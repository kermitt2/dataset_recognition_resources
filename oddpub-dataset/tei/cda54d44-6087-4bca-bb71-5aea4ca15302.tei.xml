<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Microparticles (MPs) are small (&lt;1 μm) cell membrane-derived vesicles that are formed in response to cellular activation or early stages of apoptosis.</s><s>Increased plasma MP levels have been associated with liver disease severity.</s><s>Here we investigated the clinical impact of ascites MPs in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p><s>Ascites and blood samples of 163 patients with cirrhosis (ascites n = 163, blood n = 31) were collected between February 2011 and December 2012.</s><s>MPs were obtained from ascites and from blood by two-step ultracentrifugation and quantified by flow cytometry.</s><s>Quantitative absolute MP levels were correlated with clinical and laboratory baseline parameters as well as patient outcomes.</s><s>Ascites microparticles were stained with antibodies against CD66b (neutrophils) and CD3 (lymphocytes) in a subgroup of 60 matched patients.</s></p><p><s>Results: MPs were detected in all ascites and blood samples.</s><s>Absolute ascites MP levels correlated with blood levels (r = 0.444, p = 0.011).</s><s>Low ascites MP levels (&lt;488.4</s><s>MP/μL) were associated with a poor 30-day survival probability (&lt;488.4</s><s>MP/μL 71.1% vs. &gt;488.4</s><s>MP/μL 94.7%, log rank p = 0.001) and such patients had a higher relative amount of ascites microparticles derived from neutrophils and lymphocytes.</s><s>Low levels of ascites MPs, high MELD score and antibiotic treatment were independent risk factors for death within 30 days.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Plasma MPs, in particular cell specific subtypes, have been investigated as novel biomarkers for several pathomechanistic processes.</s><s>We wanted to determine whether MPs are released into cirrhotic ascites in the first place and, if so, whether overall quantification levels correlate with clinical endpoints in cirrhosis.</s><s>This is the first report about ascites MPs in patients with liver cirrhosis.</s><s>Our study indicates that MPs are ubiquitously present in cirrhotic ascites.</s><s>This is in line with previous investigations that focused on MP diagnostics in ascites of patients with peritonitis and ovarian neoplasms.</s><s>Those studies have shown that MPs can be found in peritoneal fluid irrespective of the diagnostic method used (electron microscopy or flow cytometry) and of the cause of ascites <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our survival analysis emphasized the clinical relevance of absolute ascites MP levels in cirrhosis.</s><s>Patients with a cut-off level below 488.4 MP/μL died more frequently than patients with high levels (30-day survival: &lt;488.4</s><s>MP/μL 71.1% vs. &gt;488.4</s><s>MP/μL 94.7%, HR 8.571) along with the liver function and other clinical or laboratory parameters at baseline.</s><s>The high rate of liver failure causing death indicated to some extent that patients with low ascites MP levels are in the final stages of cirrhosis.</s><s>It is important to highlight that we observed an inverse correlation between ascites MP levels and patients' prognosis whereas in the literature cell-specific plasma MP levels rise with disease progression.</s><s>This might be explained by a formation of MP-associated immune complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which is a phenomenon observed in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis by using electron microscopy and a new generation of flow cytometers.</s><s>Generally, those formations are highly active and proinflammatory and probably express an inflammatory systemic reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>These complexes would have been missed with the conventional flow cytometers that we used as particle size significantly increases (&gt;1 µm) after complex formation.</s><s>We gated only particles with a diameter smaller than 1 µm, so that we cannot exclude the presence of high volume complexes.</s></p><p><s>This theory is supported by the fact that the rate of MPs derived from neutrophils and lymphocytes are much higher in patients with low ascites MP levels and associated with the severity of liver dysfunction, displayed by the MELD score.</s><s>This observation is well in line with the notion that end stage cirrhosis is accompanied by an inflammatory state <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, further prospective studies are needed to substantially clarify the missing correlation with conventional inflammatory parameters as well as the underlying relationship between ascites MPs and patient outcomes.</s><s>We suggest screening for MP complexes using new generation cytometers on the one hand and screening for further surface antigens in order to identify more cell types, which release MPs in ascites on the other hand.</s><s>Subsequently performed ex vivo cell-specific stimulation tests to produce MPs can clarify if cell exhaustion is an actual problem in the peritoneal cavity.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the amount of MP production in ascites but also in blood from patients with cirrhosis seems to be highly variable, with MP levels in ascites ranging from 17.5 to 32,575.7 MP/µL, and in blood from 301.8 to 4926.3 MP/µL.</s><s>This gives rise to at least two questions.</s><s>The first is which host factors apart from inflammatory processes influence the release of MPs.</s><s>The second is whether ascites MPs are derived from circulating blood cells or directly produced by autochthonous peritoneal cells.</s><s>The latter might explain why we not only had a weak correlation between plasma and ascites MP levels but also a considerable number of patients with ascites MP levels higher than those in plasma.</s><s>In this context it is important to emphasize that blood sample size was rather low potentially reducing its informative value.</s><s>Nevertheless, the fact that there were no true correlations of overall MP levels, both in ascites and blood, with clinical parameters and immune cell MPs were upregulated in patients with high risk of death suggests that it is worthwhile again to focus on MP subsets in order to clarify the cause of overall ascites MP loss in high risk patients and the high variability.</s><s>Notably, it is known that specific types of circulating MPs are involved in pathogenic processes such as endothelial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr"

growing evidence that plasma MPs reflect disease severity in chronic liver diseases.</s><s>Korneck et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> investigated 67 patients with fatty liver disease and 42 patients with chronic hepatitis C and compared them to healthy individuals in terms of immune cell-derived plasma MP levels.</s><s>We evaluated stem cell-derived plasma MP levels in acute as well as acute-on-chronic liver failure in rodents and humans (n = 10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Both studies showed that relative levels of immune cell-and stem cell-derived MPs

retrospective evaluation of all clinical data, some values were missing.</s><s>Specific information concerning cause of death was not available for 9 of 31 patients who died during the observational period.</s><s>Although the PMN count in ascitic fluid is the diagnostic gold standard for SBP, we used the Engelmann et al.</s><s><ref type="bibr">J Transl Med (2017)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">15:188</ref> ascites leukocyte count, because the ascites cell count could not be differentiated during the sample collection period.</s><s>This might be a source of inaccuracy in terms of the relevance of infectious complications.</s><s>However, the total leukocyte count has also been evaluated as a reliable diagnostic mean for SBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, ascites samples have not been centrifuged before freezing.</s><s>Variation in temperature make cells (erythrocytes and leukocytes) explode and release membranes resembling MPs.</s><s>However, cells and fragments of cells were removed by the first centrifugation step.</s><s>If remaining cells had an influence on MP levels in our setting, we should have found a high correlation of the ascites leucocyte count with the MP levels, which is not the case.</s><s>It is unclear as to whether MP levels correlated with the amount of ascites as a high ascites volume might be associated with low MP concentrations and vice versa.</s><s>However, this parameters has not been documented.</s><s>The fact that we were able to detect surface antigens from the original cell emphasizes that true MPs and not debris was captured by flow cytometry in ascitic fluid.</s></p></div>
