<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>This cross sectional study is the first using N 2 -washout and the LCI to assess peripheral airway function in children, adolescents    The LCI discriminates between patients with AATD and healthy controls, reflects AATD related lung disease in all stages and detects initial lung changes in younger age and more often than spirometry.</s><s>Increased LCIs were not only present in patients with a PI-ZZ genotype but also in individuals with other, less severe PI-types.</s></p><p><s>For interpretation of N 2 -washout measurements in AATD, a concomitant control group was required.</s><s>In accordance with an ongoing discussion about how to define a realistic reference population for lung function assessments, our current reference data collection on N 2 -washout includes individuals with a history of active and/or passive tobacco smoke exposure and a history of acute respiratory tract infections (e.g. a single pneumonia) but excluded individuals with diagnosed chronic lung diseases and prematurity.</s><s>For the present analysis, only individuals with no history of active and/or passive tobacco smoke exposure and/or a history of severe acute respiratory diseases were selected because we aimed to detect early disease in AATD.</s><s>This selection may overestimate lung changes but is in accordance with previously published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are a number of studies which have demonstrated that the LCI remains relatively stable independent of age.</s><s>We therefore felt it to be appropriate to rely on the smaller control group with the advantage to use very strict inclusion criteria for better discrimination.</s><s>This resulted in a lower number of older controls.</s><s>However when using reference data published by Verbanck et al., who has demonstrated a small increase of LCI with age after the 3rd decade in controls, LCI shifts from normal to slightly abnormal in only 7 patients.</s><s>This does not alter the overall message.</s></p><p><s>In accordance with other studies the majority of our study population had a normal FEV 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> However, almost 40% of these had an increased LCI, which increased with age.</s><s>This supports the view that development of AATD related VI begins within the smaller airways and increases over the following years towards the larger airways.</s><s>Therefore parameters derived from spirometry, representing the more central airways, remain largely unaffected over decades.</s><s>In our population LCI was abnormal starting in early school age.</s><s>In contrast FEV 1 was normal until the end of the fourth decade except for one adolescent with a history of severe lower respiratory tract infections and two children with reduced lung volumes but normal FEV 1 /FVC.</s><s>The fact that none of the patients had normal LCI results in the presence of an abnormal FEV 1 emphasises the idea of consecutive involvement of more peripheral airways first, followed by more central airways.</s><s>Accordingly Holme et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> reported worse gas transfer and health status in nonindex subjects already from age 16 and additional impaired CT densitometry from age 29 while spirometry remained normal.</s><s>Bernspång et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> reported ongoing normal spirometry in young adults with AATD despite clinical symptoms.</s><s>We therefore postulate that VI is a better marker than FEV 1 for detecting and monitoring early lung changes in AATD <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>However, to further investigate this hypothesis, longitudinal assessment of VI in patients with normal spirometry at study start is necessary.</s></p><p><s>Patients diagnosed with AATD during childhood or non-index subjects may benefit from longitudinal lung function assessments including N 2 -washout.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that longitudinal assessment of lung function in young asymptomatic patients allows predicting future progression to some extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Detection and monitoring of early pulmonary changes may motivate to adhere to preventive recommendations (e.g.</s><s>avoidance of tobacco smoke and other pollutants, choice of employment).</s><s>In patients with advanced lung disease additional measurement of the LCI may help to investigate treatment effects.</s></p><p><s>In accordance to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, both, active and passive smoking influence lung function in patients with AATD.</s><s>However, severe lung disease was also present in never-smokers.</s><s>This may be explained by other triggers such as concurrent asthma or pollutant exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>It was previously shown, that in never-smokers with AATD lung impairment measured by gas transfer and CT densitometry occurs but is delayed in time when compared to smokers with A1ATD.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Current knowledge about lung disease in other than PI-ZZ genotypes is limited.</s><s>However, available data suggest that there is a risk for lung disease which manifestates later in life and which is triggered by e.g.</s><s>cigarette smoke and/or air pollutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Seersholm et al. stated, that fist degree relatives of PI-ZZ indexsubjects with a PI-MZ genotype have a familial tendency to develop COPD which is due to unknown genetic and/or environmental factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>The risk for emphysema in patients with a PI-SZ genotype remains unclear but is expected to be as high as in patients with a PI-ZZ genotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, almost half of the adults with other than a PI-ZZ genotype had increased LCIs while only one fifth had an impaired FEV 1 .</s><s>No one had an abnormal FEV 1 with a normal LCI.</s><s>68% of this subgroup had a history of active and/or passive tobacco smoke exposure but the proportion of abnormal LCI results was slightly lower than in the group of never smokers (44% and 53% respectively).</s><s>Interpretation of this observation is limited because the groups are small thus prohibiting a more extended analysis.</s><s>However, it may be stated that individuals with other than PI-ZZ genotypes require professional attention due to their potential risk to develop AATD related lung disease too.</s></p><p><s>The study has several limitations:</s></p><p><s>We have not been able to include imaging and/or measurements of inflammatory markers as reference methods allowing formal assessment of the sensitivity of the LCI for AATD related airway obstruction.</s><s>It could be argued that DLCO should have been measured as A1AT deficiency may lead to emphysematous changes.</s><s>However, the study was carried out in different sites and DLCO measurements were not feasible in most sites.</s><s>We therefore cannot answer the question, whether DLCO is better than spirometry for detecting early A1ATD related changes.</s></p><p><s>Matching of the control group to the patients according to age, risk factors and life style would have been ideal.</s><s>However, the normal range of the LCI is narrow and almost stable over a large part of child-and adulthood.</s><s>We therefore found it appropriate to recruit a healthy control group over approximately a similar age span.</s></p><p><s>Patient characteristics were partly derived from open questionnaires and the study population is heterogeneous with regard to age and mode of diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>Both, support from the German Alpha-1-Registry, and the multicentre study design allowed recruitment of the study population from all registered patients living in Germany.</s><s>However, only few participants between 20 and 35 years of age could be recruited who may have been patients with more severe disease.</s><s>This could explain the disproportional increase of the LCI in this age range (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Asymptomatic adolescents and young adults are patients generally diagnosed during early childhood who have grown out of paediatric care.</s><s>Those who no longer have hepatic problems are commonly not transferred to an adult clinic and may therefore have been missed by our study.</s><s>However, this subpopulation could be the most important to further investigate onset and progression of early lung disease in AATD.</s></p><p><s>In addition, the present study design cannot demonstrate that all patients with abnormal LCI will develop FEV 1 changes and clinical lung disease; whether an elevated LCI in children precedes clinical lung disease in patients with AATD has to be assessed in longitudinal follow-up studies.</s></p><p><s>In summary this study presents a unique collection of cross sectional lung function data in AATD, including different genotypes and all stages of lung disease.</s><s>The study provides novel data on ventilation inhomogeneity using multiple breath washout which supports the hypothesis that pulmonary changes in AATD are present when spirometry is still normal.</s></p><p><s>We conclude that LCI measured by N 2 -washout reflects known AATD related lung disease in all stages and detects manifestation at a younger age and more often than spirometry.</s><s>Abnormal spirometry does not exclude presence of AATD related lung disease, even in other than PI-ZZ genotypes.</s></p><p><s>AATD may serve as an example for a well defined sub-group of patients with COPD.</s><s>We speculate that N 2 -washout for assessment of VI will be helpful to better understand early pulmonary changes in other forms of COPD.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 2
