<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS</head><p><s>In this multicenter study, a retrospective analysis on institutional databases from five participating international centers was performed.</s><s>The study included consecutive patients with sporadic stage IV GEP-NENs (according to the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society [ENETS] tumor-node-metastasis staging system) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> diagnosed at the participating centers (i.e., Rome, Milan, Berlin, Marburg, and Graz) from 2000 to 2015.</s></p><p><s>Patients with familial syndromes (type I multiple endocrine neoplasia, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome), as well as patients without measurable advanced disease or without available radiological or histological data (Ki67 index) required to assess the ENETS grading and staging, were excluded.</s><s>The time of inclusion in the study was at first diagnosis of stage IV disease such as (a) at initial histological diagnosis for patients with metastatic disease and (b) the time of first evidence of distant metastases identified during follow-up in patients without previous metastases.</s><s>Data were prospectively collected at the centers that treated the patients with metastatic disease, a uniform computerized datasheet was created, and data were analyzed retrospectively.</s></p><p><s>Therapeutic approaches were not standardized, and thus different treatments were used at each center.</s><s>However, at all participating centers, the therapeutic approaches and their sequence were always discussed within a multidisciplinary team.</s><s>Therefore, patients were enrolled independently from the therapeutic protocol that had been performed.</s><s>Moreover, no prospectively planned follow-up programs were standardized at the participating centers, but they all followed the ENETS standards of care for advanced GEP-NENs follow-up as appropriate in each respective center <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Histological diagnosis was confirmed in all tumors, which were classified according to the WHO 2010 classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Specimens were revised in those tumors diagnosed before the WHO 2010 classification introduction and examined by an experienced referral pathologist handling NEN specimens at each participating center's pathological institute.</s><s>Patients were arbitrarily classified into three different categories according to the proportion of metastatic liver involvement, as assessed by conventional radiological examinations (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) by measuring hepatic tumor volume: no liver metastases present or metastatic liver involvement &lt;25%; metastatic liver involvement 25%-50%; metastatic liver involvement &gt;50%.</s></p><p><s>According to the relevant local legislation, the study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of each participating center, and informed consent for data collection was obtained from all patients.</s></p><p><s>The primary end point considered was progression-free survival (PFS), which was defined as the interval between diagnosis of stage IV GEP-NENs and time of progressive disease (PD), or patient death, whichever occurred first.</s><s>Disease progression during follow-up was assessed by conventional radiological examinations, and evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>When appropriate, additional data from functional imaging procedures (somatostatin receptors scintigraphy, 68-Gallium positron emission tomography) were also evaluated to assess the disease behavior.</s></p><p><s>The distribution of continuous variables was reported as the median and interquartile range (IQR;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The present study shows that, when diagnosing stage IV GEP-NENs, it is possible to obtain a score to quantify the risk of PD by combining the predictive role of Ki67, the extension of liver metastases, and the presence of extra-abdominal lesions.</s><s>This tool is able to provide a graded measure of the likelihood for each individual patient to experience PD and may thus help physicians dealing with GEP-NENs to plan the therapeutic sequence and follow-up program.</s></p><p><s>Over the last decade, few papers have investigated the possible impact of combined risk factors on NENs clinical outcome.</s><s>An immunohistochemical prognostic score has been recently proposed by combining Ki67 with other biomarkers to predict the risk of recurrence in pancreatic NENs after radical resection, suggesting that the combination of these factors may have a higher predictive ability in comparison with each single factor alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, different from this study, that analysis was based on a panel of immunohistochemical factors (N-myc downstream-regulated gen-1, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase, and Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 3), thus being difficult to apply to the daily clinical practice.</s><s>Furthermore, it was performed in a different setting and included a lower number of patients (n 5 92) with pancreatic primaries only who had previously undergone radical surgery with the intent to predict the risk of recurrence.</s></p><p><s>An additional attempt to provide a mathematical-based predictive model was done in small intestine NENs by Modlin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> by a retrospective analysis of previously published literature regarding risk factors and gastrointestinal NENs and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) SEER database .</s><s>That analysis identified several demographic, pathological, biochemical, and clinical variables that, if combined together in a nomogram tool, were proposed to be able to quantify the risk of death.</s><s>Nevertheless, there are several differences as compared with the present study: (a) the risk factor analysis was performed by pooling data from other studies, published during a long period of time (1997-2010); (b) the NCI SEER database was used to assess survival data; (c) it was performed on small intestine NENs only; and (d) the main aim was to assess the risk of death, instead of the risk of progression.</s><s>Finally, a different methodological approach was used (nomogram model versus prognostic index model).</s><s>Consequently, a reliable comparison between the two studies is not feasible.</s></p><p><s>Another study suggested to stratify metastatic GEP-NENs into different subgroups according to the coexistence of clinical and pathological features, such as age, number of liver metastases, tumor slope, and initial surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Based on the number of these prognostic factors, a different probability of survival was reported, again suggesting to consider more than a single variable when approaching risk factors analysis in GEP-NENs.</s><s>Nevertheless, this finding was again drawn from a relatively small population (n 5 118), before the actual NEN WHO 2010 classification was published <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and with few data on Ki67 (available in 50 patients only), which is to date widely considered the most important risk factor for poor prognosis in NENs.</s><s>On the contrary, as a result of the cooperation of five referral centers for NEN management, a large population including 283 patients with stage IV GEP-NENs with available data on Ki67 and accurate disease staging was collected in the present study, allowing us to obtain an easy-to-use tool that was effective in stratifying the risk of PD based on data that are usually available, such as Ki67 and disease extension.</s></p><p><s>According to the literature, Ki67 was confirmed to be a strong independent predictor for poor clinical outcome in terms of both PD and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Ki67, as continuous variable instead of categorical variable as in the G grading system, was chosen in order to keep its predictive power and to overcome the limitations of the cut-off levels used to discriminate between different categories, as well as that of different origin of the neoplasm.</s><s>Another expected risk factor was the presence of distant extra-abdominal metastases, which, again, correlated with a worse prognosis, as previously reported by several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As a novel additional finding, the degree of liver involvement expressed as the proportion of liver metastatic disease (0%-25% versus 25%-50% versus &gt;50%) was able to significantly stratify patients into three different subgroups, with an increasing risk of progression (25%-50% HR 1.50 and &gt;50% HR 1.58 versus 0%-25% in the multivariate model).</s><s>Because a standardized stratification of liver tumor burden in NENs is lacking, different percentage values have been used by several studies investigating response to therapies and patients' survival, with some of them arbitrarily proposing

10% <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>However, this feature represents a major issue in the clinical practice and should also be considered in clinical trial designs.</s><s>In fact, most of the recent randomized control trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> have confirmed the importance of hepatic tumour load as a prognostic factor in subgroup analyses, but the proportion of liver involvement has not been a stratification factor so far.</s><s>Also, the updated ENETS guidelines suggest to consider the tumor burden when approaching NEN patients with unresectable metastatic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>On these bases, a risk score based on the combination of Ki67 and the tumor burden could help select the patients in whom an early aggressive therapeutic approach is recommended.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the choice of using PD instead of survival as the main outcome is based on the evidence that PFS is a more practical and recommended end point commonly used in recent trials, as previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The ability of the proposed risk score to discriminate between patients who did and did not experience PD was higher in comparison with that obtained by using the G grading stratification alone in the same set of patients, as confirmed by the ROC analysis, AUCs being 0.705 and 0.622, respectively (p 5 .013).</s><s>This confirms the good accuracy of the risk score in comparison with a welldefined prognostic tool such the G grading system.</s></p><p><s>As far as the primary tumor is concerned, a trend towards a higher predictive ability of the risk score was observed in pancreatic NENs in comparison with non-pancreatic NENs (AUC 0.728 and 0.662, respectively), confirming the well-known difference, in terms of tumor behavior, deriving from the different primary tumor site <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>However, the pancreatic site did not retain its independent role when multivariate model was performed, and thus it was not included in the score.</s><s>This figure, which seems to disagree with a number of previous observations, may be due to the heterogeneity of primary tumors in the group of non-pancreatic NENs, which also included NENs that, when metastatic, are usually related to worse outcome, such as gastric (type III), duodenal, and colorectal primaries.</s><s>Furthermore, it has been reported that the impact of the primary tumor site seems to decrease in the setting of advanced disease, when other factors might play a major prognostic role <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the loss of statistical significance of the variable "pancreatic primary site" may be related to its correlation with the distribution of patients according to the grading system (73.1% of grade 1 neuroendocrine tumors were nonpancreatic, 83.8% of grade 3 neuroendocrine carcinomas were pancreatic).</s></p><p><s>The present study has some limitations, mainly related to the study design.</s><s>Although data were collected by referral centers for the management of NENs, they were analyzed retrospectively.</s><s>This may represent an inherent limitation in terms of therapeutic approaches received by the patients and possible different timing and method of follow-up programs performed by each center, which was limited by involving only referral centers with documented long-term experience for NEN patients' management.</s><s>For these reasons, the direct impact of medical treatments on disease progression could not be assessed.</s><s>Furthermore, as with any prognostic score, the one proposed in the present study needs to be validated in a population different from the one from which it was derived.</s><s>An internal validation in the same data set by identifying different subgroups and/or by performing cross validation does not seem feasible due to the relatively small sample size and the likely risk to lose accuracy.</s><s>Thus, an external validation, ideally in a prospective setting, is required to provide the evidence that the proposed risk score is transportable or generalizable to other NEN populations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>The present study shows that in the setting of advanced, stage IV GEP-NENs, it is possible to obtain a risk score able to predict PD by combining the specific prognostic weight of the following three factors: Ki67 value, proportion of metastatic liver involvement, and presence of extra-abdominal metastases.</s><s>The score is an easy-to-use tool that may help physicians dealing with GEP-NENs to discriminate subgroups of patients with different risk of progression in order to plan tailored therapeutic approaches and specific follow-up programs as well as to select homogeneous groups of patients for future clinical trials.</s><s>A validation in a prospective setting is needed to understand the real impact of the risk score in the management of GEP-NENs patients with advanced disease.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Progression-free survival (PFS) in 283 patients with stage IV gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms.</s><s>Median PFS: 18 months.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,62.42,295.94,229.99,161.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
