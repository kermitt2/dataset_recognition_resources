<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Clinical trials are the hallmark of evidence-based medicine, but recruitment is often challenging, especially in stroke trials investigating patients not being able to give informed consent.</s><s>In some nations, ethics committees will not approve of inclusion in a clinical study via consent of a legal representative.</s><s>The ethical dilemma of including or excluding those patients has not been properly addressed, as there is little data on the effect of stroke characteristics on the ability to give informed consent.</s></p><p><s>Methods: To examine differences between patients able and unable to consent at inclusion to an acute stroke trial, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of monitoring records from a multicentric interventional trial.</s><s>These records listed patients who gave informed consent by themselves and those who needed a legal representative to do so.</s><s>This exemplary STRAWINSKI trial aimed at improving stroke outcome by biomarker-guided antibiotic treatment of stroke associated pneumonia and included patients within 40 h after stroke onset, suffering from MCA infarctions with an NIHSS score &gt; 9 at admission.</s><s>Standard descriptive and associative statistics were calculated to compare baseline characteristics and outcome measures between patients who were able to consent and those who were not.</s><s>Results: We identified the person giving consent in 228 out of 229 subjects.</s><s>Patients with inability to consent were older (p &lt; 0.01), suffered from more left-hemispheric (p &lt; 0.01) and more severe strokes (NIHSS, p &lt; 0.01), were more likely to die during hospitalisation (p &lt; 0.01) or have unfavourable outcome at discharge (mRS, p &lt; 0.01), to develop fever (p &lt; 0.01) and tended to be more susceptible to infections (p = 0.06) during the acute course of the disorder.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions: Demographics, stroke characteristics and outcomes significantly affect stroke patients in their ability to consent.</s><s>Where selection criteria and primary outcome measures of a trial are significantly affected by ability to consent, excluding patients unable to consent might be unethical.</s></p><p><s>Trial registration: URL http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.</s><s>Unique identifier: NCT01264549.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In order to improve future stroke care, clinical trials will remain at the core of scientific progress.</s><s>A key issue for succeeding in these is the selection of a patient population representative for "real world" stroke care.</s><s>However, including patients unable to give informed consent personally is an ethically challenging issue, faced with different regulations in different countries or even between federal states <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Some countries developed a framework by which acute treatment can be applied in emergency conditions by waiver of consent <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we explored whether exclusion of patients unable to consent would lead to a selection bias in basic demographics and classic stroke characteristics as well as in typical outcome parameters.</s></p><p><s>Our main findings are: 1) Patients able to consent were younger and had less severe strokes in term of clinical syndrome and functional deficit compared to patients unable to consent in an informed manner.</s><s>2) Location of infarction was strongly associated with the incapability to consent, most probably reflecting aphasia and unconsciousness.</s><s>3) Patients being able to consent had a higher level of pre-stroke functional independence and were more likely to live at home at the time of event.</s><s>4) Patients not being able to consent more frequently developed fever and infections and were more likely to have unfavourable outcome or even die in the course of the disorder.</s></p><p><s>These findings corroborate previous reports demonstrating stroke severity and localisation of infarction  being strongly associated with ability to consent.</s><s>Patients unable to consent are known to have higher admission NIHSS and mRS scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Similar to the presented study, the IST-3 investigators analysed the first 300 included patients and their consenting documents, and found stroke severity, type of clinical syndrome (motor deficit, dysphasia and/or visuospatial disorder) and infarct localization to show significant differences depending on ability to consent <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In a further analysis the consenting procedure was analysed in an academic stroke centre across several acute stroke studies the centre participated in.</s><s>Again, greater age and greater stroke severity as measured by Scandinavian Stroke Scale were associated with inability to consent <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are some limitations to this study: firstly, the results need to be interpreted with caution since we have performed this analysis in a post-hoc manner and the ability to consent was evaluated retrospectively from consenting sheets.</s><s>Thus, we cannot rule out that patients gave their consent orally and next-of-kins signed as witnesses.</s><s>Secondly, while we could analyse a robust sample size, larger cohorts are needed to explore further associations for different endpoints in other fields of stroke research with a higher statistical power.</s><s>However, the strengths of our study are the complete data monitoring and the interventional trial setting.</s><s>To our knowledge this is the second clinical trial in stroke research presenting differences within its cohort based on ability to consent, and the first to present it from its total cohort instead of an interim report.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Stroke patients' ability to consent in an informed manner to participate in a clinical study depends on several demographic factors and stroke characteristics.</s><s>Location of infarction, severity of stroke and functional outcome scales differ significantly between patients able or unable to give consent.</s><s>Clinical researchers investigating acute stroke in general and post-stroke immunity and infections in particular as well as ethics review boards deciding on trial protocols need to consider that patients with inability to consent are more frequently aphasic, more severely affected, older, and more likely to develop fever and infections.</s><s>We recommend bearing those differences in mind when planning selection criteria for future clinical trials.</s><s>If (primary) outcome measures of a trial are affected by this selection bias, it appears unethical to exclude patients unable to consent.</s><s>An international political and legal framework i.e. embedded within the International Conference on Harmonisation would be immensely helpful to address this issue.</s></p></div>
