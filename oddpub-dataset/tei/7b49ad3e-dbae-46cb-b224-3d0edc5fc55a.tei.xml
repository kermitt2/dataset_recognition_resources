<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>In aging individuals, both protective as well as regulatory immune functions are declining, resulting in an increased susceptibility to infections as well as to autoimmunity.</s><s>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 2-deficiency in immune cell subsets has been shown to be associated with aging.</s><s>Using intravital marker-free NAD(P) H-fluorescence lifetime imaging, we have previously identified microglia/myeloid cells and astrocytes as main cellular sources of NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity in the CNS during neuroinflammation, due to an overactivation of NOX.</s><s>The overactivated NOX enzymes catalyze the massive production of the highly reactive O − 2 , which initiates in a chain reaction the overproduction of diverse reactive oxygen species (ROS).</s><s>Agedependent oxidative distress levels in the brain and their cellular sources are not known.</s><s>Furthermore, it is unclear whether in age-dependent diseases oxidative distress is initiated by overproduction of ROS or by a decrease in antioxidant capacity, subsequently leading to neurodegeneration in the CNS.</s><s>Here, we compare the activation level of NOX enzymes in the cerebral cortex of young and aged mice as well as in a model of vascular amyloid pathology.</s><s>Despite the fact that a striking change in the morphology of microglia can be detected between young and aged individuals, we find comparable low-level NOX activation both in young and old mice.</s><s>In contrast, aged mice with the human APP E693Q mutation, a model for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), displayed increased focal NOX overactivation in the brain cortex, especially in tissue areas around the vessels.</s><s>Despite activated morphology in microglia, NOX overactivation was detected only in a small fraction of these cells, in contrast to other pathologies with overt inflammation as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or glioblastoma.</s><s>Similar to these pathologies, the astrocytes majorly contribute to the NOX overactivation in the brain cortex during CAA.</s><s>Together, these findings emphasize the role of other cellular sources of activated NOX than phagocytes not only during EAE but also in models of amyloid pathology.</s><s>Moreover, they may strengthen the hypothesis that microglia/monocytes show a diminished potential for clearance of amyloid beta protein.</s></p><p><s>inTrODUcTiOn Following the free-radical theory of aging, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are massively produced, e.g., &gt;100 nM H2O2, and attack their targets in the organism randomly, indiscriminative and cumulative, thus, generating oxidative distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Oxidative distress is a general term for the dysfunction of signaling and defense mechanisms based on ROS.</s></p><p><s>As several ROS are highly reactive, their localization is crucial for the resulting effects: on the one hand, ROS act as specific signaling molecules intracellularly at ~1-10 nM concentration, on the other hand, they constitute effective extracellular host defense mechanisms at concentrations over 100 nM.</s><s>Since the organism has efficient mechanisms to neutralize high ROS concentrations, e.g., via glutathione peroxidase or superoxide dismutase (2), these phenomena are physiological and can be summarized under the term "oxidative eustress" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>The enzymes of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family, consisting of NOX1, NOX2 (phox), NOX3, NOX4, DUOX1, DUOX2 (3), are central players leading both to oxidative eustress and distress.</s><s>Their activation catalyzes the oxidative burst when abundant highly reactive O 2 − is produced by oxidation of molecular oxygen.</s><s>Under enzymatic catalysis, O 2 − reacts with various small molecules leading to massive ROS production.</s><s>When this massive ROS production exceeds the capacities of antioxidant defense mechanisms of the tissue or when extracellular highly reactive ROS species such as H2O2 enter the cells via peroxiporins such as AQP8 (4), oxidative distress occurs, leading to tissue dysfunction and damage.</s><s>It is assumed that oxidative distress responsiveness is linked to aging.</s><s>However, this hypothesis is mainly funded on genetic studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, which allow conclusions on the expression levels, but not on the actual activation of these central enzymes.</s></p><p><s>Here, we focus on NADPH oxidase enzyme activation levels in the brain, as this organ is especially vulnerable to oxidative distress.</s><s>There is evidence that the aged brain is more susceptible to injuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>This is mainly attributed to a so-called activated basal state of low-grade chronic inflammation that has been called "inflamm-aging" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Low-grade inflammation in aging is also associated with microgliosis; however, the function of microglia in this process is highly discussed as studies using cell morphology, protein expression, cellular dynamics, or ex vivo cytokine production could detect age-dependent differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>.</s><s>No information on the age-dependent oxidative distress levels and their cellular sources in situ are available.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we determine NADPH oxidase activation levels in the context of amyloid pathology, in order to investigate age-dependent, immune-mediated tissue damaging mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.</s><s>We hypothesize that an age-dependent dysregulation of immune responses in the CNS contributes to neuroinflammatory processes associated with neurodegeneration.</s><s>ROS have been implicated in mediating age-dependent changes and promoting age-dependent neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, oxidative distress has been regarded as an early sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, although the source of ROS and the mechanisms how amyloid peptides (Aβ) influence oxidative distress have not been adequately investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Subunits of NOX2 are upregulated in patients with mild cognitive impairment compared to normal age-matched controls.</s><s>During disease progression, a further increase of the cytosolic subunits p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox could be detected in the CNS tissue.</s><s>In addition, there was a robust correlation between NOX subunit expression and the individual's cognitive status <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Together, this suggests that increases in NOX activity participate in early AD pathogenesis and contribute to AD progression due to massive ROS production initiated by NADPH oxidases, activating signaling pathways leading to neuronal excitotoxicity and glial cell-mediated inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although many studies claim to analyze NOX activity, only limited information can be gained based on the analysis of subunit expression levels.</s><s>The quantification of ROS levels in tissue has been widely used.</s><s>However, the highly diffusive nature of ROS does not allow to draw conclusions on their origin in tissues.</s><s>Up to now, neither the catalytic activity of NOX enzymes leading to oxidative distress nor their cellular sources could be tracked in vivo.</s><s>We therefore use our previously published marker-free method of intravital fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of NAD(P)H ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) to analyze the distribution and cellular source of NADPH oxidase activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15)</ref>.</s><s>Since activated NOX enzymes are membrane-bound and can be detected by FLIM, this technique allows for an unambiguous identification of the cellular source of massive ROS production.</s></p></div>
