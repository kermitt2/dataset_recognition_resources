<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background and Objectives: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a behavioral therapy that targets psychological flexibility, has been shown to be efficacious across a wide range of problems, including chronic work-related stress and perceived stress.</s><s>ACT's effect on the multiple levels of the acute stress response (i.e., subjective and biological) is less well understood.</s><s>The aim of the current study was to test whether ACT, by working toward psychological flexibility, would reduce both the endocrine and subjective evaluations of participants' acute stress response.</s></p><p><s>Methods: Participants (n = 35) were randomized to an ACT condition or waitlist (WL).</s><s>Participants in the ACT condition received a two-day ACT workshop on how to flexibly deal with stress.</s><s>All participants completed a standardized laboratory stress test.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>The ACT and WL groups did not differ on main comparisons of the endocrine response (i.e., cortisol) or subjective evaluation.</s><s>Baseline levels of psychological flexibility moderated some outcomes.</s><s>Avoidant participants had a stronger endocrine stress reaction if they received the ACT intervention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations:</head><p><s>The control condition was a WL and not an active intervention comparison.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>ACT is not useful in reducing the acute stress response and may even be iatrogenic, at least during tasks with little real-world impact for their personal values.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>COMMITMENT BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT TRAINING</head><p><s>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a behavioral therapy that aims to promote psychological flexibility.</s><s>Psychological flexibility (PF) refers to a range of inter-and intra-personal skills that can be defined as the ability to "recognize and adapt to various situational demands; shift mindsets or behavioral repertoires when these strategies compromise personal or social functioning; maintain balance among important life domains; and be aware, open, and committed to behaviors that are congruent with deeply held values 1 " <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kashdan &amp; Rottenberg, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>ACT-based interventions have been tested in over 100 randomized controlled trials and demonstrated efficacy across a breadth of mental disorders ranging from anxiety and depression to psychotic disorders and behavioral health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ruiz, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Evidence suggests that ACT-based interventions are also useful in areas not traditionally associated with cognitive behavioral interventions, including such varied things as reducing the frequency of epileptic seizures <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lundgren, Dahl, Melin, &amp; Kies, 2006)</ref>, decreasing rehospitalization following in schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bach &amp; Hayes, 2002)</ref>, and improving outcomes in treatment-resistant patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Clarke, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gloster, Sonntag, et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Built upon a basic behavioral account of cognition and verbal relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dymond &amp;

Wilson, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>For example, an ACT approach might try to increase PF by helping someone to be open to and nonjudgmentally notice stressors and to hold stress-related evaluations lightly, while simultaneously taking steps towards what is genuinely important to them.</s><s>By altering one's relationship with the stressor via the processes that comprise PF, the subjective meaning and impact of the stressor changes from something that must be eliminated to something that is now longer a barrier, even if the stressor remains uncomfortable.</s><s>PF can thus be viewed as the opposite of experiential avoidance.</s></p><p><s>Meditational and laboratory studies suggest that PF is an active and salient process involved in changes of functioning and symptoms <ref type="bibr">(Gloster et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Levin, Hildebrandt, Lillis, &amp; Hayes, 2012</ref>).</s><s>Among these, several studies have examined the impact of ACT on stress-related outcomes, including experimental stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Levin, Hildebrandt, et al., 2012)</ref> and more chronic workplace stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bond, Flaxman, &amp;

Chancellor-Freeland, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The values clarification group had a significantly lower cortisol response to the standardized stress test than the control group.</s><s>We are unaware of any study that administered all aspects of the ACT model in the form of PF training (as opposed to isolating only values) in order to test the effect on the subjective and biological stress response in a standardized situation.</s></p><p><s>Considering other psychotherapeutic approaches, a number of randomizedcontrolled trials have found cognitive-behavioral as well as resource-orientated stress management trainings to effectively reduce cortisol stress responses in participants two weeks to four months after the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gaab et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammerfald et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Storch, Gaab, Kuttel, Stussi, &amp;

Orsillo, 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Results based on the current sample may suggest a moderating effect of psychological flexibility, in that participants who were high in experiential avoidance prior to the intervention tended to remain so, but the subgroup of participants high in psychological flexibility at baseline showed a trend for more improvement on this construct as well as an reduced cortisol stress response.</s><s>At least in this non treatmentseeking population it appears that the intervention might only be effective in exacting change for those participants who already began the study at a more flexible level.</s><s>For those that were more experientially avoidant, this short intervention was not effective over the short time frame or during the analogue laboratory task.</s></p><p><s>Analyses also suggested that if the ACT intervention has any effect on the biological level of the acute stress reaction, then it might actually accentuate the cortisol response.</s><s>For participants in the control condition who did not receive the intervention, those who had a tendency to experientially avoid had a lower stress response than those high in flexibility.</s><s>In comparison, the opposite effect was observed for those participants who received the ACT intervention.</s><s>Here, participants with a tendency to be experientially avoidant had a higher cortisol response.</s><s>Thus, participants high in flexibility did not differ much between the intervention and control groups, whereas participants high in experiential avoidance had a higher cortisol response if they received the ACT intervention (i.e., those that didn't receive the intervention had a pronounced lower response).</s><s>In the short run, it appears that participants who tend to avoid may benefit from this stance in the face of an acute analogue stressor.</s><s>This "protective" factor of avoiding is not visible in participants who had the ACT intervention, perhaps because ACT encourages one to be present with and open up to stress and other uncomfortable feelings.</s><s>Whereas that may be good in the long term, in the short term it may not be helpful, at least in the face of an acute stressor with little real-world impact for their personal values.</s></p><p><s>Two previous studies have examined whether a single component of the ACT model (i.e., values) could alter the acute cortisol stress response to a standardized stress test.</s><s>In one study writing about one's most important personal value resulted in a lower cortisol response than writing about a less important value <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Creswell et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>In a second study, clarifying values led to a lower cortisol response than engaging in trivia test <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gregg et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with our findings, Gregg et al.</s></p><p><s>found that for the subset of participants that actually used the values exercise during the stress challenge (i.e., TSST) this was associated with a stronger cortisol response.</s></p><p><s>These two previous studies suggest that focusing on values has an observable effect on the biological stress response, and the effect may be different for some subgroups.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, it appears that administering the whole ACT model to a non treatment-seeking sample rendered the intervention either ineffective or even iatrogenic for this standardized stress situation.</s><s>The previous studies differed from our study in that their interventions were administered immediately before the standardized stress test.</s><s>In contrast, we administered the intervention as a multi-day workshop consistent with studies examining whole therapy packages <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gaab, et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gaab et al., 2006)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gaab et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gaab et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hammerfald et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Storch et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>These interventions have in common that they attempt to reduce one's stress response, for example via reappraisal.</s><s>The ACT approach differs in that acceptance (i.e., being non-judgmentally open) of one's reaction in the face of a stressor serves the purpose of facilitating contact with one's values.</s><s>In the face of acute stress, attempts to reduce the stress via antecedent regulation as is targeted in CBT and other therapies may be more adaptive in the short run <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gross &amp; John, 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the present study included both the subjective evaluations and This study has several limitations.</s><s>First, the comparison condition was a WL</s></p><p><s>and not an active intervention that have previously demonstrated effects in this standardized procedure.</s><s>Second, the participants were students seeking course credit and not individuals seeking clinical care.</s><s>Whereas previous studies have documented effects in this population and the participants in this study had an equivalent stress response, the ACT model may be more effective in exacting change when suffering and a paucity of valued behaviors are present.</s><s>Third, whereas the sample size was comparable with previous studies and based on an a-priori power analysis, it was limited in statistical power to detect small effects.</s><s>Mitigating this concern somewhat are the significant results observed in the targeted moderator analyses.</s><s>Finally, the study did not assess the participant's objective performance during the standardized stress situation or the degree to which they "internalized" the intervention.</s><s>Although this too is consistent with previous studies, the lack of such measurements precludes us from making statements on the important distinction between the stress reaction and how one copes with the stress reaction.</s><s>That is, any advantages gained from the ACT intervention on how to respond to stress in terms of engaging in the task at hand were not assessed.</s></p><p><s>These limitations notwithstanding, this study shows that applying the complete ACT model to an acute stress situation may not be useful in reducing the biological or subjective responses.</s><s>Whereas being present, opening up psychologically, and engaging in valued directions is clearly advantageous in the long-run (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Gloster, Sonntag, et al., 2015)</ref>, in the short-term results observed in this</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Increasing acceptance and willingness, thus being open to unpleasant experiences without unnecessary struggle, being willing to have these experiences if they help to move towards personal values.</s><s>• Defining individual personal values via values clarification exercises and valuebased actions, thus articulating mean life directions in different domains, e.g.</s><s>family, spirituality, and articulating what steps would bring the person closer to them Encouraging cognitive defusion, thus distancing oneself from the literal content of thoughts by distinguishing the process of thinking from the products of thinking, e.g.</s><s>instead of thinking "I am no good", telling oneself "I am having the thought that I am no good"</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
