<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>For identifying suitable combination partners, which may enhance the antitumor activities of vemurafenib, a screening with several pathway inhibitors and apoptosis agonists was performed (data not shown).</s><s>Synergistic enhancement of apoptosis in the combination of vemurafenib and TRAIL, which had been described previously, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> served as positive control.</s><s>Of the different effectors tested, TRAM-34, an inhibitor of the potassium channel KCa3.1, appeared of particular value.</s><s>Although it did not trigger apoptosis by itself, TRAM-34 strongly enhanced and accelerated vemurafenib-induced proapoptotic effects.</s><s>Vemurafenib was applied in a standard concentration of 30 μM as well as in two reduced concentrations of 3 and 10 μM.</s><s>TRAM-34 further enhanced apoptosis at all tested concentrations.</s><s>Thus apoptotic rates were stepwise increased when raising the concentration of TRAM-34 from 0 to 25 to 50 μM.</s><s>For example, at 48 h, the numbers of apoptotic cells increased from 12% to 23% to 33% for 3 μM vemurafenib, from 18% to 33% to 41% for 10 μM vemurafenib and from 49% to 79% to 86% for 30 μM vemurafenib (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>These effects were clearly more than additive, particularly as there was only limited proapoptotic effect of TRAM-34 alone (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In order to generalize the findings on enhanced apoptosis, two more melanoma cell lines (Mel-HO and Mel-2a) were investigated.</s><s>All three cell lines carry BRAF mutations, but whereas A-375 and Mel-HO were responsive to vemurafenib single treatment, Mel-2a revealed pronounced resistance.</s><s>Nevertheless, comparable enhancement of apoptosis was seen in all three melanoma cell lines for the combination of 30 μM vemurafenib+50 μM TRAM-34 versus vemurafenib alone.</s><s>Thus, in Mel-HO, apoptosis rates increased at 48 h from 27% to 62% by the combination with TRAM-34.</s><s>In vemurafenib-resistant Mel-2a, apoptosis rates raised from o5% at 48 h up to 40 ± 2% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that the combination effect reported here may be representative for melanoma cells, even in case of intrinsic vemurafenib resistance.</s></p><p><s>To further prove the issue of vemurafenib resistance, another model was established in A-375.</s><s>Cells were cultured with successively increasing concentrations of vemurafenib up to 10 μM within a period of 4 weeks.</s><s>The selected cells showed continuous growth despite vemurafenib and revealed no apoptotic response to 10 μM.</s><s>Nevertheless, these cells were significantly responsive to the combined treatment of vemurafenib/TRAM-34.</s><s>In response to 10 μM vemurafenib +TRAM-34, apoptosis was induced up to 19% and 58% at 24 and 48 h, respectively.</s><s>Similarly, apoptosis induced by 30 μM vemurafenib was enhanced (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Thus both intrinsic resistance (Mel-2a) and induced vemurafenib resistance (A-375-VemR) were overcome in these models.</s></p><p><s>Enhanced apoptosis went along with a reciprocal loss of cell viability, as determined by calcein staining and subsequent flow cytometry.</s><s>At all vemurafenib concentrations used (3, 10, 30 μM), TRAM-34 further decreased cell viability.</s><s>Thus, at 48 h, the numbers of viable cells in response to vemurafenib stepwise further decreased when raising TRAM-34 concentration from 0 to 25 to 50 μM.</s><s>Values decreased from 73% to 68% to 39% (Vem 3 μM), from 69% to 42% to 17% (Vem 10 μM) and from 31% to 2% to 0.5% (Vem 30 μM) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Also concerning cell viability, the combination effects were far more than additive (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In order to distinguish between direct cytotoxic effects (cell lysis) and apoptosis induction, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the cell culture supernatant was quantified by an enzymatic assay at 24 and 48 h.</s><s>In contrast to induced apoptosis, LDH activity in cell culture supernatant remained at a low level, thus indicating that cells were not lysed up to 24 h.</s><s>Only at 48 h of combination treatment, LDH levels were slightly enhanced by 2.3-fold as compared to control cells, which may be explained by secondary cell lysis following apoptosis in cell culture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Complete cell rounding and detachment, characteristic of apoptotic cells, were seen already at 24 h of combination treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>), and monitoring attachment of cells in real time (xCELLigence system) confirmed that both single treatments resulted in only intermediate effects, while the combination of TRAM-34 and vemurafenib resulted in complete cell detachment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Thus apoptosis appeared as the dominant effect of the combination vemurafenib/TRAM-34 demanding an unravelling of the pathways involved.</s><s>As expected, vemurafenib almost completely abolished ERK phosphorylation.</s><s>Total ERK was also downregulated at 48 h of combination treatment, which may be explained by strong apoptosis induction at this time.</s><s>In contrast, TRAM-34 remained without effect on ERK.</s><s>For 30 μM vemurafenib applied, only little rebound ERK activation was seen at 48 h, indicating a largely sustained effect (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>BRAF inhibition in A-375 was correlated to downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2-related protein Mcl-1 as well as to upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3 domain-only proteins Puma and Bim (24 kDa, isoform EL), as also shown previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>The finding that Puma was downregulated again after 48 h is explained by strongly induced apoptosis, which may lead to degradation of many proteins.</s><s>Of the other apoptosis regulators investigated by Western blotting, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and the proapoptotic transcription factor p53 were not regulated by TRAM-34 or vemurafenib.</s><s>But antiapoptotic XIAP as well as proapoptotic Bax were downregulated at 48 h of combination treatment in course of massive apoptosis induction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Thus Bcl-2 proteins appear of particular note for vemurafenib activity, but there  was no indication that altered expression of Bcl-2 proteins was also critical for the combination effects seen here with TRAM-34.</s></p><p><s>Significant activation of the major effector caspase-3 upon combination treatment (24 and 48 h) was seen by its characteristic cleavage products of 17 and 15 kDa, suggesting a contribution of caspase-mediated pathways.</s><s>Nevertheless, caspase activation appeared as not complete, seen by still high levels of procaspase-3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>The role of caspases was further addressed by using the pancaspase inhibitor QVD-OPh.</s><s>Pretreatment of A-375 with QVD-OPh (10 μM) for 1 h resulted in significant but not complete reduction of apoptosis by vemurafenib alone (9% → 3%) as well as by the combination (47% → 13%).</s><s>Similarly, cell viability was partly restored (16% → 33%; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins control mitochondrial apoptosis pathways, for which loss of the MMP represents a critical step.</s><s>Whereas in A-375, TRAM-34 and vemurafenib as single treatments remained without significant effect on MMP at 4 and 24 h, the combination resulted in a complete loss of MMP at 24 h (490%), indicating full activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathways at this time (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, 60% cells with low MMP were obtained in Mel-2a at 24 h.</s><s>Only here, cells also showed response at 4 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The decisive roles of Bcl-2 proteins and mitochondrial pathways were further confirmed by the results of Bcl-2 overexpression.</s><s>Thus Vem/TRAM-induced apoptosis was completely prevented in a stably Bcl-2-overexpressing A-375 cell line (A375-Bcl-2), as compared with a mock-transfected cell clone (A375-pIRES; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>Both cell clones had been previously established and characterized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>espite the obvious significance of lost MMP at 24 h, it should be considered at least in A-375 as a delayed effect, as less evident at 4 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Thus we looked for more initial effects.</s><s>By this, we identified the generation of ROS as an immediate early event, already visible at 1 h of treatment.</s><s>Thus ROS levels were consistently upregulated by vemurafenib single treatment raising from 27% of cells with high ROS at 1 h to 49% cells at 24 h.</s><s>This effect further increased with the combination treatment resulting in 48% cells with high ROS at 1 h and 72% cells at 4 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>Thus the whole cell population shifted toward higher ROS levels upon treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>The reproducible finding that ROS levels upon combination treatment were again downregulated at 24 h underlined the transient appearance of ROS, which was thus not a consequence of induced apoptosis.</s><s>In parallel, we obtained ROS generation in Mel-2a by vemurafenib at 2 h, which was, with 19 ± 2%, however, less than in vemurafenibsensitive A-375.</s><s>Nevertheless, upon combination treatment, ROS levels were raised up to 42 ± 4% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To prove the significance of ROS production, we performed experiments with the ROS scavenger α-tocopherol (VitE).</s><s>In fact, pretreating A-375 cells for 1 h with 1 mM VitE reduced ROS levels upon vemurafenib and combination treatment by almost twofold (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>This resulted in a concomitant twofold reduction of apoptosis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>) and largely recovered cell viability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>Thus ROS produced by vemurafenib appeared as largely responsible for enhanced apoptosis upon combination treatment.</s><s>Further demonstrating its signaling effect, caspase-3 activation by vemurafenib/ TRAM was completely abolished by vitamin E, just as it was abolished by the pancaspase inhibitor QVD-OPh (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</s><s>Also MMP was largely restored by vitamin E, locating also loss of MMP as downstream of ROS in the signaling cascade (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>).</s></p></div>

effect appeared as representative for melanoma cells as seen in 3/3 BRAFmutated melanoma cell lines.</s></p><p><s>Whereas caspase cascades and proapoptotic mitochondrial activation represent standard pathways in apoptosis control, the regulation of apoptosis by ROS is less understood.</s><s>The significance of ROS for apoptosis induction has been proven by us previously, <ref type="bibr"

target="#b39">40</ref></s><s>Here we prove ROS as a major factor in vemurafenib-induced apoptosis, in particular, in its combination with TRAM-34.</s><s>This was shown by the ROS scavenger α-tocopherol, which strongly diminished apoptosis induction and partly restored cell viability.</s><s>ROS was also upstream of other signaling steps, as it appeared already within 1 h, and α-tocopherol blocked both caspase activation and loss of MMP.</s><s>As a possible origin of ROS, the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) may be considered, as ER stress has already been linked to vemurafenib-induced apoptosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>n conclusion, these data shed more light on a frequently used but not completely understood melanoma therapy.</s><s>ROS represents an initial and independent apoptosis pathway that is of particular importance for vemurafenib and its combination with TRAM-34 in melanoma cells.</s><s>Better understanding may be helpful for further improving targeted therapy in melanoma.</s></p></div>
