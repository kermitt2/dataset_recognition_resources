resection, and infection, results in poor healing or nonunion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>The present gold standard for repair of critical size defects is autologous bone grafting, in which host bone is harvested from another site and used to replace the bone in the defect site <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Complications from autograft procedures, including donor site morbidity, pain, and increased risk of infection, have led to the widespread use of allogeneic grafting of bone obtained from human cadavers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Given the risk of donor to recipient disease transmission and immune rejection of the graft, recent research has focused on developing synthetic bone graft substitutes, however, these substitutes have not yet demonstrated clinical efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s></p><p><s>An alternative strategy to heal critical sized bone defects is to deliver or recruit osteoprogenitor cells to the defect site, and to locally direct their proliferation and differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising source of cells for bone regeneration, as MSCs can be obtained from the patient in need of the therapy with relative ease <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>These bone marrow-derived stem cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate into bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, directing the differentiation of MSCs post-transplantation using ECM cues may provide clinical benefit.</s><s>Present strategies in bone regeneration and tissue engineering utilize delivery of soluble growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), to control the fate of transplanted cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Because these factors can diffuse out of the defect site, they must be administered in high doses.</s><s>Clinical use of BMPs as monotherapies to enhance spinal fusion has revealed that supraphysiological doses of BMPs are both costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and often result in undesirable secondary effects in surrounding tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to soluble cues such as growth factors, insoluble cues provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM) have been demonstrated to influence the differentiation of MSCs.</s><s>For instance, mechanical properties such as substrate stiffness can modulate the phenotype of MSCs, with relatively stiff substrates yielding enhanced osteogenic differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>In addition, previous studies have reported that the identity of the ECM material can contribute to the lineage specification of MSCs.</s><s>For instance, culturing MSCs in laminin-5 has been reported to inhibit chondrogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , and MSCs cultured on laminin-1 were shown to adopt a neuronal-like phenotype, extending fine, neurite-like processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Hydrogels composed of collagen II, a major component of cartilage ECM, enhanced the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , while collagen I, a major component of bone, has been shown to enhance osteogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we hypothesized that presenting an ECM ligand derived from collagen I to MSCs would result in increased osteogenesis.</s><s>RGD peptides, initially derived from the ECM protein fibronectin, are routinely used in hydrogel systems to facilitate cell adhesion and spreading <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> .</s><s>Another peptide sequence, DGEA, found in collagen I, is known to bind the α2β1 integrin pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Previous studies utilizing biomaterials functionalized with a different collagen I-derived, integrin-binding ligand, GFOGER, have shown enhanced bone defect healing and implant osseointegration in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> .</s><s>Thus, presenting MSCs with the integrin-binding DGEA ligand may also improve osteogenic differentiation.</s><s>In this study, a peptide containing the DGEA motif was covalently bound to alginate via carbodiimide chemistry.</s><s>Alginate hydrogels presenting the DGEA peptide were used to assess the ability of the DGEA peptide to facilitate cell adhesion and induce

target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> ) was prepared to serve as a positive control for MSC adhesion.</s><s>Unmodified alginate, which is not naturally cell adhesive, served as a negative control.</s><s>Initial studies to assess the cell adhesive properties of DGEAconjugated alginate gels utilized a clonally derived murine MSC line (D1), as these cells have been previously shown to express a more stable MSC phenotype than primary bone marrow-derived MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Under serum-free culture conditions, D1 cells adhered and spread on top of alginate hydrogels modified with RGD peptide, but were generally unable to adhere to unmodified alginate gels, as observed by time lapse microscopy over the course of 3 hours (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A,B</ref> and Videos S1 and S2).</s><s>The D1 cells exhibited limited adhesion and spreading on alginate gels modified with DGEA peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>,B and Video S3).</s><s>As cell viability is closely linked to adhesion in MSCs, the viability of D1 cells seeded on peptidemodified hydrogels was assessed with the Presto Blue assay, which measures cellular metabolic activity.</s><s>D1 cells seeded on RGD-modified gels exhibited significantly higher metabolic activity than cells on either unmodified or DGEA-modified gels after three days in culture, indicating higher cell viability for cells presented with RGD peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further investigate the mechanism of cellular interaction with the RGD and DGEA peptides, D1 cells were seeded on alginate hydrogels and maintained in serum free media for 3 hours, as above.</s><s>The cells were then fixed and stained for cytoskeletal organization (Factin) and focal adhesion formation (phospho-paxillin).</s><s>Consistent with the previous adhesion data, actin staining revealed a spread morphology for cells cultured on RGDmodified gels, while those cells cultured on unmodified or DGEA-modified gels exhibited a more rounded morphology (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, formation of focal adhesions was clearly observed in cells cultured on RGD-modified gels, as evidenced by punctate staining for phosopho-paxillin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Such focal adhesions were largely absent in cells culture on unmodified or DGEA-modified gels.</s></p><p><s>While D1 cells are useful for in vitro mechanistic studies due to their stable MSC phenotype, as an immortalized cell line, D1 cells may not precisely replicate the interactions between native MSCs and DGEA-modified gels.</s><s>Therefore, the ability of MSCs to adhere in 2D to alginate hydrogels functionalized with DGEA was also assessed using primary rat MSCs (rMSCs).</s><s>To quantify the number of adherent rMSCs on DGEA modified alginate gels, rMSCs were cultured on unmodified, RGD-modified, or DGEA-modified alginate gels for 7 hours in the absence of serum, and the number of cells present on the gels before and after washing was determined.</s><s>Consistent with the studies using D1 cells, the seeded rMSCs adhered well to RGD-modified gels, whereas the vast majority of cells were removed from both the unmodified and DGEA-modified gels with washing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, Western blot analysis for phosphorylated ERK (pERK), a protein implicated in integrin-mediated signaling related to cell adhesion and proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , revealed higher levels of pERK in cells treated with RGD peptide, but not in cells treated with DGEA peptide (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition to mediating cell adhesion, integrins play crucial roles in terms of regulating gene expression in cells through a variety of signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>The potential for DGEA-presenting hydrogels to regulate MSC differentiation was investigated by encapsulating rMSCs in alginate hydrogels presenting DGEA, RGD, or both peptides, or in unmodified gels.</s><s>Gels modified with both peptides were made by mixing DGEA-and RGDpresenting polymers at a 1:1 ratio.</s><s>Cells cultured in RGD-presenting gels supplemented with BMP-2 were included as a positive control, as such conditions have previously been shown to be conducive for osteogenic differentiation of MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>The composition of alginate hydrogels used in this study produces gels with elastic moduli of approximately 20 kPa <ref

target="#b28">29</ref> ligands, so an elastic modulus of 20 kPa was chosen as alginate hydrogels of this modulus presenting RGD peptides have been previously shown to favor osteogenic differentiation of MSCs 12 .</s><s>After 7 days in culture, the fraction of cells positive for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, an early osteogenic marker, was determined by Fast Blue staining.</s><s>All peptide-presenting conditions exhibited a greater percentage of cells with ALP activity than in unmodified alginate, with the samples supplemented with BMP-2 having the greatest fraction of ALP positive cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>After 30 days in culture, more mature markers of osteogenesis were assayed.</s><s>The relative number of cells in each condition was obtained by quantifying the number of nuclei in sectioned samples and was subsequently used to normalize collagen I and osteocalcin production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>).</s><s>Production of collagen I and osteocalcin was visualized by immunofluorescence, and mineralization was observed using von Kossa staining.</s><s>Samples presenting the DGEA peptide exhibited the highest level of staining for collagen I, and significantly higher than samples presenting both RGD and DGEA peptides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A,E</ref>).</s><s>The DGEA-presenting samples had the highest levels of osteocalcin, with significantly more osteocalcin present in these samples than in the unmodified, RGD, and RGD/DGEA samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B,F</ref>).</s><s>The DGEA-presenting samples also had the greatest amount of mineralization, with a value comparable to

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Specific integrin engagement by ECM-mimicking peptides is an attractive strategy for directing the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.</s><s>Collagen I, a major component of bone, has previously been shown to enhance osteogenesis in MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, previous reports have demonstrated that functionalizing biomaterial scaffolds with another collagen-derived ligand, GFOGER, enhances bone defect healing and implant osseointegration in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> .</s><s>The DGEA peptide, derived from the α2β1 integrin-binding domain of collagen I, is therefore a potential target ligand to stimulate osteogenesis.</s><s>The DGEA peptide is known to specifically bind the α2β1 integrin pair, and it has been investigated as a targeted imaging probe for cancers known to overexpress α2β1 integrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Because of this peptide's integrin binding ability, we anticipated that it could serve as an adhesion ligand for MSCs.</s><s>However, both clonally derived mouse MSCs and primary rat MSCs were unable to adhere to the surface of alginate gels presenting the DGEA peptide, whereas alginate gels presenting the same density of RGD peptides did facilitate adhesion.</s><s>Therefore, the DGEA peptide does not appear to serve as an adhesion ligand for MSCs at the 2D density presented in this study.</s><s>These results are consistent with previously published studies demonstrating limited adhesion of rat calvarial osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts on hydrogel surfaces presenting DGEA peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Previous studies reporting cell adhesion mediated by the DGEA peptide utilized peptide adsorbed on hydroxyapatite in the presence of FBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Serum adsorption onto the peptide-coated surfaces could have resulted in non-specific adhesion in this earlier work.</s><s>Other studies demonstrating enhanced osteogenesis using the DGEA ligand have presented the ligand from peptide amphiphile nanofibrous networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Ligand presentation from these networks occurs at a much higher local density than from hydrogel surfaces, as the DGEA epitopes are localized to the surface of the nanofibers as opposed to homogenously distributed throughout the gel.</s><s>This increased local ligand density may enhance ligand clustering and promote adhesion in these peptide amphiphile materials.</s><s>Previous studies have also shown that naïve MSCs express fibronectin-binding integrins at greater levels than collagen-binding integrins, but upregulate collagen-binding integrins during differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , providing a possible mechanism for the inability of the DGEA peptide to serve as an adhesion ligand for naïve MSCs.</s></p><p><s>While naïve MSCs may not present sufficient α2β1 integrins to cluster and form stable focal adhesions at the 2D ligand density investigated in this study, integrin engagement by DGEA may still mediate a signaling response that results in changes in gene expression and differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Encapsulating the MSCs within alginate hydrogels for the differentiation assays physically entraps the cells in the material, preventing weakly adherent cells from being removed by media changes.</s><s>This confinement within the hydrogel thus allows for increased opportunities for the α2β1 integrin pairs that are expressed on the cell surface to engage the DGEA ligands, while also providing the cells more time to potentially upregulate α2β1 integrin expression.</s><s>Previous work has shown that the clustering of RGD ligands in hydrogels in 3D can alter the expression of integrins in mouse MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and a similar response may lead to an upregulation of collagen-binding integrins in response to DGEA.</s><s>At the ligand concentration investigated in this study, the total number of accessible ligands available to a spread MSC on a hydrogel surface and to an MSC encapsulated within a hydrogel is similar, on the order of 10 6 ligands per cell (see Supplemental Information for calculations).</s><s>This estimate assumes that a cell can interact with a ligand in the hydrogel network within the length of the extracellular domain of an integrin (approximately 18 nm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Presenting the MSCs with ligands from a 3D matrix is significantly different from presenting the same ligands from a 2D surface.</s><s>The results obtained from the 2D adhesion experiments do not necessarily indicate how the MSCs will interact with the ligands in 3D, and in the current study, the limited adhesion observed on DGEA-modified surfaces in 2D was a poor predictor for the ability of the DGEA ligand to induce an osteogenic response in 3D.</s></p><p><s>Presenting MSCs encapsulated in hydrogels with DGEA ligands alone resulted in significantly increased osteocalcin production and mineral deposition.</s><s>Therefore, while the DGEA peptide did not mediate cell adhesion in 2D at the density investigated in this study, presentation of the DGEA ligand in hydrogels in 3D elicited a more osteogenic phenotype from encapsulated MSCs.</s><s>Hydrogels presenting both RGD and DGEA peptides simultaneously were included to assess whether RGD-mediated adhesion would have a synergistic effect on osteogenic induction in response to the DGEA peptide.</s><s>Interestingly, the presentation of both ligands in the same gel did not exhibit an additive effect for either cell adhesion nor expression of osteogenic markers.</s><s>Rather, expression of mature osteogenic markers in these gels is comparable to that in the unmodified alginate and RGD conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>A possible explanation for these results is that by adhering to the RGD peptides through the higher expressed RGD-binding integrins, the initially weak association with the DGEA ligands did not result in upregulation of the collagen-binding integrins.</s><s>In this scenario, the interaction with the RGD ligands present may dominate, and the MSCs would behave as if they were only presented with RGD.</s><s>The RGD ligand was originally derived from the ECM protein fibronectin, and previous studies have demonstrated enhanced MSC proliferation and maintenance of differentiation capacity when cultured on naturally derived ECMs containing fibronectin <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>These previous studies suggest that fibronectin plays a role in maintaining an undifferentiated MSC phenotype, providing a possible explanation for the lower expression of mature osteogenic markers observed in hydrogels presenting the RGD ligand compared to the DGEA ligand.</s><s>Future studies should investigate the binding interactions between MSC integrins and the RGD and DGEA ligands in hydrogels in 3D to test whether the cells preferentially bind one ligand over the other, and if this preference changes over the duration of the experiment.</s><s>Future work should also address the mechanism by which the DGEA ligand enhances osteogenic phenotype in MSCs.</s><s>Western blot analysis suggests that while the RGD peptide leads to ERK activation, the DGEA peptide may elicit an ERK-independent signaling response.</s><s>One signaling pathway that should be considered is the Jnk pathway, which has been implicated in inducing differentiation in response to integrin binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The ability to utilize specific interactions between cells and extracellular matrix ligands to control cell fate has significant implications for the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</s><s>Maintaining control over cell phenotype post-transplantation remains a major challenge in the clinical translation of stem cell therapies.</s><s>Present strategies that utilize soluble factors can result in off target effects and serious complications for patients as a result of these factors diffusing out of the implant site <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>By employing specific cues derived from the natural extracellular matrix, the signals provided to direct stem cell differentiation remain localized to the material in which the cells are delivered, potentially eliminating the off target effects associated with growth factor therapies.</s><s>In particular, offlabel use of BMP-2, which is FDA-approved for use in lumbar spinal fusion procedures, has been shown to cause ectopic bone formation, leading to airway compromise and neurological impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>In the present study, presenting MSCs with DGEA peptide in hydrogels in 3D significantly enhanced the osteogenic phenotype of these cells.</s><s>Therefore, future studies should investigate if DGEA presenting hydrogels can induce osteogenesis in transplanted MSCs in vivo, as a potential alternative to co-delivery of soluble growth factors.</s></p></div>
