<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GORAB localizes to the trans-Golgi</head><p><s>In cell types relevant for the GO phenotype, a strong Golgi localization of GORAB is evident (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> online).</s><s>To better understand GORAB's function, we wanted to investigate this subcellular localization in more detail.</s><s>Nocodazole disassembles the microtubule network and leads to fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus into so-called ministacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rogalski and Singer, 1984)</ref>, making it easier to discern spatial relation of different Golgi markers.</s><s>After Nocodazole treatment of HeLa cells and human skin fibroblasts, GORAB showed a clear separation from the cis-Golgi marker GM130 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nakamura et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a and  b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the trans-Golgi network marker TGN46 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Prescott et al., 1997)</ref> and GORAB strongly overlapped.</s><s>The best colocalization was observable for p230 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gleeson et al., 1996)</ref>, indicating that GORAB is localized mainly in the trans-Golgi.</s><s>Our previous studies showed that loss of GORAB did not influence the kinetics of Brefeldin A (BFA)-induced Golgi disassembly, but the behavior of GORAB itself in cells treated with BFA has not yet been examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fischer et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This drug locks the small GTPase ARF1 in a complex with its guanosine nucleotide exchange factor disrupting endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Liang et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sciaky et al., 1997)</ref>.</s><s>After BFA treatment, Golgi matrix proteins such as GM130 are found at distinct ER-exit sites (Golgi haze), whereas more loosely associated proteins such as the Golgi SNARE GS15 are found diffusely in the ER lumen <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989)</ref>.</s><s>As expected, application of BFA instantaneously disrupted the formation of the coat protein complex 1 (COPI) coatomer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Klausner et al., 1992)</ref> within 5 minutes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>GM130 stayed at the Golgi and became redistributed to ER-exit sites after 15 minutes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>The Golgi SNARE GS15 and GORAB showed a reduced Golgi signal after 5 minutes of BFA treatment and a complete redistribution to the ER after 15 minutes.</s><s>These results indicate that, unlike a Golgi matrix protein, GORAB seems only loosely associated with membranes of the trans-Golgi network.</s></p><p><s>RAB6 interacts with the central amino acids 99 to 277 of GORAB</s></p><p><s>In our initial studies, we showed that GORAB interacts specifically with the constitutively active form of RAB6 (RAB6 p.Gln72Ala) but not the GDP-locked inactive form (RAB6 p.Thr27Asn) and that GORAB colocalizes with RAB6 at the Golgi apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hennies et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Here we wanted to further map the interaction domain of RAB6 on GORAB.</s><s>First, we specified the protein sequence of human GORAB, which, in contrast to all other species except primates, possesses two possible start methionines giving rise to proteins with a length of 369 amino acids (aas) or 394 aas, respectively.</s><s>As a mutation of the downstream methionine codon found in GO leads to a complete loss of GORAB expression, it is likely that this second methionine is the main translation start <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hennies et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>To further prove this, we analyzed immunoprecipitated endogenous GORAB from HeLa cells by mass spectrometry.</s><s>11 unique peptides for GORAB were identified, among them an N-terminally acetylated peptide starting with the alanine following the second start methionine (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2a</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>online).</head><p><s>The extra 25 aas at the N terminus of the proposed 394 aa protein were not detected.</s><s>Immunoblots revealed no correlation between GORAB band size and the presence or absence of the upstream 25 aa reading frame in cells from different species (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2b</ref> online).</s><s>As these data corroborate that the 369 aa variant is functionally most relevant, all cDNA and aa positions mentioned in this study refer to this protein.</s></p><p><s>For yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) interaction, we used three different fragments dividing GORAB into the N-terminal aas 1 to 277, C-terminal aas 278 to 369, and the central aas 99 to 277 as prey (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Only yeast transformed with the active form of RAB6 and the N-terminal aas 1 to 277 or the central aas 99 to 277 of GORAB showed growth on selective medium (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we performed in vitro pulldown assays using GTP-loaded wild-type RAB6 and the GDP-locked RAB6 mutant (p.Thr27Asn) as baits and FLAGtagged GORAB fragments overexpressed in HeLa cells as prey.</s><s>In contrast to full-length GORAB, neither the N terminus nor the C terminus of GORAB were able to interact with any form of RAB6 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,d, and f</ref>).</s><s>The protein fragment containing aas 99 to 277, however, interacted specifically with wild-type GTP-bound RAB6, but not with inactive RAB6 p.Thr27Asn (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>interaction study with all 19 known human ARF and ADPribosylation factor-like family members (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> and not shown).</s><s>ARF5, one of the two class II ADP-ribosylation factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005)</ref>, was the only candidate showing growth.</s><s>This result was verified by in vitro pulldown assays using glutathione S-transferase-tagged ARF5 p.Gln71Leu (GTP-locked), ARF5 loaded with GDP, and GTP-locked ARF4 p.Gln71Leu in order to prove specificity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>).</s><s>When incubated with HeLa lysates, only active ARF5 precipitated endogenous GORAB.</s><s>Costaining of endogenous GORAB and overexpressed green fluorescent protein-tagged ARF5 p.Gln71Leu in HeLa cells confirmed colocalization of GORAB and ARF5 at the Golgi apparatus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We performed a Y2H experiment using the different GORAB fragments mentioned above as prey constructs and wild-type ARF5 as bait (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>).</s><s>Only yeast transformed with ARF5 and GORAB 99-277 or GORAB 1-277 constructs grew, implying that aas 99 to 277 suffice for interaction.</s><s>For verification of this result, we performed in vitro pulldown assays showing that ARF5 p.Gln71Leu and wild-type ARF5 loaded with GTP interacted with FLAG-tagged GORAB, whereas ARF5 loaded with GDP did not (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>).</s><s>For the in vitro mapping, we used GTP-and GDP-loaded wild-type ARF5 protein and incubated them with lysates from HeLa cells transfected with different GORAB fragments.</s><s>ARF5 was only able to bind to aas 99 to 277, but not to the N or C terminus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3f-h</ref>), indicating that the two small GTPases RAB6 and ARF5 both bind in the region containing aas 99 to 277.</s><s>We termed this highly conserved region (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref> online) internal Golgi-targeting Rab6 and Arf5 binding domain (IGRAB) domain.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The central aas 200-277 of GORAB are the minimum requirement for Golgi targeting</head><p><s>As both small GTPases that we identified as interaction partners for GORAB localize at the Golgi apparatus and bind to the same IGRAB domain, we assumed that Golgi targeting is mediated by this part of the protein.</s><s>To prove this, we analyzed the subcellular localization of the different GORAB fragments.</s><s>It should be noted that overexpression of fulllength GORAB frequently leads to the formation of fibrous structures that are not coincident with the Golgi apparatus in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4a online</ref>).</s><s>These fibrous aggregates were not positive for any Golgi, ER, microtubule, or mitochondrial markers tested, but they contain the intermediate filament vimentin, suggesting an unspecific recruitment of coiled-coil domain proteins (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4b</ref> online).</s><s>Therefore, only cells with a low expression level were chosen in experiments involving transient transfection.</s><s>The N-and the C-terminal parts of GORAB were found in the cytoplasm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Only aas 99 to 277 showed a clear localization in a juxtanuclear position, which coincided with staining for the Golgi marker GM130 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Cutting the interacting fragment between the putative first and second coiled-coil domains resulted in the fragments 99-199 and 200-277, respectively.</s><s>Transfection into HeLa cells showed that only the 200-277 fragment weakly targets to the Golgi (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Using these fragments in pulldown assays was not feasible owing to protein instability (data not shown).</s><s>Missense mutations in the IGRAB domain disturb ARF5 and RAB6 binding and Golgi targeting Previously, a p.Ala220Pro missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue within the minimal (aa 200-277) targeting region of the IGRAB domain (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref> online) was described in patients with <ref type="bibr">GO (Al-Dosari and Alkuraya, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In silico analysis of GORAB predicted three coiled-coil regions (aa 130-170, aa 200-250, and aa 270-300) and a reduction of the probability for the aa 200-250 coil from 30% to nearly 0% in GORAB p.Ala220Pro (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S5a</ref>, b online).</s><s>As no primary cells from a patient carrying the p.Ala220Pro mutation were available, the mutant protein was expressed in HeLa cells.</s><s>GORAB p.Ala220Pro showed an even distribution throughout the cytoplasm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we examined the interaction of the protein

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this study, we examined the subcellular localization of GORAB, its dependency on interaction partners, and the effect of GORAB missense mutations on protein interaction and distribution.</s><s>Although we previously described a Golgi localization of GORAB in primary human fibroblasts and HeLa cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hennies et al., 2008)</ref>, other studies reported a localization of GORAB in the cytoplasm of SMMC-7721 hepatoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Di et al., 2003)</ref> or in the nucleus in neuronal PC12 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Liu et al., 2012)</ref>, thus implying possible cell typedependent differences.</s><s>However, in the cell types most likely affected in GO, dermal fibroblasts, and osteoblasts, GORAB has an almost exclusive Golgi localization under normal culturing conditions.</s><s>In our hands, colocalization studies under different Golgi disrupting conditions implied a localization of GORAB mainly in the trans-Golgi, which has a central role in the terminal modification of N-glycans by the addition of sialic acid and galactose.</s><s>Interestingly, loss of the trans-Golgi-localized V-type H + -ATPase subunit a2 leads not only to an N-and O-glycosylation defect but also to wrinkly skin syndrome (ARCL2A), which can be misdiagnosed as GO Growth on selective plates shows interaction of bait and prey fusion proteins.</s><s>(c-f) For in vitro pulldown experiments, wild-type, guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-loaded RAB6 (RAB6 GTP) or inactive RAB6 p.Thr27Asn (RAB6 n.act.) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and incubated with lysates from HeLa cells transiently transfected with the

altered serum protein glycosylation patterns, indicating that GORAB is not crucial for glycosylation processes, at least in hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hennies et al.,

et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>However, loss-offunction mutations in murine Scyl1 cause a neuromuscular phenotype not overlapping with GO <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schmidt et al., 2007)</ref>, making a close functional relationship between both proteins unlikely.</s><s>It was shown that SCYL1 is involved in COPI retrograde Golgi-to-ER trafficking and maintenance of Golgi morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Burman et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burman et al., , 2010))</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we identified ARF5 as an additional interaction partner of GORAB by Y2H and pulldown assays.</s><s>In addition, ARF5 is found on COPI vesicles and might have a role in COPI vesicle coat formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Popoff et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>GORAB does not, however, colocalize with COPI vesicles in HeLa cells under normal conditions, nor is it found in lysates of ARF5-positive COPI vesicles isolated from rat livers <ref type="bibr">(Popoff V., personal communication)</ref>.</s><s>It was described that ARF5 is also involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of β1 integrin, but not the uptake of transferrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Moravec et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2005)</ref>, suggesting a more ubiquitous distribution of ARF5 throughout the intracellular trafficking pathway.</s><s>RAB6 is one of the best-studied RAB-GTPases, and it is involved in several intracellular trafficking events, for example, endosome-to-Golgi trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mallard et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>However, the trans-Golgi is also a crucial sorting platform for anterograde transport, and another trans-Golgi RAB6interacting golgin, PIST (GOP/C), has been shown to influence the transport of several plasma membrane proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cheng et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Wente et al.,

type="bibr" target="#b47">Yan et al., 2010)</ref>, that localize to the nucleus or to the nucleus and the cytoplasm, respectively.</s><s>It cannot be excluded that GORAB might also reach the nucleus in some cell types as described for neuronal PC12 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Liu et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>A factor that might influence localization and protein-protein interaction is the GORAB N terminus.</s><s>Western blotting revealed two bands in HeLa and HAF whose size could correspond to the 369 aa and 394 aa forms, respectively.</s><s>However, no fragments representing the predicted 25 upstream GORAB aas were identified by mass spectrometry, and acetylation of the penultimate alanine residue of the 369 aa form is a typical sign for an aa at the N-terminal end <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Helbig et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Similar data can also be  found in Proteomics DB.</s><s>We conclude that in the human cell types that we tested, mainly the short 369 aa form is expressed.</s><s>The higher bands detected in lysates from COS7, as well as in murine cells (which lack the upstream start methionine), suggest a heavy post-translational modification, which merits further investigation.</s><s>GORAB was classified as a golgin with predicted coiledcoil elements in the identified RAB6-binding domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hennies et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Coiled-coil domains are structural elements found in a variety of proteins with functions ranging from components of the extracellular matrix to transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Qin et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>They are important structural features as they form rigid rods giving the respective parts of the protein an elongated shape.</s><s>Coiled-coil domains are also known as hubs for protein-protein interaction, mediating, for example, the dimerization of basic leucine-zipper transcription factors.</s><s>Typically, golgins are rather large proteins that are extending from the Golgi membranes, for example, to perform vesicle tethering <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barr and Short, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>For GORAB, two or three coiled-coil domains are predicted to reside between residues 120 and 300.</s><s>For comparison, in the giantin protein, coiled-coil domains are contained in a stretch of more than 3,000 aas.</s><s>Thus, for the rather small golgin GORAB to perform a tethering function, the ability to form multimers would be favorable.</s><s>We showed that high levels of overexpression induce the formation of GORAB-positive fibrous structures reminiscent of fibers formed when intermediate filaments are highly expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Singh et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the fibers formed by GORAB overexpression also showed staining for vimentin, possibly owing to unspecific aggregation of the coiled-coil domains.</s><s>We are aware that mislocalization of overexpressed proteins is a problem for biochemical interaction experiments.</s><s>Therefore, we used endogenous GORAB protein for in vitro pulldown assays whenever possible and made sure that overexpressed FLAGtagged GORAB behaved identically.</s><s>Colocalization studies were performed as shortly after transfection as possible, and only cells with low expression levels without fibrous artifacts were included.</s><s>The highly conserved IGRAB domain defined in this study is reminiscent of the GRIP domain of certain trans-golgins <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Munro and Nichols, 1999)</ref>, although it is not found at the C terminus, but in the protein's center.</s><s>Although most mutations found in GO entail a loss of the protein, both missense mutants studied here were stable, but altered the binding of the IGRAB domain to RAB6 and ARF5 to different degrees.</s><s>In GORAB p.Ala220Pro, the exchange of the flexible aa alanine to proline is likely to stiffen the polypeptide backbone, thereby disrupting the IGRAB structure.</s><s>In GORAB p.Ser175Phe, the exchange of a small for a bulky aa could interfere with the tight packing of the coils.</s><s>The fact that patients with these mutations showed the typical GO phenotype indicate that the effects must be of comparable severity to the complete protein loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Dosari and Alkuraya, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gardeitchik et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we have shown that GORAB is a mainly trans-Golgi-localized protein that interacts with Rab6 and the previously unreported interaction partner ARF5 through its IGRAB domain.</s><s>Analysis of two missense mutations in the IGRAB domain suggests that loss of proper Golgi targeting of GORAB is a central aspect of the GO pathomechanism.</s></p></div>
