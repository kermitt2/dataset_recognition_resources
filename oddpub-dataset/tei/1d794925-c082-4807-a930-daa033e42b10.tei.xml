<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>T he bone marrow is the birthplace of hematopoietic cells in adult mammals.</s><s>As such, it is a highly dynamic environment, where new blood cells are constantly generated from proliferating hematopoietic precursors and exit the bone marrow into the circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>At the same time, the bone marrow serves as a harbor for memory cells of the immune system, which reside in the various subtly different microenvironments that support specific immune cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>These microenvironments are characterized by specialized stromal cell populations, which compose stable components of the niches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>  In order to fulfill these functions, the bone marrow tissue is traversed by a dense system of blood vessels comprising arteries, distal arterioles, and sinusoids.</s><s>These are responsible for transporting cells entering and exiting the bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , and also for delivering oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>The marrow vasculature plays a key role in the regulation of hematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , and hematopoietic stem cell niches are located perivascularly.</s><s>Recently, a strong link between angiogenesis and osteogenesis, mediated by a defined vessel subtype, characterized by CD31 hi Emcn hi (type H) endothelium has been described in the bone marrow.</s><s>This finding revealed a previously unknown heterogeneity among blood vessels in the bone marrow, supporting the notion of tight functional interactions between marrow and bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In the recent decade, intravital two-photon microscopy has significantly advanced our understanding of dynamic processes within the immune system.</s><s>Within the bone marrow, intravital microscopy has helped to elucidate mechanisms of hematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , mobilization of hematopoietic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , and the maintenance of immunological memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>In mice, intravital imaging of bone marrow in areas close to the bone cortex has been performed either in the calvarium <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> , in the tibia <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , or in the femur <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>The calvarial preparation takes advantage of the thin sheet of flat bone covering the marrow in this area.</s><s>Imaging the bone marrow of long bones is more invasive, as it requires the surgical ablation of cortical bone.</s><s>Both methods have been used mainly as terminal procedures, although imaging at multiple time points has been used for intravital microscopy of both calvarium <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and long bones (femur and tibia) for imaging durations of hours, over a maximum of 40 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, up to now there is no available method enabling longitudinal intravital microscopy of the deeper marrow regions in long bones, at subcellular resolution, over the time course of several weeks or even months, i.e., both during bone healing and during homeostasis.</s><s>In order to understand the cellular dynamics occurring in those marrow regions over longer periods of time, an intravital imaging approach allowing longitudinal observation of a fixed region within the bone marrow in one and the same subject is needed.</s></p><p><s>The development of permanent windows for the brain cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> or of the spinal cord <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> solved the challenge of longitudinal imaging, but limitations regarding the accessibility of deep tissue areas still remained.</s><s>An elegant solution for this problem was provided by the lab of Marc Schnitzer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , who used gradient refractive index (GRIN) endoscopic lenses implanted into the brain cortex in order to image deep cortical layers over several weeks.</s><s>An endoscopic approach was also used previously for single-photon imaging in the femur, by introducing a fiber-optic probe into the femoral cavity through the knee area.</s><s>This method was used for imaging within a single-plane circular field of view of 300 µm diameter and at a lateral resolution of 3.3 µm.</s><s>The imaged tissue areas were located at 10-15 µm distance from the endoscope tip <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here, we present a novel method called longitudinal intravital imaging of the bone marrow (LIMB), which allows repeated imaging of the same tissue region in the bone marrow of living mice over the time course of up to 115 days.</s><s>The approach enables sub-cellular resolution multi-photon imaging of cylindrical tissue volumes (300 × 300 × 200 µm 3 ) and is based on the use of a GRIN endoscopic lens mounted on a specialized holder that is surgically fixated to the femur of the mouse.</s><s>By 28 days postsurgery, reactive processes of the organism to the implant completely cease, and the tissue reaches equilibrium.</s><s>Using our technique, we are able to demonstrate a high degree of structural plasticity of deep bone marrow vessels not only during bone healing following lens implantation, but also in steady-state homeostasis, with implications for the concepts of microenvironmental stability and niche formation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Characterization and optical performance of the LIMB implant.</s><s>In order to understand tissue and cellular dynamics in the bone marrow on a longer time scale, we developed a biocompatible implant-the LIMB implant, which allows microendoscopic imaging of the femoral bone marrow.</s></p><p><s>The implant is based on a fixation plate originally developed to stabilize the mouse femur after osteotomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Based on the principles of low contact plates developed for fracture healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> , stability is achieved via two angle-stable bi-cortical screws (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>), which fix the plate in a "bridging" position above the bone, to avoid direct contact to the bone surface.</s><s>This prevents any compression of the bone.</s></p><p><s>In order to allow repeated intravital imaging deep within the femoral bone marrow, a titanium alloy tube of 600 µm outer diameter and 450 µm inner diameter is mounted onto the fixation plate (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>To account for tissue heterogeneity and to visualize the different bone marrow areas of the femur, two types of implants were designed, allowing us to access either diaphyseal or metaphyseal regions (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</s><s>By varying the length of the endoscopic tubing in the marrow cavity (e.g., 500 vs. 700 µm, Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>), we can image pericortical tissue areas or areas deep in the marrow.</s><s>For instance, by using a long microendoscopic tubing, we can visualize the endosteum on the opposite side of the bone cortex, in a contact-free manner.</s></p><p><s>A GRIN lens (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) is positioned in the endoscope tubing and used as a lens for imaging.</s><s>We use two GRIN lens designs, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> LIMB allows murine long bone imaging in various locations with high resolution.</s><s>a Design and positioning of LIMB implant for longitudinal bone marrow imaging.</s><s>The LIMB implant is fixed onto the femur using bi-cortical angle-stable screws.</s><s>GRIN lens systems are placed within the endoscope tubing for imaging and sealed to ensure sterility.</s><s>The positioner allows adjustment and alignment of GRIN and microscope optical axes.</s><s>b In order to account for tissue heterogeneity, i.e., metaphyseal vs. diaphyseal regions, alternative LIMB designs have been developed.</s><s>LIMB fixation with four screws allows higher bone stability after osteotomies.</s><s>c Tubing lengths of 500 and 700 µm, respectively, allow access to either peri-cortical or deep marrow regions.</s><s>d Two GRIN lens systems are used for imaging.</s><s>The single GRIN lens (upper panel) combines the imaging and objective lens function and is glued into the endoscope tubing.</s><s>The symmetric triple GRIN lens (lower panel) is exchangeable and a sapphire window seals the endoscope tubing.</s><s>e 3D fluorescence image of the bone marrow

was measured on 100 nm beads (λ em = 605 nm, λ exc = 850 nm) in agarose, using the single GRIN lens.</s><s>No significant wave-front distortions affecting the PSF are observed.</s><s>g Qdots are used to estimate PSF in marrow tissue.</s><s>They reveal slight resolution deterioration with increasing imaging depth.</s><s>h 2D fluorescence images of Qdots-labeled femoral vasculature, 35 days post-surgery, at various zpositions between the surface of the single GRIN lens and 204 µm tissue depth.</s><s>They reveal fine vascularization in the upper layers and a large blood vessel (~100 µm diameter) with emerging branches in the deep marrow.</s><s>i 2D fluorescence images of femoral vasculature acquired at various depths and time points post-surgery, using the triplet GRIN

over time after implantation.</s><s>Scale bars = 100 µm both with a diameter of 350 µm.</s><s>The first design (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, upper panel) consists of one single GRIN lens of 4.49 mm in length, a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.5 at the object side and a field of view of 280 µm in diameter (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>).</s><s>The lens is permanently and stably glued into the tubing, thereby sealing it to maintain sterility within the marrow cavity and ensuring fixed positioning of the optical path.</s><s>The second design (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, lower panel) consists of a system of three GRIN lenses with NA 0.42 at the object side, 5.99 mm in length and a field of view of 150 µm diameter.</s><s>This GRIN system requires a 170 µm thick sapphire window for optimal optical performance, which is attached to the tubing and seals the implant.</s><s>Thus, this design allows flexible replacement of the GRIN lens system for applications requiring different optical properties.</s><s>A 45°prism can be glued at the end of the GRIN lens to achieve a side view of the marrow tissue and access additional tissue areas.</s><s>The LIMB implant is surgically fixated onto the right femur of mice (Supplementary Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">2b, 3</ref>) to intravitally visualize tissue dynamics by multi-photon microscopy.</s><s>The use of multi-photon excitation permits imaging deep into tissue.</s><s>The implant is completed by a titanium-alloy reference plate (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>, Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">1, 2a</ref>) mounted onto the positioner and the endoscope tubing, which allows stable, reproducible positioning of the mice under the microscope.</s><s>This reference plate couples with a custom-built adapter used to align the optical axes of the microscope objective lens (20×, NA 0.45) and of the GRIN lens, thereby transferring the focus from the microscope objective through the GRIN lens into the marrow tissue (Supplementary Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">2b, 3h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To characterize the optical properties of LIMB, we first determined the point spread function (PSF) of the GRIN lens systems using 100 nm fluorescent beads (emission at 605 nm, excitation at 850 nm) in agarose.</s><s>Using the one-lens GRIN design, the spatial resolution was 0.8 ± 0.1 µm (s.d.) laterally and 5.2 ± 0.5 µm axially, corresponding to theoretical values for NA 0.5 (n = 23 beads).</s><s>The three-dimensional PSF was not distorted by optical aberrations over the entire field of view (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>).</s><s>Using the three-lens GRIN system with the sapphire glass window, we measured a spatial resolution of 0.9 ± 0.2 µm laterally and 8.0 ± 1.1 µm axially (Fig. <ref type="figure">1g</ref>), also corresponding to the theoretical values for NA 0.42 (n = 18 beads).</s></p><p><s>Within the bone marrow, the spatial resolution was evaluated using quantum dots 655 (Qdots).</s><s>While most of these nanoparticles remained within the blood vessels, some Qdots entered the parenchyma due to the fenestrated sinusoids of the bone marrow and were observed as single fluorescent spheres of sub-resolution sizes.</s><s>Typically, resolution values of 1.0 ± 0.1 µm laterally and 7.4 ± 1.6 µm axially were achieved within the imaging volume between 40 and 70 µm distance from the surface of the GRIN lens (at each depth, n = 8 Qdots).</s></p><p><s>The maximum extent of the imaging volume within the bone marrow using the one-lens GRIN system started from the endoscope surface at 0 µm and reached down to 204 µm within the bone marrow (Fig. <ref type="figure">1h</ref>).</s><s>It included regions with superficial small sinusoids and arterioles, as well as deeper-laying large blood vessels including the central sinus.</s><s>We reliably achieved a signalto-noise ratio of at least 5, independent of inter-individual variance and of the imaging time point after surgery.</s></p><p><s>At early time points post-surgery, we typically visualized granulation tissue, characterized by a tight network of small blood vessels within a large area in the imaging volume (~30-85 µm in depth).</s><s>Over time, this granulation tissue retracted to the area next to the GRIN optics and was replaced by normal-appearing bone marrow vasculature, resembling the vasculature as observed by calvarial and tibial imaging preparations.</s><s>At late time points post-surgery, from 28 days onwards, we observed complete resolution of this granulation layer (Fig. <ref type="figure">1i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Local and overall tissue recovery after implantation.</s><s>First, we determined to what extent the surgical procedure and the presence of the implant itself affected the mice and impacted on bone physiology.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, b and Supplementary Movie 1, we confirmed that the low contact plate design does not compress the bone, instead, a gap of at least 100 µm remained between bone surface and plate.</s><s>After removal of the plate (day 7 postimplantation), reconstructed µCT images of the bone surface appeared smooth in the area where the plate had been, comparable to the surface of contralateral bones (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, no differences in bone volume, ratio of bone volume to bone surface (BV/BS), bone shape or thickness were found between the LIMB-implanted and contralateral femurs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d-g</ref>).</s><s>In order to determine the impact of the surgery on the mice, we clinically scored the animals immediately after LIMB implantation, taking parameters such as weight, general appearance, and vitality into account.</s><s>The data recorded from 79 mice
