target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>During the last decade, especially the relevance of protein citrullination has been in the focus of intensive research.</s><s>Finally, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) were included as a serological marker in the new American College of Rheumatology/European League against Abstract Smoking produces substances that activate proinflammatory, prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive mediators via posttranslational carbamylation of proteins.</s><s>As a new consequence of carbamylation, induction of anticarbamylated autoantibodies were observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, sometimes prior to onset of the disease.</s><s>The overall aim of this study was to characterize the reactivity of different isotypes of autoantibodies against carbamylated antigens of vimentin in relation to established rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and markers of disease activity in a so far largely uncharacterized population of Latin American (Cuban) patients with RA.</s><s>Antigenic properties of carbamylated vimentin as well as vimentin peptides were analyzed in 101 patients with RA, 50 disease controls and 51 healthy controls.</s><s>The diagnostic performance was compared with established commercial ELISA rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies of Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The majority of studies showed that ACPA can discriminate between RA and other arthropathies with high specificity.</s><s>They may allow early identification of patients who require more aggressive therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>One of the most common antigenic targets employed for ACPA testing are second-generation cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP2) with higher specificity and sensitivity than IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) test <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>However, to improve RA diagnostic, the different markers are used in combinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, there is still a serologic gap with seronegative patients in established RA and more emphasis was placed on the identification of novel markers.</s><s>In this context, several citrullinated proteins have been identified in the synovium of inflamed joints of RA patients including fibrinogen, enolase, fibronectin, type II collagen and vimentin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>All of them are considered potential relevant candidates to trigger ACPA production in genetically susceptible individuals.</s></p><p><s>The first anti-citrullinated vimentin antibodies detected in RA patients were termed anti-Sa and are characterized by high specificity but low sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>Bang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> identified an antigenic mutated isoform of vimentin, which was the basis for the introduction of the anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin assay (anti-MCV).</s><s>Several studies have shown that the anti-MCV assay is a useful diagnostic tool for RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>However, due to the overlap of ACPA specificities the diagnostic issue of seronegative patients was not solved.</s></p><p><s>Recently, carbamylation of lysine residues to form homocitrulline, another PTM, was described as a key mechanism triggering inflammatory responses by generating neoepitopes, which are targeted specifically by anticarbamylated protein antibodies (anti-carbP) from sera samples of RA patients.</s><s>The presence of anti-carP antibodies in RA patients is associated with more severe joint damage and was identified prior to the onset of the specific RA symptoms.</s><s>In contrast to citrullination, carbamylation is a nonenzymatic PTM, related to aging and lifestyle such as smoking status <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Of note, smoking is responsible for high rates of preventable mortality in Cuba.</s><s>Of deaths recorded in 1995 and 2007, 15 and 18 % of preventable deaths were attributed to smoking, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Latin America RA cohorts have been incompletely characterized so far, since in most studies only the anti-CCP2 assay has been used <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>To our knowledge, there are no published studies with Cuban patients evaluating response to different isotypes of ACPA or anti-carbP antibodies.</s><s>However, this population is unique due to the mixed ethnical and special environmental background.</s><s>Therefore, we evaluated the reactivity of different isotypes of autoantibodies against citrullinated and carbamylated antigens derived from the sequence of vimentin and compared that with RF and anti-CCP2 in a well-characterized cohort of Cuban patients with RA.</s><s>Furthermore, correlation of autoantibodies titers with disease activity and association with smoking status was

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The most interesting finding in our study was the high frequency of antibodies against citrullinated and carbamylated antigens of vimentin, as well as the good diagnostic performance of the anti-carbVIM IgM assay in Cuban patients with RA.</s><s>This observation is of importance not only for improved diagnostic procedures, but also for a better understanding of the pathogenesis based on the different ethnic and genetic background.</s><s>Adequate identification of seropositive patients and potential measurement of all three isotypes could improve the routine diagnostic procedures in RA, to close the gap of seronegative patients and to identify those with severe outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>It has been stated that patients with all isotypes of RF have a very high likelihood of been diagnosed with RA, similar to patients with simultaneous presence of RF IgM, RF IgA and anti-CCP2 antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In agreement with this observation, very few patients were negative for all RF isotopes and ACPA in our study.</s></p><p><s>According to our results, the frequency of RF IgM in the Cuban patients was similar to another study that used ELISA, since seropositivity of RF has been reported to be close to 50 % in Latin America <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Although Kokuina  <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, it has to be considered that these assay techniques are not directly comparable to ELISA with respect to obtained isotypes, titers and specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, our frequencies for RF IgA were higher than RF IgM in Cuban patients.</s><s>While other authors mentioned prevalence rates of RF IgA close to 42.5 % in early and 37.5 % in established RA in another country of Latin America <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, we observed 60.6 % in early and 73.5 % in established disease.</s><s>This finding is of special interest since RF IgA has been associated with severity of the disease and was reported to predict the development of RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The observed higher frequencies of RF IgA can be partially explained by the fact that almost 50 % of Cuban patients in our cohort had high disease activity (DAS28 &gt; 5.1) and about 80 % of patients had moderate or high disease activity (DAS28 &gt; 3.2).</s></p><p><s>Although the pathogenesis of RA has not yet been elucidated, growing evidence supports the involvement of an immune response against modified antigens.</s><s>Since citrullinated peptides can bind with a higher affinity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR alleles encoding the so-called shared epitope, they are efficiently presented to the immune system and can lead to activation of CD4+ T cell breaking immunological tolerance to self-antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Of note, the prevalence of anti-CCP2 antibodies was not as high as expected for early RA in our study.</s><s>However, prevalence of these antibodies has been reported between 48 and 85 % in other cohorts in Latin America <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>These differences can be due to genetic factors, environmental background or the commercial assay used <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Genetic alterations that are likely to be influenced by environmental factors can lead to the production of ACPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, there are no data available on the frequency of the shared epitope in the Cuban population.</s></p><p><s>As an ubiquitous expressed auto-antigen, vimentin might be of special relevance in triggering ACPA production.</s><s>Vimentin immunization can induce an arthritogenic process as well as a specific T cell response in mice.</s><s>In this context, an association of an immune response against vimentin and certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR alleles encoding the "shared epitope" has been reported.</s><s>Moreover, the presence of citrullinated vimentin in immuno-complexes of synovial fluid of RA patients with ACPA and the high specificity of anti-citrullinated vimentin antibodies further emphasize their role in the pathogenesis of RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies in Mexico have reported a prevalence of anti-MCV antibodies in 81.0 % <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and 69.7 % of cases <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, both studies did not differentiate between patients with early or established diseases.</s><s>In our study, we observed high frequencies of this autoantibody in both subgroups.</s><s>With respect to the study by Diaz-Toscano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> showing sensitivity of 81 % and specificity of 94 % for anti-MCV assay, we observed a higher sensitivity but lower specificity in our cohort.</s></p><p><s>The B cell ACPA response is dependent on T cell activation after the first antigen contact for production of the IgM isotype and followed by the production of IgG after repeated antigen exposure.</s><s>Usually, the half-life of IgM is short, and memory B cells against T-cell-dependent protein antigens typically produce IgG and not IgM antibodies.</s><s>One explanation for the persistent reactivity of IgM and IgG ACPA is that some citrullinated antigens are able to activate new B cells despite concurrent recognition by IgG ACPA.</s><s>In this context, it has been observed that several defined citrullinated antigens are recognized only by IgG ACPA, whereas others are also recognized by IgM ACPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In our cohort, the prevalence of anti-MCV IgG was higher than anti-MCV IgM and anti-MCV IgA supporting the usefulness of IgG ACPA for diagnostic purposes.</s></p><p><s>Initial evidence suggests that carbamylation of antigens is also involved in the pathogenesis of RA.</s><s>Carbamylated proteins induce the chemotaxis and activation of CD4+ T cells with a strong antibody response.</s><s>This could be the first phase of autoreactivity in RA subsequently leading to the local recognition of citrullinated peptides within the joints and to the development of erosive arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> identified anti-carbP antibodies in the serum of RA patients that predict disease progression in ACPA-negative patients.</s><s>Also Stoop et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> observed an immune response against carbamylated antigens in an arthritis animal model induced by collagen before disease onset.</s><s>In agreement with Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we also found anti-carbVIM and anti-carbMCV antibodies in both ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients with RA.</s><s>In subsequent studies, it would be of interest to clarify, whether antibodies against carbamylated antigens can also predict the development of RA independently of the presence of ACPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>According to our observations, the anti-carbVIM assay was able to detect more anti-CCP2 seronegative patients in early than in established RA.</s><s>These observations are in agreement with the data obtained by Stoop et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, indicating that the tolerance to carbamylated proteins, in contrast to the response to citrullinated proteins, is easily broken and that arthritis boosts the immune response against these proteins explaining the phenomenon that anti-carbP antibodies already appeared before disease onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There is growing evidence that diagnostic performance in RA patients could be increased by using more than one assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, we observed that the sensitivity could be increased by using both anti-MCV IgG and anti-carbMCV IgM or anti-CCP2 and anti-carbMCV IgM assays.</s><s>Such a very high sensitivity by combination of tests is extremely relevant and could significantly facilitate early diagnosis of RA.</s><s>Although reactivity against modified vimentin was predominant, the modified peptides were also recognized as autoantigens by antibodies from patients with early and established RA.</s></p><p><s>Several studies have shown a stronger correlation of anti-MCV levels with clinical parameters compared with anti-CCP2 levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Other authors suggest that anti-carbP antibodies can have clinical value in the prediction of RA, as well as for disease progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>We found similar correlations between anti-MCV IgG, anti-CCP2 and anti-car-bVIM IgM antibodies with ESR in patients with early RA.</s><s>It is of note that we observed a weak correlation between anti-CCP2 antibodies and DAS28 in patients with established disease in contrast to other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, seronegative RA patients for anti-CCP2 or anti-MCV were more frequently in low disease activity and remission.</s><s>Thus, we observed two clinical phenotypes according to the presence or absence of anti-MCV or anti-CCP2 antibodies.</s></p><p><s>Pathogenic models of RA nowadays include smoking as a relevant trigger factor of immune reactions to autoantigens modified by citrullination in patients with HLA-DR shared epitope <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>This is in agreement with the observed significant association between anti-CCP2 antibodies and smoking status as well as disease activity in our study.</s><s>Although causative association are not ideal in a cross-sectional design, we were not able to show an association between smoking and the formation of antibodies against carbamylated antigen.</s><s>While exposure to smokes causes carbamylation at physiological levels depending on the concentrations, there are potentially also other so far not identified triggering factors for the induction of carbamylation in RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, combination of two tests for ACPA and anti-carbVIM IgM significantly increases the diagnostic sensitivity for RA and provides the best performance achieved so far in a Cuban cohort.</s><s>Thus, for anti-MCV IgG or anti-CCP2 seronegative patients it can be recommended to test for anti-carbVIM IgM.</s><s>This strategy should be implemented in the diagnostic of RA in Latin American countries and needs to be confirmed in other cohorts.</s><s>Our results support the model that citrullination and carbamylation may contribute unidirectional to the pathogenesis of RA.</s></p></div>
