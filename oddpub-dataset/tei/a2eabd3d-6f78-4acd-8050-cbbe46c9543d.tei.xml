<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This multicentre, parallel, three group, pragmatic randomised clinical trial was prospectively registered (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612001126808) and the protocol published elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8</ref></s><s>The trial adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">9</ref> with ethical approval obtained from the human research ethics committees of the Universities of Queensland (#2012000930) and Melbourne (ID 1238598).</s><s>Participants provided written informed consent.</s><s>Although no protocol deviations were made in the conduct of the trial, there were several minor variations in planned statistical analyses.</s><s>These refinements included: specified multiple imputation; inclusion of the stratifying variable of study site in regression models; fitting of regression models separately at each time point; and for binary outcomes, use of binary regression models with a log link.</s><s>These variations were published before close out of the study (https://espace.library.uq.edu.</s><s>au/view/UQ:409744).</s><s>A post hoc analysis of the pain data dichotomised the continuous interval scale data on the basis of a clinically important difference, and was considered as a secondary outcome.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Community dwelling participants were recruited from Brisbane and Melbourne, Australia, via advertisements in print, radio, and social media.</s><s>Participants were not informed of the study hypotheses.</s><s>Inclusion criteria were: age 35-70 years, lateral hip pain for more than three months, pain intensity of at least 4/10 on a numerical rating scale (0=no pain, 10=worst pain), and clinical diagnosis of gluteal tendinopathy by a physiotherapist and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging evidence of an intratendinous increase in signal intensity in the gluteus minimus and medius tendons on T2 weighted images of the hip. <ref type="bibr">8 10</ref></s><s>Major exclusion criteria were: low back pain, sciatic or groin pain intensity of more than 2/10 on a numerical rating scale, corticosteroid injection use within the previous 12 months, current physiotherapy, total hip replacement, and other neurological conditions (supplementary appendix S1).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation</head><p><s>Volunteers underwent telephone screening, followed by physical examination and diagnostic imaging.</s><s>After baseline assessment, eligible individuals were randomised (by an independent offsite organisation using a computer generated schedule), stratified by site (in Brisbane or Melbourne, Australia), to receive the following strategies: • Education on load management plus exercise • One corticosteroid injection • A wait and see approach.</s><s>Allocations were sealed in opaque, consecutively numbered envelopes by an independent person not involved in recruitment, and kept in a central locked location.</s><s>Envelopes were opened at each site sequentially.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study treatments</head><p><s>Using ultrasound guidance, an experienced radiologist administered the corticosteroid injections (1 mL Celestone (betamethasone 5.7 mg/mL) or 1 mL Kenacort A40 (triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg/mL) and local anaesthetic (2 mL bupivacaine or 1 mL Marcaine).</s><s>Education plus exercise involved 14 individual sessions over eight weeks (60 mins initial session, 30 mins thereafter) with a registered physiotherapist.</s><s>During these sessions, participants received education on tendon care, particularly on appropriate amounts and gradual progression of tendon loading (including handouts, DVD).</s><s>They also received a home exercise programme of targeted strengthening of the hip abductor muscles and dynamic control of adduction during function (4-6 exercises to be performed daily).</s><s>The wait and see approach involved attendance at one session with a physiotherapist who provided general information about the condition, possible risk factors, and advice regarding continuation of activity, as well as reassurance that the condition resolves over time.</s><s>The treatments are described in detail in the protocol paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8</ref> and summarised in supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principal findings</head><p><s>As hypothesised, patients in our trial reported greater global improvement and lower pain intensity in the short term (at eight weeks) after education plus exercise and corticosteroid injection use for gluteal tendinopathy than after a wait and see approach.</s><s>In addition, we found that outcomes were better for education plus exercise than for corticosteroid injection use at eight weeks.</s><s>The hypothesis for the long term outcome (at 52 weeks) was only partly upheld, with patient rated improvement being greater for education plus exercise than for corticosteroid injection use, whereas we saw no difference in pain intensity between the two treatments.</s><s>The results from the pain scale might be influenced by the relatively mild pain intensities at baseline, which could have limited this scale in detecting meaningful difference observed on the global rating of change scale, but should be considered in generalising from these findings.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations of study</head><p><s>In proposing to implement these findings into clinical practice, our study had several limitations and strengths.</s><s>Participants with gluteal tendinopathy were specifically selected on the basis of clinical diagnosis and confirmation by magnetic resonance imaging, with other musculoskeletal complaints excluded (such as low back pain or hip osteoarthritis), and the trial interventions focused on treating gluteal tendinopathy.</s><s>Pragmatically, it is common for clinicians to encounter patients with multiple conditions, which would usually be dealt with in their management as well.</s><s>Magnetic resonance imaging confirmation is not always available or affordable, but evidence indicates that some clinical diagnostic tests used in this study's selection process have high diagnostic utility when compared with magnetic resonance imaging. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10</ref></s><s>Thus, use of these tests could improve confidence in selecting appropriate patients for the treatments used in this clinical trial.</s></p><p><s>Differences in number of sessions and time spent with practitioners between the different groups could affect outcomes, but these interventions are designed to reflect conventional management protocols, and requirements and investment of time for each group are implicitly unbalanced.</s><s>All physiotherapy and radiology clinics were community based, and treatments were generally well accepted by participants as demonstrated by the high retention rates and no major adverse events.</s><s>Although blinded to study hypotheses, participants were not blinded to the treatments, which could have resulted in bias when completing the patient rated outcome measures, particularly because one group was a no treatment control.</s><s>Only two measures were not patient rated outcomes: hip abductor muscle torque and active lag (at eight weeks only).</s><s>These measures were recorded by an investigator blinded to group allocation.</s><s>Analysis showed a small but significant difference in torque between education plus exercise and the wait and see approach. .</s><s>Proportion (%) of participants in each group reporting "moderately better," "much better," or "very much better" on GROC (that is, defined as success) over time.</s><s>Trial groups were education plus exercise (EDX), corticosteroid injection use (CSI), or wait and see approach (WS).</s><s>Supplementary figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref>  The potential for type 1 error due to multiple comparisons must also be considered.</s><s>Adjustment to the significance level was not made, but P values for all comparisons are provided. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22</ref></s><s>Thus, the results concerning the secondary time points and outcomes might be considered exploratory.</s><s>Notwithstanding, P values for the three primary comparisons would continue to be labelled as statistically significant if Bonferroni corrections for three pairwise comparisons were applied in a post hoc analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with other studies</head><p><s>Few studies have compared the conservative management of gluteal tendinopathy between education plus exercise and corticosteroid injection use.</s><s>Our study results regarding the corticosteroid injections concur with the only other comparable randomised trial in gluteal tendinopathy, where injections provided benefits in the short term (at 12 weeks) but not in the longer term (at 52 weeks), compared with usual care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">4</ref></s><s>hese outcomes are also broadly consistent with trials involving tendinopathies at other sites. <ref type="bibr">23 24</ref></s><s>he present study showed that the education plus exercise programme was better than the wait and see approach at all time points, demonstrating that it is effective for the management of gluteal tendinopathy.</s><s>A novel finding that was not hypothesised was the greater benefit of education plus exercise over corticosteroid injection on all primary outcomes at eight weeks.</s><s>This finding contrasts those from a previous clinical trial involving home based exercise for gluteal tendinopathy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> which reported a significantly lower success rate of only 7% for exercise compared with 75% for corticosteroid injection use at one month follow-up.</s><s>By four months, the success rate between the two groups were similar (education plus exercise group 41% v corticosteroid injection 51%).</s><s>The success rates for education plus exercise in the current study were much higher, ranging from 58% to 74% over four to 12 week follow-up.</s><s>This higher rate might be due to the fact that the present study focused on the principles of tendon load management and specifically targeted the function of the gluteus minimus and medius muscles with the prescribed exercise programme.</s><s>Conversely, the home exercise programme in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref> included exercises that did not specifically target these muscles, or control the degree of tendon loading (especially compression load) for the gluteal musculotendinous complex, and involved limited exercise supervision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5</ref></s><s>he early success rate of the education plus exercise programme, compared with corticosteroid injection use and the wait and see approach, suggests the importance of a sound evidence based rationale for condition specific management of gluteal tendinopathy.</s><s>Contemporary evidence suggests that optimal treatment for tendinopathies requires a programme that targets the underlying pathology of tendinopathy using education for load management and exercise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref></s><s>The education plus exercise programme had a dual focus: • To educate the participant to avoid movements and positions that compress the gluteus medius and minimus tendons (the tendons implicated in gluteal tendinopathy) against the greater trochanter 7 25  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>Adequate supervision to enable progression and correction of form and to directly address concerns and questions about the education information is likely to be important for the delivery of education plus exercise programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">26</ref> and their relative benefits reported herein.</s><s>Although education plus exercise had benefits over corticosteroid injection use at eight weeks, the hypothesis of its benefits in the longer term had mixed results at 52 weeks.</s><s>Success (global rating of change), quality of life (EuroQOL), and pain frequency, but not pain intensity or other gluteal tendinopathy specific measures (eg, VISA-G, lateral hip pain questionnaire, hip abduction muscle torque), indicated that education plus exercise was better than corticosteroid injection use.</s><s>As a global impression of a participant's perception of their hip condition over time, the global rating of change score might reflect less frequent pain and better quality of life rather than pain intensity and measures of disability specific to gluteal tendinopathy.</s></p><p><s>Given that measures of muscle strength did not differ between groups at eight weeks, the mechanism underpinning the benefits of education plus exercise might well be more in the education aspect of the programme.</s><s>The education component involved 14 sessions with a physiotherapist spread over eight weeks, with an emphasis on avoidance of postures and movements that compress the tendons against the greater trochanter as well as appropriately controlling and gradually progressing tendon loads.</s><s>The information about posture, activity, and exercise provided in the education component could plausibly contribute to individuals feeling globally improved, with less frequent hip pain and better quality of life than after corticosteroid injection use and the wait and see approach.</s><s>The strengthening exercises might have also contributed to improved motor control (which was not measured), direct analgesic effects, or improved tendon structure, <ref type="bibr">27 28</ref> without measurable increase in strength-which could have underpinned benefits from the education regarding load management.</s></p><p><s>Considering the favourable outcomes of an education plus exercise programme in both the short and long term, further research might be well directed towards establishing the degree of contribution of specific education alone about the condition itself, tendon loading principles, and appropriate strategies for self management.</s><s>Future work should also look at whether this approach could be a viable, cost effective approach to early management and prevention of progression and recurrences.</s><s>Understanding and knowledge of appropriate management strategies could encourage patients to have a greater sense of self efficacy and control over their condition, leading to improved quality of life.</s></p></div>
