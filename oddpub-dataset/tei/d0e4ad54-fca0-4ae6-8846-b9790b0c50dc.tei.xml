<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The ability to genetically manipulate the genomes of animal models or isolated cells has driven hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) research, revealing key mechanisms that control HSC self-renewal and differentiation.</s><s>Numerous genetically engineered mouse models have contributed to our understanding of the pathways that control HSC maintenance and regeneration in physiological settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Rossi et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Although this approach produces invaluable insights and still remains a gold standard in studying HSC biology, large time and cost commitments are required to generate new mouse models, and the approach is generally not amenable to high-throughput studies.</s><s>On the other hand, somatic engineering of hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cell (HSPC) genomes has been achieved, in large, using retroviral vectors to either overexpress or knock down the expression of genes of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rivie `re et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This approach has been used to screen for both positive and negative regulators of HSC function from up to 100 candidate genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Deneault et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hope et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Although this approach allows investigators to quickly assess the function of multiple genes, retroviral transduction negatively impacts HSC function during in vitro culture, and retroviral genome integration is a serious concern when these engineered cells are used clinically <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>A new method to edit the genomes of HSPCs should not only accelerate gene discovery research but also open up new clinical opportunities in using engineered HSPCs for gene therapy.</s></p><p><s>Among the several engineered nucleases enabling site-specific genome editing, the CRISPR-Cas9 system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jinek et al., 2012)</ref> stands out since it does not require cumbersome engineering of nucleases for each target and only requires a 20-nt RNA sequence contained within a chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to drive the endonuclease Cas9 to its target sequence.</s><s>Thus, CRISPR/Cas9 provides a versatile, modular, and costeffective means to edit the genomes of multiple model systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hsu et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sternberg and Doudna, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Several delivery methods have been used to perform CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of HSPCs, including lentiviral transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Heckl et al., 2014)</ref>, plasmid DNA transfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Mandal et al., 2014)</ref>, or chemically modified RNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hendel et al., 2015)</ref>, achieving up to 48% gene disruption in human HSPCs.</s><s>While these studies have shown the enormous potential of HSPC gene editing by CRISPR/ Cas9, a method that is highly efficient and simple, without the need for any cloning and nucleotide modifications, and that addresses clinical concerns of retroviral genome insertion is still lacking.</s><s>We sought to develop simple strategies to perform CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in HSPCs with minimal manipulations and while avoiding viral integration into the HSPC genome.</s><s>Here we describe fast, efficient, and cost-effective methods of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in primary murine and human HSPCs, and we demonstrate that this method can be used to directly examine gene function.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficient Gene Disruption in Mouse HSPCs</head><p><s>We reasoned that transfecting HSPCs isolated from Cas9-expressing mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Platt et al., 2014)</ref> with sgRNA would be an efficient method to edit the genome of HSPCs, since only the small RNA molecules would need to be introduced.</s><s>To test this idea, we designed small guide RNAs to target the GFP gene (GFP-sg1) co-expressed in the Cas9-expressing mice.</s><s>When we electroporated c-kit + HSPCs with in vitro-transcribed GFP-sg1, we observed highly efficient loss of GFP expression by flow cytometry, compared to cells electroporated with sgRNA against Rosa26 (R26-sg) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Although electroporation reduced the survival of HSPCs $20% immediately after electroporation, cells maintained at least 80% viability throughout the experiment for up to 96 hr post-electroporation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>In this condition maintaining high viability, we found that 67% ± 4% of HSPCs lost GFP expression upon electroporation of , demonstrating efficient gene editing with high cell viability.</s><s>The frequency of GFP ablation exhibited a sgRNA dose-dependent increase, plateauing at 1 mg GFP-sg1 for 10 5 HSPCs per transfection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because retroviral transduction is enhanced by culturing with cytokines to stimulate the cell cycle of quiescent HSPCs, we also tested whether brief in vitro exposure to cytokines in culture before sgRNA electroporation increased GFP gene editing.</s><s>We electroporated Cas9-expressing HSPCs after varying the duration of culture.</s><s>We found that a brief culture (1-3 hr) increased the frequency of GFP-negative cells from around 60% in fresh progenitors to a maximum of 85% ± 1% after 3 hr, without further increase after 12 hr (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>In the context of this gene-editing strategy, incorporation of an optimized scaffold sequence previously shown to improve Cas9-mediated imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chen et al., 2013)</ref> did not significantly increase the frequencies of gene disruption further (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because the c-kit + population contains various progenitors besides HSCs, we tested whether HSCs themselves undergo successful gene disruption upon transfection of sgRNAs.</s><s>After electroporation of Cas9-expressing c-kit + cells with GFP-sg1, we sorted CD150 + CD48 À lineage À Sca-1 + cells (c-kit expression was attenuated within 1 hr of pre-culture before electroporation, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>) into semi-solid media, and we monitored colonies arising from these single HSCs for GFP ablation.</s><s>Flow cytometry of individual colonies revealed that most HSC-derived colonies (40 of 48: 83%) lost GFP expression (representative three col-onies shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>), whereas electroporation with or without sgRNA did not affect the clonality of HSCs compared to cultured, un-electroporated cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our method efficiently ablates genes in HSCs with minimum impact on HSC survival.</s></p><p><s>With the optimized sgRNA delivery method in hand, we next considered whether Cas9 protein pre-complexed with sgRNA to generate a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kim et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Schumann et al., 2015)</ref> also could be used to edit genes in murine HSPCs.</s><s>Different amounts of GFP-sg1 were mixed with Cas9 protein, and the RNP complex was electroporated into HSPCs isolated from a mouse strain that ubiquitously expresses GFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Schaefer et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>As shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F and 1G</ref>, $70% of HSPCs lost GFP expression upon co-delivery of Cas9 protein and GFP-sg1.</s><s>Two other sgRNAs against GFP also attenuated GFP expression in significant fractions of HSPCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1G</ref>).</s><s>Under this condition, HSPCs electroporated with Cas9 RNP maintained viability of &gt;80% for up to 96 hr after electroporation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>).</s><s>Since loss of GFP expression is an indirect measure of genome editing, we directly examined insertion or deletion (indel) frequencies at the genomic level.</s><s>First, we performed T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assays and found that a significant fraction of HSPCs accrued indels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>).</s><s>We note that the T7E1 assay often underestimates the rate of indel formation, potentially due to self-hybridization of the alleles that carry the indel, incomplete duplex melting, and inefficient cleavage of single nucleotide indels <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Schumann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>To accurately determine the nature of the indels, we next performed high-throughput sequencing, which revealed that $60% of HSPCs accrued small indels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1H</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>These genomic analyses corroborated the flow cytometry data demonstrating that GFP alleles were mutated by the Cas9 RNP approach.</s><s>Thus, this strategy allows us to study gene function directly in HSPCs in any genetic background.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional Assessment of Gene Disruption in Mouse HSPCs</head><p><s>We then tested whether targeted gene editing in HSPCs by CRISPR/Cas9 could be used to alter HSPC function.</s><s>We chose to disrupt two polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components Eed and Suz12, which are both found mutated in human leukemias <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Shih et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that monoalleleic loss, but not biallelic loss, of Eed or Suz12 confers proliferative advantages to HSPCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Xie et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>We transfected wild-type HSPCs with Cas9-RNP complexes against Rosa26, Eed, or Suz12; plated them on semi-solid media; and serially replated the cells.</s><s>Whereas most Rosa26-targeted HSPCs lost proliferative capacity upon the fourth replating, Eed-and Suz12-targeted HSPCs exhibited extensive proliferative capacity at the fourth passage (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>T7E1 assays performed on HSPC cultures shortly (48 hr) after electroporation revealed that a substantial fraction of cells accrued indels in Eed and Suz12 (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s><s>Sanger sequencing and tracking of indels by decomposition (TIDE) analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Brinkman et al., 2014)</ref> revealed that $50% of the sequence reads accrued small indels between 4-bp deletion and 2-bp insertion (Figures <ref type="figure">S2A  and S2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also cloned individual colonies at later passages and examined the editing status.</s><s>T7E1 assay revealed that Eedand Suz12-edited colonies acquired indels, and sequencing verified that they all acquired monoallelic loss of Eed or Suz12 (Figures <ref type="figure">2C-2F</ref>), consistent with the haploinsufficient function of Eed and Suz12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Xie et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>These results establish that Cas9 RNPs can be used to perform gene editing in primary murine HSPCs regardless of genetic background, resulting in clear loss-of-function phenotypes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficient Gene Disruption in Human HSPCs</head><p><s>Encouraged by the results obtained in mice, we assessed the feasibility and efficiency of our protocol in human hematopoietic cells.</s><s>We first sought to target human CD45 (hCD45) in HL-60 cells, a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line.</s><s>We electroporated HL-60 cells with Cas9/hCD45-sg RNPs testing three different CD45 guides.</s><s>Strikingly, all three guides displayed very high efficiencies of disrupting CD45 expression (sg1, 98%; sg2, 91%; and sg3, 74%), as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>).</s><s>Two additional AML cell lines, OCI-AML2 and Kasumi, exhibited similar editing efficiencies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>We also tested whether our protocol was capable of editing peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived primary T lymphocytes.</s><s>While resting T cells were resistant to CD45 editing (data not shown), activated T cells targeted with hCD45-sg1 exhibited efficient (86% ± 2%; n = 3) loss of CD45 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>), with some residual CD45 bright and CD45 mid cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3B</ref>).</s><s>We performed high-throughput sequencing of unfractionated T cells as well as cells sorted based on CD45 expression (CD45 bright , CD45 mid , CD45 dim , and CD45 neg cells), and we discovered that, while the unfractionated cells had an indel frequency of 83%, more than 95% of alleles in CD45 neg and CD45 dim cells and 40% of alleles in CD45 mid cells had acquired indels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3B</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, CD45 dim cells harbored 51% in-frame and 49% out-of-frame indels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3C</ref>), which may explain the residual CD45 expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3C</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, low indel frequencies (0.2%, 1.7%, and 0.4%; read depth: 924, 301, and 527) were observed at the top three predicted off-target (OT) sites (Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>; Supplemental Experimental Procedures).</s></p><p><s>We then tested whether primary human CD34 + HSPCs could be gene edited.</s><s>To search for the optimal conditions, we first electroporated primary CD34 + cells derived from umbilical cord blood with Cas9/hCD45-sg1 RNP using nine different electroporation parameters, and we performed flow cytometry 96 hr later to measure CD45 expression levels together with cell viability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3D</ref>).</s><s>The optimized electroporation parameter (condition 9) was used for all further experiments.</s><s>Since shortterm ex vivo expansion is routinely exploited to increase transfection and transduction efficiency, we explored the impact of short cytokine exposure on transfection and gene disruption efficiency.</s><s>We electroporated CD34 + cells from single donors (n = 5) with mRNA encoding for GFP-fused Nucleophosmin 1 (GFP-NPM1) immediately after isolation, or after 24 or 48 hr of cytokine exposure, and we analyzed GFP expression 24 hr later.</s><s>While fresh cells showed only 28% ± 13% GFP positivity, cells cultured for either 24 or 48 hr displayed transfection efficiencies higher than 75% (24 hr, 81% ± 12%; 48 hr, 78% ± 10%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To assess whether CRISPR-mediated gene disruption efficiency was influenced by exposure to cytokines, we performed a similar experiment electroporating CD34 + from single donors (n = 8) with Cas9/hCD45-sg1 RNP again at 0, 24, and 48 hr of culture, and we analyzed CD45 expression 4 days later.</s><s>As expected, freshly isolated CD34 + cells not exposed to cytokines exhibited limited loss of CD45 cell surface expression (8% ± 4%).</s><s>However, gene disruption efficiency was significantly higher in cells cultured for 48 hr compared to 24 hr (73% ± 16% versus 41% ± 12%, p = 0.003) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), implying that the efficiency of gene disruption is dependent upon more than transfection efficiency.</s><s>Importantly, CD34 expression remained unchanged even following efficient CD45 knockout (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also determined the impact of CRISPR-Cas9 delivery on human HSPC viability.</s><s>CD34 + cells from single donors were electroporated with Cas9 only or Cas9/hCD45-sg1 RNP or left untreated in culture, and viable cell counts were recorded by trypan blue staining at 24, 60, and 96 hr after electroporation.</s><s>Nonelectroporated cells expanded in vitro, reaching 2.1 3 10 5 cells, 5 3 10 5 cells, and 1.1 3 10 6 cells at 24, 60, and 96 hr of culture, respectively, starting with 10 5 cells.</s><s>Electroporated cells exhibited significant but acceptable cell loss in Cas9/hCD45-sg1 RNP-treated cells compared to non-electroporated cells (24 hr, 69% ± 31%;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The strategies we describe herein enable efficient gene editing, particularly loss-of-function studies, in both murine and human HSPCs directly.</s><s>With the RNP-based methods, it is possible to generate gene-edited HSPCs within a week starting with conception of the study, including downtime for oligonucleotide synthesis.</s><s>This is substantially shorter than editing HSPCs using lentiviral transduction, which requires cloning sgRNAs into lentiviral vectors, generation and quality control of lentiviral particles, and results in variable HSPC transduction efficiencies and risks of lentiviral integration in undesirable sites.</s><s>Furthermore, electroporation of RNPs is a transient hit-and-run approach that obviates the need for a special mouse strain expressing Cas9, and it reduces concerns of constitutive Cas9 expression and OT cleavage.</s><s>The costs of generating gene-edited HSPCs with these methods are substantially lower than those with lentiviral methods.</s><s>Although commercially available Cas9 protein makes gene ablation with RNPs feasible, we also envision this strategy could be used for other Cas9 derivatives where transient effects may be desirable, such as CRISPR interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Konermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Qi et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One limitation of our protocol is that it lacks the ability to mark the cells that were successfully electroporated, unlike lentiviral transduction methods in which transduced cells can be marked by fluorescent proteins or by antibiotic resistance.</s><s>However, with a gene-editing efficiency approaching 90% as we show for some targets, our method makes it possible to examine the molecular or phenotypic changes without selection for transfected cells.</s><s>We have shown that deletion of DNMT3A from primary human CD34 + cells leads to a precipitous reduction in DNMT3A protein levels in the population within 96 hr after electroporation.</s></p><p><s>We have observed that gene-editing efficiency is slightly more efficient in human than murine HSPCs.</s><s>It is possible that this difference reflects developmental states, since the human cells are derived from cord blood rather than bone marrow.</s><s>Additional optimization using murine HSPCs from the fetal liver or after mobilization may further increase the gene-editing efficiency.</s></p><p><s>Perhaps the most significant finding we observed was efficient HDR in human HSPCs.</s><s>The ability to introduce specific mutations in HSPCs will enable the expanded study of cancer-driver mutations in AML and other hematologic diseases.</s><s>More importantly, the repair of inherited mutations in both common and rare blood disorders using CRISPR may now be feasible without integration of viral vectors or delivery of plasmid DNA, represent-ing a major stepping-stone toward therapeutic gene editing.</s><s>We have not yet achieved detectable HDR frequencies in mouse HSPCs, and it is possible that a longer culture time prior to electroporation is necessary to activate this repair process in murine cells.</s></p><p><s>These remarkable knockout and HDR efficiencies in human HSPCs may suggest the possibility of broad and immediate utility.</s><s>However, most ex vivo manipulations ultimately have been shown to impact function of the most long-term HSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Genovese et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hoban et al., 2015)</ref>, and all of the available assays have limitations in their ability to assess bona fide HSC function.</s><s>Therefore, caution in application of these strategies is still warranted.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we describe a fast, efficient, and cost-effective method to edit the genomes of both murine and human HSPCs based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system.</s><s>The ability to quickly and efficiently edit primary HSPCs makes it possible to test the function of genetic variants identified in association with hematologic diseases, such as leukemia or bone marrow failure.</s><s>Moreover, the high efficiency offers the possibility to perform large-scale combinatorial gene editing in HSPCs to model complex mutational landscapes.</s></p></div>
