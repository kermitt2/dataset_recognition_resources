<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE) includes the release of placental factors into the maternal circulation, inducing an inflammatory environment in the mother.</s><s>One of the factors may be the proinflammatory chemokine fractalkine, which is expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast of human placenta, from where it is released into the maternal circulation by constitutive shedding.</s><s>We examined whether placental fractalkine is up-regulated in severe early-onset PE and whether the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and IL-6 are able to increase the expression of fractalkine.</s><s>Gene expression analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemistry consistently showed increased fractalkine expression in placentas from severe early-onset PE, compared to gestational age-matched controls.</s><s>Expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) 10 and 17, which convert transmembrane fractalkine into the soluble form, was significantly increased in these cases.</s><s>Incubation of first-trimester placental explants with TNF-a provoked a significant increase in fractalkine expression and release of the soluble form, whereas IL-6 had no effect.</s><s>TNF-aemediated up-regulation of placental fractalkine was reversed in the presence of the aspirin-derivative salicylate, which impaired activation of NF-kB p65 in TNF-aetreated explants.</s><s>On the basis of data from placental explants, we suggest that increased maternal TNF-a may up-regulate the expression and release of placental fractalkine, which, in turn, may contribute to an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response in PE. (Am J Pathol 2015, 185: 1334e1343; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2015.01.019)</s></p><p><s>Although detailed processes underlying the etiology and pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE) are still not completely understood, the release of placental factors into the maternal circulation is one of the hallmarks of the syndrome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>These placental factors are suggested to include not only placental debris, but also a host of molecules, such as angiogenic factors, components of the renin-angiotensin system, and inflammatory cytokines, 3e5 which may trigger maternal vascular dysfunction and an increased maternal inflammatory response.</s><s>Recently, the chemokine fractalkine [or chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1, CX3CL1] was shown to be expressed at the apical microvillous plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast in human placenta, from where it is released into the maternal circulation by constitutive metalloprotease-dependent shedding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>According to previous placental explant studies, the release of placental fractalkine significantly increases from first trimester toward term of pregnancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>In general, fractalkine, together with another chemokine termed CXCL16, represents a unique group of chemokines, because they are not expressed as soluble chemokines but as transmembrane multidomain molecules consisting of a chemokine domain, a mucin-like stalk, a transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail.</s><s><ref type="bibr">7e9</ref> The extracellular domains, representing the chemokine domain and the mucin-like stalk, can be shed by the a disintegrin-like metalloproteinases (ADAMs) 10 and 17 into a soluble form.</s><s>10e12 On the basis of these observations, fractalkine exists as membrane-bound and soluble forms, both of which bear different functions.</s><s>Although the membrane-bound form promotes flow-resistant adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial or epithelial cells via its corresponding G proteinecoupled, seven-transmembrane receptor CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1), the soluble form has chemoattractive activity for monocytes, natural killer cells, and T cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Attention to this chemokine-receptor duo is constantly increasing, and it is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn disease, allergic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>nowledge regarding a role of fractalkine in human pregnancy is, albeit extending in recent years, restricted to a few studies.</s><s>Initial experiments with trophoblast cell lines suggest fractalkine to be involved in establishing first contact between the blastocyst and the uterine epithelium, and to promote trophoblast migration through the maternal decidua.</s><s><ref type="bibr">15e17</ref> Another study suggests a role of fractalkine in placental microvasculature remodeling, because the up-regulation of placental fractalkine was associated with increased fetal microvessel density in placental villi from pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>Moreover, increased release of soluble fractalkine was determined in perfusion fluids of perfused placental lobules in response to lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> indicating up-regulation of fractalkine in the placental endothelium under proinflammatory conditions.</s><s>Recently, increased fractalkine expression was shown in human amniotic epithelial cells isolated from pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>aken together, available data suggest up-regulation of fractalkine in the uteroplacental unit in response to inflammatory conditions.</s><s>Indeed, normal pregnancy is accompanied by a mild systemic inflammatory response, which strengthens during pregnancy and peaks during the third trimester. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>This mild systemic inflammatory response is characterized by increased circulating inflammatory cytokines and the activation of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>In PE, a maternal syndrome of hypertension and proteinuria, the intensity of the systemic inflammatory response is more vigorous, including significantly increased proinflammatory maternal circulating cytokines, when compared to normotensive pregnancies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Thus, the hypothesis was tested whether placental fractalkine is up-regulated in severe early-onset PE and, moreover, whether exogenously applied proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and IL-6, mimicking proinflammatory maternal circulating cytokines, are able to increase fractalkine expression and release in placental villous explant culture.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Placental Fractalkine Expression Is Increased in Severe Early-Onset PE</head><p><s>Quantitative gene expression analysis showed 2.99 AE 0.40-fold increased fractalkine expression in placentas from severe early-onset PE, when compared to gestational agematched controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>ELISA analysis of tissueassociated fractalkine protein levels indicated the same trend and showed 1.55 AE 0.47-fold increase in placental tissue from severe early-onset PE, which, however, did not reach statistical significance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Immunohistochemistry of placental tissues from control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) and severe early-onset PE (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) localized fractalkine expression in the syncytiotrophoblast, where staining was more pronounced in severe early-onset PE, compared to controls.</s><s>Incubation with negative control mouse IgG revealed no staining (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Although the analysis of tissue-associated fractalkine protein by ELISA only showed a trend of increase in severe early-onset PE, quantification of immunohistochemical staining for fractalkine by a softwarebased pixel classification approach revealed 4.16 AE 0.56-fold increased staining in placental tissue sections from severe early-onset PE, compared to controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>This discrepancy between results from ELISA and immunohistochemical quantification may be explained not only by the differences in method, but also by different antibodies used in these methods.</s><s>Significant differences in observed mRNA levels and the nonsignificant increase in protein levels measured by ELISA could be explained by the fact that membrane-bound fractalkine is cleaved by the metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17, which have been described to release soluble fractalkine from the syncytiotrophoblast by metalloproteolytic shedding.</s><s>Increased ADAM10 and ADAM17 may increase shedding of soluble fractalkine, resulting in decreased membrane-bound fractalkine.</s><s>To consider this aspect, expression of ADAM10 and ADAM17 was analyzed.</s><s>Accordingly, expression of both ADAM10 and ADAM17 was significantly increased 4.17 AE 0.91-fold and 2.43 AE 0.30-fold, respectively, in placentas from severe early-onset PE, when compared to controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Placental Fractalkine Is Up-Regulated by TNF-a, But Not IL-6</s></p><p><s>Because PE has been suggested to have its origin in the first trimester of pregnancy and has been associated with a proinflammatory cytokine signature, including elevated maternal circulating IL-6 and TNF-a levels, 26e28 we next tested the effect of these cytokines on fractalkine expression in first-trimester placental explants.</s><s>Placental explants were incubated in the presence or absence of IL-6 and TNF-a or the combination of both at 1 and 10 ng/mL.</s><s>Gene expression analysis revealed a significant 6.37 AE 3.00-and 4.37 AE 1.22-fold up-regulation of placental fractalkine in the presence of TNF-a alone and TNF-a in combination with IL-6, respectively, at a concentration of 10 ng/mL after 48 hours of treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>IL-6 alone did not affect placental fractalkine expression at both concentrations, which leads us to suggest that the observed effects of combined IL-6 and TNF-a treatment were only driven by TNF-a.</s><s>Analysis of the respective tissue protein and released soluble fractalkine confirmed mRNA data, albeit effects were less pronounced.</s><s>Tissue-associated fractalkine protein increased 1.65 AE 0.21and 1.79 AE 0.19-fold in the presence of 10 ng/mL TNF-a alone and TNF-a combined with IL-6, respectively, whereas no effects were detected in the presence of IL-6 alone (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</s><s>Similar effects were detected in the supernatants of explant cultures, where released soluble fractalkine increased 1.81 AE 0.24-and 2.17 AE 0.39-fold on treatment with 10 ng/mL TNF-a and TNF-a in combination with IL-6.</s><s>Incubation of placental explants with IL-6 alone had no effects on the level of soluble fractalkine (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).</s><s>To determine any cytotoxic effects of TNF-a and IL-6 on placental explants, the release of LDH into the culture medium was analyzed after culture and showed no significant differences between treatments (data not shown).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Although maternal circulating cytokines were not analyzed in the present study, data from placental explant experiments suggest that increased maternal circulating TNF-a, but not IL-6, up-regulates the expression and release of placental fractalkine in PE.</s><s>This up-regulation may be initiated early in pregnancy, because longitudinal studies detected elevated maternal circulating levels of TNF-a during the first trimester in women who were destined to develop PE compared to women destined to have a normotensive pregnancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>This assumption is in good agreement with our data from first-trimester placental Previous studies by Stepanian et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> suggested a trend toward elevated levels of soluble fractalkine in patients with early-onset PE, which fits well with our results.</s><s>However, it should clearly be stressed at this point that soluble fractalkine in the circulation of patients with early-onset PE may not only derive from placental villi, but also from endothelial cells of the maternal vasculature.</s><s>Thus, elevated soluble fractalkine may derive from fetal and maternal origin.</s><s>Contribution of placental fractalkine to the maternal pool of soluble fractalkine during gestation may be relatively low because the entire surface of placental villi at term, with approximately 12 to 15 m 2 , represents only a small area compared to approximately 4000 to 7000 m 2 endothelium of maternal blood vessels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s>However, in the case of placental fractalkine, the function of the soluble form may comprise recruitment of CX3CR1-expressing monocytes, natural killer cells, and T-cell subsets to the fetal-maternal interface.</s></p><p><s>Our finding of increased placental ADAM10 and ADAM17 expression in severe early-onset PE confirms previous studies, which also demonstrated increased expression of both metalloproteases in preeclamptic placentas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref></s><s>Up-regulation of placental fractalkine, together with increased placental ADAM10 and ADAM17 expression, suggests enhanced shedding and release of placental fractalkine, which, in turn, may increase recruitment of maternal leukocytes in severe early-onset PE.</s><s>This way, placental fractalkine could contribute to activation of maternal monocytes and type 1 helper T-cell lymphocytes, the predominant cell types mediating the inflammatory cascade in women with PE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> Although not necessarily the primary cause of PE, leukocyte activation is suggested to contribute to the progression of this pregnancy pathology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>Activation of leukocytes during their uteroplacental passage has been suggested by Mellembakken et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> who detected increased adhesion molecules and complement-related factors on neutrophils and monocytes in samples from uterine veins compared to samples from antecubital veins in patients with severe PE.</s><s>Thus, activation of leukocytes by placental factors, such as placental fractalkine, may, in turn, initiate a vicious circle of leukocyte activation leading to a persistent, exaggerated, proinflammatory uteroplacental environment in PE.</s><s>Whether this activation depends on direct cellular interaction of maternal leukocytes with the syncytiotrophoblast remains speculative.</s><s>However, incubation of monocytes with soluble fractalkine has been shown to significantly up-regulate TNF-a expression, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> and rather argues for activation by soluble fractalkine independent of direct intercellular contact.</s><s>On the basis of this concept, leukocyte-derived cytokines, such as TNF-a, may sustain up-regulation of placental fractalkine expression in the syncytiotrophoblast.</s></p><p><s>Our placental explant experiments show activation of the NF-kB pathway in response to TNF-a, which is supported by previous studies with primary trophoblasts and trophoblast cell lines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref></s><s>Salicylate effectively inhibited TNF-aeinduced upregulation of placental fractalkine by interfering with NF-kB activation in explant culture at a concentration of 10 mmol/L.</s><s>However, salicylate derivatives, such as aspirin, at suprapharmacological concentrations (&gt;5 mmol/L) exhibit inhibitory actions on several transcriptional activators and, in fact, are considered as toxic for human subjects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s>Nevertheless, highdose aspirin treatment not only reduced the severity of atherosclerotic plaques, but also significantly reduced fractalkine expression in aortas of apolipoprotein E knockout mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>In humans, low-dose aspirin treatment (50 to 150 mg/day) of women at high risk for PE has been suggested to reduce the incidence and severity of PE without causing harm.</s><s>Metaanalyses of randomized controlled studies revealed that low-dose aspirin treatment, when started 16 weeks, significantly reduced the risk for severe PE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> Whether low-dose aspirin treatment down-regulates placental fractalkine expression in severe PE remains open.</s><s>However, direct interference with the fractalkine/CX3CR1 axis may be a more eligible strategy.</s><s>Potent and selective orally available CX3CR1 antagonists have recently been developed and inhibited fractalkine-induced activation of CX3CR1 on blood monocytes in a rat model for multiple sclerosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref></s><s>n summary, we conclude that TNF-a up-regulates placental fractalkine expression and secretion via activation of the NF-kB pathway.</s><s>On the basis of our results, we propose the concept that up-regulated placental fractalkine, together with up-regulated placental ADAM10 and ADM17 expression, may lead to increased release of soluble fractalkine into the maternal circulation, where it may contribute to an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response in severe early-onset PE.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure
