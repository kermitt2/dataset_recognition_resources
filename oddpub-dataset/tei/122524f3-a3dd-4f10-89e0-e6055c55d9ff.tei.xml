the BM are not observed.</s><s>In contrast to the BM, lymph node total cellularity is highly dynamic over 24 hr, as seen when homing or egress is blocked.</s><s>Still, homing of leukocytes to lymph nodes and bone marrow occurs predominantly at night, while egress (or mobilization in the case of the bone marrow) occurs predominantly during the day.</s><s>Thus, rhythmic egress of lymphocytes via efferent lymph is a major mechanism underlying the oscillatory leukocyte numbers in blood.</s><s>Whether other egress routes for lymphocytes, from the thymus or the spleen, occur in a circadian manner is currently unclear.</s></p><p><s>Our data point to a critical role of cell-intrinsic clock-dependent mechanisms in the regulation of T and B lymphocyte trafficking.</s><s>While global BMAL1
