<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>The occurrence of AEs is significantly (and non-linearly) dependent on MHD serum level, whereas the dependence of OXC dosage is less distinctive.</s><s>But, tolerability of OXC seems to depend on age of the patients as well as on pharmaceutical formulation of OXC.</s></p><p><s>ß 2015 British Epilepsy Association.</s><s>Published by Elsevier Ltd.</s><s>All rights reserved.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, we retrospectively examined serum levels in a large group of patients treated with OXC as monotherapy with or without adverse effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head><p><s>The therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) database of the Laboratory of the Epilepsy Research Society at the Epilepsy Center Bethel (Bielefeld) was analyzed with regard to OXC dosages, MHD serum concentrations and the occurrence and kind of AEs in patients on OXC monotherapy.</s><s>As part of clinical routine, serum levels are determined in case of AEs as well as at the beginning or before the end of in-patient treatment.</s><s>Blood samples have to be accompanied by laboratory order form carrying detailed information about the medication and AEs, in case of occurrence.</s></p><p><s>In addition, further data were extracted, e.g. the pharmaceutical drug formulation of OXC, date of blood sampling, gender, age and body weight of the patients.</s><s>MHD serum levels collected for TDM were determined between 2005 and 2010.</s><s>Almost all patients were inpatients of the Bethel Epilepsy Centre (Bielefeld, Germany), a tertiary reference center for epilepsy.</s><s>Just five patients were under out-patient care of the epilepsy center.</s></p><p><s>In total, 990 MHD serum levels under OXC monotherapy were identified by searching the laboratory database.</s><s>OXC monotherapy as well as all on the laboratory order forms reported AEs were verified by checking patients' medical record and missing information of the above mentioned data was completed, if possible.</s><s>Cases with an incomplete data set were excluded from further evaluation.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, children younger than 6 years of age were excluded as adverse effects reported by children below the age of 6 were assumed as not reliable.</s><s>Hence, 893 blood samples of 442 patients were included in this retrospective study.</s><s>The study was conducted in accordance with the Gesundheitsdatenschutzgesetz (GDSG NRW, German law of healthcare data protection).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Determination of MHD serum concentrations</head><p><s>For the determination of MHD serum concentrations (sum of Rand S-enantiomers) a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with UV detection was used.</s><s>The serum samples (100 ml) were mixed with the extraction solution, i.e. 200 ml of acetonitrile and methanol (9:1) containing the internal standard ETB = ethyl-tolyl-barbituric acid (all from Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany).</s><s>The proteins were precipitated and after centrifuging the supernatant fluid transferred into microvials.</s><s>The chromatographic separation was carried out on a HP 1090 LC (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) apparatus with a Kromasil C18, 5 mm, 250 Â 4 mm HPLC column.</s><s>A gradient elution with acetonitrile and a phosphate buffer (pH 4.5) was used at 75 8C and the wavelength for UV detection was 207 nm.</s><s>The lower limit of detection was 0.5 mg/ml and the limit of linearity was found with 90 mg/ml for MHD.</s><s>The coefficient of variation (day to day) of the method was below 3%.</s></p><p><s>The accuracy of the determination of AED serum concentrations, including MHD, is regularly verified and certified by external quality assessment (participation in interlaboratory comparisons of three different institutes).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Statistical evaluation</head><p><s>For analyzing the occurrence of AE in relation to MHD serum levels and OXC dosages, Kaplan Meier estimates (mean value, median and standard errors) for the lowest MHD concentration and lowest OXC dosages at which an AE occurred (mean value, median and standard errors) were computed.</s></p><p><s>In most patients no AE occurred and therefore the (lowest) MHD level or OXC dosage at which AE would occur are unknown.</s><s>However, in these patients data on the highest MHD level and highest OXC dosage without AE are available and this kind of ''censored'' data should be considered in the statistical analysis.</s><s>Therefore, we used methods originally developed for survival analysis (Kaplan Meier estimates, Kaplan-Meier, log rank tests) to describe and analyze the occurrence of AE dependent on MHD levels.</s></p><p><s>Log-ranks tests were performed to check whether the MHD serum levels or MHD dosages at which AEs occurred were dependent on gender, age of patients and pharmaceutical formulation of OXC.</s><s>In some patients two or more MHD determinations were assessed; however, for the statistical analyses mentioned above only the highest serum level without AE (''censored'' values) or, in case of AE, the lowest serum level at which an AE (''event'') occurred was included.</s></p><p><s>In addition, a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was used to investigate the effect of MHD serum levels, OXC dosage, pharmaceutical formulation of OXC, gender and age (&lt;18 vs. !18</s><s>years) on the probability of the occurrence of AE (specifications: binominal distribution, logit link function, independent working matrix structure).</s><s>Wald-test was used for testing significance of the factors mentioned above.</s><s>In contrast to usual logistic regression, in the GEE model using a logistic link function repeated measurements of patients may be included.</s><s>Thus, for GEE all 893 blood samples of 442 patients were analyzed.</s></p><p><s>More details of the GEE approach of are described, for example, by Fahrmeir et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 (two-sided, if not mentioned otherwise).</s><s>For statistical analyzes IBM SPSS for Windows 20.0 was used.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Limitations</head><p><s>Our study has several limitations.</s><s>First of all, this was a retrospective study, accordingly there was no fixed scheduleneither for the minimum or the maximum dose of OXC nor for the time of taking blood samples.</s><s>Furthermore, the reporting of AEs was dependent on patient's subjective perception and abnormal lab values were not considered.</s><s>In some cases, determined serum levels could differ from the actual serum level at first appearance of the AE as blood sampling was lagged.</s><s>But the number of these cases can considered being small as, apart from five, all patients were inpatients of an epilepsy center and timely blood sampling is part of clinical routine.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p><s>Our results indicate that the occurrence of adverse effects, especially those related to the central nervous or digestive system was significantly related to the MHD serum level.</s><s>Children and younger patients tolerated higher body weight adjusted doses of OXC as well as higher MHD serum levels compared to adults.</s><s>Furthermore, higher doses of the extended-release formulation of OXC seem to be better tolerated than identical doses of immediaterelease formulations, probably due to lower diurnal fluctuations of MHD serum levels.</s></p></div>
