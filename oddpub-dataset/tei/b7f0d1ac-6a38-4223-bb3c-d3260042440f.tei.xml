(LCs) were considered to be the only DCs able to initiate CHS, more recent studies suggested that dermal DCs also contribute to its pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al.,

2002)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells contribute to inflammatory responses.</s><s>Hapten-specific CD8 + cytotoxic T cells producing IFNγ and IL-17 are the primary effector cells in murine CHS to haptens such as oxazolone (OXA) or DNFB <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bour et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kehren et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr"

cells, the phenotype of Treg cells involved as well as Treg trafficking to and retention within the skin, are not yet fully understood.</s></p><p><s>The integrin α E (CD103) is primarily expressed by epithelial lymphocytes of the intestine, lung, and skin, but also by subsets of mucosal mast cells, mucosal DCs, and dermal DCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kilshaw, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Schön et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pribila et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Although its function on DCs and mast cells remains elusive, it is thought that CD103 is not

target="#b37">Schlickum et al., 2008)</ref>, as its only known ligand, E-cadherin, is expressed by epithelial cells such as keratinocytes and LCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cepek et al.,

of CD103-expressing lymphocytes is often increased in inflammatory skin diseases.</s><s>Some studies suggested that CD103 expression on Treg cells but not on effector T cells is mandatory for their retention in inflammatory lesions and that dysregulation of CD103 leads to imbalanced local immunoregulation in the skin with augmented inflammatory responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lehmann et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Siegmund et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Suffia et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>However, the points at which CD103 is required during this complex multistep immune response have not been clearly delineated.</s></p><p><s>We demonstrate that CHS developing in the absence of CD103 is more severe compared with wild-type (wt) mice.</s><s>Moreover, while the number of T cells was increased, CD103 deficiency leads to a diminished FoxP3 expression on Treg cells suggesting a functional role.</s><s>However, although CD103 is not mandatory for T-cell localization per se, it is crucial for Treg retention during CHS.</s><s>Thus, it appears that CD103 deficiency augments inflammatory responses due to defective regulatory mechanisms by affecting both Treg function and retention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Increased CHS reaction in CD103-deficient mice CHS was induced using two different obligate haptens, namely OXA and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, in a large number of CD103-deficient mice and their wt counterparts (detailed in the legend to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The mice were sensitized on their shaved lower backs and challenged 5 days later on their right ears (the left ears served as internal vehicle controls).</s><s>Although the overall dynamics of ear thickness as a surrogate parameter of cutaneous inflammation were similar in both genotypes, CD103-deficient mice developed a significantly stronger ear swelling response throughout the entire observation period.</s><s>The difference in ear thickness between the strains became significant as early as 8-24 hours after the challenge, with a peak at 32-48 hours (Po0.001,</s><s>Po0.01 or Po0.05, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Control mice, which were only challenged with either of the two haptens, did not mount an increased ear swelling, neither in wt, nor in CD103 − / − mice (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>To assess whether the observed differences were specific for allergic immune reactions, we induced irritant contact dermatitis using Croton oil, which elicits acute inflammation without sensitization and, therefore, addresses innate immune responses in a T-cell-independent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Nosbaum et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The typical biphasic Croton oil-induced ear swelling response as a parameter for acute irritant inflammation was observed as early as 1 hour after exposure, with peak values after 6-8 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Of note, there were no significant differences between CD103 − / − and wt animals.</s><s>In addition, cutaneous infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes was similar in both genotypes (data not shown).</s><s>Thus, deficiency of CD103 did not directly affect acute inflammatory processes.</s></p><p><s>When OXA-sensitized mice were evaluated histopathologically to assess the tissue distribution of various cell types involved in inflammatory processes, OXA-challenged skin showed a profound mixed inflammatory infiltrate including mononuclear, polymorphonuclear, and mast cells within the dermis, all of which were conspicuously more prominent in CD103-deficient mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, four upper panels).</s><s>Immunohistochemistry revealed massive dermal recruitment of CD11b + myeloid lineage cells (monocytes/macrophages) and Gr1 + granulocytes, respectively, into inflamed skin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, four lower panels).</s><s>Used as a second independent and quantitative method, flow cytometric analyses revealed markedly higher numbers of immigrating CD11b + monocytes/ macrophages, CD11b + /Gr1 + neutrophils, and F4/80 + macrophages upon OXA challenge in CD103 − / − mice.</s><s>Paralleling the macroscopic observations, these differences were most pronounced at 36 hours after OXA challenge (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, a higher percentage of CD11b + and CD11b + / Gr1 + , but not F4/80 + cells cells within the infiltrate of CD103 − / − mice became apparent.</s><s>As these innate effector cells do not express CD103, they might not be the primary cell types mediating the observed differences.</s><s>Therefore, we hypothesized that the stronger CHS-induced inflammation in CD103-deficient mice was due to altered function of cells expressing CD103, either DCs or T cells.</s></p><p><s>Normal DC function in CD103 − / − mice during T-cell priming in the sensitization phase Given that priming of hapten-specific T cells by DCs, particularly epidermal LCs, in dLNs during sensitization is mandatory in CHS <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Grabbe et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bennett et al., 2007)</ref> and because the density of LCs influences CHS responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bennett et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Vocanson et al., 2009)</ref>, we examined DC migration, homing, maturation, and function in wt and CD103-deficient mice.</s><s>On the basis of morphometric analyses of epidermal sheet preparations, we found that in situ counts and morphology of LCs showed no significant differences between CD103 − / − and wt mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), suggesting that CD103 was not required for the orthotopic localization and morphogenesis of LCs within the epidermis under steady-state conditions.</s></p><p><s>To elucidate the migration of skin DCs to the dLN, we followed DC migration after cutaneous painting with the fluorescent hapten, FITC, and analyzed FITC-loaded cells recovered from dLN by flow cytometry.</s><s>All FITC-containing cells were MHCII/CD11c-positive, thus being DC migrated from the skin.</s><s>Indeed, migration of DCs was restricted to dLN, as non-dLN and spleen did not harbor any FITC-positive cells, irrespective of the mouse strain used (data not shown).</s><s>Approximately 2.5-3.0 × 10 5 antigen-loaded DCs migrated to each dLN in both CD103 − / − and wt mice with similar dynamics for an observation period of up to 72 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>To assess DC phenotypes, classical DC activation markers including the adhesion molecule, CD62L (L-selectin), the chemokine receptor, CCR7, regulating homing and trafficking of DC from the skin to secondary lymphoid tissues, and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD83, and CD86, respectively, were assessed by flow cytometry.</s><s>Expression of these markers was similar within the FITC-positive populations of both strains (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Further analysis of FITC-loaded skin-derived DC in dLN of wt mice showed that the vast majority did not express CD103 (12.16% (SEM = 2.07%); data not shown) and are, therefore, presumably LCs, as these cells do not express CD103.</s></p><p><s>In functional activation experiments, bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) from CD103 − / − mice stimulated hapten-specific CD4 + or CD8 + T-cell proliferation with equal efficiency compared with BMDCs from wt mice (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 online</ref>).</s><s>This indicated that CD103 expression on DCs was not required for the stimulation of antigen-reactive T cells in CHS.</s><s>BMDC preparations from both CD103 − / − and wt mice contained 485% DCs as assessed by the expression of CD11c (data not shown), and their maturation phenotype was identical with respect to MHCII, CD86 and CD40 expression (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 online</ref>).</s><s>Altered DC functions during the elicitation phase cannot be formally excluded.</s><s>A recent study demonstrated that dermal dendritic cells form clusters with effector T cells during the elicitation phase leading to optimal antigen-specific activation and proliferation of T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Natsuaki et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p></div>

note, the function of CD103 appeared to be dichotomous: On the one hand, CD103 was associated with higher expression of FoxP3 in Treg cells, and thus it is likely that Treg cell function is altered.</s><s>On the other hand, it contributed to the retention of Treg cells at sites of inflammation.</s><s>CD103 is relevant for tissue-specific localization not only of CD8 + epidermal T cells

expression in CD103 + and CD103 − Treg cells and their suppressvie capacity is, therefore, an interesting open question.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, expression of both CD103 − and FoxP3 is induced by

CD103-mediated retention exposes Tregs to TGFβ within the epithelial microenvironment for a longer period of time, thus enhancing their FoxP3 expression.</s><s>To further address the question of T-cell plasticity, it is likely that previously non-regulatory T cells are converted to CD103 + Treg cells in the presence of TGFβ.</s></p><p><s>It is reasonable to assume that unraveling the molecular crosstalk between CD103 and FoxP3 will provide a handle on targeting regulatory mechanisms in inflammation.</s><s>It is also conceivable that CD103 is involved in transcriptional regulation of other surface molecules, chemokines, or cytokines, which are crucial for traffic and function of Treg cells, thus acting indirectly.</s><s>In any case, our study of CHS now provides experimental
