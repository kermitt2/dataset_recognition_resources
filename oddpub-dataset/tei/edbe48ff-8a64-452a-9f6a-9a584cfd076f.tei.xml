<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance of methods on testing data</head><p><s>Our results clearly show that the methods assessed differ in their efficiency to detect animal interactions and their symmetry.</s><s>The main factor that characterizes their efficiency is whether interactions take place between groups or individuals, and all methods are more efficient to detect interaction between species than between individuals.</s><s>In our data this is unsurprising as the complexity of individual interactions was higher than the inter-species interactions (40 individual animals versus 2 species).</s><s>Although fair comparisons between methods are not straightforward due to their different nature, CHA, MDNN and MDCM methods applied to inter-species relationship matrices performed well.</s><s>MDCM was able to detect all different interactions and symmetry embedded in the simulated animal movement, followed in efficiency by MDNN and CHA methods.</s><s>MDNN performance depended on the number of nearest neighbours included in the transformation method, and although the response was not linear, when the number of neighbours was k = 6 MDNN was able to correctly detect all interactions and their symmetry (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>CHA performed well for different timespans (1, 3, 5 hours) on matrices that contained interactions driven by one species, and in the case where there were no interactions between species, but CHA failed to detect symmetric interactions (i.e. when each species were allowed to modify the movement behaviour of the other).</s><s>As a result of this issue CHA was the worst performer of the three methods.</s></p><p><s>One of the issues with convex hull areas is its high dependence on specific individual animals that segregate far away from the main core of the group.</s><s>This high dependence on outliers means that the convex hull area may not be reflective of the state of all members of the group.</s><s>In real experiments, missing data for one or two influencing animals due to temporary GPS failure may also have a large effect on the convex hull area.</s><s>The poor performance of CHA in the test data may also be due to the simplifications of the model (see below: Assessing interactions on experimental data).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> noted that the Couzin model could not replicate the cluster-disperse cycle in animal movement that drove changing convex hull areas in their experiments.</s><s>MDCM performed best probably, in part, due to the inherent smoothing intraspecies effect of the transformation because distances are taken from the species center of mass, which minimizes the effect of spatial outliers.</s></p><p><s>The four methods applied to infer interactions at an individual level (DNN, DPP, DCM, VTA) performed poorly in uncovering the exact structure of the test data interaction matrices.</s><s>The transformations DPP and DNN, in particular, were unexpectedly poor.</s><s>DPP is based on the distance an animal moved from a previous position, and in view of our results it seems a poor criterion to capture the movement of the simulated data movement, given that the networks created were highly disconnected.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, however, used this criterion to reconstruct a state-space to model the flocking behavior in flight of pigeons with nonlinear basis functions to capture interaction behaviour.</s><s>The fact that DNN and DPP are bad performers may be an indication that linear models within the Granger causality tests are not adequate to capture the true behaviour at the resolution of individual animals.</s><s>This shortcoming of Granger causality has been recognized and palliative measures have been suggested to better deal with nonlinearity.</s><s>These include information theory measures such as transfer entropy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref> and statespace methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>.</s><s>The other two methods applied (DCM, VTA) enabled the creation of networks with large connected components but not as expected by the construction rules of the simulated relationship matrices (see, Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> for VTA on test Data 2).</s><s>However, they were able to capture the levels of intra-and inter-species interactions embedded in the relationship matrices, which again reinforce the idea that the methods used perform better to infer interspecies than inter-individual relationships.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Movement model limitations</head><p><s>Before discussing the results of applying the different methods to our experimental data on sheep and deer movement, we should highlight the limitations of the simulation model used here to replicate actual sheep and deer movements.</s><s>We reiterate that the purpose of the model was to investigate if the structure of the embedded relationship matrices could be recovered using our methods and was not to propose a realistic animal movement model.</s><s>Nevertheless, it is instructive to discuss some of the shortfalls of the model and its assumptions so that better and more appropriate models can be proposed in future.</s></p><p><s>The model makes many simplifications in its structure, such as not allowing for different animal states, e.g.</s><s>grazing activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, changes in distance travelled, temporal simultaneous orientation and attraction, or orientation and repulsion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>In reality there may be different values of movement speed (v) based on species, underpinned by differences in body size and energy requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>, and different values of r r , r o and r a for each species <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and for inter-and intra-species interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, updating of the position based only on the direction, velocity and previous position does not allow for accounting for the effect of physical environmental factors on behaviour, such as the circadian rhythm.</s><s>However, the model used is general enough to capture basic animal movement behaviours in order to test the effectiveness of the approach taken to produce scalar time series by either species or individual animals from the data.</s></p><p><s>One of the issues with recording time series of animal movement is the selection of the appropriate time interval at which animal positions are collected <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>.</s><s>To infer different behaviours one might need the use of different time intervals, or the same behavior might need different time intervals with respect to different species.</s><s>When it is feasible to select different time intervals of data gathering, a way to avoid making assumptions on the most appropriate interval is to assess the robustness of the results against interval changes.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> assessed how GPS fixes acquisition interval was instrumental to capture complex social dynamics in sheep movement around parturition.</s><s>At short time intervals their models were able to predict how likely a ewe changed its dynamic social unit, but the longer the interval the less reliable was the prediction.</s><s>Thus an additional task to ask of any simulated model is to test the effect of different sampling schemes on the proposed methods.</s></p><p><s>[21] used convex hull area as a measure for the clustering and dispersion behaviours of sheep.</s><s>They found that sheep slowly disperse (increasing convex hull area) before rapidly forming into a tight cluster (sudden decrease in convex hull area) before slowly dispersing again with a period of around 10 minutes.</s><s>Our experimental data in use is hourly and we sampled the simulation to mimic this situation, and so social structures with shorter time-span will not be adequately captured in the CHA time series transformation measure.</s><s>This effect also means that any time-span trends that occur in the spread of sheep due to the behaviour of the other species will have a large amount of noise depending on where in the cluster-disperse cycle of sheep the data was captured.</s></p><p><s>Another issue to consider is the effect of spatial scale on movement behaviour.</s><s>Under spatial restrictions, such as experimental plots or in larger areas where animals are attracted by preferred resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, frequent interaction between species that compete for resources is likely and the need for finer resolution (more frequently sampled) time series is less crucial than in conditions when species interact with less frequency.</s><s>The flexibility of GPS technology allows for very short intervals between fixes but at a cost of battery life, so careful planning is needed to balance detailed time series and battery life, especially when GPS time deployment should be maximized because animal handling (to recharge collars) is logistically difficult or impossible.</s><s>These considerations are important not only for logistical experimental design but in meta-analysis that use results from studies carried out in very different conditions, possibly making comparison difficult or even incomparable.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessing interactions on experimental data</head><p><s>The results clearly indicate that interaction between sheep and deer is more complex than

and bite depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</s><s>On these premises it would be predicted that in our data set larger red deer (92 kg) graze on a higher sward than smaller sheep (47 kg) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> facilitating grazing for sheep, and consequently, deer driving sheep movement.</s><s>However, with reference to Table <ref type="table">5</ref> which itself is a summary of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> for CHA and other time series tables (not shown), at the species-level analysis this prediction was only supported by 17% of the tests (11 of the 64 entries).</s><s>Almost 13% of these tests across the different data segments and time series transformation methods supported the opposite, i.e., sheep drives the movement of deer.</s><s>Moreover, 14% of the tests show that the interaction between sheep and deer is symmetric, and in 56% of the cases no significant inter-species interaction could be detected.</s><s>It is worth noting that the methods showed a bias for non-detection on the test data and the figure of 56% is reported assuming all methods were equally good at detecting interaction if it exists.</s><s>We have also chosen to report the results of all methods investigated and not just the "good" or "bad" methods which would lower or increase the success rate.</s></p><p><s>It is relevant to note the fact that within each transformation method the nature of the inter-species interaction was not consistent across different time series segments, nor did we observe consistency of the methods performance between the testing and the actual data.</s><s>This suggests three main explanations, (i) the movement drivers of the actual data are more complex than those used to create the testing data, (ii) the driving dynamics of inter-species interactions change across time, a possible seasonal and resource effect, and (iii) the levels of interaction forces vary across individuals of the same and different species, as corroborated by the lack of consistency in the nature of the interactions across MDNN k-values, and by the byindividual methods.</s><s>In general, the inconsistency of the methods on the real data and as supported by the testing data results suggests the weakness of the approach is the number of false negatives-not always detecting a genuine interactions-as opposed to the number of false positives-detecting a spurious interaction.</s></p><p><s>Since more than half of the tests carried out did not detect any significant interaction it may be interpreted as sheep and deer do not interact strongly.</s><s>Although this is possible, this interpretation should be taken with precaution.</s><s>Consider the following situation in which there is behavioural synchronization between species, for example, in rumination bouts or night resting.</s><s>The methods would be more likely to detect bouts of no significant interaction since little new information to predict one species behaviour is available from the behaviour of the other species.</s><s>On the other hand if the within species behaviour is highly synchronized, this can also produce bouts of no significant interaction that depend only on the behaviour of one species, for example, when one species lie down regardless of the other moving away.</s></p><p><s>Sheep and red deer commonly graze in large numbers within grass-heather dominated mosaic areas in northern Britain and other parts of Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</s><s>In a grass-heather mosaic and under controlled conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> found that both red deer and sheep consumed similar proportions of grass and heather year round, even when grass availability declined.</s><s>Only small differences in the use of the mosaic were found with sheep showing preferences in the use of small grass patches whereas deer make spatial use of grass and heather patches more evenly.</s><s>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> did not carry out a spatial analysis to assess for species interaction they suggested that due to their tight range overlap the overall patterns of foraging behaviour by sheep and deer were little affected by the presence or absence of the other species.</s><s>Our results support these findings, as we have not found clear evidence or consistency across different methods of analysis that one species drives the movement behaviour of the other species.</s></p><p><s>Our actual data is affected by two main factors of noise, (i) the number of GPS marked animals varied between some of the time series segments (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), (ii) not all animals in the experimental plot were GPS marked.</s><s>The latter was especially true in the case of sheep when on average there were 31% of individuals marked vs. 80% in deer.</s><s>This was a compromise in the experimental design between a large size plot, similar grazing densities to the ones found in open hill farming systems and the number of GPS units available.</s><s>The effect of the variation in the number of animals across the experiment was controlled by creating different time series segments that were homogeneous in the number of animals and applying the methods to each segment separately.</s><s>The fact that only part of the population was marked could not be controlled in the analyses, but we assumed that in most real situations only a small part of the population can be marked and conclusions have to be derived from the data.</s></p><p><s>Our results suggest that methods which assess the interaction based on proximity, rather than on topological metrics, provide results easy to interpret in terms of behavioural interaction and can facilitate their incorporation on to layers of geographical information, such as vegetation communities, mosaic fragmentation, land cover, which adds extra
