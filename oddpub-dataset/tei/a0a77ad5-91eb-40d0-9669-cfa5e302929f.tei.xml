<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Urticaria is a disease characterized by the development of wheals (hives), angioedema or both.</s><s>Chronic urticaria (CU) is defined by the appearance of these signs and symptoms for ≥6 weeks and is categorized into two main types: chronic spontaneous urticaria (CsU) and chronic inducible urticaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>CsU is thought to affect 0.5-1% of the global population at any given time, accounting for approximately twothirds of all cases of CsU.</s><s>Chronic Urticaria can have a considerable burden on patients, healthcare systems and society <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Different studies have evaluated the economic impact of CsU and a total annual cost of $ 2047 per patient has been estimated, with indirect costs accounted for 15.7% ($322) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>More importantly, this disease is commonly associated with an impairment of patients in many aspects of their daily living (e.g.</s><s>their choice of clothes or food) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, with marked impact on their quality of life (QoL) and productivity (e.g.</s><s>impaired work performance, absence from work) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several guidelines, consensus papers, and practice parameters are available for the management of chronic urticaria.</s><s>The leading international guideline is the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for urticaria, which was revised and updated in 2013.</s><s>National practice parameters include those of the US American AAAAI/ACAAI Joint Task Force, which were updated in 2014.</s><s>The recommendations given by all of these documents are similar, although some minor differences exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>For example, the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for urticaria does not recommend H2 antihistamines or first generation antihistamines for CsU, whereas the US practice parameters do <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for urticaria provides a set of specific recommendations for the management of CU.</s><s>For example, they recommend a stepwise approach in the management of CsU, beginning with licensed doses of modern second generation H1antihistamines (sgAHs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> as the first line therapy, which is effective in resolving symptoms in about 40% of patients with CsU <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>As second line therapy, the guideline recommends increasing the doses of sgAHs up to four times the regular doses, if a patient does not respond to first line treatment after 2 weeks.</s><s>For patients non-responsive to higher doses of sgAHs, the guideline recommends the addition of a third-line treatment option such as omalizumab, cyclosporine or montelukast <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recent studies on guideline and awareness in physicians who treat urticaria patients have shown interesting results.</s><s>In one such study, performed in Germany, the level of urticaria guideline knowledge was highest in dermatologists (50.6%) when compared with pediatricians (24.2%) and general physicians (12.6%).</s><s>Physicians who were familiar with the guidelines were significantly more likely to perform useful diagnostic tests such as the ASST (autologous serum skin test).</s><s>However, even in physicians who knew the guideline, the test was still only performed by one of five physicians.</s><s>Physicians who stated to be familiar with the guidelines were less likely to use sedating antihistamines and systemic steroids as a first-and/or second-line treatment, indicating that guideline recommendations may improve the quality of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Most of the studies performed indicate that the knowledge and awareness of guidelines for the management of patients with chronic urticaria is low in physicians who treat them.</s><s>This may be responsible, at least in part, for the fact that more than 70% of the patients had stopped consulting a physician, resigning themselves to self-treatment or simply living with their condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As of now, little is known about the knowledge of urticaria guidelines in physicians in Latin America who treat urticaria patients or about their clinical practice and the impact of guidelines.</s><s>Our study intended to explore the awareness and knowledge of urticaria guidelines in physicians in Ecuador and to better characterize and understand the actual clinical practice for CsU.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>From March 2015 to March 2016 we conducted a crosssectional survey study using a standardized questionnaire.</s><s>This was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Luis Vernaza.</s></p><p><s>The participants were physicians, and this survey covered several topics about CsU: general questions about urticaria (e.g.</s><s>prevalence, duration, and disease activity), questions about the diagnostic and therapeutic management of CsU as well as consequences of insufficient symptom control.</s><s>In addition, questions on how the physicians perceive the patients, self-assessment of the participating physicians and questions concerning the implementation of the current guidelines were also addressed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment</head><p><s>The target populations were general physicians and specialists from Ecuador attending the Respiratory and Allergy Medicine Conference and physicians working in hospitals and private practices in different cities of Ecuador.</s><s>The participation criterion was having a diploma in medicine and being a certified medical doctor.</s><s>When a candidate was identified, we asked if he/she often sees patients with urticaria.</s><s>Once agreed, the data collection team asked for consent and delivered the selfassessment survey.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study survey</head><p><s>The original survey questions were previously developed by an expert panel from Germany.</s><s>It has been successfully pretested for comprehensibility and feasibility in a limited number of physicians (n = 32).</s><s>We used a rigorous method of validation for the translated version of the German questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> which we briefly described.</s><s>Two official translators translated the German version (GV) of the original survey to Spanish.</s><s>Next, the Spanish-language version was translated to German language by a third translator who did not know the original version of the questionnaire.</s><s>Then, the backtranslated German version of the new Spanish-language questionnaire was compared with the original Germanlanguage version.</s><s>Each item on the back-translated German-language version was ranked by 30 individuals who were bilingual and independent of the study team for comparability and similarity of interpretability with the same item on the original German-language version.</s><s>Any translated item with a mean score &gt;3 (seven was the worst agreement and one was the best agreement) was formally reviewed and corrected.</s><s>The revised item was then translated back to German and compared again with the original German-language version of that item.</s><s>This process continued until the mean scores for each item indicated a valid version (&lt;3 on each of the comparability and interpretability rankings, and preferably &lt;2.5 on the interpretability rankings) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In total, the survey consisted of 32 questions, mostly involving Likert-scale ratings, quantitative questions, yes ⁄ no lists and multiple choice questions (the complete survey can be provided upon request).</s><s>Only physicians who reported attending at least one patient at month with idiopathic chronic urticaria were considered for analysis.</s><s>Also, the outliers values of patients reported to be attended with chronic urticaria at last month were excluded of analysis (n = 31, 6.6%).</s><s>After that, the values left blank automatically were treated as missing values, in total, 7.3% of data were missed.</s><s>Further missing value analysis determined that these missing values were random.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Descriptive statistics were employed to compare frequencies and percentages values are given as means and standard deviation (SD), unless specified otherwise.</s><s>We used Chi square test to compare proportions across specialty groups (allergists/dermatologist, general physician, internal medicine, pediatrician, and others) and between physicians who do or do not know the EAACI/ GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for the management of urticaria.</s><s>Finally, adjusted logistic regression was performed to test the association of guideline knowledge and use of second line therapy for confounders (physicians' specialty and location, years in practice, and gender.</s><s>SPSS version 20 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL) was employed.</s><s>A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant for all tests.</s></p></div>
