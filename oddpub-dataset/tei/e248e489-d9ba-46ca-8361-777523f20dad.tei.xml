<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Kainic acid induced seizures result in transient phosphorylation of ERK in the hippocampus which can be blocked by a small molecule MEK inhibitor.</s><s>We triggered seizures in mice to induce strong synchronous neuronal activity in the hippocampus.</s><s>To assess the time course of ERK activation after kainic acid provoked seizures we analysed brain sections of mice sacrificed 5, 15, 30, and 90 minutes after seizure onset.</s><s>The phosphorylation and activation of ERK was monitored by using phospho-site-specific antibodies.</s><s>Immunohistological analysis revealed that phosphorylation of ERK occurs within minutes after seizure onset in the hippocampus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-g</ref>).</s><s>Most intense staining was observed after 5 to 15 minutes and the p-ERK signal was strongly reduced after 90 minutes.</s><s>The granular cell layer and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were predominantly stained (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the mossy fiber zone exhibited strong labelling.</s><s>We observed an increased p-ERK staining in the dendritic layers but not in the cell bodies of pyramidal neurons in CA1-CA3.</s><s>The observed pattern is in agreement with previous results obtained after generalized seizures in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>We immunostained parallel sections of the brains dissected at the different time points after seizure onset for Arc/Arg3.1.</s><s>The activity-induced protein was detectable 90 minutes after seizure onset in the granular cell layer and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cells in CA1-3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h-k</ref>).</s><s>At this time point the p-ERK signal was already reduced.</s><s>Thus, our observations are in accordance with the concept that ERK phosphorylation precedes activity dependent gene expression.</s></p><p><s>Next we analysed the in vivo inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by intraperitoneal injection of the blood-brain barrier-penetrating MEK inhibitor SL327 which has no significant effect on a variety of other kinases such as CAMKII, PKC or PKA <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The inhibitor was applied one hour before kainic acid injections and the animals developed strong seizures.</s><s>Application of the inhibitor resulted in a complete blockade of ERK phosphorylation in the hippocampus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Transcriptome analysis identifies MEK/ERK dependent genes.</s><s>Next we treated mice with vehicle, SL327, kainic acid or SL327 combined with kainic acid and obtained hippocampal tissue for microarray analysis from animals sacrificed 1 hour after seizure onset or from time matched controls.</s><s>In addition, we included in our analysis untreated control animals; mice treated with kainic acid sacrificed 4 and 8 hours after onset of seizures and respective time matched controls treated with vehicle only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>RNA extracted from one hippocampus was hybridized to one microarray, and we measured four replicate animals for the untreated controls and three   <ref type="figure">(c,d</ref>) brain section of a mouse treated with SL327 for 90 minutes; (e,f) brain section of a mouse sacrificed 15 minutes after onset of seizures; (g,h) brain section of a mouse treated with SL327 60 minutes before intraperitoneal kainic acid injections and sacrificed 15 minutes after onset of seizures.</s><s>Note the complete inhibition of hippocampal ERK phosphorylation (g,h).</s><s>CA1, field CA1 of the hippocampus; DG, dentate gyrus.</s><s>time matched replicates for all other treatments.</s><s>Using principle component (PC) analysis of the 1000 top varying genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), we found that expression data from controls and vehicle treated animals group together.</s><s>Kainic acid treatment had the strongest global effect on the transcriptome (change in PC1 and also PC2 at t = 1 h), and the transcriptome showed the strongest response 1 h after treatment.</s><s>Kainic acid treatment with inhibitor or inhibitor alone resulted in hardly any change in the major PC (PC1), but in changes in PC2 similar to kainic acid treatment, suggesting that PC2 contains genes that are regulated whenever MAPK signalling is modulated, regardless of inhibition or activation.</s><s>When using unsupervised clustering on the correlation of transcriptomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>), we found that again controls and vehicle treatment form one cluster, kainic acid treatment forms a second cluster, and inhibitor treatment forms a distinct cluster.</s><s>Taken together, these analyses confirm that expression profiles of parallel treated animals were mostly similar, and that the data clearly separates effects of kainic acid treatment and pathway inhibition.</s></p><p><s>To identify genes robustly induced after seizure we discarded genes with very low expression levels and used a stringent cut-off for differential expression (FDR &lt; 0.05).</s><s>Following this definition, we identified 980 genes induced by neuronal activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>To identify which activity-induced genes are regulated by MEK/ERK signalling, we classified these genes as "inhibitor sensitive" if the presence of the MEK inhibitor significantly attenuated the induction.</s><s>We called those genes that showed an induction in the presence of the inhibitor "seizure induced with inhibitor" and defined genes that were induced by the inhibitor alone.</s><s>Intersecting these groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> left) showed that out of 980 induced genes 190 could not be classified as they were neither significantly induced in the presence of the inhibitor nor significantly affected by the inhibitor.</s><s>Inspection of these genes revealed a moderate induction of expression and statistical testing between groups was not of sufficient power.</s><s>We therefore focus on the 131 significantly induced genes with an induction of at least 0.9 log fold change, of which most could be classified according to our criteria (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a right)</ref>.</s><s>120 of the top 131 activity-regulated genes were classified as inhibitor sensitive.</s><s>Out of these, the majority (97 probe sets corresponding to 89 genes) were not significantly induced in the presence of a MEK inhibitor, therefore we termed these fully MEK signalling dependent genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,b</ref>).</s><s>The identified transcripts comprise a large number of previously described activity-regulated genes, such as Arg3.1/Arc or Homer1, but also poorly characterized genes, non-coding RNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).</s><s>Expression of 23 genes was induced after seizures and their induction was only partially reduced in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>These activity-regulated genes were classified as "partially MEK signalling dependent" and comprise several previously described activity-regulated genes, such as Npas4, Rgs2, Arl4d and Errfi1.</s><s>A small group of seven genes was induced after seizures and this induction was not hampered in the presence of the MEK inhibitor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,e</ref>).</s><s>These activity-regulated genes were classified as "MEK signalling independent".</s><s>Within this group of genes a particular induction pattern was observed, e. g. for the lncRNA Neat1.</s><s>Seizures induce transcript levels of these genes in absence and presence of MEK inhibition and MEK inhibitor treatment alone also resulted in upregulation.</s><s>Such regulation of expression is expected for genes that are regulated by parallel pathways.</s><s>MEK/ERK signalling is known to contain strong negative feedbacks.</s><s>If the MEK/ERK pathway is inhibited, these feedbacks are relieved and can cross-activate parallel pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , and these in turn can induce genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>Two genes in the MEK-independent set (Neat1, Col6a5) and four of the partially MEK dependent genes (Dusp1, Atf3, Cdkn1a and Sik1) showed this regulation albeit with variable strength (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,d,e</ref>).</s><s>In-situ hybridization validates classes of MEK/ERK dependent and independent genes.</s><s>To validate our data, we analysed changes in gene expression by in situ hybridizations of brain sections of mice treated with vehicle, SL327, kainic acid, or SL327 combined with kainic acid.</s><s>Each gene was analysed on sections of three different animals sacrificed 1 h after seizure onset or of time matched controls.</s><s>The in situ hybridization analyses are, except for Btg2 see below, in good accordance with the results obtained from the microarrays and demonstrate that activation of Arc/Arg3.1,</s><s>Arl5b, Gadd45b, Homer1, Inhba, and lincPint transcription in the hippocampus is hampered by MEK inhibition, whereas induction of Arl4d, Npas4, Rgs2, Errfi1 and Btg2 is only partially reduced by the inhibitor, and induction of Ppp1r15a is not effected by MEK inhibition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>In situ hybridizations revealed also the spatial induction pattern of these genes.</s><s>For Arc/Arg3.1 and Gadd45b, we observed that seizures in the presence of the MEK inhibitor resulted in almost complete loss of induction with only modest signal detectable in the CA1 area and an almost complete inhibition in the dentate gyrus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>The expression pattern of the partially MEK dependent genes visualized by in situ hybridization was identical after seizures in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor but expression levels were reduced throughout the hippocampus when the MEK inhibitor was applied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>For Btg2 a strong interanimal variation in the microarray analysis was observed for animals treated with MEK inhibitor and kainic acid (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>) and it was classified as MEK independent.</s><s>Whereas the in situ hybridization analysis rather suggests that Btg2 is partially MEK dependent.</s></p><p><s>To further test the reliability of the microarray analysis we investigated the expression of Zwint.</s><s>Its induction has a log fold change below 0.9.</s><s>Therefore, it was excluded due to our criteria.</s><s>Otherwise it would have been classified as a MEK dependent activity-regulated gene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>In situ hybridizations corroborated the microarray results and Zwint expression was hardly detectable under control conditions, not induced by the inhibitor, but induced by seizures.</s><s>The inhibitor prevented the induction although transcript levels were slightly higher than in controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>In conclusion, in situ hybridization analysis of 13 genes confirms the induction patterns observed in our microarray analysis.</s></p><p><s>LincPint, a novel activity dependent long non-coding transcript.</s><s>We identified lincPint, a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) as activity-regulated MEK dependent transcript, which has so far not been described as regulated by neuronal activity (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 and 5</ref>).</s><s>To compare the expression of lincPint with known activity-regulated genes, we investigated its expression at different time points after seizure onset.</s><s>Hippocampi of mice sacrificed 1, 4, or 8 hours after seizure onset were subjected to microarray analysis.</s><s>In addition, animals were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 hours after seizure onset and brain sections were analysed by in situ hybridizations.</s><s>LincPint is expressed on a low level in most regions of the brain and induced by seizures in the hippocampus with maximal induction after 1 hour (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>LincPint transcripts are evenly induced in the hippocampus and downregulated to basal levels already 4 h after seizure onset.</s><s>The induction kinetic was similar to the induction of Arl5b and Npas4.</s><s>Other activity-regulated genes, such as Arc/Arg3.1,</s><s>Inhba, and Rgs2 are induced for a longer time period.</s><s>Inhba presents a complex hippocampal expression pattern that changes between the dentate gyrus and the CA1 area over time.</s><s>The expression pattern of Rgs2 changes as well after induction.</s><s>Expression is strongly induced 1 h after seizures in the dentate gyrus and in CA1, reduced already 2 h after seizures, evenly distributed in the hippocampus after 4 h, after 8 h strongly expressed in CA3, and reduced to baseline level after 24 h.</s><s>We analysed as well the induction kinetic of the MEK independent gene Ppp1r15a and observed an induction in the hippocampus 1 and 2 hours after seizure onset followed by a rapid reduction of expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Alternatively spliced variants of the lncRNA Neat1 are differentially regulated by MAPK/ ERK.</s><s>We identified the lnc RNA Neat1 (nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1), also named MEN, as an activity-regulated transcript (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>Neat1 is expressed as two splice variants differing in length.</s><s>One, named Neat1_1 or MEN-β , has been previously described as an abundant 3.2 kb transcript and the other, named Neat1_2 or MEN-ε , as a less abundant 20 kb transcript <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Our microarray analysis suggested a very low expression level of Neat1_2 and in contrast a moderate and 3-4 times higher expression level of Neat1_1 in the murine hippocampus.</s><s>In agreement, the short isoform was detected by radioactive in situ hybridization in the brain after 7 days of exposure, but the long isoform was undetectable at this exposure-time and became detectable after 30 days exposure.</s><s>We observed an activity-dependent induction of both variants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>).</s><s>Predominant induction in the dentate gyrus of the short variant, Neat1_1, lasted for 1 to 4 hours after seizure onset and was MEK dependent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b,c</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, induction of the long variant, Neat1_2, lasted longer and was MEK independent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b,c</ref>).</s><s>The spatial distribution of the Neat1_2 transcripts after induction was dynamic.</s><s>Neat1_2 expression was restricted to the dentate gyrus 1 to 4 h after seizure.</s><s>8 and 24 h after seizure transcripts were more dispersed over the hippocampus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref>).</s><s>The expression of Neat1_2 after vehicle treatment was not detectable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>).</s><s>Increased Neat1_2 expression after MEK inhibition, after seizures, and after combination of MEK inhibition and seizures was detected by microarray analysis.</s><s>In situ hybridizations revealed a distinct and differential spatial induction in the fimbria of the hippocampus and paraventricular areas and only minor induction in the hippocampus after inhibitor application only.</s><s>This expression pattern resembled the expression of Neat1_1 under control conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>).</s><s>Seizures alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor resulted in a distinct induction of Neat1_2 in the dentate gyrus.</s><s>The observed activity-regulated expression of Neat1 variants and their differential regulation by the ERK signalling pathway links this pathway to the regulation of activity-dependent alternative splicing.</s></p></div>

machinery.</s><s>We validated the activity regulated induction of the MEK independent gene Ppp1r15a (protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15a, which is also named growth-arrest-and DNA-damage-induced transcript 34, Gadd34).</s><s>Ppp1r15a and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) form a complex that dephosphorylates eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2α (eIF2α ) which is regarded as a critical step in restoring general protein synthesis and promotes cell recovery from stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>In addition, PP1 plays a role in modulating synaptic plasticity <ref

both identified groups of MEK dependent and partially MEK dependent genes.</s><s>This corroborates the notion that CREB is one MAPK/ERK target.</s><s>However, CREB can be also activated through other signaling pathways and conversely MAPK/ERK targets also other transcription factors.</s><s>Accordingly, certain transcription factors can be modulated by alternative kinase signalling pathways to regulate broad and complex genetic programs.</s></p><p><s>The present survey analyzed hippocampal gene induction provoked by chemically induced seizures.</s><s>Our validation experiments employing in situ hybridization of brain sections revealed induction of some transcripts in brain areas other than the hippocampus, e.g.</s><s>Arc/Arg3.1,</s><s>Rgs2, and Npas4 were as well induced in the cerebral cortex, the amygdala, and the striatum although to varying degrees.</s><s>In these brain areas most but not all of the activity-regulated induction appeared MEK dependent suggesting brain region-specific modulation of MAPK/ ERK signaling.</s><s>A number of studies demonstrated a requirement for MAPK/ERK activity in several forms of plasticity in the hippocampus, but as well in the amygdala, the striatum and the cerebral cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>However, the precise modulators of the signaling pathway and the targets for MAPK/ERK in each of the different brain regions might differ.</s></p><p><s>ERK signalling has been shown to induce changes in the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity in hippocampal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> and to regulate epigenetic changes by modulating histones <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Both mechanisms may underlie chromosomal decondensation which is required for transcriptional changes.</s><s>Remodelling of chromosomal DNA depends on posttranslational modifications of

target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>The role of MAPK/ERK in histone H3 phosphorylation has been extensively investigated.</s><s>Moreover, there is accumulating evidence that phosphatases such as PP1 are also important determinants in this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to protein coding transcripts, we identified activity-regulated long non-coding (lnc) RNAs.</s><s>Dynamic expression profiles of several lncRNA after hippocampal LTP induction have been demonstrated recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>LncRNAs have been suggested as nuclear key factors that organize nuclear sub-structures, modulate chromatin state, and regulate gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>We demonstrate MEK dependent activity-regulated expression of the lncRNA lincPint and visualize its inducible expression pattern in the brain.</s><s>LincPint is ubiquitously expressed and knockout mice are reduced in size and body weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>LincPint localizes to the nucleus and interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2).</s><s>PRC2 represses gene expression by catalysing methylation of histones and modulating chromatin structure.</s><s>LincPint alters PRC2 binding to specific genomic loci <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>Expression of anti-sense oligos against lincPint in MEF cells resulted in upregulation of the activity regulated genes Arc/Arg3.1,</s><s>Gadd45b, and

specific gene transcription to downregulate genes following their induction together with lincPint.</s></p><p><s>In addition, we identified Neat1 as an activity dependent lncRNA and find that splice variants of Neat1 are differentially regulated by MAPK/ERK.</s><s>It has been shown previously that Neat1 is ubiquitously expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> and transcripts are increased in human epileptic brain and in depolarized human neuroblastoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref> .</s><s>Neat1 localizes exclusively to paraspeckles and serves as an architectural component of these nuclear bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> .</s><s>The cell nucleus contains distinct classes of subnuclear bodies, inlcuding nucleoli, paraspeckles, splicing speckles, Cajal bodies, and PML bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52</ref> .</s><s>The latter have been shown to be dynamically modulated in number and size by seizures and PML bodies have been suggested to be associated with activity-dependent nuclear alterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref> .</s><s>A proposed function of paraspeckles is subnuclear sequestration of nuclear proteins, the regulation of expression of adenosine-to-inosine hyper-edited mRNAs and nuclear retention of target transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> .</s><s>The knockdown of Neat1 leads to the disintegration of paraspeckles <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b56">56</ref> , we observed a low expression of Neat1_1 in the brain where expression of Neat1_2 was barely detectable.</s><s>We demonstrate the MEK dependent induction of Neat1_1 in the dentate gyrus after seizures.</s><s>Neat1_2 expression is undetectable under control conditions and can be induced already by MEK inhibition alone.</s><s>The pattern of expression resembled that of the shorter form under control conditions.</s><s>The induction of Neat1_2 by neuronal activity is independent of MEK and lasts longer than the induction of Neat1_1.</s><s>These findings indicate that MAPK/ERK signalling suppresses expression of Neat1_2 under control conditions, but nevertheless can be induced by synaptic activity.</s><s>In contrast, under control conditions the basal expression of the shorter splice variant is MAPK/ ERK independent but induction following neuronal activity is strictly dependent on MAPK/ERK activation.</s><s>This substantiates that MAPK/ERK signalling conveys activity dependent differential splicing of Neat1.</s><s>This in turn might underlie activity dependent nuclear transformations.</s></p></div>
