postrandomization and prior to starting the case assessments, they received a training case.</s></p><p><s>The 6 diagnostic performance cases were presented in random order.</s><s>Each case started with a video presentation of a prototypical patient.</s><s>Thereafter, participants could select, in any order, from 30 diagnostic tests as many as desired, but were instructed to be as fast and accurate as possible.</s><s>Results were presented as real-world clinical data (eg, auscultation sounds or x-ray images).</s><s>To complete a case, participants had to select 1 of 20 diagnoses and indicate their confidence.</s></p><p><s>Dependent variables were diagnostic accuracy (correct or incorrect), number and relevance of diagnostic tests (obtained from expert data 3 ), time to diagnoses, time tests would take in reality, and confidence (on a Likert scale from 1 = least to 10 = most confident).</s><s>Before the main task, participants took a multiple-choice test about respiratory diseases to check whether knowledge about the topic differed between groups (individual vs pairs).</s></p><p><s>A required sample size of 117 was determined, assuming the pairs would correctly diagnose 1 more case (α = 0.05, β = 0.2, dropout = 5%).</s><s>The study design was approved by the Charité Medical School institutional review board.</s><s>We conducted t tests for confidence (within pairs), participant characteristics, accuracy, and relevant knowledge (between conditions), and analyses of variance for all other analyses in SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc) with a 2-sided significance level of P &lt; .05.</s></p><p><s>Results | Of 88 students recruited, 28 worked individually and 60 in pairs.</s><s>Participant characteristics did not differ between groups.</s><s>Pairs were more accurate than individuals (67.78% vs 50.00%; difference, 17.78% [95% CI, 5.83%-29.73%];</s><s>P = .004)</s><s>despite having comparable knowledge about the topic and selecting an equal number of diagnostic tests (Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s><s>Pairs selected more relevant tests on average, but did so only when incorrect.</s></p><p><s>Pairs needed 2:02 minutes (95% CI, 1:37 to 2:28 minutes) longer than individuals to reach a diagnosis, but their selected tests would have taken 6:15 minutes (95% CI, −12:08 to −0:21 minutes) less in reality.</s><s>Pairs were more confident than individuals, but their confidence was not better calibrated (same difference between correct and incorrect cases).</s><s>Within pairs, confidence between participants differed more when incorrect than when correct (1.79 vs 1.16; difference, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.12 to 1.13]; P = .02).</s></p><p><s>In addition, to assess whether pairs might perform better because they are statistically more likely to contain a knowledgeable member, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> we randomly paired all participants of the individual group into 28 simulated pairs and used the performance of the more confident member as this pair's performance.</s><s>The procedure was repeated 1000 times and performance averaged.</s><s>The accuracy of simulated pairs was comparable with individuals (mean, 56.73%;
