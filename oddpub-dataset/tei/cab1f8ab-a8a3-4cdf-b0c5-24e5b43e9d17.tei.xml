cytosol.</s><s>Malfunctions of ~100 GPCRs are known to be associated with different human diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, including inflammation, infertility, metabolic and neurological disorders, viral infections, and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and mutations in the thyrotropin receptor are most frequently associated with the occurrence of cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, nearly 20% of tumors harbor mutations in GPCRs, and ~10% of cancer-related mutations have been mapped to G proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Related work has not only concentrated on the physiological or pathophysiological mechanisms and pharmaceutical aspects of GPCR action but has also been extended to include stem cell research <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, in this context, 365 nonolfactory human GPCRs are treated as potential drug targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and ~40% of approved drugs target GPCRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Endogenous cues or drugs (agonists) that bind to the extracellular domain or to the upper part of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the GPCR activate the receptors by inducing conformational changes, the exact mechanism of which remains elusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>However, it is believed that some of the intramolecular constraints that stabilize the receptor's inactive (ground) state are removed, and structural flexibility is induced within the intracellular domain (ICD).</s><s>Endowed with the ability to explore a broader conformational space, the ICD of an activated GPCR may exist as an assembly of alternating conformations (conformers).</s><s>Some of these ICD conformers have surface epitopes that are exposed and hence are accessible for interaction with distinct effector molecules such as G proteins and arrestins.</s><s>These active conformers become stabilized and enriched by forming complexes with the effector molecule (affinity selection).</s><s>In this respect, agonist-induced ICD flexibility represents a crucial element of the GPCR activation process.</s></p><p><s>Signal routing from a GPCR to the intracellular effector molecules is dictated by the identity of the receptor-interacting G proteins, but many receptors couple to more than one G protein isoform.</s><s>The coupling can vary in a temporary, tissue-or ligand-specific manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>Dissecting GPCR signaling on the basis of which pathways are activated will shed new light on the mechanism of hormonal action, which in turn will enable the development of novel strategies for the treatment of GPCR-related disorders, and more efficient and safer therapeutics that act in a signalpathway-specific manner.</s></p><p><s>Attempts to elucidate the exact nature of a receptor's active state have been compromised by the apparent inability of agonists to stabilize a receptor in a corresponding active conformation, which supports the idea that G proteins play active roles in stabilizing a receptor's active state via affinity selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>A breakthrough in the field was achieved with the first crystallographic determination of the structure of the b2-adrenoceptor (b2-AR) in an active conformation stabilized by a G protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>The structure helped elucidate the nature of the conformational changes associated with activation of the receptor, and revealed that the GPCR/G protein complex interface is formed by the receptor's intracellular loop 2 (ICL-2) and the juxtamembrane regions of the transmembrane helices 5 and 6 (TM5 and TM6).</s><s>However, the structure of the complex did not provide new insight into the molecular mechanism governing the selectivity of GPCR/G protein recognition.</s><s>For instance, a comparison of b2-AR sequences involved in the formation of the GPCR/G-(s) interface with corresponding sequences from other G-(s)-coupled receptors led to no consensus.</s><s>Moreover, both G-(s) and G-(i) isoforms effectively couple to b2-AR, despite the fact that the Ga-(s) and Ga-(i) subunits have only five amino acids in common among the 21 amino acids that constitute the b2-AR/G-(s) complex interface, and the majority of these five amino acids are located in the C-terminus, which is a highly conserved region among all G protein isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The crystal structure of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor was published in 2012 by <ref type="bibr">Kruse et al. (20)</ref>, who then compared the structural features of the existing GPCR crystal structures in an attempt to identify differences in the ICD of GPCRs specific to G-(i), G-(q), or G-(s).</s><s>In the GPCRs analyzed, the authors found a correlation between the selectivity of G-protein coupling and the distance between the intracellular termini of TM5 and TM6.</s><s>This finding is consistent with the idea that the selectivity of GPCR/G protein recognition is determined by both specific interresidue interactions and features related to the overall three-dimensional conformation of the ICD <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>It appears, therefore, that to elucidate the fundamentals of the selectivity of GPCR/G protein recognition, a comprehensive analysis of the structure-activity relationships of multiple GPCR complexes with different G protein isoforms is required.</s><s>However, enormous technical difficulties associated with the isolation of functional receptors in quantities required for direct structural studies effectively impede progress in the field.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we addressed this problem by constructing functional mimetics of the GPCR ICD.</s><s>We demonstrated that by using a soluble scaffold that furnishes peptides derived from the GPCR ICD with spatial constraints similar to those found in native receptors, we were able to facilitate the reconstitution of a native-like G protein-recognition epitope.</s></p><p><s>As a model GPCR, we used thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), a GPCR that has well-documented promiscuous G protein-coupling behavior and is able to activate all known G protein isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>The respective physiological/pathological consequences of the activation of individual isoforms of G proteins by TSHR, however, remain unclear.</s><s>The gene encoding for TSHR is highly mutable <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, and TSHR mutations have been identified as a cause of acquired, hereditary, and congenital thyroid diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Multiple mutations known to affect TSHR functions, both artificial and naturally occurring, have been shown to alter the profile of G protein coupling of this receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Some of these mutations have been mapped to ICL-2 and ICL-3, which are the ICD elements that are directly involved in G protein recognition and activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>The unique functional properties of TSHR make it a well-suited model for studying the structural determinants of GPCR/G protein recognition.</s></p></div>

by an activated b 2 -AR and the G-(s) protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>An artificial protein designated 6-Helix, which is a bundle composed of six a-helices connected by short flexible linkers (Gly/Ser), was derived from the elements of a trimer-of-hairpins structure of the HIV glycoprotein gp41 (formed by the NH 2 -and COOH-terminal regions of three gp41 molecules) assembled during the virus-cell fusion process <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>6-Helix is an exceptionally stable protein that can be produced in high quantities in a bacterial

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional properties of 6-Helix-based TSHR-ICD mimetics</head><p><s>Guided by the structure of the b-AR/G-(s) protein complex, we identified 6-Helix, a six-a-helix bundle protein that is characterized on one side (side III) by a helical termini topology similar to that found on the intracellular side of the TMD of an activated GPCR.</s><s>In the side III-based TSHR ICD mimetic, the ICL-2 and ICL-3 inserts contributed synergistically to the mimetic's ability to stimulate Ga-(s)-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the presence of the ICL-2 and ICL-3 elements in the side III mimetics resulted in only a mild or no structural perturbation the a-helical core.</s><s>In contrast, in the side II mimetics, in which a native-like placement of the ICL elements is not possible, a pronounced destabilization of the helical core resulted.</s><s>Accordingly, the side II ICD mimetics bound the G protein with a significantly lower affinity than the side III mimetics.</s><s>Altogether, these results are consistent with the idea that in the side III mimetics, the ICL elements assume a distinct conformation that is efficient in both binding and activating the target G protein.</s><s>Thus, by endowing individual ICD sequences with native-like spatial constraints, one can facilitate the reconstitution of a composite G protein-recognition epitope.</s></p><p><s>The bg subunits are known to play a regulatory role in G protein signaling.</s><s>In the absence of an activated receptor, the bg subunits attenuate GDP dissociation from the Ga subunit, preventing its subsequent activation by GTP, and therefore they are required for efficient GPCR/G protein coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, using isolated Ga subunits in the analysis of steady-state kinetics of GTP hydrolysis may result in an underestimation of the ability of the ICD mimetics to stimulate GTPase activity.</s></p><p><s>In cell-based assays, the TSHR exhibited a broad G protein-coupling profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, however, the 6-Helix-based TSHR ICD mimetics were able to recognize and activate the G-(s) isoform, but failed to do so with the G-(q) and G-(i) isoforms.</s><s>To interpret these results, one should take several important considerations into account.</s></p><p><s>First, this study was carried out using isolated Ga subunits.</s><s>According to the crystal structure of the b-AR/Ga(s)bg complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>, the bg subunits are not directly involved in the formation of the GPCR/G protein interface.</s><s>However, because of the stabilizing effect of the bg subunits on the Ga structure, we cannot rule out the possibility that their presence affected the selectivity of GPCR/G protein recognition.</s></p><p><s>Second, a comparative analysis of the structural features in a manifold of GPCR crystal structures led Kruse et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> to conclude that one of the factors affecting the selectivity of GPCR/G protein coupling is the distance between the intracellular termini of TM5 and TM6.</s><s>According to this study, distances of 9-10, 10-12, and 13-14 A ˚are characteristic of G-(q/11), G-(s), and G-(i/o)-coupled receptors, respectively.</s><s>In the case of TSHR (or any other receptor with a broad profile of G protein coupling), this implies that signal routing would require the action of several biased agonists to regulate the TM5-to-TM6 distance.</s><s>For TSHR, however, biased endogenous agonists are so far unknown, leading to the speculation that upon activation, the receptor undergoes a complete relaxation of the ICD to enable competitive binding of various G protein isoforms on the basis of affinity selection modulated by the availability of particular effectors.</s><s>The idea of complete ICD relaxation under activation entails the possibility that a relatively small number of interhelical constraints stabilize the promiscuous receptors in their inactive (ground) state compared with the receptors with a narrow G protein-coupling profile.</s><s>This is consistent with experimental observations that the TSHR is particularly susceptible to mutations that result in constitutive receptor activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the side III 6-Helix ICD mimetics, the distance between the termini of the helices corresponding to the receptor's TM5 and TM6 (to which the ICL-3 element is attached) is ~11-12 A ˚(measured in an equilibrated structure of the 6-Helix scaffold; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In the mimetics, the ICL-3 sequence is attached to the helical termini through flexible linkers (GGSGG), softening the distance constraints imposed by the scaffold.</s><s>The presence of excessive flexibility in the linkers, however, may have an unpredictable effect of trapping the ICD structure in a certain conformation compatible with binding of a specific G protein isoform (G-(s) in this case).</s><s>Research is ongoing to examine the effect of structural flexibility on the specificity of G protein recognition by constructing a panel of TSHR ICD mimetics in which flexible linker(s) are replaced by sequences predisposed to the formation of rigid a-helical structures (e.g., poly-Ala).</s></p><p><s>Third, although according to the structure of the b2-AR/ G-(s) complex, the ICL-1 and the C-terminal helix-8 (H8) are not part of the GPCR/G protein interface, increasing evidence indicates that the role of these ICD elements in G protein binding may not be dispensable.</s><s>For instance, in rhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> and muscarinic M1R <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, H8 was shown to be important for G-protein coupling, and the H8 of the muscarinic M3R cross-linked to Ca-(q) in an agonistdependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, an NMR study of activated m-opioid receptor suggested that ICL-1 and H8 may play roles in the initial interaction with the G-protein, whereas the engagement of TM5 and TM6 occurs during later steps of the complex formation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the formation of the GPCR/G protein complex may be a multistep process in which different elements of the ICD engage the effector G protein sequentially.</s><s>In sequential binding, the intermediate interaction steps may kinetically facilitate the formation of the final complex by presenting the G protein in a correct orientation to its ultimate binding epitope.</s><s>In each of these putative intermediate steps, selectivity filters that ultimately affect the specificity of G protein coupling may apply.</s><s>In this case, our ICD mimetics lacking both ICL-1 and H8 would be deficient in their ability to recapitulate G protein binding specificity correctly.</s></p><p><s>Fourth, the results may reflect a real paradigm of TSHR/G protein coupling.</s><s>Simultaneous activation of both G-(s) and G-(i) signaling pathways in the same cell would apparently be counterproductive, and it is conceivable that these processes are resolved in time.</s><s>A possible sequence of events may include G-(s) activation followed by an alteration of the receptor's structure by a third-party effector molecule (e.g., a cAMP-dependent kinase) that renders the receptor competent for G-(i) coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>A switch in the receptor's coupling specificity may also be achieved by the recruitment of an auxiliary protein(s) that promotes specific GPCR/G protein interactions.</s></p><p><s>A long-known phenomenon of TSHR-mediated signaling is the different potencies with which TSH activates the G-(s) and G-(q) signaling pathways, with the G-(q) pathway requiring higher receptor occupancy than the G-(s) pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>A similar phenomenon has been reported for some other GPCRs, including those for calcitonin <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref> and secretin <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>.</s><s>Allen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref> demonstrated that in a spare receptor-free system, the difference in potencies could be explained by homodimerization of TSHRs.</s><s>According to the authors, stimulation of G-(s)-mediated cAMP formation requires TSH binding to only one of the monomers in the preexisting homodimer, whereas activation of G-(q)mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis requires both TSHR monomers to be occupied by the hormone.</s><s>There is also a possibility that the receptor dimerization is TSH dependent, with Ga-(s)-coupled monomers prevailing at low TSH concentrations and Ga-(q)-coupled dimers prevailing at high TSH concentrations.</s><s>Thus, G protein coupling specificity may depend on the oligomeric state of the receptor, a feature that may not be easily recapitulated by the ICD mimetics.</s></p></div>
