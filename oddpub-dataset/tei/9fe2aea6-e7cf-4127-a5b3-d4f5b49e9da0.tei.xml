<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The present study shows a complex relationship between EASI and oSCORAD/SCORAD and several limitations of both measures.</s><s>Xerosis and/or oozing/weeping were associated with significantly higher oSCORAD, but low EASI.</s><s>This is because xerosis and oozing/weeping are scored in oS-CORAD, but not in EASI.</s><s>Patients with low EASI had higher oSCORAD secondary to localized moderate-severe lesions, and higher POEM scores.</s><s>EASI assesses 4 AD signs and weights them to the BSA-affecting 4 sites.</s><s>oSCORAD/ SCORAD assesses 6 AD signs separately from BSA, with representative lesional intensity comprising 76%/61% of the total score.</s><s>Thus, patients with localized moderate-severe lesions may have high oSCORAD, but low EASI.</s><s>Selection of a representative lesion in oSCORAD/SCORAD might bias toward reporting more severe disease.</s><s>However, this does not appear to be the case because oSCORAD/SCORAD showed a closer relationship with POEM than with EASI.</s><s>EASI and SCORAD were not perfectly correlated with POEM.</s><s>Although each of these is a validated AD outcome measure, it may be that no single assessment is adequate for assessing the full severity and/or burden of AD.</s><s>Of note, the 3 signs most closely associated with patient-reported AD severity (erythema, excoriation, and edema/papulation) 5 are present in EASI and oSCORAD/SCORAD.</s></p><p><s>Low EASI scores encompass a heterogeneous group of patients, including some having fairly extensive milder lesions and localized moderate-severe lesions.</s><s>Studies of mild AD that use low EASI scores as an inclusion criterion may enroll a diverse mixture of patients with different extent and lesional severity.</s><s>These results shed light on the interpretation of EASI scores in the mild range.</s><s>Previous interpretability studies found that EASI scores of 0 to 7.0 encompass almost clear or mild AD, 6 yet this encompasses a heterogeneous group of patients.</s><s>In EASI, the lowest surface area category is quite broad at 1% to 9% and equally weights cases with a 1-cm plaque or 9% of the body site affected.</s><s>EASI may be a poorer measurer than oSCORAD when assessing patients with more limited disease.</s><s>Alternatively, it is possible that oSCORAD/SCORAD is a poor measure of mild disease with too broad a range of values.</s><s>We believe this to be less likely, because unlike EASI, the oS-CORAD/SCORAD scores had linear relationships with POEM.</s><s>Nevertheless, inclusion of xerosis in the oSCORAD/ SCORAD might reduce its responsiveness, because xerosis may be present in the absence of active AD lesions.</s><s>Moreover, assessing xerosis can be challenging in clinical trials because it varies by the frequency, vehicle, and time of last application of emollients/moisturizers.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the present results provide further support for the inclusion of oSCORAD and/or SCORAD in addition to EASI in clinical trials.</s><s>oSCORAD/SCORAD correlated better with POEM than did EASI.</s><s>However, the merits of assessing both EASI and SCORAD in trials has to be weighed against the excess burden of data collection for investigators and patients, as well as difficulties in training investigators in how to assess both scales.</s></p></div>

_1step improvement in their PatGAdisease control rating from baseline to follow-up) and ''not improved'' disease control (defined as an unchanged or worsened PatGA-disease control rating).</s><s>Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity of each possible cutoff point for UCT score changes indicating ''improved disease control'' was computed.</s><s>In addition, the sum of the percentage of misclassified patients was recorded.</s><s>Before the ROC curve analysis was performed, we had defined that the correlation between the anchor (PatGA-disease control changes) and the UCT score changes should be at least good (r ; 0.5) in order to ensure the suitability of the anchor.</s></p><p><s>As an alternative, indirect method to determine the MID, we applied a distributional-criterion approach.</s><s>In this approach, the baseline UCT's SD is divided by 2, based on reports that one-half of the SD of a PRO measure's mean baseline score is a good approximation of the MID.</s><s><ref type="bibr">E21</ref> Smallest detectable change.</s><s>The smallest detectable change (SDC) is the smallest change that can be considered a ''real'' change with a 95% confidence.</s><s>E19 It is the smallest change of a PRO tool's score beyond the measurement error.</s><s>The SDC is defined as 1.96 times the SD of the PROs' score changes E22 between 2 independent assessments in stable, unchanged patients.</s><s>Subjects with an identical PatGA-disease control rating at baseline and followup were included for this analysis.</s></p><p><s>Because the proportion of stable patients was rather small in the population studied, we decided to additionally determine the SDC in the population from the original UCT publication E1 independently to ensure that the SDC results are accurate.</s><s>Thirty-three patients were included because they exhibited an unchanged disease severity at 2 independent UCT assessments 4 weeks apart.</s><s>These patients (22 females, 11 males) had a mean age of 47.4 6 16.5 years and a mean disease duration of 111.3 6 149.4 months.</s><s>In this population, neither a defined intervention nor resistance to H 1 -antihistamines was a prerequisite for inclusion.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional results on the SDC of the UCT score</head><p><s>In this study, 10 patients exhibited a stable, unchanged PatGAdisease control rating at baseline and follow-up.</s><s>These patients had a mean change of their UCT score of 1.3 6 1.9 points (median, 1.0).</s><s>The UCT score changes followed a normal distribution (P 5 .13,</s><s>Shapiro-Wilk test).</s><s>Accordingly, the SDC of the UCT score is 3.7 points (1.96*SD).</s><s>Only 2 patients (20%) exhibited an improvement of their UCT score by 3 points or more, in other words, 80% are classified correctly as not meaningfully improved when a MID of 3 points is applied.</s></p><p><s>In the independent patient sample from the original UCT publication, E1 33 subjects exhibited a stable disease status between 2 UCT assessments 4 weeks apart.</s><s>The mean difference between the first and the second UCT application was 0.5 6 1.9 points (median: 0).</s><s>Based on this population, the SDC of the UCT score is 3.8 points.</s><s>Only 5 patients with stable disease (15%) exhibited an improvement of their UCT score by 3 points or more, that is, 85% are classified correctly as not meaningfully improved when a MID of 3 points is applied.</s><s>Because the UCT score changes did not fulfil the criteria for normal distribution in this patient sample (P 5 .018,</s><s>Shapiro-Wilk test), we also investigated the performance of the calculated SDC in this population.</s><s>Notably, only 3 patients (9%) reported a UCT score change of &gt;3.8 points, suggesting the validity of the applied method of SDC calculation also in this sample.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Levels of MID and SDC</head><p><s>As explained in the original article of this repository, we regard a MID of 3 points as most appropriate for UCT score changes.</s><s>With this MID, at least 80% of patients with ''truly not improved'' disease control are correctly classified as not improved by the UCT.</s><s>Moreover, a definition of the UCT's MID to be 4 instead of 3 points, at least in our population, would go along with an unchanged specificity but a lower sensitivity of identifying subjects with ''truly improved'' urticaria control.</s><s>The proportion of misclassified patients would increase.</s></p><p><s>The SDC of the UCT was found to be 4 points in this study, in other words, the smallest change of the UCT score beyond the measurement error.</s><s>While the number of 10 patients for the SDC calculation was small, and its result might therefore be questioned, we were able to reproduce the same SDC value in a second, independent, and larger patient population from the original UCT validation study.</s><s>E1 It may appear confusing that the SDC with 4 points is slightly larger than the MID with 3 points.</s><s>However, this is a well-known phenomenon in clinimetrics.</s><s>For most measurement instruments, the SDC is greater than the MID.</s><s><ref type="bibr">E22</ref> A major reason for this is that the criterion for the SDC computation (95% confidence) is very conservative, whereas the criteria for the MID need to be less rigorous.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study limitations</head><p><s>Limitations of this study include (1) that the patient sample consisted only of H 1 -antihistamine-refractory and only of CSU patients, (2) that the data on the MID was obtained in patients that received only 1 type of treatment adjustment, known to have a large effect size, (3) that all patients were recruited in a specialized, tertiary referral center, and ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) that all included subjects were adults.</s><s>Accordingly, we cannot fully exclude that the MID might be overestimated in this setting and that slightly different results might be obtained in other populations, such as patients with less-severe urticaria, patients with CIndU but not CSU, or children and adolescents.</s><s>Further limitations of this study are that the populations to determine the SDC were small and that it may be questioned whether the distributions of the UCT score changes are normal enough for the SDC calculations.</s><s>Although, the SDC results were found to be similar in the 2 independent populations studied, the SDC of the UCT remains to be confirmed in future studies.</s><s>Values are percentages (n).</s><s>*Changes from baseline to 4 weeks after the first omalizumab injection (300 mg).</s><s>Physicians globally assessed the treatment response as ''no response'' (&lt; _30% improvement of the disease), ''partial response'' (&gt;30% but &lt; _90% improvement of the disease), ''complete response'' (&gt;90% improvement of the disease).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>this article's Online Repository at www. jacionline.org).</s><s>UCT score changes from baseline to follow-up correlated strongly with changes of the UAS7 (r 5 20.63) and CU-Q 2 oL total score (r 5 20.71), and showed a good correlation with changes in DLQI scores (r 5 20.49) (see</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
