<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study describes the influx of extracellular Ca 2+ as an important mediator of OXT-induced intracellular signaling in acute anxiolysis in the PVN of male rats.</s><s>More specifically, OXT-mediated anxiolysis is blocked by SKF96365 by inhibiting Ca 2+ influx through TRPV2 channels in OXTsensitive hypothalamic neurons.</s><s>This prevents increase of [Ca 2+ ] i and Ca 2+ oscillation amplitude induced by OXT, as well as the activation of MEK1/2.</s></p><p><s>As a basic paradigm to study OXT-dependent effects on anxiety, we used injections of OXT into the PVN.</s><s>Coapplication of SKF96365 prevented the anxiolytic OXT effects.</s><s>We have previously demonstrated, by using a specific OXTR antagonist in the same tests as used here, that the anxiolytic effect of OXT in the PVN is exclusively mediated by the OXTR, and not the closely related AVP-R1A <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blume et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the TRPV2 channels expressed in the AVP system <ref type="bibr">(Nedungadi et al, 2012 and this study)</ref> are not likely to have contributed to OXT-induced anxiolysis.</s><s>Furthermore, AVP exerts an anxiogenic, not an anxiolytic, activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Murgatroyd et al, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Landgraf et al, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bunck et al, 2009)</ref>, again arguing against the involvement of TRPV2 channels expressed by AVP-producing cells.</s></p><p><s>A participation of an influx of extracellular Ca 2+ into the cytosol to mediate the anxiolytic activity of OXT in the PVN was evidenced by the lack of effect of an OXT infusion following that of SKF96365 in two behavioral tests for anxiety, the LDB and the EPM.</s><s>There was, however, a tendency to an anxiolytic effect of SKF96365 in the absence of OXT in the EPM, but not LDB.</s><s>We have, at present, no explanation for this, but the lack of any anxiolysis when both SKF96563 and OXT were infused clearly indicates that SKF96563 prevents the anxiolytic activity of OXT.</s><s>In two previous papers, we have shown that application of OTX directly into the PVN induces anxiolysis, and that infusions outside of the PVN exert no effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blume et al, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jurek et al, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The anxiolytic effects of OXT are thus restricted to the PVN, implying that SKF96365, applied using the same techniques as described earlier, is locally active within the PVN as well.</s><s>SKF96365 blocks some TRP channels as well as T-type channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boels et al, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Clapham, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Our observation that SKF96365, when applied alone, did not significantly influence anxiety-like behavior, excludes a role of voltagedependent T-type Ca 2+ channels in the anxiolytic activity of OXT, because T-type channels should be active in the absence of OXT.</s><s>The Ca 2+ channel mediating the OXT effects should therefore be one of the SKF96365-sensitive TRP-channel family members TRPC6, TRPC7, and TRPV2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clapham, 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our observation that La 3+ , SKF96365, and ruthenium red prevented the effects of OXT on intracellular Ca 2+ dynamics in cultured primary hypothalamic cells demonstrates that the OXT-sensitive channel is TRPV2, as this is the only channel that is blocked by all of the three blockers tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boels et al, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Experiments with siRNA to inhibit TRPV2 synthesis for further verification appeared to be impossible, as the neurons in our cell cultures form a network as can be seen by synchronous Ca 2+ oscillations, but leading to false-positive results in TRPV2 knockdown studies.</s><s>As SKF96563 and ruthenium red, when applied in the absence of OXT, did not influence basal intracellular Ca 2+ and Ca 2+ oscillations, one can conclude that T-type channels are not involved, and furthermore that TRPV2 channels do not contribute to the membrane conductance without OXT.</s><s>This is consistent with the outcome of the behavioral tests, where SKF96365 was without effect in the absence of OXT.</s><s>Indeed, TRPV2 activity depended on PI3K, which likely promoted the surface expression of the channel on the cell membrane, as has been described before for TRPV2 incorporation in the cell membrane following insulin-like growth factor-1 stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Caterina et al, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>The punctate distribution and intracellular localization of TRPV2 that we found in the rat hypothalamus suggests that TRPV2 is stored in vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Everaerts et al, 2010)</ref>, which fuse with the membrane when OXT is released.</s><s>This subcellular arrangement supports the scenario of TRPV2 cell surface expression following an OXT surge.</s><s>Interestingly, the TRPV2-immunopositive cells not only included OXT-positive cells but also vasopressin-positive cells, thus confirming the results by Nedungadi et al (2012) who used the same antibody as we did in our study.</s></p><p><s>OXT failed to phosphorylate MEK1/2 in H32 hypothalamic cells when ruthenium red was applied in the bath.</s><s>This is of particular interest, as MEK1/2 phosphorylation is necessary for the anxiolytic activity of OXT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blume et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, TRPV2 activation and MEK1/2 phosphorylation are part of one and the same intracellular pathway that mediates OXT-induced anxiolysis.</s><s>This anxiolytic pathway likely starts with OXTR-induced G protein Œ≤/Œ≥-subunit activation, which permits binding of PI3K to the G protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chen et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, PI3K is activated and incorporates TRPV2 channels in the plasma membrane, leading to Ca 2+ influx and MEK1/2 phosphorylation.</s><s>How the latter two events are coupled is not precisely known, but a Ca 2+ -activated calmodulin-dependent activation of the EGFR is likely to be involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blume et al, 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Apart from the stimulatory effects on axon outgrowth in spinal motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia during development <ref type="bibr">(Shibasaki et</ref>  gene-related peptide release from dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Qin et al, 2008)</ref>, little is known about the physiological functions of TRPV2 in the central nervous system.</s><s>Here we describe for the first time that TRPV2 channels have a role in emotion regulation and, more specifically, are involved in anxiolytic effects when activated by OXT.</s><s>Two other TRP channels have been described to be involved in the control of anxiety and fear, namely TRPC5 and TRPV1.</s><s>In contrast to the anxiolytic effect of TRPV2 in the PVN, however, TRPC5 seems to be anxiogenic in the amygdala, as TRPC5 ‚àí/‚àí mice exhibit diminished innate fear in tests for general and social anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Riccio et al, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, TRPV1 knockout mice show decreased anxiety-like behavior in the LDB and EPM, as well as reduced conditioned fear, suggesting that TRPV1 activity promotes anxiogenic behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Marsch et al, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In summary, our in vivo and in vitro studies identified TRPV2 channels in the PVN of rats as mediators of OXTinduced anxiolysis.</s><s>This implies an until now unrecognized role of extracellular Ca 2+ in OXT signaling in the PVN, in addition to the previously described roles of Ca 2+ from intracellular stores, especially in female rats during labor and lactation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Israel et al, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In the light of growing interest in intranasally applied OXT as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of various psychopathologies, including anxietyand stress-related disorders, as well as social dysfunctions, it is essential to understand especially the acute consequences of OXT application at the neuronal level.</s><s>As both the anxiolytic (amygdala, PVN; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bale et al, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blume et al, 2008)</ref> and the anxiogenic (lateral septum; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Guzman et al, 2013)</ref> effects of OXT application have been reported, a thorough understanding of the molecular, cellular, and behavioral consequences of intranasal OXT application in the brain is a prerequisite for the efficient therapeutic use of synthetic OXT in humans.</s></p></div>
