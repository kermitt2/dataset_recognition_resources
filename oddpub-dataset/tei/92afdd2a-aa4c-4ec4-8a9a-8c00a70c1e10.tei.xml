thus, evaluating the full range of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate fetal, neonatal, and adult myogenesis is necessary to understand how muscle development is controlled.</s></p><p><s>In stem cells functions, the importance of a functional autophagic machinery is being unraveled.</s><s>Pluripotency, selfrenewal as well as quiescence require autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Autophagy is a homeostatic process acting as a quality control pathway and as a recycling system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>, carrying out degradation of cytoplasmic components including damaged organelles, toxic protein aggregates and intracellular pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In adult stem cells (ASCs), including hematopoietic (HSCs), mesenchymal (MSCs) and neuronal (NSCs) stem cells, autophagy sustains such ASCs functions as erythroid maturation, adipocyte differentiation, neuritogenesis and neuronal differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In muscle, autophagy contributes to the metabolic reprogramming that occurs during myogenic differentiation and provides a successful process of myogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">15]</ref>.</s><s>Autophagy is required for adult satellite cell (SC) activation from a quiescent state, promoting the metabolic adaptations needed for leaving quiescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Further, autophagy has been identified as capable of maintaining satellite cells stemness, thus preventing the switch between quiescence and senescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In MYF5 + (myogenic factor 5) precursor cells, autophagy regulates energy and glucose homeostasis affecting brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle development <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However MYF5 + cells contribute to adult myonuclei by 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[19]</ref>, and, consequently, loss of Atg7 in MYF5 + progenitors modestly affects myocyte size.</s></p><p><s>To date, little information has been provided on whether autophagy controls muscle development.</s><s>To study this we deleted Atg7 specifically in satellite cells and found that Atg7 knockdown leads to severe deficiencies in neonatal skeletal muscle growth.</s><s>Furthermore, we identified in the regulation of NFE2L2 and DDIT3 the molecular determinants responsible for the effectiveness of the muscle GH-IGF1 system, thus defining the existence of a direct link between both factors and a proper autophagic flux.</s><s>Collectively, our results provide in vivo evidence that basal autophagy is a process regulating muscle maturation in the neonatal phase.</s></p></div>
