Furthermore, the viscosity of epoxy resin decreases as the heating rate increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, the viscosities of samples heated after pre-curing varied greatly depending on the temperature of pre-curing, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>.</s><s>The viscosities of the resin heated at 120 • C after pre-curing at 30 and 23 • C were 1.19 × 10 8 and 2.10 × 10 4 MPa•s, respectively.</s><s>The viscosity of the resin pre-heated at 23 • C, which was not gelled for 24 h, decreased greatly.</s><s>However, the viscosity of the resin pre-heated at 30 • C, which was gelled for 16.5 h, only minimally decreased.</s><s>Although the viscosity of the resin heated after pre-curing at 23 • C was reduced by heating, the viscosity remained higher than the initial viscosity of the resin.</s><s>In MW heating, CFs act as a conductor and get abruptly heated due to ionic polarization and dipole orientation, rather than relying on heat transfer through conduction and convection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the temperature of the resin at the interface should increase rapidly.</s><s>The viscosity reduction of the epoxy resin at the interface, based on the high heating rate, would make it easier for the epoxy resin to impregnate the surface of CF in the initial stage of the curing process.</s><s>Thus, excellent impregnation behavior of epoxy resin by MW irradiation leads to an increase of the reaction efficiency of CF and epoxy resin.</s><s>In the case of rCF-600, the epoxy resin would be easily impregnated into the rough surface of rCF-600 by irradiating with MW immediately after mixing.</s><s>On the other hand, MW irradiation after pre-curing might suppress the impregnation of the epoxy resin to the surface of rCF-600.</s><s>Therefore, the result suggests that the IFSS of rCF-600 samples MW-irradiated after pre-curing would drop due to the lowering of the impregnation based on the high viscosity of the epoxy resin.</s><s>In the case of the rCF-500, due to the smooth surface of rCF-500, resin impregnation would be unaffected by interfacial adhesion, resulting in IFSSs of MW-irradiated samples after pre-curing to be similar to those irradiated after mixing.</s><s>The effect of shrinkage of the epoxy resin on interfacial adhesion is also discussed.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8a</ref> shows the linear cure shrinkage of epoxy resin after mixing as a function of time.</s><s>For a curing temperature of 100 • C, the epoxy resin shrunk by curing and then thermally expanded by heating at 120 • C. Finally, the cured epoxy resin thermally shrunk significantly when returning to room temperature.</s><s>This shrinking behavior of epoxy resin after mixing was observed at all setting temperatures.</s><s>The linear cure shrinkages of the epoxy resin heated at 80, 100, and 120 • C from the initial stage to when returning to room temperature were 2.65, 4.14, and 4.96%, respectively.</s><s>The linear cure shrinkage of the epoxy resin increased with increasing initial curing temperature.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8b</ref> also shows the linear cure shrinkage of epoxy resin after pre-curing, as a function of time.</s><s>Furthermore, the linear cure shrinkages of the epoxy resin heated at 120 • C after pre-curing at 23 and 30 • C were 4.62 and 1.01%, respectively.</s><s>The linear cure shrinkage of the gelled epoxy resin was small even when it was cured at 120 • C. On the other hand, the linear cure shrinkages of the non-gelled samples at 23 • C were almost the same as that of the sample heated at 120 • C immediately after mixing.</s><s>The pre-curing of epoxy resin before gelation had no effect on the shrinking behavior of the epoxy resin.</s><s>This result indicates that the temperature during gelation of the epoxy resin is important for the shrinkage of the epoxy resin.</s><s>These results also showed that the linear cure shrinkage of the sample MW-irradiated after pre-curing were similar to the one MW-irradiated after penetrating.</s><s>In MW heating, the temperature of the epoxy resin on the CF interface rises rapidly.</s><s>Furthermore, it is reported that the polarity functional groups with an active oxygen in CF are locally-heated strongly rather than the non-polarity functional groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the polarity functional groups can react with the epoxy groups in the epoxy resin and the epoxy resin on the CF interface binds tightly to the CF surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, in a previous study, the activation energy of the CFRP prepared by MW heating was about one half as compared to the one prepared by conventional heating <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Because the reaction rate of epoxy resin is increased by lowering the activation energy, the interfacial adhesion is also improved.</s><s>Furthermore, the heat generated from CF is diffused outward from the CF, resulting in curing of the epoxy resin which should progress outward from the CF. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref> shows the SEM image of recycled CF, which was MW-irradiated for 5 min and washed with ethanol to remove unreacted epoxy resin.</s><s>It was confirmed that the epoxy resin was adsorbed on the surface of CF, showing that the epoxy resin was cured from the CF interface.</s><s>Furthermore, in the MW process, the curing of the epoxy resin outward from the CF interface causes the shrinkage of the epoxy resin along the CF direction.</s><s>Because the temperature of the epoxy resin near the fiber is high, the shrinkage of the epoxy resin at the interface is significant.</s><s>As results, the epoxy resin can hug the CF strongly.</s><s>However, in the case of conventional oven heating, the epoxy resin in the composite is heated from the outside, due to which the chemical reaction of the epoxy resin is initiated from the outside.</s><s>Because the curing reaction is an exothermic reaction, the reaction of the epoxy resin from the outside is accelerated, and the epoxy resin shrinks from the outside.</s><s>This shrinking behavior of epoxy resin from the outside causes the delamination of the epoxy resin from CF surface.</s><s>In fact, the interface of the composite of CF and epoxy resin cured by conventional oven was partially delaminated <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the reactivity of the epoxy resin with CF must be lesser than with MW heating, because the temperature of epoxy resin on the CF interface is lower than the setting temperature.</s><s>Thus, in the conventional oven heating, the interfacial adhesion would decrease.</s><s>These results suggest that external heating, such as that in an electric oven, requires slow curing at a low temperature for the suppression of shrinkage, whereas MW irradiation can facilitate rapid curing with high-temperature heating.</s><s>MW irradiation can thus improve the interfacial adhesion between recycled CF and thermosetting resins via mainly shrinkage of epoxy resin along the fiber direction and enhanced impregnation owing to the decrease of viscosity of the resin on the interface.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p><s>To improve the interfacial adhesion between various recycled CFs and epoxy resin by MW irradiation, the IFSSs of composites prepared under different conditions was investigated.</s><s>In this study, recycled CFs, with or without surface defects, were recovered from CFRP by thermal degradation processes at different temperatures.</s><s>In the case of the composite MW-irradiated immediately after mixing, the IFSSs of both recycled CFs samples increased with increasing absorbed MW.</s><s>On the other hand, the IFSS of the composite composed of recycled CF with surface defects did not improve by MW irradiation after pre-curing.</s><s>We also investigated the curing behavior of epoxy resins by using a rheometer.</s><s>The viscosity of the epoxy resin decreased greatly by heating immediately after mixing, whereas its reduction was suppressed by heating after pre-curing.</s><s>The pre-curing of epoxy resin before gelation did not affect the shrinking behavior of epoxy resin.</s><s>These results suggest that the MW process improved the interfacial adhesion between recycled CF and epoxy resin from two aspects, namely, by impregnation owing to the decrease of viscosity of the resin on the interface, and the shrinkage of epoxy resin along the fiber direction.</s></p><p><s>One important consequence of the present work is that the interfacial adhesion between recycled CF and the epoxy resin is significantly affected by the curing state of the epoxy resin before MW irradiation.</s><s>The interfacial adhesion between various recycled CF and epoxy resin can be improved by MW irradiation immediately after mixing the epoxy resin and curing agent.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Temperature profile (a); gap and normal force (b) of epoxy resin at 100 • C setting temperature.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,117.46,241.94,360.36,162.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
