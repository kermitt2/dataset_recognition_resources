SampEn is then given as the natural log of U m (r)/U m+1 (r).</s><s>Consequently, high SampEn values indicate low predictability (or higher randomness) of data patterns by indicating that patterns of length m + 1reoccur less often than patterns of length m (i.e., the higher the ratio U m (r)/U m+1 (r), the higher SampEn and vice versa).</s><s>The inclusion of multiple time scales in MSE <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> is achieved by coarse-graining the original time series prior to SampEn estimation: for any scale s, s successive, non-overlapping data points are averaged, and SampEn is calculated across these averaged data points.</s><s>As MSE at scale 1 is identical to SampEn, we will refer to SampEn whenever MSE analyses are focused on scale 1.</s><s>The boundary criterion r √ó SD is typically defined only once for the native time series (i.e., scale 1) and then applied to all MSE scales.</s><s>Accordingly, MSE may be interpreted as the SampEn at each scale relative to the overall variance (SD) of the time series.</s><s>Importantly, each MSE scale must necessarily be interpreted in the context of the sampling rate.</s><s>That is, scale 1 represents the native sampling rate of a given digitized signal (e.g., 250 Hz, or 4 ms sampling interval), scale 2 represents the native sampling rate/2 (e.g,.</s><s>125 Hz, or 8 ms), and so on for successive scales.</s><s>Thus, scale-specific MSE results can only be compared across studies when accounting for differences in sampling rate.</s></p><p><s>Typically, in neurophysiological settings, parameter values of m = 2 and r = 0.50 are utilized <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Although m (also referred to as the embedding dimension) is often set to 2, optimal values can also be determined using the procedure proposed by Small and Tse <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>r value settings of 0.50 are also typically specified according to recommendations by Richman and Moorman 5 .</s><s>In the current paper, we mainly report analyses using these specific parameters (analyses with r parameters of 0.15 and 0.30 did not reveal any substantial differences in our analyses; see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 and S2</ref>).</s><s>Calculation of MSE was implemented as described in Costa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>For the calculation of the MSE across discontinuous segments, two further constraints were added: (1) coarse-graining was conducted segment-wise (i.e., within segments), and (2) patterns were not allowed to cross segment borders.</s><s>Thus, in addition to the requirements on the number of data points as described above, the maximal scale possible was restricted here to be [n/(m + 1)] rounded down to the nearest integer, with n being the number of successive data points per segment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of SampEn and MSE estimates from sparse data.</head><p><s>In order to investigate the behavior of SampEn and MSE when reducing the number of data points and parsing continuous time series into discontinuous data segments of varying lengths (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), we evaluated the accuracy (Œî; i.e., unbiasedness) and precision (SD; i.e., dispersion) of SampEn and MSE values.</s><s>Accuracy here represents the absolute deviation of (a) the average SampEn (or MSE) values of a sample of shorter or discontinuous time series from (b) the 'benchmark' average SampEn (or MSE) values calculated from a sample of 'ideal' time series with 'optimal' data density [i.e., Œî : = | mean(SampEn short/discontinuous time series ) -mean(SampEn benchmark ) |].</s><s>It allows one to approximate the bias of the SampEn and MSE values that can be expected given a certain amount of data points (continuous as well as discontinuous).</s><s>Precision here is defined as the standard deviation (SD) of the distribution of the SampEn (or MSE) values around their mean and is equivalent to the dispersion of the accuracy at any level of data density and data segmentation.</s><s>Consequently, the precision allows one to estimate the standard error of the SampEn and MSE values given a certain sample size and thus can be used to approximate the statistical power in a given experimental design <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , as will be discussed in detail below.</s></p></div>

accurate and precise for time series with more than 10,000 data points.</s><s>Thus, we used SampEn and MSE estimated from time series with 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> (65,536) data points as the benchmark for all comparisons.</s><s>In order to obtain stable SampEn and MSE estimates, all reported point measures (i.e., mean (M), and standard deviation (SD)) are calculated from 1,000 randomly generated time series.</s><s>Furthermore, in order to keep the spectral power at the lower end of the frequency spectrum constant for different signal lengths, time series were high-pass filtered with a frequency cutoff of sampling frequency/2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (1,024) Hz (e.g., 1 Hz cutoff with a sampling frequency of 1,024 Hz) with a 4 th order Butterworth filter implemented using the filtfilt function in MATLAB.</s></p><p><s>In order to evaluate the robustness of SampEn to reductions in the number of data points, we compared the average deviation of SampEn calculated from 2 5 (32) to 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>  (32,768) successive data points from the benchmark SampEn calculated from 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> (65,536) successive data points.</s><s>As introduced above, we refer to the absolute average deviation as accuracy and to the SD of the SampEn values as precision, both calculated across SampEn values of 1,000 randomly generated time series (representing randomly drawn samples of white or 1/f noise).</s><s>It should be noted that smaller numerical values denote higher accuracy and precision.</s><s>Since the average deviation and the SD decrease approximately exponentially with increasing data volume, results are plotted in log-log space.</s><s>After determining the number of data points needed to obtain stable SampEn estimates, we examined the impact of discontinuous data segment lengths on SampEn.</s><s>In a first pass, segments of 128, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 3 data points were used to approach the absolute limits of the behavior of SampEn when using as little continuous data as possible (i.e., as mentioned above, if m = 2, the minimum number of data points to compute SampEn is 2 + 1 = 3).</s><s>However, because of a clear monotony of results across these segment lengths (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>), for simplicity we present only segments of 128, 32, and 3 in the current results.</s><s>Since the critical measure within SampEn is the frequency of reoccurring patterns, the comparison between SampEn estimation from discontinuous and continuous data was based on an equivalent number of compared patterns [number of compared patterns = (n‚àí m) √ó j, in which j denotes the number of segments, m is the m parameter of the SampEn (MSE) measure, and n represents the number of data points within segments].</s><s>Combined, these analyses were intended to establish the critical amount of data necessary to obtain relatively stable SampEn and MSE estimates from continuous and discontinuous data.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we extended the above single-scale analyses to multiple scales (up to scale 20).</s><s>MSE calculated from time series with 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> (65,536) successive data points served as the benchmark.</s><s>We compared estimation across 10 to 640 discontinuous segments with lengths of 2 4 (16) to 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (1,024) data points, and a maximum number of 20 √ó 2 10 (20 √ó 1,024) data points, to the benchmark.</s><s>Accuracy and precision of the MSE estimation across discontinuous segments are again reported as the log 10 of the absolute average difference from the benchmark MSE values, and log 10 of the SD of the MSE values, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Application to EEG Data.</s><s>In order to test whether simulated results were applicable to typical neurophysiological data, we conducted similar analyses using resting state EEG data from the large-scale COGITO study conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development (MPIB), Berlin, Germany (see Schmiedek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> for a detailed description of the study).</s><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the MPIB, and was carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.</s><s>All participants provided written informed consent.</s><s>A detailed description of the resting state EEG data is provided in Grandy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In short, resting state EEG data were initially recorded from 45 younger adults (24 women; age range = 20-31 years; M = 25.1;</s><s>SD = 2.8) with BrainAmp amplifiers (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) and 64 Ag/AgCl electrodes.</s><s>Sixty scalp electrodes embedded in an elastic cap (EASYCAP GmbH, Herrsching, Germany) were organized according to the 10% system.</s><s>The EEG was recorded with an analog band-pass of 0.1 to 250 Hz and digitized with a sampling rate of 1 kHz.</s><s>EEG resting state data were acquired from two conditions: 2 min eyes closed (EC) and 2 min eyes open (EO).</s><s>Participants were instructed to sit as relaxed and as still as possible in both the EC and EO conditions, and to fixate on a cross during the EO condition.</s><s>During recording, the ground was placed at AFz.</s><s>Two electrodes were placed on the outer canthi and one electrode below the left eye in order to monitor eye movements.</s><s>During recording, all electrodes were referenced to the right mastoid electrode.</s><s>Electrode impedances were maintained below 5 kŒ© before recording.</s></p><p><s>Preprocessing and analysis of EEG data was performed using the EEGLAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> and FieldTrip 28 toolboxes, as well as custom MATLAB code.</s><s>EEG data was re-referenced to mathematically linked mastoids, high-pass filtered with a 4 th order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 250/2 10 (250/1,024) Hz ( = 0.24 Hz), down-sampled to 250 Hz and segmented into epochs of 4.096 sec (i.e., 1,024 data points).</s><s>Epochs were visually inspected for each subject, and all segments containing artifacts other than eye blinks and eye movements were excluded from further analyses.</s><s>After manual artifact rejection, a temporal independent component analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (ICA) was conducted.</s><s>Independent components capturing eye blinks and movements were visually identified and removed prior to back-projection of the data.</s><s>Only participants with at least 20 artifact free segments of 1,024 data points (4.096 sec) within each condition were kept for the current analyses, leaving n = 19 individuals.</s><s>For each of the 19 participants, the first 20 artifact free segments were chosen for all subsequent analyses, ensuring an identical amount of data for all included individuals.</s><s>Importantly, our selected subsample (n = 19) did not differ from excluded sample participants in terms of several relevant sample descriptives [age (t(43) = 0.62, p = 0.537), perceptual speed (Digit Symbol Substitution scores; t(43) = 0.39, p = 0.700), fluid intelligence (Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices scores; t(43) = 1.22,</s><s>p = 0.231), and individual alpha frequency (t(43) = ‚àí 1.22, p = 0.230; cf.</s><s>Grandy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> ].</s></p><p><s>The rationale for these choices was two-fold.</s><s>First, we aimed at obtaining a sample size within the range of a typical cognitive neuroscience experiment (N ‚âà 20).</s><s>Second, we sought a number of available data points that would allow highly accurate MSE estimates, to serve as a valid benchmark for assessing the effects of reducing the number of data points in a neurophysiological signal.</s><s>It was not possible to obtain 10,000 successive data points in our EEG data, although in our simulations the bias of MSE estimates from 10,000 successive data points was below 0.001 up to scale 20 when estimating the MSE across 20 segments of 1,024 data points (see Results).</s><s>As a result, we used 20 √ó 2 10 (20 √ó 1,024) data points (instead of time series with successive data) as the benchmark for EEG data in the current study.</s><s>The amount of data was then systematically reduced from 1/2 to 1/2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> (1/128) by sampling between j discrete segments (j = 10 to 640) with lengths of n data points [n = 2 4 (16) to 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (1,024)] from the overall pool of 20 √ó 2 10 (20 √ó 1,024) available data points.</s><s>MSE was calculated for j √ó n data points for every electrode.</s><s>For accuracy, the log 10 of the absolute average deviation from the benchmark MSE, averaged across all electrodes and participants (representing a random sample of resting-state EEG signals), is reported.</s><s>For precision, the average SD calculated across participants' MSE values within electrodes is reported.</s><s>To provide the lower limits of accuracy and precision, the 95 th percentiles and maximum values of the respective distributions are also presented.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the robustness of the statistical difference between the two resting conditions (EC vs. EO) when reducing the amount of data used for MSE estimation was investigated to demonstrate more practical implications for typical cognitive neuroscience study designs.</s><s>Point-wise (scales √ó electrodes) paired-samples Student's t-tests (EC vs. EO) were conducted for all j √ó n data sets.</s><s>We then calculated the sensitivity and specificity of detecting a reliable difference between conditions (with the Œ±-level set at 0.05) as a function of decreasing the overall amount of data.</s><s>In the current context, sensitivity denotes the probability to detect a reliable difference between conditions (across electrodes and scales) given that the benchmark comparison of the two conditions indicated a reliable difference.</s><s>Specificity denotes the probability to obtain a non-significant difference between conditions given that the benchmark comparison rendered a non-significant difference.</s><s>Note that the meaning of 'sensitivity' and 'specificity' in our context thus deviates slightly from their use in standard diagnostics; nevertheless, as introduced here, they provide a useful heuristic to describe the effect of reducing the number of data points on the statistical comparison of the two conditions.</s></p><p><s>Application to fMRI Data.</s><s>Finally, we also applied the above analyses to high-speed, multiband fMRI resting state data from 20 randomly selected young adults (age range = 20-30 years) from the NKI-Enhanced dataset (publicly available at http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/download.html).</s><s>All participants were right-handed and reported to be psychiatrically and neurologically healthy.</s><s>As noted in Nooner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , Institutional Review Board Approval was obtained for the NKI-Enhanced project at the Nathan Kline Institute (Phase I #226781 and Phase II #239708) and at Montclair State University (Phase I #000983A and Phase II #000983B), and the study was carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained for all study participants.</s></p><p><s>Whole-brain resting-state fMRI data (10 mins, 900 volumes total)

Œî = absolute average difference between benchmark MSE and MSE estimated across discontinuous time series with a reduced overall amount of data points; SD = standard deviation; Sens = sensitivity; Spec = specificity.</s><s>these entropy measures, we hypothesized that it would be possible to calculate SampEn and MSE across discontinuous data segments with high accuracy and precision; this hypothesis was supported across simulation-based, EEG, and fMRI analyses.</s></p><p><s>Simulations.</s><s>We started by describing and evaluating the accuracy (absolute average deviation) and precision (SD) of the SampEn (MSE at scale 1) as a function of signal length using simulated white and 1/f noise.</s><s>Both accuracy and precision of SampEn were found to improve approximately linearly (monotonically) in log-log space as a function of signal length (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref>), emphasizing the importance of the number of data points for the robust estimation of SampEn.</s><s>For increasingly shorter time series an increased overestimation in the exact SampEn value was observed and the level of overestimation was higher for 1/f noise (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>The difference in overestimation is most likely driven by differences in frequency content between the two noise types.</s><s>As white noise has a flat spectrum (and thus a more consistent time series variance), sampling fewer data points has relatively little impact on the estimation of the SD of the time series.</s><s>However, for 1/f noise which is characterized by slower rather than faster frequency content, reducing the number of continuous data points necessarily reduces the low frequency content that is captured and hence reduces the SD estimate.</s><s>Thus, for sparser time series from 1/f noise, the boundary interval (r √ó SD) over which data points are compared is smaller and, holding all else equal, has the effect of increasing the entropy value.</s><s>In line with this notion, no difference in overestimation is observed when estimating SampEn with the SD of the overall time series from which the shorter segment was sampled (see Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s></p><p><s>For real data, potential properties and differences in SampEn and MSE values between signals are likely unknown but may be rather subtle, ensuring that any given signal(s) will fall somewhere along the log-log continuums we report for accuracy and precision.</s><s>Thus, in any given study design, such overestimation is not necessarily problematic per se, but rather underscores the necessity of ensuring equal numbers of data points across conditions and subjects in comparative settings so that any overestimation bias remains stable.</s><s>Hence, we cannot recommend a fixed number of data points as a required minimum for accurate and precise estimation of SampEn and MSE; similar to how choices of sample size impact statistical power, the number of required data points strongly depends on the requirements of a given study's analyses.</s><s>We provide a more detailed discussion of various practical implications below.</s></p><p><s>We then assessed the effect of calculating SampEn and MSE across discontinuous segments.</s><s>As hypothesized, when equating the number of pattern comparisons, estimates across discontinuous segments were as accurate and precise as those from continuous time series.</s><s>Importantly, even with a segment length at the absolute minimum (of n = m + 1 = 3 in the current report), accuracy was exceptionally high when including a sufficient number of segments.</s><s>Thus, neither discontinuity nor segment length impeded accurate estimation of SampEn or MSE.</s></p><p><s>Validation in EEG and fMRI data.</s><s>Next, we evaluated these issues in relation to real neurophysiological data (EEG and fMRI).</s><s>The overall picture for the EEG data was comparable to our simulation-based results.</s><s>Accuracy and precision of MSE estimates were higher, albeit lower than in the simulations, with increasing number of data points and pattern comparisons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A,B</ref>).</s><s>Since the accuracy of the MSE estimate per se is not necessarily meaningful as an explicit value, we also heuristically assessed the practical consequences of the inaccuracies when limiting the amount of data points when comparing EO and EC conditions.</s><s>Robustness of the Regardless of the number of data segments, data points per segment, and time scale, deviation of the voxel-wise accuracy from overall accuracy were effectively zerocentered, with tighter and more symmetric distributions at higher data densities (scale 1 vs. higher scales; lower vs. higher number of data points per segment).</s><s>statistical difference was assessed by calculating the sensitivity and specificity (as defined in the Methods section) of detecting reliable differences between conditions.</s><s>Sensitivity was high (between 0.77 and 0.94) when using only half the data points [equivalents of 10 √ó 2 10 (10 √ó 1,204) data points], but decreased when further reducing the amount of data included in the MSE estimation.</s><s>Notably though, sensitivity was not dependent on the length of the discontinuous segments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, specificity remained high despite reducing the overall amount of data.</s><s>Thus, decreasing the amount of data decreases the probability of detecting reliable differences between conditions (decreased sensitivity) without introducing increasingly false positives (stable specificity).</s><s>That is, while the probability of (falsely) detecting reliable differences between conditions (or groups) does not change, the probability of detecting existing 'true' differences is greatly reduced when reducing the amount of data.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we extended the applicability of our approach to fMRI data, for which acquisition of continuous data is typically sparse due to an impoverished sampling rate [albeit here, 885 multiband volumes were collected within 10 minutes (TR = 645 ms), serving as an example that approaches current best-case scenarios for temporal resolution of the BOLD signal while maintaining adequate spatial resolution].</s><s>As expected, high MSE accuracy and precision were achieved when including sufficient data in the MSE estimation.</s><s>Furthermore, no evidence was found for a systematic influence of voxel location on accuracy and precision.</s><s>The larger the number of data points available for MSE estimation, the less the number of voxels with reliable deviations from the overall accuracy.</s><s>Importantly, even in the worst-case scenarios, accuracy values appeared to be randomly distributed across voxels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>This indicates an ideal scenario in that the reported mean accuracies do provide a representative approximation of the accuracy across the whole brain.</s><s>As our reported accuracy and precision values refer to a voxel size of 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 mm, accuracy and precision values would likely improve even further if anatomical or functional parcellation schemes were used (such as AAL).</s><s>In this sense the voxel-level values may be conceived of as an effective lower bound on regional estimates.</s><s>Benefits of discontinuous MSE estimation.</s><s>Of note, an interesting and important consequence of our general approach is that it allows the estimation of scales not accessible from native data segment lengths.</s><s>For example, calculation of scale 20 is not possible from only 128 data points, but was estimated highly accurately in our simulations when estimating the MSE across multiple segments of 128 data points.</s><s>This is an important advance for some classes of neurophysiological data.</s><s>For example, in many typical EEG (e.g.</s><s>short trials, or short time series due to artifacts) or fMRI settings (TR = 2 sec), the number of successive data points is severely limited.</s><s>However, in contrary to some signal types (e.g., heart rate data), scale 1 (i.e., the sampling frequency) is often not the most interesting scale in M/EEG or fMRI data.</s><s>With a limited number of successive data points, the scales of interest that map, for example, to the alpha (8-12 Hz) or theta frequencies (4-7 Hz) may not normally be accessible.</s><s>Thus, our approach of MSE estimation across discontinuous segments allows inclusion of higher scales that were previously not estimable, permitting one to map out an even broader range of neurophysiological dynamics.</s></p><p><s>Why does MSE estimation from discontinuous segments work?.</s><s>It may at first glance seem counterintuitive that sampling shorter data segments (or even reordering them) could yield similar MSE results as in continuous data.</s><s>However, our proposed MSE solution works explicitly because data patterns are not computed across data segment boundaries.</s><s>In this way, data patterns within each segment are "protected" and in their original state.</s><s>When discrete data patterns are counted in MSE, the algorithm does not care for when in the time series data patterns occurred, but rather only that the patterns exist; because we ensure that all data patterns are real (i.e., from within data segments) rather than artificial (i.e., those crossing data segment boundaries), accurate and precise MSE estimation is indeed possible.</s><s>However, "real" patterns here are necessarily bound by minimal data point requirements within segment to enable MSE estimation (m + 1 = 3, with or without coarse-graining); this means that only those time scales that meet this data minimum can be estimated, with the provision that enough pattern exemplars (and thus, data segments) are available in the data.</s></p><p><s>Practical recommendations derived from the current study.</s><s>Importantly, from an application point of view, our definitions of accuracy and precision allow one to approximate the sample size and/or number of data points required to detect an expected difference in MSE with a given level of statistical power <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>We will briefly outline the basic rationale here for an example two-group comparison design (e.g., comparing healthy individuals and patients) in order to demonstrate how to make use of reported accuracy and precision values from the current study.</s><s>With respect to accuracy, there are two important considerations.</s><s>First, as already mentioned above, the systematic bias (i.e., the overestimation of MSE values; e.g., Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref> leftmost plot) for shorter time series is approximately equal for signals with similar signal characteristics (see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 and S6</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, as long as signal characteristics are not fundamentally different (e.g., white versus 1/f noise), the bias in the absolute MSE values should be comparable across groups (i.e., for both groups, the absolute MSE value is shifted by approximately the same amount), and should not greatly influence the statistical comparison (as MSE values in both groups are shifted in the same direction by approximately the same amount).</s><s>If, however, signals do differ fundamentally in their signal characteristics, it can be expected (or should be ensured by means of including a sufficient number of data points) that the difference between the MSE values of the two signals is large compared to the difference in accuracy (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref>: the difference between white and 1/f noise is larger than 0.3; yet, their respective accuracies are smaller (i.e., better) than 0.1).</s><s>In sum, accuracy should only in rare instances impede statistical comparisons between groups.</s><s>Second, and more importantly, the accuracy does show a strong dependency on the number of data points; shorter time series exhibit systematically larger MSE values.</s><s>Consequently, MSE values should only be compared across groups if they are calculated on the same amount of data points as otherwise artificial differences (i.e., a differential bias) between MSE values may be introduced.</s></p><p><s>Precision of the MSE values as a function of the number of data points can be used to approximate the sample sizes required to detect an MSE difference at the electrode or voxel level with a certain probability (i.e., statistical power, 1‚àí Œ≤).</s><s>Reported raw MSE group differences so far range approximately between 0.02 and 0.20 in the EEG literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and approximately between 0.02 and 0.15 in the fMRI literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Using our precision values to estimate effect sizes for expected group differences in MSE values (demonstrated here for expected MSE differencesderived from the literature-of 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15) allows one to approximate the required sample sizes per group to detect a group difference with a given statistical power of, for instance, 0.80, 0.90, or 0.95 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Most importantly, apart from the actual estimated sample sizes, it can be seen that when applying MSE at the absolute minimum of the required amount of data points (as is the case here for scale 5), doubling the amount of data can reduce the required sample size up to approximately one fifth.</s><s>Thus an important practical consequence of our results is that at the limits of data sparsity the number of data points can be highly efficiently traded against the sample size.</s></p></div>
