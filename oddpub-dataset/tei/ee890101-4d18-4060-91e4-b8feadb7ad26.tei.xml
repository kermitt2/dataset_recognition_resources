<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introductory paragraph</head><p><s>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder hallmarked by adult-onset loss of motor neurons and fatal paralysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Here, we show that mutations in the gene encoding TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) cause ALS and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD).</s><s>By exome sequencing of 202 familial ALS patients and 827 control individuals, we found an exome-wide significant enrichment of TBK1 loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in the patient group.</s><s>Another 4 LoF mutations were identified during a subsequent targeted screening of 1076 additional patients.</s><s>TBK1 mutations co-segregated with disease in five families with reduced penetrance.</s><s>Genetic and biochemical data suggested a critical role for the C-terminal TBK1 coiled coil domain (CCD) that mediates binding to the TBK1 adaptor protein optineurin in neurodegeneration.</s><s>A mild knock-down of TBK1 expression in zebrafish caused shortening and abnormal branching of motor neurons in vivo.</s><s>We conclude that haploinsufficiency of TBK1 causes ALS and dementia/FTD.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main text</head><p><s>Mutations in 29 genes have been linked to ALS pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and are frequently also associated with fronto-temporal dementia (FTD).</s><s>However, mutations in known ALS genes explain less than 1/3 of ALS cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To evaluate low-frequency variants in protein-coding genes DNA samples from 202 familial ALS (fALS) patients were selected for exome sequencing.</s><s>They had been previously screened negative for SOD1 and C9orf72 mutations and came from families with two or more affected individuals per family from the Nordic countries, Germany and Portugal.</s><s>Control exomes (n=827) from Germany were used to compare the variant burden.</s><s>We used a gene-based test (CMC test, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> ) to analyze all missense variants at four MAF thresholds (MAF &lt;= 5%, 1%, 0.1% and 0.05%).</s><s>In addition, LoF variants defined as nonsense, canonical splice site (within two nucleotides of exon boundary), read-through and frameshift variants were investigated separately (MAF &lt;= 5%).</s><s>While analysis of missense variants revealed no prominent hits (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the test for LoF variants revealed two outliers, TBK1 and IL1RL1, with p-values of 4.048e-7 and 6.982e-9, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>IL1RL1 proved to be a sequencing artifact in a low complexity region, leaving TBK1 as the only candidate.</s><s>LoF variants in TBK1 were absent in controls, whereas ALS patients carried 7 different LoF mutations in 8 individuals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>For further evaluation of TBK1 variation, we screened in a second stage additional case and control groups using a targeted high resolution melting curve protocol including 50 fALS and 516 sporadic ALS (sALS) patients from Sweden, 510 German sALS cases as well as 650 Swedish control subjects.</s><s>A splice site variant was detected in a Swedish fALS patient and another splice site variant was present in 3 sALS patients from Sweden and one control individual.</s></p><p><s>Clinically, patients carrying TBK1 LoF mutations had a median age of onset of 61 years, 45% showed cognitive impairment often progressing to fulminant FTD, and bulbar onset was observed in 36%.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> provides an overview of all identified TBK1 variants.</s><s>It includes TBK1 variants from additional 1,791 in-house exomes and 63,358 exomes of the ExAC public dataset 5 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1 and Supplementary   Table 1</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, TBK1 is highly conserved: it does only contain a single variant with a MAF larger than 1%.</s><s>All other 171 non-synonymous variants had a MAF smaller than 0.1%.</s><s>The presence of 8 LoF variants in the ExAC dataset was higher than expected when assuming a lifetime risk for ALS of approximately 1 in 450 according to normal population registries <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> .</s><s>This is most likely explained by the fact that the ExAC dataset is not representative for the general population but contains diseasespecific samples from various exome sequencing projects 5 including schizophrenia, which has been clinically linked to ALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Co-segregation with ALS or dementia was found in 5 families, confirming causative linkage of TBK1 LoF mutations with ALS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-f</ref>): TBK1 mutations co-segregated with disease between 2 cousins in a Danish Family (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), two second degree relatives in a Swedish family (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), as well as between 4 first degree relatives in a German family (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>The identical splice site mutation (p.690-713del) was found in a Danish and a Swedish Family but not in over 70 000 controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e   and f</ref>).</s><s>This prompted us to undertake genealogical investigations and indeed we could track both families to a common ancestor in Sweden 5 generations earlier (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e and f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Investigation of unaffected individuals provided evidence for reduced penetrance.</s><s>In family 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), the p.Ile450LysfsX14 mutation was observed in 3 unaffected individuals who survived the latest known onset of disease observed in this family by 11, 14 or 21 years.</s><s>We also found TBK1 LoF mutations in 3 patients who had no reported family history of ALS (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with incomplete penetrance and the same pattern has also been found for other ALS mutations in the SOD1, C9orf72, FUS, ANG, TDP43, OPTN and p62 genes 2 .</s></p><p><s>In family 5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) a maternally transmitted TBK1(p.Tyr185X) nonsense mutation was observed together with a paternal FUS(p.R524G) missense mutation.</s><s>The TBK1 mutation was associated with dementia in the index patient's mother and the FUS mutation with ALS in her father (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>The relative contribution of each variant, both co-segregating with disease in the following generation, cannot be determined at this point.</s><s>However, this observation supports the notion of an oligogenic basis of ALS which has previously been reported for other ALS mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Taken together, the highly significant increase in LoF mutational burden in ALS together with cosegregation with disease demonstrates causality of the identified TBK1 LoF mutations.</s><s>Consequently, we investigated selected mutations in vitro and in vivo in order to clarify the pathogenic mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>Most LoF mutations seemed to result in haploinsufficiency.</s><s>In a patient-derived immortalized lymphoblast cell line the splice site mutation c.358+2T&gt;C (p.Thr77TrpfsX3) resulted in a low expression of an aberrant splice product the mRNA level, most likely as a consequence of nonsensemediated RNA decay, without compensatory upregulation of the wild-type allele at the mRNA or protein level (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The same mutation expressed in neuronal H4 cells did not result in subcellular re-distribution or aggregation of TBK1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Faint immunohistochemical staining intensities of the truncating LoF mutants were in agreement with the low expression levels observed by Western blotting (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a and f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine if a subset of the identified missense variants also resulted in a loss-of-function, we investigated their kinase activity and ability to bind to substrate and adaptor proteins.</s><s>Several rare missense variants identified in our screens were predicted to impair TBK1 function based on the analysis of the TBK1 crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4 and 10</ref> ).</s><s>p.M559 is predicted to be buried in a hydrophobic pocket of the scaffold/dimerization domain (amino acids 408-654) and its substitution by an arginine to result in a disturbed protein structure (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">4 and 10</ref> ).</s><s>p.M559R indeed resulted in a complete loss of optineurin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-c</ref>) and interleukin-related factor 3 (IRF3) binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>), a loss of TBK1 kinase activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d and f</ref>), and loss of IRF3 activation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f and g</ref>).</s><s>p.M559R is thus likely to result in loss-of-function while the causal relevance of the other rare missense variants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) with the exception of p.E696K (see below) cannot be adequately judged at this point.</s><s>A mild knock-down of the TBK1 zebrafish orthologue resulted in shortening and abnormal branching of motor neuron axons, further supporting a TBK1 LoF mechanism in vivo (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, our data indicate that most pathogenic variants identified represent null mutations, and dosage reduction from 2 copies to a single TBK1 copy is sufficient to cause ALS or FTD.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the 6 different truncating mutations found in ALS cases (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), the c.2138+2T&gt;C splice site mutation co-segregating in the extended Danish/Swedish pedigree over 9 generations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>) is predicted to result in exon skipping and in-frame deletion of 24 amino acids in the C-terminal coiled-coil domain (CCD) of TBK1 (p.690-713del).</s><s>This domain was shown to mediate the binding to various adaptor proteins relevant for TBK1 activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> .</s><s>A point mutation in the same CDD (p.E696K) was associated with a similar clinical phenotype of progressive bulbar palsy and a disease duration of less than 2 years in two different families, supporting causality for this point mutation.</s><s>Haplotype analysis was compatible with a common founder in both families (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the absence or mutation of the C-terminal adaptor-binding CCD of TBK1 seems to be sufficient to induce neurodegeneration.</s><s>Staining of the brain of patient III/3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>) with the p.690-713del mutation revealed Type B TDP-43 positive perinuclear inclusion in neurons in lamina III of the temporal lobe and p62 positive perinuclear inclusions in lamina III in the right para-hippocampal gyrus (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Both p.690-713del and p.E696K abolished binding to the prototypic TBK1 adaptor protein optineurin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-c</ref>).</s><s>However, binding to (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>) and activation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f and g</ref>) of IRF3 was unaffected upon overexpressin.</s><s>IRF3 is a TBK1 substrate that binds to the more upstream ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) of TBK1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> .</s><s>The p.E696K mutation we have identified in ALS patients has been employed before as an (at that time) "artificial" mutation to dissect the structure/binding properties of the TBK1 C-terminal CCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> .</s><s>In contrast to the observed loss of optineurin binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-c</ref>), normal binding of TBK1(p.E696K) to other TBK1 adaptor proteins such as TANK, Sintbad and NAP1 was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>These findings point to the relevance of the disruption of the CCD for disease causation and suggest that loss of TBK1/optineurin interaction is associated with the development of neurodegeneration.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we demonstrate that TBK1 haploinsufficiency causes ALS and fronto-temporal dementia.</s><s>As the frequency of TBK1 LoF mutations was 4% in our exome-sequenced cohort of 202 genetically unexplained fALS index patients, TBK1 mutations may be one of the more common genetic causes of ALS among Caucasians.</s><s>Moreover, our genetic and functional data point to a critical role of the C-terminal TBK1 adaptor-binding domain and its interaction with optineurin as a cause of neurodegeneration.</s><s>Earlier studies reported mutations in optineurin <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref> and p62/SQSTM1 14 , which are both autophagy regulating adaptor proteins and substrates of TBK1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref
