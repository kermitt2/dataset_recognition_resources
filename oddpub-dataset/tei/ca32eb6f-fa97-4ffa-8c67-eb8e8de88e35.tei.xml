<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>A cross-sectional study was conducted among three main undergraduate medical universities located in Changsha, which is the capital of Hunan Province, China, from March to June of 2016.</s><s>Final-year medical students were recruited, because they had taken the infectious disease course prior to this investigation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The questionnaire</head><p><s>The questionnaire was designed based on the report of Laurenti <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref> and adjusted appropriately.</s><s>The questionnaire focused on two dimensions: attitudes and experiences and knowledge of epidemiology and prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</s><s>Each question had five possible answers, of which only one was correct.</s><s>The students were asked to circle the most appropriate answer independently without receiving any help completing the questionnaire.</s><s>All students participated on a voluntary basis and were not remunerated for their contribution.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We found that medical students had generally poor knowledge about TB.</s><s>More than 50% of the total questions regarding TB knowledge were incorrect, which was consistent with another survey conducted in southwest China in 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref> that reported that fewer than half the students had knowledge of TB symptoms of cough/ blood-tinged sputum, local TB dispensaries and the national free TB treatment policy.</s><s>Compared with the results reported by Laurenti <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref>, the total mean percentage of correct answers in our study was lower (44.4% vs 56.5%), as were those for epidemiology and prevention (52.5% vs 63.5%) and diagnosis (35.7% vs 54.1%); however, our results regarding treatment were slightly higher (47.5% vs 45.7%).</s><s>Moreover, the general knowledge level for TB in the present study was inferior to other surveys conducted among medical students in Italy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>, Brazil <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref>, and National TB Curriculum Consortium (NTCC) schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>, which suggested a considerable need for improvement in TB knowledge among medical students.</s><s>Because this lack of knowledge may be an influencing factor for a higher TB prevalence, improved instruction in TB for medical students is necessary.</s></p><p><s>Medical students' attitudes towards TB may play an integral role in how they manage TB patients during their careers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>.</s><s>However, our study indicated that the majority of medical students lacked an accurate TB attitude.</s><s>Approximately one-quarter of the medical students considered themselves at risk of contracting TB, which was consistent with the results reported by Bhandari <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, in the subsequent multiple linear regression analysis, we observed a negative association between attitude and the level of knowledge of TB treatment.</s><s>In other words, the medical students who believed they were not at risk of contracting TB had a higher level of knowledge of TB treatment.</s><s>This finding disclosed that the medical students in our study lacked prevention awareness, although they had comparatively more TB knowledge.</s><s>Therefore, we could infer that a relationship did not necessarily exist between knowledge and attitudes for TB and that higher levels of knowledge did not result in positive attitudes.</s><s>However, this result might have been influenced by the sample size and questions asked.</s><s>Admittedly, correct knowledge and positive perceptions towards TB were prerequisites to seek early prevention and control measures.</s></p><p><s>In our study, more than 80% of the medical students had observed at least one TB case and an X-ray of a TB patient; these students reflected a better grasp of TB knowledge.</s><s>Furthermore, the multivariable linear regression analysis showed a significant association between observing at least one TB case and an X-ray of a TB patient and greater knowledge of epidemiology and prevention, diagnosis, and treatment and the total score.</s><s>This finding suggested that clinical experience was important for promoting TB knowledge among medical students.</s><s>This result might be related to the amount of curriculum time devoted to TB and the number of TB patients seen by the students <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">23]</ref>.</s><s>However, Hoffman <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> reported in 2016 that even among health professionals, a significant gap remained for improvement of knowledge and practices regarding TB.</s></p><p><s>We also found that older medical students (≥23 years) had more accurate TB knowledge about the diagnosis and total scores, leading to a positive association between age and the level of TB knowledge.</s><s>Similarly, a study by Montagna <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref> reported that correct answers to questions concerning TB and its vaccine were associated with increasing age.</s><s>TB knowledge increased with age, probably because older medical students developed more correct attitudes and behaviours regarding the disease.</s><s>The TB course schedule might also be responsible for this finding.</s></p><p><s>To appropriately address the specialized problems of TB prevention and control, education and competence need to be strengthened among health care providers.</s><s>The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the NTCC in 2003 to develop educational programmes to improve TB knowledge and practices among health professions students <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref>.</s><s>China also published the National Guideline for TB control, which emphasized TB health education <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Compared to traditional teaching, modern training methods, such as student-based teaching methods (problem-based learning), lead to improved student satisfaction and provide additional learning opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the results of the present study highlight a demand to innovate modern educational methods to promote knowledge and social responsibility among medical students.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Our study has several limitations.</s><s>First, the questionnaire from Laurenti may not be comprehensive and appropriately adapted to the specific situation in China.</s><s>Second, the representativeness of the sample needs to be improved further by increasing the sample size or adopting randomized sampling methods.</s><s>Third, gauging a person's attitude towards TB based solely on the question "I am at risk for TB" is insufficient.</s><s>This issue should be improved in a future study.</s><s>Fourth, due to the cross-sectional study design, the causal relationship between the TB knowledge level and determinants could not be explored; however, the findings provide a basis for acquiring and testing a causal hypothesis.</s><s>Finally, some reporting bias may have been inherent in this study design.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>The present study found poor knowledge of TB among final-year medical students and considerable room for improvement in terms of TB knowledge, attitudes and practices.</s><s>Moreover, practical clinical experience, attitude and age were significantly associated with more TB knowledge through a multiple linear regression analysis.</s><s>We present the current status of TB knowledge levels among medical students and promote the need for active-learning methodologies.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Demographic characteristics, experiences and attitudes of participants</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Characteristics of participants</cell><cell>Number</cell><cell>Percent</cell></row><row><cell>Demographic</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Gender</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Male</cell><cell>435</cell><cell>40.0</cell></row><row><cell>Female</cell><cell>653</cell><cell>60.0</cell></row><row><cell>Age (Std.
