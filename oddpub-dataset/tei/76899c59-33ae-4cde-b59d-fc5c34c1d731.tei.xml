<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>Patients 18 to 75 years of age who had stable moderate to severe plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months and were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy and who had inadequately responded to or were unable to tolerate or receive at least 1 conventional systemic therapy were eligible for enrollment.</s><s>Patients were required to have disease involvement of 10% or more of the body surface area, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 12 or more (scores range from 0-72, with higher scores indicating more severe disease), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and a static Physician Global Assessment of at least moderate severity (6-point scale, assessment ranges from clear to very severe). <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Patients must have had no evidence of active tuberculosis according to local guidelines; women of childbearing potential were required to use contraception.</s><s>Patients with nonplaque psoriasis, drug-induced psoriasis, or any other skin condition that might interfere with evaluation of efficacy were excluded.</s><s>Patients who previously used adalimumab or a biosimilar of adalimumab, or any 2 or more biologics for psoriasis were also excluded.</s><s>Other therapies not permitted during the study included ultraviolet B light and most topical therapies, except upper midstrength to least potent topical steroids and bland emollients, within 14 days of first study treatment dose; ultraviolet A light (with or without psoralen), excimer laser, and nonbiologic systemic therapies within 28 days of first study treatment dose; etanercept within 1 month before screening; and any other antieTNF agent or ustekinumab within 3 months before screening.</s></p><p><s>This study was conducted in accordance with the current International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating site and adhered to all local regulatory requirements including data protection requirements.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from each patient before study enrollment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This randomized, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled phase III trial consisted of a 4-week screening period, after which eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive treatment with ABP 501 or adalimumab (Fig <ref type="figure">1)</ref>.</s><s>Randomization was carried out by a computer-generated randomization schedule with stratification by prior biologic use and geographic region.</s><s>Patients were allocated by an interactive voice and web response system.</s><s>During the study, the patients, investigators, study center personnel, and sponsor remained blinded to the patient's randomized treatment assignment.</s><s>ABP 501 and adalimumab were administered in identical syringes at an initial loading dose of 80 mg subcutaneously on week 1/day 1, followed by 40 mg subcutaneously every other week (starting at week 2) for 16 weeks.</s><s>At week 16, patients with 50% or more improvement in PASI score from baseline (PASI 50) were eligible to continue in the study; patients initially randomized to receive ABP 501 continued treatment, and patients initially randomized to receive adalimumab were rerandomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continue adalimumab or switch to ABP 501.</s><s>Rerandomization ensured that the blind was maintained.</s><s>This report includes efficacy data through the initial treatment phase (week 16) and safety and immunogenicity data through week 20 after single transition from adalimumab to ABP 501 after rerandomization.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Efficacy data were analyzed using the full analysis set, which included all patients initially randomized in the study with missing values imputed using the last observation carried forward method.</s><s>The safety analysis included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, and the immunogenicity analysis included patients in the safety analysis who had at least 1 evaluable antibody test result.</s><s>Clinical equivalence for the primary end point was evaluated by comparing the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in PASI percent improvement from baseline to week 16 between treatment groups with the equivalence margin of 615.</s><s>A sample size of 340 patients was calculated to provide greater than 90% power to demonstrate clinical equivalence at a .025</s><s>significance level.</s><s>The 2-sided 95% CI of the group difference was estimated using an analysis of covariance with baseline PASI score and stratification factors of geographic region and prior biologic use as covariates.</s><s>Descriptive statistics were provided for secondary efficacy assessments.</s><s>Safety and immunogenicity data were summarized descriptively through week 16 and post-week 16 (after rerandomization) through week 20, which included data for the patients transitioned from adalimumab to ABP 501 (adalimumab/ ABP 501).</s></p></div>
