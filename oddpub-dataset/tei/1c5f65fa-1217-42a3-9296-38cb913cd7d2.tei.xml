despite a decrease in age-standardized rates of stroke mortality in the last two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Ischemic brain injury is caused by a complex cascade of pathophysiological events including exitotoxicity, peri-infarct depolarizations, apoptosis, and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Manifold interventions have been proven successful in experimental stroke studies.</s><s>However, most of them failed in the clinical studies with human stroke patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Metallothioneins (MT) are small molecular weight (6-7 kDa) cytoplasmic metal-binding proteins with a high content of cysteine residues.</s><s>Four family members of the MTs are expressed in mice and have been involved in various signaling pathways, including protection against exitotoxicity, inflammation, axonal sprouting, or regulation of apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>MT-I and MT-II are thought to act similarly and their neuroprotective effect has been ascribed to their abilities to scavenge toxic divalent metal-ions like zinc, copper, and cadmium, as well as protect against reactive oxygen species (ROS) with its cystein-rich domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>There is also speculation that MTs regulate Zn-containing transcription factors due to their zinc-finger domains and their metal-binding capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to MT-III, which in the central nervous system (CNS) is mainly expressed in neurons, MT-II is predominantly expressed in astroglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and is induced by stress, inflammation, and metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>MT-II is also secreted in the extracellular space during conditions of tissue stress or damage and where it is thought to modulate immune responses, and the resolution of tissue damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Extracellular MT-II was postulated to mediate its effects on neuronal cells through membrane receptors from the low-density lipoprotein family, mostly lipoprotein receptor-1 and -2 (megalin) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>MT was shown to regulate the expression of growth and trophic hormones responsible for angiogenesis, neurogenesis, axonal sprouting, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines.</s><s>Thus, it promotes regeneration, repair, and neuroprotective effects after brain-injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>MTs reveal neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory abilities in murine models of diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>The contribution of MT-I and-II in traumatic brain injury was demonstrated by the use of MT-I/II-double-knockout mice, which had a severely depressed wound healing when compared to wild-type mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, a whole transcriptome screening approach identified MT-II as the most significantly induced gene 12 hours after the start of reperfusion in a murine standard model of focal cerebral ischemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The neuroprotective potential of MT in experimental stroke was underlined by the reduced infarct volumes in mice over-expressing MT-I <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, as well as by the significantly enlarged infarct volumes in MT-I/-II double knockout mice after transient focal cerebral ischemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, metallothionein-III (a brain specific MT isoform) is induced after stroke in neurons and astrocytes.</s><s>MT-III knockout mice had aggravated ischemic brain damage after transient focal ischemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, but not after permanent cerebral ischemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>MT-III displays strong ROS scavenging properties but impairs neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival of neurons in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>A PEP-1-MT-III fusion protein protected against oxidative stress induced cell death in vitro and in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Various in vitro and in vivo studies since then support this robust neuroprotective effect in different models of injury, inflammation, or neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>For example, intraperitoneal treatment with MT-I/II in a model of focal cryolesion brain injury reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in a vehicle-controlled study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The exact mechanism of neuroprotective abilities of extracellular metallothionein remains unclear, but potentially involves lipoprotein-receptor related proteins (LRP), such as LRP2 or megalin <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, despite the robust neuroprotective effects in various models of CNS injury, the high degree of expression of metallothionein mRNA in the central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, as well as its significant induction under circumstances of stress and danger, there is almost no data on exogenously applied metallothionein in stroke up until now.</s><s>Only one very recent study, which was published after the start of our project, reported on a protective effect of MTapplication i.p. in a rat model of transient stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>It was further reported that isofluorane preconditioning protects neuronal and glial cells against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro and is mediated by MT <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is also discussion on whether exogenous MT can reach the CNS if applied i.m. or i.p. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, interpretation of the significance of the therapeutic potential of MT in stroke is currently hindered by the limited data (e.g. with regard to different species, stroke models, or ways of application).</s></p><p><s>In accordance with the recommendations of the STAIR criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, we therefore evaluated the MT-effect in different experimental stroke models in vitro and in vivo: MT-II was applied in vivo by different routes (i.p. vs i.v. and with vs. without co-administration of rtPA, respectively) in combination with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models in mice, as well as in vitro in combination with oxygen-glucose-deprivation (OGD).</s><s>Our results revealed a significant benefit of MT-II treatment with regard to stroke sizes and neurological deficit in standard experimental stroke models in vitro and in vivo, but also with regard to animal survival after experimental stroke.</s></p><p><s>However, model-specific differences were observed and protective effect sizes did not reach those observed with MT-I/II deficient or MT-over-expressing transgenic mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>This potentially explained by the different locations of action (extracellular vs intracellular way of action), or by the route of application <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p></div>
