<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>In an attempt to transition from paying for health care quantity to value, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently instituted the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).</s><s>Nearly 1.5 million clinicians will be taking part in MACRA through the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), whereby physicians are assigned a Composite Performance Score based on quality, clinical practice improvement activities, Meaningful Use Electronic Health Records, and measures of resource utilization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> For the resource use measure, CMS will calculate average health care expenditures for patients attributed to an individual clinician or group of clinicians; this measure will be included in the composite score which will determine whether a provider is financially rewarded or penalized.</s><s>The purpose of this measure is to evaluate resource utilization, which also incorporates measures of quality.</s><s>For example, although a physician who regularly consults other professionals during a patient's hospital admission or prescribes home care may have higher episode spending because of resource utilization, surgeons who have patients who were readmitted to the hospital after a complication would also have higher measures of resource utilization compared with surgeons with no readmissions.</s><s>The MIPS program will lead to Part B payment increases or reductions of up to 4% in 2019 and 9% by 2022.</s><s>Although the resource use measure will not be part of the composite score in 2019, it will be weighted 10% in 2020 and 30% in 2021. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The stated goal of the resource use measure is to make physicians aware of, and accountable for, the health care payments of their patients and to provide actionable data to reduce expenditures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>owever, making such data actionable requires an understanding of how physician-specific episode payments vary.</s><s>Although this has been evaluated for hospital-based episode payments, it is unclear at the physician level whether all component payments (i.e., index admission, readmission, physician services, or postacute care) experience similar variation and whether these patterns are consistent across geographic region and patient characteristics (i.e., number of comorbidities and/or cancer characteristics).</s><s>If available, such data would provide important insight into the current state of physician-level episode payments and may provide both physicians and CMS with important insights around how to decrease 90-d episode payments.</s></p><p><s>In this context, we examined expenditures for major cancer surgery as a model for understanding baseline physician-specific variation in 90-d episode payments before implementation of the policy initiative, especially for oncologic surgeons.</s><s>We specifically used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data to evaluate physician-specific episode-based payments for the treatment of four common surgical malignancies: prostate, kidney, lung, and colorectal cancer.</s><s>We further examined component payments by high-and low-payment providers and determined if the variation in these payments was consistent across geographic region, number of patient comorbidities, and cancer stage.</s><s>By virtue of this approach, our findings will inform physicians, payers, and policymakers on current physician-specific variation in 90-d surgical episodes whether this variation is consistent for all component payments and potential strategies that physicians and CMS might use to decrease health care expenditures after implementation of the MIPS program.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p><s>We used data from SEER registries linked with Medicare claims data from 2008 to 2012.</s><s>SEEReMedicare is a patientlevel dataset that links Medicare claims with clinical, demographic, and outcome data from SEER cancer registries covering 17 major regions across the United States.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>Our study cohort included patients, aged 66e99 y, who underwent a prostatectomy, nephrectomy, lung, or colorectal resection for cancer.</s><s>We identified patients using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9), diagnosis and procedure codes and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Appendix Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>We excluded cases that were missing an ICD-9 diagnosis or procedure code for the cancer of interest, a CPT code for surgery of interest, and/or a cancer diagnosis listed in the SEER file.</s><s>We further excluded patients who underwent multiple surgeries for different cancers, those that did not have continuous Medicare Parts A and B enrollment, and/or those who participated in Medicare Health Maintenance Organizations during the study interval.</s></p><p><s>For each patient, we determined the cancer stage, number of comorbidities according to the method described by Charlson et al., and the geographic census region (i.e., Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) of the treating hospital. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>tates were categorized into the corresponding Census region based on data from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey.</s><s>Cancer stage was evaluated using the SEER Patient Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary File.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physician attribution</head><p><s>To evaluate provider-level variation, we attributed each episode of care to an individual surgeon.</s><s>To do this, we first identified the National Provider Identifier associated with the surgery claim.</s><s>If more than one physician was associated with the claim, we attributed the episode to the physician with the appropriate corresponding Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) specialty code.</s><s>The HCFA specialty code list for the corresponding cancer diagnoses is as follows: prostate and kidney cancer, HCFA specialty code 34 (urology); lung cancer, HCFA specialty codes 33 (thoracic surgery), 78 (cardiac surgery), 02 (general surgery), and 91 (surgical oncology); colorectal cancer, HCFA specialty codes 28 (colorectal surgery), 02 (general surgery), and 91 (surgical oncology).</s><s>If more than one provider with an appropriate HCFA specialty code was associated with the index surgery, the episode was attributed to the provider who received the larger payment for the claim.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Estimating 90-d episode payments</head><p><s>We first identified the index hospitalization for each patient meeting our inclusion criteria.</s><s>We then aggregated all payments for claims that occurred from 2 d before the initial hospital admission through 90 d postdischarge.</s><s>We selected the 90d episode because it is consistent with the global surgery period and other episode-based payment programs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Component payments included those for the index hospitalization, readmission(s), professional charges, postacute care, and hospice.</s><s>Differences in episode spending may occur because of variation in any one or multiple of these components.</s><s>To account for differences in Medicare payments based on disproportionate share payments, teaching status, and geography, we price-standardized all payments using previously described methods adapted from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>In addition, we used established methods to reduce the influence of outliers on payments, by excluding patient's whose episode payments were below the first and above the 99th percentile.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> Examining provider-level variation in 90-d episode payments</s></p><p><s>To evaluate provider-specific variation in 90-d episode payments, we calculated each surgeon's average surgical episode payment.</s><s>We then examined payment variation among the most and least expensive providers.</s><s>To do this, we sorted physicians into quartiles based on average total episode payments.</s><s>We then calculated the difference in total and individual component payments (i.e., index hospitalization, readmission, professional, postacute care, and hospice) between physicians in the highest payment quartile and those in the lowest.</s><s>We also calculated the share (i.e., percentage) that each component contributed to the total difference in episode payments.</s></p><p><s>To determine whether the variation was consistent across cancer stage, number of patient comorbidities, and hospital geographic region, we calculated payment quartiles for each cancer stage group (i.e., I, II, III, and IV), number of comorbidities, (i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 3), and geographic region (i.e., Northeast, Midwest, South, and West).</s><s>We then evaluated the differences in total and component payments among physicians with the highest and lowest 90-d episode payments for each of these patient and hospital characteristics and examined the percent of variation that each individual component contributed to the total difference in episode payments for each of these characteristics.</s></p><p><s>All analyses were performed using SAS v 9.4 (Cary, NC) and STATA (College Station, TX).</s><s>The University of Michigan's Institutional Review Board deemed this study exempt from review.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We identified 39,109 patients who underwent a major cancer surgery by 1 of 7182 providers.</s><s>The distribution of cancer sites was as follows: 22% prostate, 11% kidney, 17% lung, and 51% colorectal.</s></p><p><s>Mean physician-specific 90-d episode payments for Medicare patients undergoing prostatectomy, nephrectomy, lung or colorectal resections were $11,036, $17,964, $30,432, and $29,572, respectively.</s><s>We observed wide variation in payments for each procedure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Prostatectomy exhibited the lowest payment variation, and colorectal resections the greatest.</s><s>The highest spending physicians for prostate, kidney, lung, and colorectal cancer had total payments that were 6, 9, 20, and 21 times greater than those for the lowest spending physicians, respectively (ranges for prostatectomy: $7046e$40,687, nephrectomy: $8855e$82,489, lung resection: $11,167e$223,467; colorectal resection: $9711e$199,480).</s></p><p><s>The payment component demonstrating the largest difference in the 90-d episode varied for each procedure.</s><s>Physician payments were responsible for the greatest difference in episode payments for prostatectomy (29%), postacute care for nephrectomy (38%), and colorectal resections (38%), and the index hospitalization was responsible for the greatest difference in episode payments for lung resections (43%; Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, with the exception of prostate cancer (where payment differences were more evenly balanced between components), the payment component with the largest differences in expenditures was similar across cancer stage, number of patient comorbidities, and geographic region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>These components were postacute care and index hospitalization for kidney and lung cancer, respectively, and primarily postacute care for colorectal cancer.</s><s>For prostate cancer, readmissions, professional services, and postacute care, each accounted for the largest component payment</s></p></div>

and thus, our findings may not generalize to younger patients with cancer.</s><s>However, estimates for the Medicare population are policy relevant, given CMS' recent interest in evaluating physicianspecific spending.</s><s>Second, we evaluate 90-d episode payments that may not align with Medicare's final resource use measure.</s><s>Although one of the current resource use measures is based on Medicare Spending per Beneficiary, which includes claims from 3 d before the index hospitalization and 30 d after discharge, another measure is based on episodes for which the period after hospital discharge has yet to be determined.</s><s>We evaluated a 90-d episode window for this analysis because it is consistent with the global surgery period and other episode-based payment programs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>In addition, it is unclear whether CMS will include payments for care of all conditions (including pre-existing conditions) within a specified period or just those that occur as a direct result of the procedure and/or index admission.</s><s>CMS has used both the broadly defined definitions (i.e., including all conditions) and the more narrowly defined approach (i.e., only including treatment for conditions directly attributable to the index admission) to evaluate episode spending. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref></s><s>Although we evaluated payments for all conditions within 90 d from the index admission, previous research demonstrated that the broad and narrowly defined episodes of care are strongly correlated, with minimal payment differences for most hospitals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref></s><s>Third, our evaluation did not adjust for case-mix (i.e., age, race) or diagnosis-related group payment differences.</s><s>However, our evaluation seeks to determine component payments on which CMS can direct efforts to decrease total episode payments, and these component payments were similar across geographic region and patient characteristics.</s><s>In addition, the method of risk adjustment used for MIPS has yet to be finalized, and differing risk adjustment methods may impact analyses discordantly.</s><s>Fourth, we evaluated 90d episode payments and their components for cancer surgery.</s><s>Additional analyses will need to be performed for other conditions and episodes to properly understand physician variation across conditions.</s></p><p><s>These limitations notwithstanding, our findings have significant implications for physicians, policymakers, and payers.</s><s>For oncologic surgeons, there is clearly wide variation in how much episodes of care cost under their direction.</s><s>At a minimum, receiving such feedback will provide high-cost surgeons with some of the first insight into how they compare with peers and may drive changes in practice patterns that yield cost savings.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, our findings may arguably have different implications for policymakers and payers.</s><s>Although the wide variation in physician-specific episode payments suggests that measuring resource utilization in MIPS could portray meaningful information for CMS to initiate efforts at reducing episode payments, there are manifold challenges and concerns around the fidelity and actionability of this approach; these include discerning true physician performance from random noise (i.e., reliability), <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> adequate risk-adjustment for differences in patient complexity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref> individual physician's abilities to translate cost information into meaningful change, and the substantial resources required by CMS to provide payment data to each physician.</s><s>Given these limitations, an alternative approach to individual physician accountability for resource utilization is to use physician-specific measures of resource utilization to identify procedure-specific "signatures" with respect to component payments that drive payment variation.</s><s>CMS can then direct its efforts toward these specific components to decrease health care expenditures.</s><s>In fact, this approach has precedence from the bundled payment model for coronary artery bypass graft, which encouraged the use of cardiac rehabilitation to improve quality and decrease longterm payments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s>In addition, there is greater reliability in using aggregated rather than individual physician-specific data.</s><s>In fact, our analyses found that the component payments are consistent across patient characteristics and geographic regions, and CMS could therefore provide physicians with a framework or specific suggestions on which to act to decrease payments.</s><s>With this approach, although every physician will not demonstrate savings by aiming efforts at decreasing that particular component (i.e., if she or he is already a low spender for that component), substantive savings could be realized across the population of clinicians.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, our analyses identify the magnitude of physician-level payment variation for prostate, kidney, lung, and colorectal cancer surgery.</s><s>The components with the greatest variation in episode payments vary by cancer type but remain stable across geographic region, number of patient comorbidities, and cancer stage.</s><s>These findings suggest that measuring physician-specific episode payments may provide valuable information, but that to decrease payments for cancer surgery, CMS should direct its efforts on decreasing specific episode components, rather than individual physician spending.</s><s>Moving forward, it will be important to evaluate component payments for other surgical and nonsurgical diagnoses, assess explicit measures for decreasing component payments, and evaluate how risk-adjustment impacts payments.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 e</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 e Physician-specific 90-d surgical episode payments for (A) prostate, (B) kidney, (C) lung, and (D) colorectal cancers.</s><s>(Color version of figure is available online.)</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,56.75,359.49,466.29,356.09" type="bitmap" /></figure>
