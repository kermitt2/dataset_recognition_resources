<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EPs 7630 provokes rapid production of immune mediators</head><p><s>Understanding the molecular effects of EPs 7630 is key to take advantage of its medical potential and the identification of further indications.</s><s>So far, data regarding its target cells and effects thereof within the human immune system are lacking.</s><s>To address this issue, we first investigated whether EPs 7630 influences resting human immune cells.</s><s>Therefore, PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were treated or not (control) with EPs 7630 at two concentrations and were tested for cytokine production.</s><s>As a comparison, these cells were also stimulated with toll-like receptor (TLR)3 [poly(I:C)] and TLR4 ligands (bacterial lipopolysaccharide), which mainly act on antigen-presenting cells (e.g., monocytes) and mimic viral and bacterial infection, respectively.</s><s>As further positive controls a mix of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12), able to activate NK-cells, as well as T-cell activating anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies, were used.</s><s>Interestingly, cells responded to EPs 7630 by secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 with levels that were much higher than those induced by the mix of cytokines and TCR engagement (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore EPs 7630 slightly triggered IL-10 production, and this production was clearly smaller (~3-to 5-fold) than that induced by CD3/CD28-mediated stimulation.</s><s>Importantly, the cytokine profile induced by EPs 7630 in PBMCs was also different from that induced by TLR3 or TLR4 ligands (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>In fact, the EPs 7630-induced response was much more pro-inflammatory than that induced by the viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>As no relevant cytotoxicity or influence on PBMC proliferation were observed by EPs 7630, the cytokine increase provoked by EPs 7630 seems to be due to an induced production rate (S1 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>A more detailed investigation revealed a concentration-dependent induction of cellular TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion by EPs 7630, with clear effects already seen at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, a kinetic analysis of EPs 7630-dependent cytokine production by PBMCs revealed, that especially TNF-α is produced very quickly (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>Afterwards, the TNF-α level continuously decline, probably as a result of binding and internalization of this cytokine by monocytes.</s><s>In contrast to TNF-α, IL-6 and, in particular, IL-10 were produced more slowly after EPs 7630 stimulation, with levels steadily increasing over time.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EPs 7630 activates monocytes predominantly via selected MAPK pathways</head><p><s>To prove monocytes as being the cell population sensitive among PBMCs to the action of EPs 7630, we analyzed intracellularly stained TNF-α in these cells after EPs 7630 stimulation using flow cytometry.</s><s>Indeed, we observed a strong dose-dependent induction of TNF-α production in monocytes, whereby, similar to the effect on whole PBMC, this effect was already seen at 1 μg/ml (Fig 3A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">and 3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To understand the action of EPs 7630 at the molecular level we then investigated the signaling pathways activated by this drug.</s><s>PBMCs were treated for 10 and 30 min with EPs 7630 at two different concentrations (3 and 10 μg/ml) and, as comparison, with TLR3 and TLR4 ligands, the IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-12 comprising cytokine mixture, and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies.</s><s>Because of the cytokine profile observed after PBMC incubation with EPs 7630, we focused our analysis on MAP kinase, NF-κB, and PI3K pathways.</s><s>Respective Western blot analyses revealed that EPs 7630 activated the MAP kinases JNK1/2, p38, and ERK1/2.</s><s>Additionally we observed a slight activation of the PI3K (phosphorylation of Akt) and NF-κB (phosphorylation of p65) pathways, whereas STAT5 expectedly remained unaffected (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C)</ref>.</s><s>In line with the different cytokine profiles induced by EPs 7630 versus TLR3 and TLR4 ligands, cytokine mixture, and anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies, the pattern of activated kinases by EPs 7630 was unique.</s><s>By pharmacological blocking using the selective inhibitors SP600125 (JNK1/ 2/3), PD98059 (MEK; activator of ERK1/2), SB202190 (p38α/β), and wedelolactone (IκB kinase), we observed that EPs 7630-induced production of TNF-α in monocytes was strongly dependent on p38 activity and at least partly dependent on the activation of Erk1/2 and NF-κB (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EPs 7630 modulates the immune response to bacterial and viral recognition</head><p><s>EPs 7630 is very frequently used for infection prevention, in particular in the autumn and winter.</s><s>Therefore, we asked whether EPs 7630 pretreatment would influence the immune response in the context of viral and bacterial infections.</s><s>To address this question, we pretreated PBMCs with increasing concentrations of EPs 7630 (0.1-3 μg/ml) for 24 h followed by stimulation with TLR3 or TLR4 ligands (mimicking viral or bacterial infection, respectively) for another 24 h.</s><s>Surprisingly, we observed that EPs 7630 pretreatment concentration-dependently inhibited the TLR3-and TLR4-mediated production of TNF-α and IL-10 (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, we detected EPs 7630 concentration-dependent high IL-6 secretion in this situation (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that EPs 7630 pretreatment specifically modulates the cytokine production in subsequent viral and bacterial infection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The special extract of Pelargonium sidoides roots, EPs 7630 (Umckaloabo 1 ) is therapeutically active against upper respiratory tract infections and currently approved for the application in acute bronchitis in Germany.</s><s>Surprisingly, the large use of this preparation is not associated with a respective knowledge regarding its pharmacodynamic properties.</s><s>In fact, besides the known anti-infective properties of EPs 7630, directed against viruses and bacteria, little is known about its molecular effects and cellular targets.</s><s>Moreover, we do not understand the pathway(s), via which EPs 7630 mediates its effects on cells.</s><s>So far, the majority of published studies regarding the effects of Pelargonium extracts concern tissue cells.</s><s>Only few studies involved immune cells, and most of them focused on murine macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Especially, there are no studies that investigated the influence of EPs 7630 on cytokine production by human primary immune cells.</s><s>However, cytokines play an essential role in the defense against bacteria and viruses and in the intercellular communication between immune and tissue cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the focus of our current study was to unravel the possible influence of EPs 7630 on human immune cells.</s></p><p><s>Our data show that EPs 7630 strongly and dose-dependently induced the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in human blood immune cells.</s><s>Moreover, a less prominent induction of the anti-inflammatory acting IL-10 was observed.</s><s>Importantly, the cytokine profile induced by EPs 7630 was completely different from that induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents that caused production of a more anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu.</s><s>These observations suggest that EPs 7630 acts as an immunostimulant and, before infection, may promote the innate immune defense and the ability of the body to quickly and efficiently eliminate potentially incoming microbes.</s><s>Underlying mechanisms may include in particular the activation of phagocytes by TNF-α, the induction of acute phase proteins in the liver, and the elevation of neutrophil generation in the bone marrow.</s></p><p><s>Within human PBMCs, monocytes but not CD4 + T cells were found to be targets of EPs 7630 and to produce high amounts of TNF-α upon this treatment.</s><s>This result is in line with previous data showing that Pelargonium extract acted on murine myeloid cells, in which it induced the production of TNF-α and IL-1β <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>When investigating the signaling cascades induced by EPs 7630, we found a strong MAPK kinase pathway activation, which included phosphorylation of JNK, Erk1/2, and p38.</s><s>Furthermore, EPs 7630 slightly provoked NF-κB and PI3K pathway activation.</s><s>However, pharmacological blockade of only p38 resulted in a strongly decreased monocyte TNF-α production.</s><s>The observation that this signaling pattern differed from that induced by TLR3 and TLR4 ligand, inflammatory cytokines, and CD3/CD28 engagement suggest that Pelargonium extract affects monocytes via receptors different from those used by the mentioned stimuli.</s></p><p><s>It has previously been reported that the majority of in vitro macrophage activation with immune stimulating botanicals is caused by lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide derived from bacterial contamination of the herbal raw material or from endophytes colonizing these plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>As described above, we observed that the EPs 7630-activated pathway and cytokine pattern was very different from the response seen after stimulation of human PBMCs with bacterial lipopolysaccharide.</s><s>Furthermore, analysis of EPs 7630 for the presence of contaminating bacterial lipopolysaccharide by a Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay revealed a very low content of less than 200 EU/mg, which is equivalent to about 20 ng/mg.</s><s>Currently, it is not known which constituents of EPs 7630 are responsible for the observed effects on cytokine production.</s><s>Previous investigations have suggested that the antiviral activity of the extract is quantification of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in respective culture supernatants by ELISA.</s><s>Mean (± SEM) cytokine concentration data from 12 donors are given as percent of 0 μg/ml EPs 7630 group (control).</s><s>Cytokine concentrations in the absence of EPs 7630 in TL3L and TL4L groups were: 1267±414 and 1534±324 pg/ml (TNF-α), 1278±369 and 2135±650 pg/ml (IL-6), 1011±127 and 1430±140 pg/ml (IL-10), respectively.</s><s>Significant differences compared to 0 μg/ml EPs 7630 group are indicated (* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01,</s><s>Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test).</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0138075.g004</s><s>primarily due to its content of prodelphinidins <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>As these complex molecules may not be systemically bioavailable, further studies are required to demonstrate whether the clinically observed therapeutic effect of EPs 7630 is mediated by components different from prodelphinidins via stimulation of the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract.</s></p><p><s>By our study, we also demonstrated that EPs 7630 preincubation of immune cells influenced their subsequent, by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents induced cytokine production towards an IL-6-dominated milieu, with lower TNF-α and IL-10 content.</s><s>This observation suggests that taking EPs 7630 before infection might reduce flu-like symptoms during infection, which are associated with the action of TNF-α.</s><s>Furthermore, the EPs 7630 caused elevated IL-6 production during infection might strengthen the production of acute phase proteins, neutrophilic granulocyte generation in the bone marrow, and the establishment of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells.</s><s>In fact, the differentiation of Th17 cells is, besides IL-1β, IL-23 and TGF-β, particularly dependent on the presence of IL-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, IL-6 also cooperates with TNF-α in inducing the differentiation of Th22 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> and both Th17 and Th22 cells play an essential role in the defense against microbes at body barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, by indirect induction of Th17 and Th22 responses, EPs 7630 treatment of patients may promote the adaptive host defense against different viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens at respiratory epithelia.</s></p></div>
