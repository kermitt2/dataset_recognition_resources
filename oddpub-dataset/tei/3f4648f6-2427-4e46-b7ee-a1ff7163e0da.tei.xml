<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure.</head><p><s>Participants were told that they would perform two separate experiments in the fMRI scanner.</s></p><p><s>The first one was described as a cognitive neuroscience experiment.</s><s>The second one was introduced as not linked to the previous one and having a marketing background.</s><s>All participants were naive to the real aim of the study.</s><s>At the end of the experiment participants were probed for suspicions about the experiment's true purpose.</s></p><p><s>The study consisted out of a three-factorial experimental design.</s><s>The first factor was ethicality (ethical or unethical behavior).</s><s>The second factor described the modality (writing a note with the hand (hand) or leaving a voicemail (mouth)).</s><s>The third factor was the set of products participants had to rate with respect to the desirability (toothpaste and mouthwash products vs. hand soaps).</s></p><p><s>While lying in the fMRI participants enacted short scenarios modeled analogue to Zhong and Liljenquist 1 and Lee and Schwarz 2 .</s><s>For example, participants read the following scenario: "Imagine you are a law-firm associate competing for promotion with a colleague Sven.</s><s>Today in the morning you found an important document on the floor by accident, which has obviously been lost by your colleague Sven.</s><s>Returning this document to Chris would be very important for Sven, but might hurt your own career.</s><s>" After 18 seconds a new screen showed up, instructing the participant to leave Sven a voice mail (mouth condition) or a note with a pencil on a paper (hand condition).</s><s>In the unethical voice mail condition (mouth condition) the participant was prompted with the following screen: "Please leave a voice mail for Sven.</s><s>Tell him who you are and that you did not find his document.</s><s>Please speak now!".</s><s>In the ethical voicemail condition (telling the truth) the participant was prompted with this instruction: "Please leave a voice mail for Sven.</s><s>Tell him who you are and that you did find the document.</s><s>Please speak now!"</s><s>In the hand condition the participants were faced with the following instructions (ethical): "Please leave a note for Sven.</s><s>Write him that you did not find his document and sign the note.</s><s>Start now!".</s><s>For the ethical condition the instruction was like this: "Please leave a note for Sven.</s><s>Write him that you did find his document and sign the note.</s><s>Start now!".</s></p><p><s>The participants had 17 seconds to perform this task.</s><s>Then a new screen showed up asking the participants to rate the following products on a four-point scale (Likert-scale, 1 = completely undesirable, 4 = completely desirable).</s><s>After 2.5 seconds two pictures of products were shown, each lasting for 4 seconds with an interstimulus interval of 9 seconds.</s><s>Thus, the participants had 13 seconds to rate each of the products (earlier responding did not automatically start the next trial).</s><s>One of the pictures was taken out of a category of hand soap products, the other picture belonged to a category of toothpastes and mouthwash products.</s></p><p><s>Participants were required to press buttons with their right hand using a key with four buttons (ranging from + 2 to − 2) to assess the products.</s><s>Before the experiment they were explained that they could weight their responses from moderate (inner buttons) to extreme (outer buttons).</s><s>Participants were made familiar with both tasks before beginning of the experiment.</s></p><p><s>The experiment consisted out of a total of 60 scenarios.</s><s>Each scenario was repeated two times, followed by either the instruction to convey a malevolent or the instruction to give a benevolent message.</s><s>Half of the scenarios included the instruction to leave a written message, the other half asked the participants to leave a message on the voice mail.</s><s>The order of presentation of the two product categories (first or second place) was randomized.</s><s>Furthermore, the products for each category were randomized over all conditions (within and between subjects).</s><s>Products were chosen as equally attractive in a pre-study.</s><s>Participants were told that the voice messages inside the scanner were recorded for later analysis.</s><s>In fact we did not record these messages.</s></p><p><s>Visual images were back-projected to a screen at the end of the scanner bed close to the subject's feet.</s><s>Subjects viewed the images through a mirror mounted on the birdcage of the receiving coil.</s><s>Foam cushions were placed tightly around the side of the subject's head to minimize head motion.</s></p><p><s>The experiment consisted out of six runs, each lasting for about 12 minutes and including all conditions.</s><s>Participants were allowed to take short breaks between the runs.</s><s>All data were tested for normality of distribution and possible outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>FMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis.</s><s>Data acquisition was done on a 3 T scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Trio, Germany).</s><s>T2-weighted functional images were acquired using gradient echo-planar images (TR = 2 sec, TE = 35 ms, flip angle = 80 degrees, FOV = 224 mm).</s><s>For each subject, data were acquired in six runs.</s><s>In each session, 404 volumes were acquired.</s><s>Functional volumes consisted of 32 slices.</s><s>Each volume comprised 3.5 mm slices (no gap, in plane voxel size 3.5 × 3.5 mm).</s><s>For anatomic reference a high-resolution T1-weighted structural image was acquired using an MP-RAGE sequence (TR = 1650 ms, TE = 5 ms).</s></p><p><s>Image preprocessing and analysis was performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping Software (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK).</s><s>Individual functional images were realigned to correct for inter-scan movement using sinc interpolation and subsequently normalized into a standard anatomical space (MNI, Montreal Neurological Institute template) resulting in isotropic 3 mm voxels.</s><s>Data were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full-width half maximum.</s></p><p><s>We then computed statistical parametric maps by using multiple regressions with the hemodynamic response function modeled in SPM8.</s><s>Data analyses were performed at two levels.</s><s>First, we examined data on the individual subject level by using a fixed effects model.</s><s>Second, the resulting parameter estimates for each regressor at each voxel were entered into a second-level analysis with the random effects model.</s><s>In order to examine responses in sensorimotor brain areas when participants perform the (un) ethical task we calculated statistical contrasts (t-tests) for the time window while speaking relative to rest and writing relative to rest, respectively.</s><s>In order to examine brain responses while assessing the products we examined the time window while evaluating the desirability of the products.</s><s>We computed an ANOVA for repeated measurements with the factors previous ethical behavior (moral vs. immoral), set of products (toothpaste and mouthwash vs. hand soaps), and modality (hand vs. mouth).</s><s>Statistical contrasts (t tests) were then performed to examine cortical activation associated with moral and immoral behavior for the different set of products and different modalities.</s><s>In order to test our hypothesis that sensorimotor brain regions subserve the embodiment of the moral-purity metaphor in a topographic way, we masked these effects with results of the speaking and writing task, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Parameter estimates for voxels in the sensorimotor regions of interest (maximum peaks in SI and M1) were tested for possible correlations (Pearson) with behavioral responses (bias in rating of products).</s><s>In addition to those brain areas we also tested

activations that survived a threshold of p &lt; 0.05, family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple comparisons.</s><s>Correction was achieved by imposing a threshold for the volume of clusters

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The theory of embodied cognition makes clear assumptions of an interaction between body and mind.</s><s>The current study aimed to test these assumptions by examining neural mechanisms that underlie embodied knowledge.</s><s>In particular, we aimed to determine the role of the sensorimotor cortices in the moral-purity metaphor.</s><s>In line with previous studies we report that people find purification of the "dirty" body part more desirable than purification of other body parts, thus demonstrating that moral purity is specific to the sensorimotor modality involved in moral transgression.</s><s>FMRI results provide support for the assumptions of the theory of embodied cognition by showing that this interaction was associated with activation especially in the somatosensory cortices (SI).</s><s>This engagement of SI was somatotopically organized, thus activating mouth areas while evaluating products after lying in a voicemail (but only for toothpaste and mouthwash products) and hand areas after lying in a written note (but only for hand wash products).</s><s>In addition, the hand area in SI was not recruited for the verbal condition and the mouth area not for the hand condition, thus demonstrating a somatotopic specifity and a double dissociation of the effects.</s><s>The theory of embodiment argues that cognition is deeply rooted in sensory experiences.</s><s>According to this theory social cognitions (e.g., the moral appropriateness of actions) are strongly based on bodily sensations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Numerous behavioral studies confirm the theory of embodied cognitions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ).</s><s>Studies using neuroimaging approaches offer the chance to provide additional support by showing potential engagement of sensorimotor brain areas involved in embodied cognitions, which could proof the assumptions of the theory in a direct way.</s><s>Several studies employing fMRI report an involvement of somatosensory brain areas, in particular SI, when examining neural correlates of embodied metaphors.</s><s>The current study is the first one demonstrating that metaphors are topographically reflected in the somatosensory homunculus, thus providing strong support for the theory of embodiment in general as well as for a fundamental role of SI in this theory in particular.</s></p><p><s>Our behavior results confirmed the study by Lee and Schwarz 2 in a with-in subjects design.</s><s>First, we replicated the Macbeth effect for both modalities.</s><s>Thus, evaluations of purification goods were higher after lying relative to telling the truth, for both modalities.</s><s>These results are in line with the ones reported by Zhong and Liljenquist 1 (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> ).</s><s>Second, participants preferred purification of the "dirty" body part over purification of other body parts, thus confirming the results of Lee and Schwarz 2 .</s><s>Hence, toothpaste and mouthwash products were evaluated more positively after lying in a voicemail but not after lying in a written note, demonstrating that embodiment is sensitive to motor modality.</s><s>However, hand wash products seem to wash away the sins both for lying in a voicemail as well as for lying in a written message.</s><s>This result differs from Lee and Schwarz 2 .</s><s>Nevertheless, Lee and Schwarz 2 used slightly different products (mouthwash and hand sanitizer).</s><s>In addition, they used a between-subjects-design with a higher number of participants.</s><s>Last, participants of our study had another cultural background.</s><s>One or a combination of these points might explain the lack of specifity in the hand modality in our study.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of our fMRI data confirmed our behavioral results.</s><s>The Macbeth effect for the hand modality (lying vs. telling the truth in a written note) was accompanied with activation in sensorimotor brain areas including SI, BA6 and

behavioral results, which failed to find a significant difference here, see previous paragraph).</s><s>Similarly, the Macbeth effect for the mouth modality (lying vs. telling the truth in a voicemail) was associated with activity in SI and premotor cortex.</s><s>Again, these brain regions were engaged after immoral relative to moral deeds, but here only when assessing toothpaste and mouthwash products, not when judging the desirability of hand wash products.</s><s>Thus, neural correlates of the embodied moral-purity metaphor rely on sensorimotor brain regions, in particular SI.</s><s>This is in line with previous studies investigating other embodied metaphors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>Moreover, SI was differentially involved depending on the modality of lying.</s><s>Thus, lying in a written note resulted in more dorsal activation of the somatosensory homunculus when assessing the hand wash products.</s><s>This more dorsal activation was in line with the activation of SI during the writing task (the hand area of the homunculus).</s><s>In contrast, lying in a voicemail resulted in a more inferior activation of the somatosensory map, similar to the activation of SI during the lying (speaking) task (the mouth area of the homunculus).</s><s>We conclude that the results confirm the hypothesis that embodiment is sensitive to modality and that the neural underpinnings of this sensitivity are reflected in the somatotopical map in SI.</s></p><p><s>While previous studies already documented a role for somatosensory brain regions, in particular SI, for embodied metaphors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> ), the present study demonstrates for the first time a functional topographical dissociation of activity in SI depending on the modality used in moral transgression.</s><s>Hence, SI seems to maintain a central role for embodied metaphors.</s><s>This role for SI in embodied metaphors is in line with other studies showing an involvement of somatosensory brain areas in social cognitions.</s><s>Whereas classic studies understood this body map representation in SI as fix and reflecting the physical location of peripheral stimulation in the form of the famous somatosensory homunculus, recent studies challenge this view and suggest a more complex role for SI.</s><s>For example, numerous studies suggest that the somatosensory cortices are engaged in social perceptions, in particular to empathy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ).</s><s>Furthermore, mirror-like activations in somatosensory cortices when observing others being touched have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>These mirror-like activations in the somatosensory cortices have been shown to be linked with the empathic abilities of the observer (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> ).</s><s>The present study extends these results of a role of SI in social perception by showing that embodied metaphors such as moral purity are based on somatosensory activations in a functional topographic way.</s></p><p><s>But why are somatosensory brain areas important for embodied metaphors such as moral purity?</s><s>It has been hypothesized that early experiences with the physical world structure our later understanding or representation of more abstract concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s><s>For example, Williams et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref>   bodily sensation.</s><s>Thereby, the concept formation process or "scaffolding" must be first based on bodily sensations.</s></p><p><s>Wilson <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> added an evolutionary argument by arguing that we are "evolved from creatures whose neural resources were devoted primarily to perceptual and motor processing".</s><s>In his neural reuse theory Anderson argues that the cognitive roles played by each region of the brain are various <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Brain areas are involved in different neural partnerships depending on tasks and circumstances.</s><s>According to Anderson neural reuse means a form of neuroplasticity in which neural elements originally developed for one purpose are put to multiple uses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>His neural reuse theory points to our brains early-evolving capacity for recurring interaction with our environment.</s><s>Anderson claims that the abstract use of physical concepts (e.g., using purity as a metaphor for moral behavior) may be an example of how the brain uses old strategies in new ways.</s><s>In this way, our novel and abstract higher-order cognitive processes may be just recombinations of more simple and basic brain processes.</s></p><p><s>Beyond activation of sensorimotor activations we also found engagement of hippocampus and amygdala accompanying the Macbeth effect.</s><s>These structures are well known to be related to memory functions.</s><s>More in detail, it has been suggested that those memory structures in the medial temporal lobe may bind distributed activated sites in the neocortex that represent a whole memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>A role for memory structures during the Macbeth effect is in line with the assumptions of the embodiment theory.</s></p><p><s>While we found bilateral engagement of the somatosensory cortices for the hand (soap) condition, the verbal condition seemed to involve in particular the somatosensory cortex of the left hemisphere.</s><s>This may be explained simply by the fact that we wash both of our hands with soap, but in general brush our teethes only with the dominant (here the right) hand.</s><s>However, recent studies also draw the attention to a functional asymmetry in the somatosensory cortices especially for social tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, future research is needed to understand the role of hemispheric asymmetry in the neural underpinnings of the Macbeth effect.</s><s>" Thus, together with the studies by Zhong and Lillenquist 1 and Schnall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , the results of our study demonstrate that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive and contextual processes rather than reasoning and conscious thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Our results show that the neural underpinnings of these intuitive processes are in particular the somatosensory cortex, an area that is currently also prominently discussed for social perceptions in general (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> ).</s><s>We conclude that the role of this brain region seems to be more complex than previously thought, possibly playing important roles in knowledge acquisition and understanding of others and thereby providing support for the neural reuse theory by Anderson <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Hence, our results support the view that the body influences the mind just as the mind influences the body.</s></p></div><figure
