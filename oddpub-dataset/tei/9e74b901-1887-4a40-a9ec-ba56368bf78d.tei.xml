<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p><s>Given the lack of consensus regarding the pathological assessment of postneoadjuvant systemic therapy breast cancer specimens in clinical trials, an international working group of pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists, and gynecologists was convened by the BIG-NABCG collaboration.</s><s>Members were nominated by BIG-NABCG leadership and the working group co-chairs, as well as by sites responding to the collection of standard operating procedures described below.</s><s>Members represented an array of disciplines and countries.</s></p><p><s>First, to gauge existing variability in approaches to postneoadjuvant systemic therapy pathologic assessment, we collected standard operating procedures from neoadjuvant breast cancer trials and from sites participating in such trials.</s><s>ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>was searched for mainly academic, phase II or III neoadjuvant trials activated since 2005, with a planned recruitment of at least 100 patients.</s><s>Earlier trials were included if they were one of the trials included in the US Food and Drug Administration pooled analysis noted above, or otherwise were major trials (e.g., 41000 patients).</s><s>Standard operating procedures were requested of 48 trials, both from the leaders of the trials themselves (trial standard operating procedures) and, where leaders responded, the sites involved in those trials (site-specific standard operating procedures).</s><s>Information from the standard operating procedures was abstracted into categories of 'extent of sampling,' 'quantification/size/grading/cellularity,' 'lymph node evaluation,' 'retesting of markers,' and 'other information.'</s><s>The abstracted information was then compared and contrasted.</s></p><p><s>The working group convened on seven teleconferences and three smaller planning calls, exchanged emails, and went through several rounds of comments, resulting in the development of practical recommendations for a minimum, essential set of components that should be included in the pathologic evaluation and reporting of postneoadjuvant systemic therapy breast cancer specimens.</s><s>The working group has also written a companion paper intended for a Postneoadjuvant breast cancer evaluation more multidisciplinary audience, explaining how a standardized approach would benefit the entire medical team and summarizing the more detailed recommendations provided below. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">41</ref></s></p></div>
