<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</head><p><s>NF-κB-driven inflammation is negatively regulated by the zinc finger protein A20.</s><s>Gibberellic acid (GA3) is a plant-derived diterpenoid with documented anti-inflammatory activity, which is reported to induce A20-like zinc finger proteins in plants.</s></p><p><s>Here, we sought to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of GA3 in airway epithelial cells and determine if the anti-inflammatory action relates to A20 induction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH</head><p><s>Primary nasal epithelial cells and a human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE14o-) were used.</s><s>Cells were pre-incubated with GA3, stimulated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS; IL-6 and IL-8 release, A20, NF-κB and IκBα expression were then evaluated.</s><s>To determine if any observed anti-inflammatory effect occurred via an A20-dependent mechanism, A20 was silenced using siRNA.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KEY RESULTS</head><p><s>Cells pre-incubated with GA3 had significantly increased levels of A20 mRNA (4 h) and protein (24 h), resulting in a significant reduction in IL-6 and IL-8 release.</s><s>This effect was mediated via reduced IκBα degradation and reduced NF-κB (p65) expression.</s><s>Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory action of GA3 was abolished in A20-silenced cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p><s>We showed that A20 induction by GA3 attenuates inflammation in airway epithelial cells, at least in part through its effect on NF-κB and IκBα.</s><s>GA3 or gibberellin-derived derivatives could potentially be developed into anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases associated with A20 dysfunction.</s></p></div>

Due to the lack of PNECs, our investigation of induction of ZF fractions was only performed four times, which may lead to an imperfect statistical estimation.</s><s>Many products are known to contain trace amounts of LPS and small amounts of LPS may desensitize to a subsequent challenge.</s><s>The GA3 preparation used in this study passes the tests for plant cell culture applications (Sigma-Aldrich), but has not been specifically tested for its LPS content.</s><s>However, determination of TLR4 mRNA in GA3treated cells showed no change in the expression of TLR4, while in LPS-stimulated cells TLR4 showed a time-dependent up-regulation (Supporting Information Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>Overall, this may suggest that the GA3 preparation lacks TLR4 stimulating endotoxins.</s><s>Finally, future work is required to determine if GA3 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion when cells are treated after LPS challenge.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we demonstrated that pre-incubation of airway epithelial cell lines and PNECs with GA3 (single bolus of 30 μM) induces the NF-κB regulator A20 at the mRNA and protein level, thereby exerting an anti-inflammatory effect upon subsequent LPS stimulation.</s><s>Our work provides molecular evidence (i) for A20 as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases; and (ii) for the plant diterpenoid gibberellin in reducing NF-κB-driven inflammatory responses.</s><s>Gibberellin or gibberellin-derived derivatives could be developed into anti-inflammatory drugs for the potential treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases associated with A20 dysfunction such as salivary gland degeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kasamatsu et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">), liver degeneration (da Silva et al., 2012b)</ref>, bone resorption associated with inflammatory diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shimada et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Mabilleau al., 2011)</ref> and psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gon et al., 2004 and</ref><ref type="bibr">reviewed in Kelly et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the concept of pharmacological induction of A20 presents A20 as a potential drug target to reduce or normalize the inflammatory response in chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as CF, asthma and COPD.</s><s>Further work will investigate GA3 in primary cells from patients with chronic airways disease.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Statistical significance levels are indicated as *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01 and ***P &lt; 0.001.</s><s>786 British Journal of Pharmacology (2016) 173 -778 789 J A Reihill et al.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
