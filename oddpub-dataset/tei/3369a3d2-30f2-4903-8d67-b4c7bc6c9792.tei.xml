<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Glycine receptors, including its beta receptor subunit (GLRB), play a major role for inhibitory neurotransmission.</s><s>Recently, a genomewide association of GLRB with categorical (panic disorder (PD)) and dimensional (agoraphobia (AG)) forms of fear and anxiety has been reported, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> in particular for rs7688285 which was associated with GLRB expression changes in post mortem tissue and reporter gene assays.</s><s>Increased neural fear network activation during fear conditioning and increased acoustic startle reflexes were observed in risk allele carriers, thus qualifying as a potential intermediate phenotype of defensive system reactivity across different levels of analyses, corresponding to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>n light of the recent 'replication crisis' in psychology and neuroscience, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> such promising findings need to be followed up.</s><s>Direct replication attempts (for example, replication of genomewide association studies (GWAS) findings in an independent sample as performed in the initial report) provide information about the reproducibility of a specific phenomenon, but not necessarily about the theoretical construct. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Hence, direct replications need to form a synergy with conceptual replications targeting the same construct with divergent methodological approaches and paradigms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Here we focus on 'defensive reactivity' on a neurobiological level of analysis aiming to conceptually replicate the previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> on fear conditioning and startle responding.</s></p><p><s>Defensive behaviors are part of an evolutionary conserved dynamic defense cascade that depends upon the proximity of threat, as described in the predator imminence model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>The defensive system encompasses phylogenetically older adaptive behaviors (startle reflex; fight, flight, freeze responses) to higherlevel integrated cognitive-affective coping systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Phylogenetically old defensive responses are modulated by individual learning experiences.</s><s>Fear conditioning enables the organism to avoid future threats in that important information (conditioned stimuli (CS)) signaling a potential threat (unconditioned stimulus (US)) elicits defensive reactions (conditioned fear response).</s><s>Fear conditioning is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of pathological anxiety and serves as experimental model for the development of anxiety disorders.</s><s>On a neural level, fear conditioning involves multiple areas associated with defensive responding such as the (pre-) motor cortex, medial prefrontal cortex/ACC, anterior insula, amygdala, hippocampus and thalamus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>uman <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and animal studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> evidence that genetic factors represent a significant source of individual variation in (aversive) emotional-associative learning.</s><s>At least one third of the variance in human fear conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and the risk to develop anxiety disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> has been attributed to genetic factors.</s><s>The overall startle magnitude in humans has been shown to be heritable (for example, 59-61% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> or 37-52% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ).</s><s>Studies on the heritability of task-related brain activity suggest moderate heritability of brain activation in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and amygdala activation (to faces) appears to be a temporally stable and trait-like measure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>This evidence presents fear conditioning and affective startle paradigms as prime laboratory models for investigating genetic influences on neurobiological mechanisms contributing to defensive responding, fear and anxiety.</s></p><p><s>On the basis of previous findings 1 and focusing on rs7688285 which phenotypically showed the most robust impact, we aimed to conduct a conceptual replication by studying defensive reactivity on the level of brain function, structure, and physiology.</s><s>We expected GLRB risk allele carriers to (a) exhibit increased fear network activation during two different fear conditioning tasks in regions related to the defensive system's neuro-architecture such as the brainstem, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, insula, medial prefrontal cortex/ACC, and (pre-) motor cortex with different effects for the early vs late acquisition (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> ), (b) show brain morphometric alterations in these areas of interest that could underlie observed functional changes, and (c) show impaired startle habituation as a subsequent behavioral outflow of enhanced defensive system reactivity.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample characteristics</head><p><s>Sample 1: Sample 1 from Hamburg was recruited from a healthy subject pool within a collaborative research center (CRC TRR-58, first and second funding period, see Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> for sample descriptives) and partly included in the GWAS analyses reported in. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> However, this sample originated from a different project within the CRC TRR-58, using a complex cue and context conditioning procedure.</s><s>For subjects already included in the previous GWAS analysis we present new data on associations between GLRB genetic variants and brain function (n = 48) and morphology (n = 416).</s><s>In addition, we present data of a further sample on GLRB dependent variation of startle habituation (n = 105, of which seven subjects were included in the previous GWAS).</s><s>Subjects were screened for psychiatric conditions via the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and excluded if screening for any lifetime mental disorder was positive.</s><s>They provided written informed consent and protocols were approved by the General Medical Council of the State of Hamburg.</s></p><p><s>Sample 2: This healthy control group sample was recruited within the national research network PANIC-NET <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>) and not part of the previous report.</s><s>Four centers (Aachen, Berlin-Charité, Dresden, Münster) participated in a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that aimed to detect neuroplastic changes following exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy in PD with AG.</s><s>Quality controlled fMRI data from n = 60 controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> were included from whom genotype information on rs7688285 was available in n = 38 subjects.</s><s>Subjects were free of lifetime mental disorders as evidenced by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CAPI-WHO-CIDI; DIAX-CIDI version). <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>After complete description of the study, subjects provided informed written consent.</s><s>The study had been approved by the ethics committees of all participating centers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotyping</head><p><s>Genotyping based on blood samples was performed with Sequenom's MassArray system (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA), as described previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Focusing on rs7688285 as main SNP of interest, the Risk group was defined as carrying at least one risk (A) allele (G/A).</s><s>Complying with the previous report, 1 rs7688285 and three further GLRB variants (rs17035763: G/A with A allele as risk allele, rs191260602: A/G with G allele as risk allele, and rs78726293: T/A with A allele as risk allele) were used for the Combined GLRB Risk group analyses (see Supplementary Information).</s><s>Combined Risk group status was defined as carrying at least one risk allele out of the four SNPs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data acquisition and analysis pathways</head><p><s>Sample 1.</s><s>The fMRI assessment employed a combined cue and context fear conditioning paradigm (for details see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> ).</s><s>Subjects viewed a sequence of three different rooms (45 s each) as context CSs, which were assigned counterbalanced to a cue conditioning (predictable: p), a context conditioning (unpredictable: u) or a safe condition (s).</s><s>During fixed time windows, three different symbols that served as cue CSs (5 s) were superimposed on the assigned room.</s><s>A black screen with a white fixation cross served as inter-trial interval for 6-8 s (mean 7 s).</s><s>An individually adjusted electro-tactile stimulus served as US.</s><s>To mirror experimental designs reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and in sample 2, only responses based on cued, not context fear were considered.</s><s>Subjective ratings and mean skin conductance reactions across all cue onsets were analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with CS-type as within-subject variable and genotype as between-subject variable across all blocks.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> Data of seven subjects were excluded because their proportion of zero or missing responses exceeded a threshold of 66% during the full fear acquisition phase.</s><s>An α level of Po0.05 was considered significant and Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied if necessary.</s></p><p><s>Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired on a 3 T MRI scanner (MAGNETOM Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).</s><s>For fMRI, 38 continuous axial slices (2 mm thick, 1 mm gap) were acquired using a T2*-sensitive gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (repetition time (TR): 2.34 s; echo time (TE): 26 ms; flip angle: 80°; field of view (FOV): 220 × 220 mm, 2 × 2 mm in-plane resolution) in three sessions (229 volumes/ ~9 min each) using a 32-channel head coil (generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions, GRAPPA-factor 2).</s><s>To account for T1 equilibrium effects, the first four volumes of each time series were discarded.</s><s>fMRI preprocessing included realignment, unwarping, co-registration and normalization (using DARTEL <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ) with SPM8 (http:// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) running on MATLAB2013a (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) smoothed with a 6 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel.</s><s>For first-level analyses, data were analyzed within the framework of the general lineal model for differences in general and differential cued fear responses (that is, CS+ &amp; CS − ; CS+ vs CS − ).</s><s>Linear models for each of the three sessions included block regressors for three contexts (PCXT, UCXT, SCXT) and one block regressor for the rating phase.</s><s>Event-regressors were included for three cue-(PCue, UCue, SCue) and US-onsets and convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function.</s><s>Parameter estimates (β − ) images were calculated and linearly combined for contrasts for main effect responses (CS+ &amp;

in the insula and thalamus with previously reported findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>xtending these, we additionally observed an inverse effect during early fear conditioning: here the GLRB risk group showed impaired CS-discrimination (sample 1: precentral gyrus and ACC) or even enhanced responding towards the CS − (sample 2: ACC, insula, amygdala, thalamus, and midbrain) that resembles impaired fear inhibitory learning as reported for pathological states of anxiety.</s><s>While the main group effect of GLRB was driven by enhanced responding in the insula during both acquisition and extinction (sample 2), GLRB effects on differential conditioning were observed during fear learning only, thus pointing towards a specificity in modulating the acquisition of conditioned fear, but possibly not its recall or fear inhibitory learning (as induced during extinction training).</s><s>Evidence from fear conditioning studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> suggests that anxiety disorders (and particularly PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> ) are not characterized by enhanced reactivity towards the CS+, but rather by attenuated fear inhibition in the face of a safety signal leading to reduced discrimination between both CSs.</s><s>Using fMRI, enhanced activation of defensive circuit networks in response to a safety signal has been reported as a pathophysiological feature of PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> and as a marker of non-response towards exposurebased treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> that is based on fear-inhibitory learning, reflecting the relevance of safety signal processing for the etiopathogenesis of anxiety disorders.</s><s>Given further evidence on the relevance of GLRB allelic variation regarding the underlying etiopathogenesis of anxiety disorders, it could represent an additional source in explaining altered patterns of fear conditioning, thus offering potential to stratify patient subgroups to individually tailored, novel therapeutic strategies (for example, fostering discriminatory learning).</s></p></div>
