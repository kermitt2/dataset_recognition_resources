<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The current diagnostic modalities for the detection of lymph node metastasis include computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).</s><s>Due to the superior anatomic resolution, CT and MRI are commonly used for the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Each technique has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.</s><s>In clinical practice, we must compromise between accuracy and effectiveness vs. invasiveness and cost considerations.</s><s>An innocuous, noninvasive imaging modality remains an open quest in biomedical imaging.</s><s>Among the current modalities mentioned above, only MRI and ultrasound do not involve radiation exposure or invasive procedures.</s><s>Ultrasound is a widely available imaging modality but it is restricted to expert referral centers because its diagnostic performance is highly dependent on the experience of the operator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>With a relatively expensive cost, MRI is not widely available.</s><s>Therefore, a reliable, new, cost-effective method is desired.</s></p><p><s>Infrared (IR) thermal imaging is a non-radiating, noncontact, noninvasive, low-cost and fast imaging modality that passively captures thermal radiation emitted by any object above absolute zero.</s><s>Unlike other imaging modalities, IR imaging provides functional rather than anatomical information because temperature is a useful indicator of disease.</s><s>Previous studies have found that temperature distribution is symmetrical between the two sides of the human body in healthy people; in diseased individuals, abnormal blood flow results in abnormal temperature distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>For instance, excess heat generated by blood flow (angiogenesis) and metabolic activity in breast cancer provide the basis for the detection of breast cancer with IR imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>With technological advances in thermal cameras and image analysis tools over the years, there has been a resurgence in the use of IR thermal imaging as a diagnostic tool in medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>IR imaging has been applied to the diagnosis of many diseases such as breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , infantile hemangiomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, IR imaging has not been applied to the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis.</s></p><p><s>Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning technique that is widely used in classification problems.</s><s>The algorithm uses special nonlinear functions called kernels to transform the input space into high-dimensional space and aims to select a hyperplane to discriminate between two classes by maximizing the margin between two data clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>The technique has recently been used to improve diagnostic performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In this study, we proposed a digital infrared thermal imaging system as a screening and patient-based diagnostic tool for the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis from oral cavity cancer.</s><s>Then, the analysis of the IR images was performed by two methods: manual qualitative analysis and automatic analysis by an entropy-gradient support vector machine (EGSVM), the classification was done on a per patient basis.</s><s>We also investigated its diagnostic performance and compared it with that of contrast-enhanced CT which is now routinely used for the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis in Stomatology Hospital of Peking University.</s></p></div>
