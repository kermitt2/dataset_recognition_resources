<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, primary human hepatocytes was used to elucidate the protective role of a Traditional Chinese Medicine-matrine.</s><s>We found that high concentrations of matrine decreased the albumin secretion in hepatocytes, upregulated the protein level of CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 and reduced LDH and AST levels.</s><s>Furthermore, we demonstrated that low concentrations of matrine enhanced the ECOD activity and decreased the level of NO 2 induced by cytokines in human hepatocytes.</s></p><p><s>In the last decades matrine has been one of the most important drugs to treat viral hepatitis in China.</s><s>Although many experiments were made with animals, the mechanisms of its effects are not yet elucidated.</s><s>Isolated human hepatocytes are the ideal source for bio-artificial liver support devices, hepatocyte transplants and pharmacological and toxicological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Morsiani et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Horslen and Fox 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lloyd et al. 2004</ref>).</s><s>Unlike immortalized cell lines, the specific functions are retained in freshly-isolated primary human hepatocytes in vitro, including albumin secretion and cytochrome P450 inducibility.</s></p><p><s>Cultured hepatocytes are capable of secreting a large number of different proteins into the culture medium.</s><s>Among these proteins, albumin is one of the most abundant.</s><s>Isolated hepatocytes can synthesize and secret albumin for a few days in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Weigand and Otto 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Miranda et al. 2009)</ref>.</s><s>According to the results of this study, the isolated human hepatocytes retained the property of secreting albumin during seven culture days and the quantity of albumin in culture supernatants was stable.</s><s>Low concentrations of matrine (7-21 mg/L) did not influence the albumin secretion, but the quantity of albumin declined rapidly in the group cultured with 140 mg/L matrine.</s><s>That means matrine decreased the ability of hepatocytes to secret albumin when its concentration was higher than 140 mg/L.</s></p><p><s>CYP is the principal enzyme system for the metabolism of exogenous compounds.</s><s>These enzymes are mainly located in the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nebert and Russell 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The expression of the major CYP proteins is a qualitative marker to determine whether or not the isolated and cultured cells can be used to study various aspects of liver related diseases or for the analyzing of drug metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Frye et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Today more than 30 human isoenzymes are identified, the major human CYP isoforms involved in drug metabolism are CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4.</s><s>Among these, CYP3A4 is the most abundant: it catalyzes the metabolism of approximately 50 percent of therapeutic agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tang and Stearns 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Actually, we have investigated six types of CYP protein using western blot: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2B6.</s><s>The results show that matrine induced human hepatocytes to express CYP1A2 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, e, f), while the expression of CYP2E1 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) and CYP1A1 (Supplemental Figure <ref

related to inflammation caused by HBV and HCV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gripon et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hara and Adachi 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jover et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Our results showed that low concentration of matrine (140 mg/L) would increase the protein level of some CYP proteins (like CYP2A6), indicating the protective effect of matrine on cultured hepatocytes.</s><s>Further study is needed to clarify if this function is of benefit or harmful to patients.</s></p><p><s>AST and LDH are cytosolic enzymes, which are present in little quantities in serum under normal conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Skibba and Gwartney 1997)</ref>.</s><s>The degree of cell injury caused by toxic substances or by the long culture time can be estimated through the leakage of enzymes, like LDH and AST <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Takahashi et al. 2009</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the present study we found that LDH increased on culture day two along with the concentration of matrine and showed significantly higher levels than in the control group at the same day (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, P \ 0.05).</s><s>The result contradicts other publications, which stated that matrine used at the same concentrations did not damage the membrane system of rat hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Si et al. 2001)</ref>.</s><s>The result of AST level after the cells treated with high concentrations of matrine do not accord with the result of LDH except for the group treated with 1,000 mg/L matrine.</s><s>LDH and AST are markers of cell injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baur et al. 1975)</ref>.</s><s>LDH enzyme release is a reliable indicator for the of the cell membrane damage while AST is an index for mitochondrial damage since 80 % of them are AST is located in the mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Zimmerman et al. 1965)</ref>.</s><s>From the result shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref>, AST level only increased on day 6 under the treatment of matrine of 1,000 mg/L, indicating that only higher concentrations of matrine present for a longer period can matrine damage the mitochondrial membrane.</s><s>We suggest that AST and LDH may come from different parts of hepatocyte, which resulted in the different increase patterns of AST and LDH.</s></p><p><s>The increasing evidence proves that nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most versatile mediators in the control of viral infections, being the earliest antiviral response of the host <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Torre et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>It also takes part in the pathogenesis of many human infectious and inflammatory diseases, acting as pro-apoptotic inducers in some cell types or as an anti-apoptotic modulator in other cell types including hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zamora et al.

target="#b4">(Carnovale et al. 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Excessive NO production and increased iNOS induction in the liver are reported in chronic liver diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sen et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The present study shows that 140 mg/L matrine can lead to a decrease of the level of NO in isolated human hepatocytes, which are induced by a mixture of cytokines TNF-a, IFN-c, IL-1 and LPS, suggesting that matrine might alleviate inflammatory reactions and possibly protect hepatocytes.</s><s>This could perhaps be one of the mechanisms of matrine acting against hepatitis and as such is of great interest for further investigations at a larger scale.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, the present study demonstrates that low concentrations of matrine (7-140 mg/L) have no obvious negative effects on primary human hepatocytes in culture, whereas high concentrations of matrine (250-1,000 mg/L) exert cytotoxicity against the cells.</s><s>Our findings provide a meaningful basis
