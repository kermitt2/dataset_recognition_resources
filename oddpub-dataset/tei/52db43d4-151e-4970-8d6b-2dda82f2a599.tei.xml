<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The roles of the neurotrophins NGF (Neurotrophic growth factor) and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in neuronal growth and development are already known.</s><s>Meanwhile, the neurotrophin receptors TrkA (tropomyosin related kinase A), TrkB, and p75 are important for determining the fate of cells.</s><s>In endometriosis, this complex system has not been fully elucidated yet.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and location of these neurotrophins and their receptors in peritoneal (PE) and deep infiltrating endometriotic (DIE) tissues and to measure and compare the density of nerve fibers in the disease subtypes.</s></p><p><s>Methods: PE lesions (n = 20) and DIE lesions (n = 22) were immunostained and analyzed on serial slides with anti-BDNF, −NGF, −TrkA, −TrkB, −p75,-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5, intact nerve fibers) and -tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, sympathetic nerve fibers) antibodies.</s></p><p><s>Result: There was an equally high percentage (greater than 75 %) of BDNF-positive immunostaining cells in both PE and DIE.</s><s>TrkB (major BDNF receptor) and p75 showed a higher percentage of immunostaining cells in DIE compared to in PE in stroma only (p &lt; 0.014, p &lt; 0.027, respectively).</s><s>Both gland and stroma of DIE lesions had a lower percentage of NGF-positive immunostaining cells compared to those in PE lesions (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively), but there was no significant reduction in immunostaining of TrkA in DIE lesions.</s><s>There was no difference in the mean density of nerve fibers stained with PGP9.5 between PE (26.27 ± 17.32) and DIE (28.19 ± 33.  15, p = 0.8).</s><s>When we performed sub-group analysis, the density of nerves was significantly higher in the bowel DIE (mean 57.33 ± 43.9) than in PE (mean 26.27 ± 17.32, p &lt; 0.01) and non-bowel DIE (mean 14.6.</s><s>± 8.6 p &lt; 0.002).</s></p><p><s>Conclusions: While the neurotrophin BDNF is equally present in PE and DIE, its receptors TrkB and p75 are more highly expressed in DIE and may have a potential role in the pathophysiology of DIE, especially in promotion of cell growth.</s><s>BDNF has a stronger binding affinity than NGF to the p75 receptor, likely inducing sympathetic nerve axonal pruning in DIE, resulting in the lower nerve fiber density seen.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Endometriosis is diagnosed by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside of the uterine cavity.</s><s>These endometriotic lesions are predominantly found in the pelvis, namely on the peritoneum, ovaries, myometrium of the uterus (adenomyosis) and the bowel.</s><s>The gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis is surgical visualization, which is commonly accomplished with laparoscopy, followed by histological confirmation of operatively excised lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Endometriosis can be divided into two subtypes: superficial peritoneal endometriosis (PE) and deep infiltrating (DIE) disease, the latter defined by lesions located at least 5 mm beneath the peritoneal surface.</s><s>The pathophysiology of DIE, including its development, innervation, and association with inflammation and vascularization, has been the subject of numerous studies.</s><s>Most, but not all, conclude that these aspects differ between DIE and PE endometriosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition, multiple investigators have aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of pain generation in endometriosis to improve the understanding of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies have evaluated for the presence of nerve fibers in endometriotic lesions, comparing the innervation density between PE, DIE and normal peritoneum using specific stains for all intact-nerve fibers (Protein Gene Product 9.5,PGP9.5),</s><s>sensory nerve fibers-(Substance-P), and sympatheticnerve fibers (tyrosine hydroxylase) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>The studies have found that: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> there is little difference in overall nerve fiber density between PE and healthy peritoneum and (2) PE lesions have a higher density of sensory nerve fibers and a lower density of sympathetic nerves than healthy peritoneum <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In DIE, the density of nerve fibers stained with PGP9.5 was the highest in endometrial lesions taken from rectum compared to the density seen in peritoneal lesions and in DIE lesions taken from other locations such as the uterosacral ligament or the retro-uterine cul de sac.</s><s>Surprisingly, the nerve fiber density in non-bowel DIE (cul-de-sac and uterosacral ligament lesions) was not different than that observed in peritoneal endometriosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The presence of neurotrophins, a family of proteins critical to supporting the growth and differentiation of developing neurons and to maintaining neuronal survival, has been studied in endometriosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The key components of the neurotrophin system in humans are nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the neurotrophins-3 (NT-3), −4/5 (NT-4/5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> as well as their respective receptors, the tropomyosin kinase receptors (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC) and the neurotrophin receptor p75, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily.</s><s>Specifically, the Trk receptors consist of: TrkA, the high affinity receptor for NGF and TrkB, the main receptor of BDNF and NT4/5.</s><s>The binding of NGF and BDNF to the P75 receptor induces survival of the cell while the binding of the premature type of neurotrophin, pro-NGF and pro-BDNF, to the p75 receptor induces apoptosis in the cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In endometriosis, the expression of NGF was confirmed using immunohistochemistry in the gland, stroma, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and in nerve fibers of endometriosis lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the concentration of the neurotrophin NGF has been reported by several groups to correlate with the density of nerve fibers, both in PE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> as well as in DIE, including bowel endometriosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, Anaf et al. reported that NGF expression was higher in the glands and stroma of adenomyosis lesions compared to PE <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, but interestingly did not differ from endometrium of disease-free controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The spatial relationship between the main neurotrophins (NGF and BDNF) and their receptors (TrkA, TrkB, p75) in histological sections from endometriosis tissue has not been extensively studied so far.</s><s>Tarjanne et al. recently reported that NGF and its receptor TrkA were strongly expressed in rectovaginal endometriosis but they did not make comparisons to PE or DIE from other locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>No studies have evaluated the presence and location of BDNF in endometriosis lesions, although BDNF is present in eutopic endometrium from women with endometriosis.</s></p><p><s>The main objective of this immunohistochemistry study was to assess for the presence and localization of the neurotrophins NGF and BDNF and their receptors, TrkA and, TrkB and p75, in endometriosis lesions and to compare these between PE and DIE by using quantitative methods.</s><s>Secondarily, we compared the density of nerve fibers in PE versus non-bowel DIE and bowel DIE.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Archived endometriotic tissue samples were collected from 44 patients who had undergone surgery for pain, infertility suspected uterus malformation or other gynecologic indication.</s><s>Disease was confirmed histologically by the presence of both endometrial glands and stroma in an ectopic location.</s><s>We analyzed PE lesions from 20 women and DIE lesions from 22 women, 7 of whom had deep endometriosis lesions located on the bowel (n = 7), the remaining in non-bowel pelvic locations (n = 15).</s><s>Endometriosis was staged surgically according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) revised guidelines.</s><s>The age of patients ranged from 27 to 45 years (mean age ± Standard Deviation (SD): 33.15 ± 5.79 in PE group) and 24 to 49 years (mean age ± SD: 33.54 ± 6.72 in DIE group).</s><s>Medical records were reviewed to collect relevant clinical information.</s><s>All subjects were confirmed to be premenopausal with regular menstrual cycles.</s><s>For the women in the PE group, 8 were in the menstrual or proliferative phase and 9 in the secretory phase of the cycle, and for 3 women this information was not available.</s><s>For the most of the women in the DIE, menstrual phase information was not available, while 5 were confirmed to be in the menstrual or proliferative phase.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> summarizes the relevant clinical data of subjects.</s></p><p><s>None of the subjects received medical therapy for endometriosis nor hormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to laparotomy or laparoscopy for the excision of endometriosis.</s><s>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Innsbruck (No. UN5130, July 2nd, 2013) and all patients gave their informed consent for research participation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histological specimens</head><p><s>All the specimens were immediately fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 12 h, and processed and embedded in paraffin according to standard protocols.</s><s>Each section was cut at 3 μm thickness for 15 serial sections.</s><s>Serial sections enabled us to study corresponding spatial/anatomical sites and evaluate the location of neurotrophins as well as their receptors.</s><s>Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was performed for tissue overviews.</s></p><p><s>Immunohistochemistry of sections with antibodies directed against NGF, BDNF, TrkA, TrkB, p75, PGP9.5, and TH were performed.</s><s>Immunohistochemistry was performed with an automated staining system Ventana® Roche® Discovery that ensured precise and equal treatment of each slide.</s><s>This was a prerequisite for quantification of immunostaining intensities.</s><s>Sections were immunohistochemically stained with the polyclonal rabbit anti-NGF (dilution: 1:400, sc-548, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California), polyclonal rabbit anti-BDNF (dilution: 1:1200, ab101752, Abcam, England), polyclonal goat anti-TrkA (dilution: 1:240, sc-20,537 Santa Cruz biotechnology, California) polyclonal rabbit anti-TrkB (dilution: 1:60, sc-8316, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California), polyclonal rabbit anti p75 (dilution: 1:3200, a gift from Prof. Reichardt, University California San Francisco), polyclonal rabbit anti PGP.9.5 (dilution: 1:2400, ab10404, Abcam, England) monoclonal mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (dilution 1:2000, T1299, Sigma, USA).</s><s>Healthy human colon and healthy human endometrium were used as positive controls for neurotrophins and receptors.</s><s>Healthy human skin and healthy human colon were used as positive controls for nerve fibers.</s><s>Negative controls were treated identically except that the primary antibody was replaced with IgG rabbit or goat isotype for polyclonal antibodies and IgG1 mouse for monoclonal antibody.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell counting</head><p><s>For each study participant, one representative gland and area of stroma were identified.</s><s>Once the immunohistochemistry analysis for that gland and stroma was carried out with a single antibody, it was then carried out on the same gland and stroma in the adjacent section for another antibody.</s><s>With this method, we could determine the precise localization of the neurotrophins and receptors on the same gland and stroma.</s></p><p><s>Stained tissue sections were analyzed at × 20 magnification using a Tissuefax Plus system based on a Zeiss® AxioImagerZ2 Microscope (Jena, Germany).</s><s>Images were acquired with the TissueFaxs (Tissue-Gnostics®, Vienna, Austria) software.</s><s>The percentage of NGF-, BDNF-, TrkA-, TrkB-, and p75 -positive immunostaining cells in each endometriosis tissue specimen was quantified using HistoQuest® (Tissue-Gnostics) software.</s><s>This software has been used by previous researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and has the advantage of being more objective than the subjective assessment by an investigator.</s></p><p><s>Histoquest® is an analytical tool used to quantify immunostaining based on single cells using the cell specific nucleus structure as the primary identification marker (hematoxylin), followed by an automatic segmentation of the immunostaining confined to the corresponding nucleus.</s><s>A ring mask around this nucleus is interactively defined and set as parameter for all sections stained with a certain marker-specific channel named single reference shade.</s><s>The brown staining caused by chromogen (3,3'diaminobenzidine, DAB) is automatically separated from the blue hematoxylin staining into their optical density counterparts.</s><s>The mean optical density per cell is quantified by the segmentation method.</s></p><p><s>Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined separately for glandular epithelial tissue and stromal tissue.</s><s>Identification of cell types was accomplished through morphometric parameters such as the nuclear size, shape and staining intensity.</s><s>A background threshold for hematoxylin staining was determined interactively.</s><s>Immunostaining cut-offs were determined as well (this tool differentiates between positive and negative cells; these were set in the dot blots).</s><s>All images were acquired with the same setting parameters.</s><s>The representative brown color (DAB chromogen) was picked by the color picker tool.</s><s>Positive staining cells were shown in the scatter gram of forward gating tool.</s><s>The raw data of the analysis were imported into SPSS 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) for further statistical analysis.</s><s>The number of NGF-, BDNF-, TrkA-, TrkB-, and p75positive immunostaining cells was divided by the total number of cells in each gland or stroma of endometriosis tissue (hematoxylin counterstain), yielding a percentage of staining.</s><s>More detailed methodology and setting parameters of Histoquest® can be found in the Supplemental Section (Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5: Figs.</s><s>S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nerve fiber density</head><p><s>Each stained endometriosis section was imaged at × 40 magnification using the above described TissueFaxs Plus systems.</s><s>The evaluation area was randomly set to 1 mm 2 surrounding the nerve fiber located nearest to the lesion.</s><s>The area of interest was manually highlighted with a tool provided by HistoQuest® software to comprise an area of 1 mm 2 as shown in Additional file 6: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the total nerve fiber density was calculated by averaging the amount of nerve fibers defined by PGP9.5 positive staining in 3 different areas of endometriosis of 1 mm 2 each (Additional file 6: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>).</s><s>The same method was used to calculate the density TH-positive staining sympathetic nerve fibers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the difference between the percentage of positive immunostaining cells in PE and DIE.</s><s>The student's t-test was used to compare mean nerve fiber density between groups.</s><s>Pearson correlation was used to analyze the correlation between neurotrophins and the nerve fibers.</s><s>P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95 % of confidence interval.</s></p></div>
