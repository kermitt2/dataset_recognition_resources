<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Thyroid dysfunction (TD), i.e. hyper-and hypothyroidism, is known to occur with two-to ninefold higher prevalence in women compared to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, but the influence of sex on clinical manifestation and outcome of TD has not well been studied so far.</s><s>Interestingly, a recent study indicated that the presence of clinical symptoms is a better predictor for overt hypothyroidism in men and that women report significantly more symptoms after thyroid hormone (TH) replacement therapy than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, the risk for atrial fibrillation and reduced bone mineral density appears to be increased in hyperthyroidism in women (at postmenopausal state) compared to men <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Data on a possible sex difference in thyroid function parameters such as the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and serum concentrations of classical THs thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in cohort studies are inconclusive, with some studies showing sex variance of TH function parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> while others do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>These contrary findings may be due to differences in cohort characteristics such as age and gender distribution, ethnicity and iodine supply.</s><s>At the same time, they also illustrate the complexity of TH action in an organism, which may not be directly deducted from serum thyroid function parameters.</s></p><p><s>In a previous study, we performed a characterization of 5-months-old mice with thyroid dysfunction and identified sex-specific differences in behavioural, functional, metabolic, biochemical and molecular parameters of hyper-and hypothyroidism.</s><s>Distinctly higher T3/T4 serum concentrations of hyperthyroid female mice did not explain phenotypical differences, as, e.g.</s><s>no sex impact was noted for heart rate.</s><s>Moreover differences under control conditions were more frequently preserved with TH excess (body temperature, body weight, nutritional intake), whereas sex impact appeared with TH deprivation for, e.g.</s><s>cholesterol serum concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since TD may occur at any life stage and the prevalence of TD even increases with age, we now asked whether hyper-and hypothyroidism may distinctly impact the male vs. female organism at different ages.</s><s>By comparing adult <ref type="bibr">(12 months</ref>) and old (20 months) with younger (5 months, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>) mice, we show that age modulates features of TD with more pronounced sex difference under hyperthyroid but less so under hypothyroid conditions.</s><s>Furthermore, addressing body weight (BW), body temperature, heart rate, activity and neuromuscular function (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), we demonstrate a function-specific modulation whereby either sex, THs or age dominates the phenotypic traits.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Regulation of body temperature, muscular strength and locomotor activity under TD is dominated by sex</head><p><s>Rectal body temperature differed between younger male and female mice under all TH conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and persisted in adult and old age with higher body temperature in female than male mice.</s><s>This was irrespective of thyroid status and suggests a strong sex-dependent effect (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a,  b</ref>).</s><s>Non-invasive methods of rectal and surface body temperature measurements correlate very well with mice core body temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>However, a drawback of these methods is that only certain time points can be measured and differences in small time frames may therefore be missed.</s><s>As reported previously in a study investigating the influence of sex hormones on body temperature via radiotelemetry <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, sex differences were most obvious at daytime and in the proestrous and estrous periods with higher values in 3-months-old females than males.</s><s>Ovariectomy in these mice resulted in similar body temperature pattern during proestrous and estrous as in male mice, indicating that differences in these time frames were regulated by sex hormones.</s><s>However, throughout metestrus and diestrus stages, body temperature was comparable between ovariectomized and control female mice suggesting that sex hormones are not the only factors contributing to body temperature regulation in female mice.</s><s>As no influence of THs was addressed in this study, we conclude from our measurements, that TH excess and deprivation likely have stronger influence on basal body temperature in general, rather than on time points during estrous cycle.</s></p><p><s>Other examples for the predominant effect of sex on phenotypic traits were muscular strength and locomotor activity.</s><s>As already described for younger mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, a major sex difference was found in the chimney test, which particularly assesses strength and coordination in adult and old mice at eu-, hyper-and hypothyroid mice.</s><s>Only few old animals were able to pass the test.</s><s>Hence, conclusions can be derived from adult age only and showed that female mice had a much higher ability to climb up the tube at all TH conditions, while only few male mice were capable to pass the chimney test even at euthyroid state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>).</s><s>This finding suggests that female mice may have a better movement coordination and muscle strength and are more fatigue resistant than male mice.</s><s>Sex difference in muscle function has been described in human studies, showing less fatigue and faster recovery in female than male muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and this observation was also confirmed in a mice study <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, TD had a stronger impact on females than male mice, with seemingly decrease of sex difference, e.g. in the chimney test in hypothyroid adult mice.</s><s>While the observed interplay between TH and sex hormones may affect muscle and/or neurological function of the central and peripheral nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, it may also be influenced by BW and mouse size.</s><s>As females are lighter and smaller than males at all TH conditions and ages, they may be in a more favourable position to climb up the tube.</s><s>Thus, when assessing motor function beside muscle strength and endurance, BW and size are likely considerable contributing factors.</s></p><p><s>Changes in activity were assessed by the open field test and were quantified by measuring the total distance travelled in 5 min.</s><s>Significant sex difference was noted with higher activity of female mice at different TH conditions and persisted in adult, but differences decreased with old age ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6c, d</ref>).</s><s>The observed findings are in line with other studies confirming a higher locomotor activity and increased voluntary exercise in female mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, indicating an influence of sex hormones on activity of female mice, irrespective of TH status.</s></p></div>
