<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p><s>The Chromomethylase 1 (CMT1) has long been considered a nonessential gene because, in certain Arabidopsis ecotypes, the CMT1 gene is disrupted by the Evelknievel (EK) retroelement, inserted within exon 13, or contains frameshift mutations, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein.</s><s>In contrast to other transposable elements, no transcriptional activation of EK was observed under stress conditions (e.g., protoplasting).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>We wanted to explore the regulatory pathway responsible for EK silencing in the Ler ecotype and its effect on CMT1 transcription.</s><s>Methylome databases confirmed that EK retroelement is heavily methylated and methylation is extended toward CMT1 downstream region.</s><s>Strong transcriptional activation of EK accompanied by significant reduction in non-CG methylation was found in cmt3 and kyp2, but not in ddm1 or RdDM mutants.</s><s>EK activation in cmt3 and kyp2 did not interfere with upstream CMT1 expression but abolish transcription through the EK.</s><s>We identified, in wild-type Ler, three spliced variants in which the entire EK is spliced out; one variant (25% of splicing incidents) facilitates proper reconstitution of an intact CMT1 mRNA.</s><s>We could recover very low amount of the full-length CMT1 mRNA from WT Ler and Col, but not from cmt3 mutant.</s></p></div>

the later is located at the centromeric region of chromosome 2 near a highly active gene (At2g09990) encoding for 40S ribosomal protein.</s><s>Thus, it appears that the CMT3 and SUVH4/ KYP cooperate to maintain non-CG methylation as well as H3K9 methylation and consequently silencing of low copy number, long TEs, which are essentially located near or within active genes.</s><s>Our analysis of the single-copy AtCOPIA18A retroelement (gene ID At5g35935), located on chromosome 5 near active genes (e.g., At5g35970), showed that this element is transcriptionally activated in both kyp2 and cmt3 mutants.</s><s>In a recent article, Sigman and Slotkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed that chromosomal location of TEs (i.e., near a gene, within a gene, in a pericentromere/ TE island, or at the centromere core) provides the first rule determining the specific regulation of TEs.</s><s>Accordingly, Sigman and Slotkin <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposed that TEs located near genes as well as within genes are initially targeted for DNA methylation by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM).</s><s>Once DNA methylation is established, maintenance of methylation by MET1 or CMT3 methyltransferases and histone H3 dimethylation by SUVH4/ KYP is sufficient to maintain methylation and propagate silencing.</s><s>Consistent with this proposal is the finding that the EK retroelement inserted within the CMT1 gene is not activated in RdDM mutants, ago4 and hen1, probably because CMT3 and SUVH4/KYP can maintain EK methylation in the absence of RdDM pathway.</s><s>Similarly, CpG methylation of the 35S promoter sequence was maintained by the activity of MET1 in the absence of RNA trigger <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, unlike CMT3 and SUVH4/KYP, suppression of MET1 activity did not block the establishment of RNA-directed CpG methylation.</s><s>Notably, analysis of available sRNA databases for the Ler ecotype revealed an overlap with the DNA methylation pattern, whereby 24-nt sRNAs, presume to induce DNA methylation at complementary sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, are covering the entire EK and the 3â€² CMT1 region (Additional file 1: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), suggesting that the RdDM pathway involves in DNA methylation and silencing of EK.</s><s>However, our results showed that the RdDM is not able to maintain methylation in EK and 3â€² CMT1 region in the absence of CMT3 or SUVH4/KYP.</s><s>One possible explanation is that DNA methylation of the EK retroelement and downstream CMT1 is initially established by the RdDM pathway in conjunction with CMT3 and SUVH4/KYP methyltransferases, rather than with DRM methyltransferases.</s><s>This may gain support by the findings that DRM and CMT3 may act in a complementary manner to maintain RNAdirected non-CG methylation and that mutation of CMT3 alone could release, to some extent, pre-established RNA-dependent transcriptional gene silencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, sRNAs target methylation directly via the CMT3/KYP machinery rather than the canonical AGO4-RdDM pathway.</s><s>Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that besides their function in establishing and maintaining DNA methylation, the 23-24-nt sRNAs may be involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing by directing transcript cleavage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, which could explain the lack of CMT1-EK transcript and the low level of CMT1 full-length mRNA in the Ler ecotype.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interplay between EK activation and CMT1 transcription</head><p><s>Commonly TEs are considered as mutable elements in which their insertion into coding or regulatory regions of genes might interfere with proper gene transcription, leading to production of aberrant or new transcripts.</s><s>Yet, plants have evolved various mechanisms to cope with TEs inserted near or within genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, intragenic TEs do not necessarily interfere with proper transcription of the invaded genes due to an IBM2dependent mechanism that allows synthesis of full-length RNA over intragenic TEs carrying repressive epigenetic marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</s><s>Our study showed that this is applicable also for exonic TEs.</s><s>Although EK insertion resulted in alternative splicing proximal to the insertion site, namely retention of intron 12 (Additional file 1: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), this pattern of CMT1 upstream transcription is retained whether EK is methylated and silent (WT Ler, ddm1, RdDM mutants) or unmethylated and strongly activated (cmt3 and kyp2).</s><s>Yet, downstream CMT1 transcription is affected by EK insertion displaying a relatively low level of CMT1 RNA downstream of the insertion site.</s><s>Similarly, genes carrying highly methylated intronic TEs displayed defects in transcription downstream of TE insertion site <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Methylation and silencing of EK appear to be critical for transcription through the EK element.</s><s>The chimeric transcript undergoes further processing splicing out the entire EK, resulting in a transcript yielding a truncated, non-functional protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>However, our study revealed the existence of two additional spliced variants, namely SV3 whose splicing follows the canonical GU-AG rule yielding a transcript encoding for a truncated protein and SV2 whose splicing is non-canonical (GC-AG, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>) but allows for faithful reconstitution of the CMT1 RNA that potentially can yield a functional protein.</s><s>We found that the frequent occurrence of this non-canonical splicing (GC-AG) of the entire EK from CMT1 transcript is about 25%.</s><s>Splicing through non-canonical sites (e.g., GC-AG) has been reported in both plants and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, although it has been proposed previously that CMT1 is dispensable in certain Arabidopsis ecotypes carrying EK within the CMT1 gene (Ler, No-0, RLD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that in these ecotypes a functional CMT1 mRNA is produced at a very low level (~ 12.5% considering intron 12 retention) due to splicing Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> A feed-forward model illustrating the regulation of Evelknievel (EK) retroelement by CMT3 and CMT1 proteins.</s><s>a Silencing of EK inserted within the CMT1 gene.</s><s>CMT3 in concert with SUVH4/KYP maintain cytosine methylation over the entire EK and 3â€² CMT1 region, particularly at the CHG and CHH contexts (red and green lollipops, respectively) and to some extent also CG methylation (blue lollipops) as well as histone methylation at lysine 9, resulting in a complete silencing of EK.</s><s>Consequently, transcription from the CMT1 promoter proceeds through the EK to the CMT1 transcription termination site.</s><s>The CMT1/EK/CMT1 transcript undergoes splicing in which EK is spliced out faithfully (in 25% of the events), leading to reformation of mature CMT1 mRNA and possibly to retrieval of a functional CMT1 protein, which could potentially further methylates EK to ensure its own expression.</s><s>b Activation of EK.</s><s>In the absence of KYP or CMT3, EK is transcriptionally activated due to absence of CHH and CHG methylation, resulting in transcriptional interference of CMT1 rendering it incapable of transcription beyond the EK insertion site.</s><s>This leads to formation of a truncated CMT1 mRNA and to an aberrant, non-functional CMT1 protein out of the entire EK.</s><s>Indeed, using RT-PCR we could recover low amount of full-length CMT1 mRNA in WT Ler, but not in cmt3 mutant.</s><s>Whether this level is sufficient for synthesizing a functional CMT1 protein is currently under investigation.</s></p><p><s>In cmt3 and kyp2 mutants, CMT1 downstream transcription driven by the CMT1 promoter was completely abolished.</s><s>This can be explained by the oppositely oriented EK and CMT1 combined with a higher rate of EK transcription, resulting in a transcriptional interference <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> that renders CMT1 incapable of transcription beyond the EK insertion site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Yet, EK activation in cmt3 and kyp2 led to strong expression of CMT1 downstream of the EK insertion site via alternative mechanism.</s><s>We hypothesize that in cmt3 and kyp2 mutants the EK 5â€² LTR may function as a bidirectional promoter driving both EK and CMT1 transcription in opposite directions, a topic currently studied in the laboratory.</s><s>Precedence over LTRs functioning as bidirectional promoters was described in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> as well as in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44]</ref>.</s></p></div>
