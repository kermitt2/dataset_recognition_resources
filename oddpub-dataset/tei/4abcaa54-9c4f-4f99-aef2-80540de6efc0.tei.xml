<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing has made it possible for the general public to access personal genomics information.</s><s>A new sector has thus arisen in the biotechnological industry capitalising on selling genomic tests directly to the public, circumventing the need for consulting with a clinician before taking a test.</s><s>This has encouraged the growth of P4 medicine (personalised, predictive, preventive and participatory) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> whereby patients can take control of their own health and may be empowered to understand potential health problems even before symptoms arise.</s><s>The Personal Genomes Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> also supports participation of healthy individuals in genomics research by providing a robust framework for sharing their data publicly with a unique consent process.</s><s>The rapid development of the field, initially fuelled by companies such as 23andMe, deCODE Genetics, and Navigenics, has enabled sharing of data and development of methods for personal genomics analysis.</s><s>However, this has come at the price of ever increasing demands on the breadth of knowledge and skills needed to interpret genetic risks and the consequent burden on DTC providers to keep up to date with scientific research.</s><s>The value of DTC predictions has recently been questioned by the FDA, which has prohibited 23andMe from providing clinically related inferences based on their customers' genotype.</s><s>DTC providers cannot offer all available methods and scientific insights for any given set of genetic markers.</s><s>This can be particularly frustrating for users who may want to explore further the raw data from which DTC predictions are made or simply apply third party tools to the analysis of their personal genomes themselves.</s></p><p><s>The power of family-based genomic analysis has been established <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>DTC companies currently offer very limited support for genetic analyses involving more than one individual, e.g., whole families <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Privacy considerations present additional challenges in family analyses, since different individuals of a family may have different comfort levels about sharing some or all of their personal genetic risks and data.</s><s>In addition, this type of information might have consequences for offspring and children.</s><s>Since members of a same family share much of their genetic sequence (and hence information), decisions made by one individual may affect the whole family.</s><s>Hence, family-based personal genomics analyses may necessitate the re-evaluation of pre-established notions of identity and privacy, and of data ownership.</s></p><p><s>Here we present the personal genomics analysis of a set of exomes from a family (the Corpas family), and a microbiome analysis of an individual of this family.</s><s>We build from our crowdsourcing on the previously published analysis of five samples of the Corpas family using 23andMe SNP chips <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>We use DTC genetic testing with the goal of exploring the process of participatory medicine performed at the family level with current technology.</s><s>One of the family members is a scientistthe bioinformatician leading this study (Manuel Corpas).</s><s>After discussing privacy issues, the family made a group decision to make their personal genomics data publicly accessible and shareable.</s><s>The family made their genome data available under a Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license waiver, with the underlying assumption that, by making their genomic data freely available, the chances of receiving analysis results from scientists and companies would be increased.</s><s>Publicly sharing personal genomes has been reported as one of the driving factors for participants in open data projects for DTC genetic testing (e.g., openSNP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</s><s>They thus started a crowdsourcing project <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to attract the attention of potential collaborators who might be able to analyse the data and return results that could complement their existing knowledge about their personal genomes.</s><s>To emulate the principles of participatory medicine, the current study was designed to follow these principles: 1) all experiments must be carried out with private funds and as a private effort (i.e., using no public grant money, donations); 2) all individuals involved need to provide informed consent; 3) analyses are to be carried out by combining results from personal investigation and crowdsourcing efforts and 4) whenever possible, advice is to be taken from professional genetic counsellors and clinicians should any predicted risk require it.</s><s>Once consent was provided, saliva samples were extracted using free sample Oragene kits and shipped to the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) at Shenzhen, China, for sequencing.</s><s>With very limited financial resources and the simple proposition of sharing personal genomics data widely on the Internet, different sets of raw data and results were posted through blogging and social networks, describing the shared data, and reporting how results affected the family <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>All the personal genome data were made available via figShare <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> with a public domain license (CC0), which means that companies and scientists can use the data without having to acknowledge or return any results to the family.</s><s>This decision to put the personal genomics data in the public domain sped the process of adoption and collection of data by third parties, motivating several companies and scientists to contribute to the analysis.</s><s>The companies included Oxford Gene Technology, InSilico Genomics, Diploid Genomics, BIOBASE, Orion Integrated Biosciences, and GeneTalk.</s><s>Qiagen Ingenuity variant analysis was performed by a contributing scientist.</s><s>Scientists or students who joined the crowdsourcing project at different stages added the remaining contributions.</s><s>The combined crowdsourcing analyses have allowed the family to compile results from many different genome and metagenome tools.</s></p><p><s>The exomes have been used in a variety of tutorials, some of them in the USA, e.g., National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, and some others in Europe, such as the Clinical Genomics module at the University of Navarra's, MSc course in Biomedical Research taught by M.C. or an exome analysis module developed by P.N.R. for the bioinformatics curriculum at the Free University of Berlin.</s><s>Some of the results from research assignment in taught courses have been fed back to the family, constituting new research additions (e.g., section on hair colour by N.T.).</s></p><p><s>In this article we present the experiences, results and a discussion of this whole process, which has been ongoing since 2009.</s><s>In a previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> we presented findings and results derived from the analysis of the 23andMe genotypes from five members of the Corpas family using only SNP chip data as well as one exome and comparing extracted SNPs with SNPedia annotations.</s><s>We now extend the study and analysis to the personal exomes of four members of the family and a metagenome of one of them (sadly the missing fifth exome was not to be performed due to the demise of a family member).</s><s>We call members of this family Mother, Father, Aunt, Daughter and Son (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We contextualise the exome sequence analysis for the quartet comparing 23andMe SNP chip data with exome-derived variations, extending SNP chip data analyses with new methodologies to provide the most complete possible overview of genotype-phenotype associations making use of all crowdsourced results to date.</s><s>In addition, we also delve into the ethical hurdles and barriers encountered by the family and the lead scientist of this work, who is also a member of the family.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of exome and 23andMe data</head><p><s>In order to assess the quality of the data, we first compared the variant calls from the exomes to those of the previously analysed 23andMe SNPs from the same family members.</s><s>SNPs were matched by ID (not by coordinates) in both the VCF exome and the 23andMe files.</s><s>The scripts and data used are available via figShare.</s><s>We found that exome variant calls and 23andMe SNP chips share 36,315 SNPs for Daughter, 39,624 for Father, 40,234 for Mother and 22,233 for Son.</s><s>Son was genotyped using the 23andMe SNP chip version 2 and the remaining family members with version 3, hence Son has substantially fewer variants common to the exome and SNP results than the other family members.</s><s>Next, we analysed the SNP calling quality for the exomes.</s><s>We found that most 'non-concordant' SNPs (23andMe SNPs not present in the exome) have low coverage (under 10 fold).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the distribution graphs for coverage in the quartet.</s></p><p><s>Among the filtered non-concordant SNPs, opposite strand SNPs and haploid predictions were included.</s><s>For most errors it was not possible to establish whether the SNP calls by 23andMe or by exome analysis were erroneous.</s><s>In some cases, no clear Mendelian inheritance error was found because both inferred genotypes could result in the observed family tree.</s><s>For instance, rs11580218 in Father's exome genotype was GA and in 23andMe it was GT.</s><s>According to dbSNP <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, rs11580218 has the alleles A/G/T.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hair colour in the Corpas Family</head><p><s>The main reason for focusing on the hair colour genetics of the family is because Son has three offspring, all of them with red hair, despite his black hair colour.</s><s>Therefore, the objective of this section is to explain hair colour in the Corpas family using different SNP variants and comparing the genotypes of the family with other European populations.</s><s>SNP data for this analysis were collected from the 23andMe SNP chips for 5 members of the Corpas family (including aunt).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the distribution of red hair in Europe and the region where the Corpas family is originally from (bottom left orange arrow).</s></p><p><s>We characterised 27 SNPs from 10 genes associated with hair colour from the Corpas family: SLC45A2 (rs16891982, rs28777); IRF4 (rs12203592); TYRP1 (rs2733832, rs683); TPCN2 (rs35264875, rs3829241); TYR (rs1042602, rs13 93350); SLC24A4 (rs4904868, rs2402130); OCA2 (rs18 00407, rs7495174); HERC2 (rs12913832, rs7183877, rs11 635884 rs916977, rs8039195); MC1R (rs1805005, rs18 05006, rs2228479, rs11547464, rs1110400, rs1805008, rs88 5479) and ASIP (rs1015362, rs2378249).</s><s>Significant differences (p &lt;0.05) in the genotype distribution were sought.</s><s>Genotypes with significant differences between the Corpas family and a reference population are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to analyse the distribution of variants in members of the Corpas family.</s><s>This analysis showed a clear difference between the family member with red hair (Aunt) and those with dark brown hair (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>This difference could be explained due to variants in the MC1R gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Aunt was found to have a different genotype for rs916977, rs8039195 and rs7183877 in the HER2 gene.</s></p><p><s>Both populations (Corpas family and reference) have similar genotype pattern and significant differences are only present in variants of 9 SNPs.</s><s>According to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, genotype of hair colour SNP variants are different between the two European populations.</s><s>Nevertheless, few differences have been found between these two cohorts, which may be due to the Polish population of the reference study having red hair preferably <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and red hair being present in the Corpas family.</s><s>In addition, we have been able to successfully conclude that Son is</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation and relevance</head><p><s>An important question for DTC genomics analysis is whether consumers will be able to interpret the findings without genetic counselling or other medical advice.</s><s>One of the authors (P.N.R.) is active in the field of medical genetics, and has attempted to assess the understanding of the family before and after discussions with Son about the findings.</s><s>Son (Manuel Corpas), who is himself a scientist and bioinformatician, has no medical background but is still likely to be much better able to interpret the relevance of the findings than a member of the general public without either medical, bioinformatics, or scientific training.</s><s>We have held several discussions about the reports of the four DTC providers.</s><s>Perhaps one of the most striking observations about the reports is the sheer number of findings predicted to be deleterious.</s><s>A typical exome displays tens of thousands of variants compared with the genomic reference sequence, up to roughly 10,000 of which are predicted to lead to nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, alterations of conserved splice site residues, or small insertions or deletions.</s><s>Even after filtering out common variants, hundreds of variants of suspected medical relevance may remain.</s><s>In fact, each genome is thought to harbour about 100 genuine loss-of-function variants with about 20 genes completely inactivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Son reported that the list of potentially relevant variants conveyed by the DTC providers were simply too copious to evaluate in detail in discussions within his family.</s><s>Genome Trax reported 162 variants in candidate genes as deleterious.</s><s>These included homozygous variants calls in genes related to cancer (BRCA1, APC, MEN1), congenital malformation syndromes (TCOF1), metabolic deficiencies (FBP1, HEXA), and neurological diseases (FUS, MLC1, DMD).</s><s>"Major variants", included the LYZ gene that was homozygous in Son and heterozygous in each parent.</s><s>Mutations in this gene are associated with familial visceral amyloidosis (OMIM: 105200), a disease characterized by chronic nephropathy, arterial hypertension, and hepatosplenomegaly.</s><s>The report notes that the allele is rare in the general population and is predicted deleterious by a bioinformatics tool.</s><s>The variant in question is listed in dbSNP with ID rs1800973, which is reported to have a minor allele frequency of 0.021.</s><s>Since familial visceral amyloidosis has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, and none of the family members show signs of this serious disease, the variant can confidently be classified as nonpathogenic.</s></p><p><s>Another variant flagged by the Genome Trax analysis involved the P2RX5 gene.</s><s>It is noted that each parent is heterozygous for a frameshift deletion, but the Son is homozygous wild type.</s><s>The variant was Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> Comparison of most significant exome results from the crowdsourced analyses of the Corpas family quartet by four different platforms: Genome Trax, Ingenuity Variant Analysis, Diploid and GeneTalk.</s><s>The different predicted phenotypes and their evidence are represented as present (red highlight) or absent (blank) for each of the family individuals.</s><s>We find that there is no overlap among reported top results from the four companies highlighted because it is associated with "allogenic cytotoxic T lymphocyte response".</s><s>However, the publication that reports this finding was referring to an allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia after donor lymphocyte infusion.</s><s>This patient was found to have the frameshift mutation in homozygous state <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Since parents are heterozygous, and Son is homozygous wild type at this position, and since no family member has been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia, from a medical standpoint this finding is irrelevant.</s></p><p><s>The variant c.2562T &gt; G was reported to cause altered splicing in CFTR, the cystic fibrosis gene.</s><s>Mother is reported heterozygous for the variant, and Son is reported as being homozygous for the wild type, with the interpretation that this is just a disease-associated polymorphism.</s><s>The variant was initially reported to be associated with increased CFTR exon skipping in healthy individuals and was thought to disrupt an exonic splicing enhancer, although no experimental proof was provided for this assertion.</s><s>The variant is listed in dbSNP under rs1042077 with a minor allele frequency of 44 %, and is interpreted as "Benign/Likely Benign" in Clin-Var <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Medical interpretation would classify this as irrelevant, again especially in light of cystic fibrosis being an autosomal recessive disease and the lack of any convincing evidence of pathogenicity.</s></p><p><s>A predicted pathogenic variant in the gene STOX1 was found to be homozygous in Son.</s><s>Some mutations in this gene are associated with preeclampsia, which is noted to be a condition only relevant in pregnancy and thus not applicable to Son.</s><s>While this interpretation is reasonable, the fact that this variant (rs1341667) has a population minor allele frequency of 36.7 %, makes it unlikely that it is a large-effect mutation that would be a major risk factor.</s></p><p><s>The Ingenuity Variant Analysis software predicted a number of single nucleotide variants as pathogenic (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>For instance, NM_006208.2:c.2230</s><s>+ 1G &gt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have presented the results of the crowdsourcing of the analysis of a genomic dataset for a family.</s><s>The current lack of whole-family personal genomics data available for public use has been a significant factor in the success of this family's crowdsourcing enterprise, attracting the attention of scientists and companies to contribute results.</s><s>We have contributions from scientists who wanted to carry out an experiment to analyse a cohort of individuals or test data for development of new tools (SNPedia tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Ingenuity analyses) or for demonstrating new products to prospective customers and clients (InSilicoDB, BIOBASE Genome Trax, Orion Integrated Biosciences Inc., GeneTalk, and Diploid Genome Interpretation).</s></p><p><s>The main goal of this family study has been to explore the utility of DTC genomic analysis in a family setting with a data derived from personal genotypes, exomes and metagenomes.</s><s>In order to achieve this objective, many obstacles had to be dealt with (e.g., finding a sequencing provider, shipping samples, establishing the appropriate ethical framework to perform and publish the analyses).</s><s>We expect this study to pave the way for other families who might wish to actively engage in participatory medicine and share their experiences.</s><s>Some individuals have already made their genome sequences public (e.g., Personal Genome Project) and many more individuals have done so with their 23andMe data (e.g., Genomes Unzipped).</s><s>The Corpas family decided to take the unprecedented move of publishing their exome and microbiome data and analyses on the Internet under a CC0 license waiver, the least restrictive type of license.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first reported family to engage independently in genomic citizen science by publishing their identities and personal genomes on the Internet.</s><s>This does not mean that the family encourages everybody to follow this example; the family does request, however, other researchers and the general public not to censure this decision.</s><s>This has allowed them to explore their personal genomes to an extent it would have been impossible at this time otherwise.</s></p><p><s>It has been argued that individuals have more control due to participatory nature of research enabled by having access to personal genomic data.</s><s>However, it might be also the case that by letting individuals share their data and accept more responsibility about potential consequences, they lose their control on their data and results they might receive.</s><s>In addition, posting data in such an identified way would make personal genomic data sharing an irreversible decision in nature, given the fact that withdrawing yet shared data from the web is not a feasible option.</s></p><p><s>In order to satisfy established ethical conventions by the community, ethical research and advice were sought to create the appropriate framework in which to share and report data and findings.</s><s>Although the Internet and private test providers rendered the personal genomic data sharing a plausible practice, it is hard to perceive that this is immediately translated to more power to individuals.</s><s>There are significant limitations on controllability of data which has to be taken into consideration while promoting participant-centric approaches to research.</s><s>Participant centric research and in this case personal data sharing is often coupled with presuming a higher level of responsibility and awareness for the participants.</s><s>Publicly sharing data will put third parties' access to data under no limit whatsoever.</s><s>As a result, third party researchers are not obliged to sign any contract or abide by "terms and conditions" that normally set in other research settings.</s><s>This might raise concerns that in case of any harmful uses by third party researchers, there are no grounds for making researchers legally responsible.</s><s>To this end, it is imperative to assure those who engage in such initiatives are sufficiently informed about implications and prepared to embrace the associated risks.</s><s>It is not the objective of this research to ignore current practice and established ethical procedures in the data sharing of personal genomes (see NIH's elements of informed consent <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A primary objective was to probe the extent to which DTC genetic testing can provide meaningful results to people who decide to purchase those tests privately.</s><s>By lowering the barriers for scientists and companies to access these data, the family could increase the chances of successfully crowdsourcing their analysis and receiving results back.</s><s>These data have been used for testing and educational purposes.</s></p><p><s>The health care implications of the exome and metagenome data obtained in our study are at best uncertain.</s><s>It was remarkable that there was no overlap of the sets of variants reported as significant by the four DTC analysis providers.</s><s>This is reminiscent of recent reports on the low concordance of DTC analysis of SNP-based testing, with substantial differences in the predicted disease risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The lack of concordance between the results of the DTC analyses of the Family's exomes illustrates the difficulties in using this kind of analysis for participatory medicine at present, and it is not clear if any of the findings have relevance for the clinical care of the family at present.</s><s>A further limitation of our study is the fact that for economic reasons, whole exome sequencing was performed at a relatively low average coverage of about 30√ó.</s><s>It has been noted that different bioinformatic pipelines lead to different sets of called variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>We were limited to one pipeline provided online by InSilicoDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and did not explore the effects of different computational analysis strategies, since this would not normally be available in a DTC context.</s></p><p><s>We note that our results were not intended to compare the ability of the DTC companies to identify disease-causing mutations in the setting of human genetics or oncology, which are the primary use cases for exome sequencing.</s><s>We provide the same starting point, a VCF file, and the same starting end, the predicted phenotypes based on SNP variations from the VCF file.</s><s>The analyses that were conducted at a particular point in time will have their own software versions and configurations.</s><s>It is thus almost impossible to have a 100 % reproducibility of results due to the difficulty posed by the various formats presented from the different providers and the dynamics of the evolution of methods or the businesses themselves.</s></p><p><s>The metagenomic analysis of Son's fecal microbiome did not identify any actionable findings.</s><s>The most abundant bacterium in the sample, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, is thought to be protective <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, but there is currently no accepted analysis strategy that would allow one to make certain conclusions about the medical relevance of the results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In this study we have confined ourselves to the evidence given by DTC companies and applied different software for interpretation.</s><s>One of our main aims was to simulate what it will be for a family of the future to analyse their personal genomes privately.</s><s>At current costs, however, this type of analysis could hardly be afforded by most families globally as genetic testing and counselling would have been too expensive.</s><s>This may change in the future as the cost of analysis drops.</s></p><p><s>We have shown the extent to which private efforts in participatory medicine can enhance knowledge or a family of committed members wishing to analyse their personal genomes.</s><s>We have also shown how current technologies allow entire families to engage in participatory research with the help of the Internet without having to consult a clinician beforehand.</s><s>While carefully pondering risks and seeking appropriate ethical framework, the Corpas family decided to publish all their genetic data on the Internet to crowdsource their analysis.</s><s>It is our belief that the risks of unintended uses of this family's genomic data have far been outweighed by the amount of information received from the contributors to the crowdsourcing of data analysis.</s><s>The results of the analysis provided an explanation for the "surprising" hair colour of Son's children, and indicated the possibility that Father may be an intermediate metaboliser of the antiplatelet medication clopidogrel (if there were an indication for this medication, an alternate medication such as prasugrel might be considered).</s></p><p><s>Combining the results of four providers, we have offered an initial survey into the amount of knowledge that can be gathered by a family using solely DTC means.</s><s>Results from the DTC providers vary widely between them and no consensus seems to come up in terms of actionable knowledge derived from the analyses.</s><s>In spite of the limited amount of information gained, this study offers an initial survey on what is possible for any ordinary family to learn about their own personal exomes with current sequencing technology.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical framework</head><p><s>Since the family bought the sequencing tests themselves, they were not required to follow an Institutional Review Board (IRB).</s><s>We have, however, consulted with ethical and genetic counselling experts regarding the appropriate way in which to carry out the public sharing of personal genomic data, which led us to adopt the consent forms developed by Genomes Unzipped <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Genomes Unzipped developed a participant information form clarifying the goals of the personal genomics data sharing partakers were involved in.</s><s>We adapted this participant form and had it signed for all members of the family quartet, clarifying the goals of the personal genomic data sharing, potential risks and discomforts derived from the (ab)use of the data shared on the Internet.</s><s>This consent process was discussed and agreed upon by the Corpas family.</s><s>Issues discussed included that, subsequent to publicly sharing the data in the public domain, data could no longer be considered to belong exclusively to the individual; therefore, it would be hard to prevent unintended usages in the future, if not impossible.</s><s>Additionally, it was also indicated that from the legal stand point of view (depending on jurisdictions) the family could relinquish all rights over the data by publicly sharing them.</s><s>From the standpoint of genetic counselling, it was also apparent from our expert consultant that it is difficult to compare our study to a 'gold standard' regulatory practice because there is not such a thing yet.</s><s>Hence we are unable to assess the significance of the results in relation to current practice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crowdsourced data</head><p><s>From 2011 onwards, the Corpas family decided to embark on the journey of analysing their personal genomes.</s><s>When the first exome was obtained (2012), Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was becoming routine in research labs but was rarely available for DTC personal genomic tests.</s><s>Son was in fact the first DTC personal genome that was sequenced by the BGI.</s><s>After this, some negotiations followed, with BGI agreeing to perform Illumina Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for $4,000 per person (2012 prices).</s><s>To raise funds, a crowdfunding campaign was started to fund $20,000 for five genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>.</s><s>The crowdfunding plea offered in return (for a significant percentage of the money expected to be raised) early access to the data and printouts of publications derived from the analysis of the data.</s><s>To our knowledge this was the first time crowdsourcing and crowdfunding were employed for the analysis of the genomes of a complete family.</s><s>The crowdfunding campaign succeeded in raising ~$3,300, precluding whole genome sequencing of the entire family; hence exome sequencing for 3 members of the family was performed, a much cheaper alternative.</s><s>The crowdfunding initiative, together with private efforts from the family, provided sufficient funds to generate a variety of datasets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The crowdsourced data include both raw and processed data.</s><s>Because these data were obtained as DTC tests, sometimes the source or platform utilised for the same test was slightly different between individuals because a different version of the platform was used (indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We have attempted to minimise the impact of platform versions by using the same pipelines and methods for alignment and variant calling.</s></p><p><s>The crowdsourced data encompass genotypes, annotations, alignments, whole exome sequencing and metagenomics sequencing.</s><s>The fastq files, the quartet's VCF file and their corresponding metadata are available via figShare.</s><s>InSilicoDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> was used to create the BAM and VCF files.</s><s>From InSilicoDB it can be downloaded the fastq files, BAM files and VCF files for each member of the family quartet <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Although the genotype data and derived processed sources have been published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the exome sequencing data, and the corresponding derived (processed) files and metagenomics data are presented for the first time here.</s><s>All variations are single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and no indels or copy number variations were used for this analysis.</s></p><p><s>The years in which the data were obtained are denoted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> to roughly show the timeline of family tests.</s><s>The five sample genotype data obtained from 23andMe SNP chips are in bed format, mapped to the human reference genome, NCBI36.</s><s>These datasets were obtained in the summer of 2009 (Son; version 2 of 23andMe; ~0.5 M SNPs) and January 2011 (Mother, Father, Daughter, Aunt; 23andMe SNP chip version 3, ~1 M SNPs per individual).</s><s>Whole exome sequencing from Son, Mother, Father, and Sister was performed with DNA extracted from saliva using Illumina HiSeq 2000 with an average coverage of the target region of ~30√ó.</s><s>The Son's exome was the first family member to be sequenced (January 2012).</s><s>Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment technology (human all exon V4) for single-end reads was used to capture DNA material.</s><s>The other three exomes (Mother, Father, and Daughter) were sequenced in January 2013 using the Agilent SureSelect 44 Mb human All-Exon design and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq.</s><s>All sequencing was done by BGI.</s><s>The metagenomics sequencing was performed for Son in August 2013 from a fecal sample using Illumina (HiSeq 2000) shotgun sequencing.</s><s>We crowdsourced only the resulting two cleaned fastq PE metagenomics files.</s><s>These contain an insert size of 170 bp and a total size of 1,201 Mb of clean data (after removal of carrier reads, low complexity reads, low quality reads, adapter contamination and duplicate reads).</s></p></div>
