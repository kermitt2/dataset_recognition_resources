<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Presbycusis [age-related hearing loss (ARHL)] is a universal feature of mammalian aging in which the auditory function is compromised, hearing thresholds increase, and frequency resolution gets poorer.</s><s>As a result, in noisy environments speechunderstanding deteriorates and temporal processing deficits in gap detection measures increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lee, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In humans, this condition affects tens of millions of people world-wide <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yamasoba et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Many people with hearing loss also experience tinnitus, which is the perception of a sound in one or both ears or in the head in the absence of an external sound source <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jastreboff and Hazell, 1993)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Presbycusis is complex in that it has repercussions at a physical, cognitive, emotional, and social level; quality of life can deteriorate, and for some people presbycusis could lead to depression, social isolation and lower self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lee, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ciorba et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Environmental factors such as diet, physical exercise, smoking, and intake of medications are some of the extrinsic factors predisposing to presbycusis.</s><s>There are several auditory structures affected by presbycusis, such as hair cells, stria vascularis, afferent spiral ganglion neurons and the central auditory pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fuentes-Santamaría et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Based on results of audiometric tests and temporal bone pathology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Schuknecht and Gacek (1993)</ref> and later modified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nelson and Hinojosa (2003)</ref>, classified presbycusis as either sensory (downslope audiometry and cochlear degeneration), neural (downslope audiometry and very poor speech discrimination, spiral ganglion and nerve fibers degeneration), metabolic (audiometry in a platform and strial atrophy), cochlear conductive (downslope audiometry and thickening and stiffening of basilar membrane), mixed (mixture of the above), or undetermined (none of the above) types.</s></p><p><s>Depending on the type and severity of the hearing loss, several options are available to reduce the hearing difficulties and consequently improve quality of life.</s><s>When patients are appropriately fitted and motivated, hearing aids and cochlear implants (CIs) are the most commonly used devices for treating mild-severe presbycusis.</s><s>Electric-acoustic stimulation and active middle ear implants may also be suitable solutions for treating presbycusis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sprinzl and Riechelmann, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Biological markers are widely used in oncology, hematology and in other medical disciplines to diagnose or to monitor various diseases.</s><s>In otology, biological markers are not yet widely used, but once identified, they could provide a means of determining the time-course or most effective treatment for an individual with presbycusis or tinnitus.</s><s>Potential biomarkers include mutations in mitochondrial DNA, chromosomal mutations, state of chronic inflammation, presence of certain diseases associated with earlier onset or progression of presbycusis (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) and metabolic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Van Eyken et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Verschuur et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>It was recently estimated that 35-55% of auditory aging could have a genetic background <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ruan et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Of interest are genes coding for glutamate receptors as glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the peripheral and central auditory pathways.</s><s>It has been suggested that increased release of glutamate may be involved in the auditory aging and the generation and maintenance of tinnitus by causing "excitotoxicity."</s><s>There are many types of glutamate receptors, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alfa-amine propionic acid (AMPA), the latter being the most relevant receptor in physiological neurotransmission at auditory pathways.</s><s>NMDA receptors are not essential for the auditory transmission, but they have been shown to be expressed in the cochlea after induction of tinnitus.</s><s>Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the application of NMDA antagonists directly into the cochlear fluid can block salicylate-induced tinnitus in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Figueiredo et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>GRM7 encodes a metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 7 (mGluR7), a G protein-coupled receptor regulating auditory nerve excitability.</s><s>When bound by L-glutamate, mGluR7changes the configuration of adenylyl cyclase, which has implications in the metabolism of AMPc, control of cellular cycle, and normal functioning of central nervous pathways.</s><s>mGluR7 plays a general role in glutamate synaptic transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Voytenko and Galazyuk, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In the auditory periphery, mGluR7 is thought to mediate glutamate excitotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pujol et al., 1993)</ref> and in the cochlea mGluR7 maintains the glutamate-dependent equilibrium between the inner hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Newman et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Its role in the higher auditory pathways remains unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lu, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GRM7 have been demonstrated to be associated with auditory aging in European <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Friedman et al., 2009)</ref> and American populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Newman et al., 2012)</ref> but not of a Chinese population <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Luo et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Newman et al. (2012)</ref> have reported that certain SNP variants of GRM7 associate with poorer speech recognition in the elderly.</s><s>The importance of GRM7 in the auditory system is supported by the detection of mGluR7 in the inner and outer hair cells and in the spiral ganglion nerve <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Friedman et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Highly concentrated glutamate may affect membrane permeability in the hair cells, causing an increase in Cl − influx, and consequently an osmotic imbalance and membrane disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Puel et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, glutamate excitotoxicity induces apoptotic cell death and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Sahley et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This was demonstrated in an animal model to be directly responsible for the loss of inner hair cells in a time-, dose-and tonotopy-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hu et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, neonatal exposure to monosodium glutamate has been shown to induce neuronal atrophy and dysmorphia in the cochlear nucleus and in the superior olivary complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Foran et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The physiological effects of glutamate excitotoxicity therefore are concluded to include ARHL <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pujol et al., 1993)</ref> and tinnitus <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brozoski et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sahley et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yu et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Oxidative stress represents an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their detoxification and has been postulated to play a major role in the overall aging process and to significantly contribute to the ARHL.</s><s>Oxidative stress in the inner ear, secondary to impairments in defense mechanisms caused by certain polymorphisms related to a battery of antioxidant systems, could make individuals more susceptible to ARHL <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Seidman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fujimoto and Yamasoba, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the adult inner ear, presence of several detoxification and antioxidant enzymes including catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferases (GST) has been demonstrated.</s></p><p><s>One of the sources leading to accumulation of ROS are insufficiently acetylated drugs which accumulate and may be converted into reactive drug metabolites by oxidative enzymes.</s><s>N-acetyltransferase (NAT) are enzymes responsible for the detoxification of exogenic substrates via N-acetylation or O-acetylation.</s><s>In humans, the catalytic activity by NAT isoenzymes NAT1 and NAT2 may be regulate by these substrate concentration.</s><s>Both isoenzymes are highly polymorphic and catalyze many aromatic amines and hydrazine substances important for the balance of the oxidative status.</s><s>In addition, NATs are known to be involved in the detoxification of harmful xenobiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Vatsis and Weber, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hein, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ünal et al., 2005b)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Variation in NAT2 alleles or haplotypes resulting from combination of SNPs is responsible for the N-acetylation polymorphism.</s><s>Regarding the latter, rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylator phenotypes have been demonstrated.</s><s>These phenotypes are associated with the rate of catalytic activity and accordingly predispose toward drug toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rajasekaran et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Because the individuals with the null genotype for NAT2 may be more susceptible to effects of environmental toxins and oxidative free radical cellular damage, the presbycusis becomes an ideal model for evaluation of gene-environmental interaction <ref type="bibr">(Ünal et al., 2005a,b)</ref>.</s><s>Although many individuals have been exposed to several environmental risk factors, the ARHL develops to a different degree in various age groups.</s><s>This suggests genetic host factor(s) contributing to the degenerative mechanisms <ref type="bibr">(Ünal et al., 2005b)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies demonstrated the association between the common human NAT2 alleles and ARHL.</s><s>Independent studies have showed a significant association between NAT2 polymorphisms and presbycusis, namely NAT2 * 6A in the Turkish population <ref type="bibr">(Ünal et al., 2005b)</ref> and in the European population <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Van Eyken et al., 2007)</ref> with Caucasian subjects carrying a NAT * 6A mutant allele having an increased risk to Presbycusis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bared et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Other studies considering different NAT2 alleles reported negative associations with ARHL <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dawes et al., 2015)</ref> and with the shape of the audiograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Angeli et al., 2012)</ref>, when considering audiometric patterns of presbycusis in older individuals.</s><s>However, most authors suggested that NAT2 gene is a susceptibility factor for development of hearing impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Ünal et al., 2005b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dawes et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here we explore the relationships between presbycusis, tinnitus, co-morbidities, and the genotypes of GRM7 and NAT2,
