<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and Methods</head><p><s>The safety and efficacy of LCIG were evaluated in patients with advanced PD experiencing motor fluctuations despite optimized medical therapy in an openlabel, phase III, 12-month study (ClinicalTrials.gov:</s><s>NCT00335153).</s><s>The study methodology has been reported on <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">22</ref> and is summarized below.</s><s>The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board/ethics committee at all 86 centers in 16 countries.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>The study included a screening period (28 days), baseline assessments, a nasojejunal (NJ) titration period (2-14 days), a PEG-J titration period (2-14  days), and a 54-week treatment period (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>).</s><s>The starting infusion dose was based on each patient's previous daily dose of oral <ref type="bibr">L-dopa.</ref></s><s>Usage of other PD medications that required tapering off was compensated for at the investigator's discretion.</s><s>Patients were hospitalized for NJ tube placement and initiation of LCIG titration as well as PEG-J tube placement and further dose optimization by PEG-J, if required.</s><s>At the end of titration, patients entered long-term PEG-J treatment and assessments began on day 28.</s><s>LCIG was administered by a portable pump during waking hours; a morning dose/bolus was followed by continuous infusion for approximately 16 hours with additional rescue doses during the day, if clinically indicated.</s><s>The use of oral immediate-release L-dopacarbidopa was permitted only when the pump was turned off at night.</s><s>Use of other PD medications was permitted after 28 days post-LCIG initiation at the investigator's discretion.</s><s>Apomorphine and controlledrelease L-dopa-carbidopa were not permitted.</s><s>Safety and tolerability provided the primary endpoint whereas efficacy assessments provided the secondary endpoints.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Eligible patients were 30 years old, L-dopa responsive, met UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank diagnostic criteria, and had severe motor fluctuations defined as 3 hours of daily off time at baseline (confirmed by the PD symptom diary), despite optimized treatment with available PD medications.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p><s>Safety measures included AEs, infusion device complications, and tolerability assessed by number of patients completing the study.</s><s>Laboratory results, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored.</s></p><p><s>AEs were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 14.0.</s><s>Each event could be coded to one or more terms descriptive of the event.</s><s>Planned hospitalization for baseline assessment and treatment initiation was not considered a serious AE (SAE) unless hospitalization was prolonged as a result of complications.</s><s>All AEs reported are treatment-emergent AEs, which were defined as those that began or worsened from the time of NJ tube insertion until 30 days after PEG-J removal.</s><s>AEs of special interest were monitored.</s><s>These were AEs associated with neuropathy, the procedure and device (e.g., PEG-J placement), respiratory tract aspiration, weight loss, and cardiovascular fatalities.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p><s>Efficacy outcomes included assessed mean change from baseline to last visit in patient-diary off time, "on" time with troublesome dyskinesia, and on time without troublesome dyskinesia (on time without dyskinesia plus on time with nontroublesome dyskinesia, i.e., does not interfere with function or cause meaningful discomfort); the investigator-rated Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale; the UPDRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">23</ref> Parts II, III, total score (Parts I-III), and the dyskinesia items from Part IV (questions 32-34); the 39-item PD Questionnaire (PDQ-39) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">24</ref> ; the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) Summary Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">25</ref> ; and the EuroQoL visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">26</ref></s><s>Efficacy assessments were collected during post-PEG-J weeks 4, 12, 24, and 54; PD diary and CGI-I were also collected at post-PEG-J week 36.</s><s>PDQ-39 was administered during screening visit 1 rather than at baseline.</s></p><p><s>Patients were trained to record their motor states every 30 minutes throughout the waking day using a 24-hour diary (Hauser diary) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">27</ref> over the 3 consecutive days preceding baseline and each scheduled visit.</s><s>PD diary variables were normalized to a 16-hour waking day and averaged over the 3 consecutive days.</s><s>At baseline, clinicians rated the severity of patients' symptoms with the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale.</s><s>During treatment, clinicians used the CGI-I scale.</s><s>The UPDRS was administered by the investigator during the best on state (usually 2-4 hours after the morning dose).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p><s>Efficacy analyses included all patients who received LCIG during the post-PEG-J period and completed 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment.</s><s>Safety analysis included all patients who had NJ placement and completed 1 postbaseline safety evaluation.</s><s>The within-group magnitude of change for all efficacy outcome measures was tested using a one-sample t test.</s><s>Multiple testing procedures were not used to control for study-wise type I error rate.</s><s>Planned enrollment was 320 patients to provide a sufficient sample to satisfy regulatory requirements for exposure assessments at 6 and 12 months.</s></p></div>
