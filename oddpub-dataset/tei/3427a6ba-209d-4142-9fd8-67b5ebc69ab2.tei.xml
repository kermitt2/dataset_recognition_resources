targets.</s><s>However, following treatment initiation, both ASDAS and BASDAI disease activity were strong predictors for the achievement or lack of achievement of week-48 treatment targets, with disease activity as early as week 2 predicting longer-term outcomes in patients treated with CZP.</s></p><p><s>ASDAS disease activity state at week 2 was associated with the likelihood of achieving ASDAS inactive disease at week 48, with 0% of patients (0 of 27) with ASDAS very high disease activity at week 2 achieving ASDAS inactive disease at week 48, compared to 71% of patients <ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The prediction of response in axial SpA and PsA patients has not been studied extensively.</s><s>The majority of work in the

type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>These studies have consistently found that long-term clinical improvements are predicted by raised inflammatory markers (such as CRP level) at baseline, and by an early clinical response to treatment.</s><s>Other factors predictive of long-term improvements in some of these studies were better function (lower Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index score), lower enthesitis score, younger age, HLA-B27 positivity, male sex and anti-tumor necrosis factor naivety at baseline in ankylosing spondylitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref

thus increasing the likelihood of a patient responding well to their initial treatment and reducing the need to switch therapies.</s><s>Positive prediction based on early response provides clinicians with reassurance when continuing a patient on their current treatment.</s><s>Complementary to these ideas is the concept of negative prediction, which can inform a clinician whether or not to consider stopping treatment in a patient who is not responding or who is having a suboptimal response to therapy.</s></p><p><s>The concept of negative predictability has previously been demonstrated in RA

may benefit from switching therapy after 12 weeks of CZP treatment.</s><s>These patients were predicted to be nonresponders at week 52 (patients with a very low likelihood of achieving low disease activity) with a high degree of specificity, based on the improvement in their disease activity level at week 12 (DAS28 improvement from baseline) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</s><s>Here we demonstrate that this approach is also applicable to axial SpA and PsA patients treated with CZP.</s><s>The axial SpA data reported here demonstrate that the prediction of long-term nonresponse (based on remission or low disease activity) was independent of the presence of radiographic sacroiliitis and provides further evidence that the use of treat-to-target methods can be applied across the spectrum of axial SpA patients, inclusive of both the ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations.</s><s>Furthermore, these concepts were applicable when using either clinician-rated outcomes or patient self-reported outcomes as the predictor.</s></p><p><s>In this article we present individual patient data, which show that very few patients with high or very high disease activity at week 12 had moderate or inactive disease at any The analyses reported here have a number of limitations.</s><s>One such limitation is the lack of validated thresholds for DAS28-CRP and BASDAI.</s><s>Although the DAS28-CRP is not validated in PsA, most patients in the study had polyarticular disease and therefore DAS28-CRP was felt to be the most appropriate measure in the absence of another well-accepted and validated measure in PsA to assess disease activity, although there is also debate about the thresholds of remission and low disease activity in RA.</s><s>A second potential limitation in these analyses is the use of last observation carried forward imputation for axial SpA analyses for the ASDAS and BASDAI outcome measures, as has been previously used when reporting these outcomes from the RAPID-axSpA trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>However, the number of patients achieving ASDAS inactive disease remained similar when an alternative, more conservative imputation method (nonresponder) was used.</s><s>As the number of patients affected was so low, the outcomes of this investigation were unlikely to be impacted by a change in imputation methodology.</s><s>A further limitation is the use of data from clinical trials, which may mean that these results are not representative of the wider axial SpA and PsA patient populations, as clinical trial populations tend to have worse disease activity and fewer comorbidities than the general patient population.</s><s>Finally, the results are restricted by the limited number of patients in the ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations.</s></p><p><s>Here we have shown that by using disease activity state or, to a lesser extent, clinical response during the first 12 weeks of CZP treatment, we were able to identify a subset of axial SpA or PsA patients who are unlikely to achieve long-term treatment goals.</s><s>For the treating clinician in practice, discontinuation of CZP treatment should be considered in axial SpA patients with ASDAS very high disease activity or BASDAI .6 after 12 weeks of CZP treatment, as these patients are very unlikely to achieve treatment targets (ASDAS inactive disease or BASDAI ,2 and normal CRP) at later time points.</s><s>Moreover, patients at week 12 who still have ASDAS high disease activity or BASDAI .4 have only a small chance to reach the treatment target and stopping treatment should be considered.</s><s>Similarly, for PsA patients with DAS28-CRP .5.1 after 12 weeks of CZP treatment, careful consideration should be given before continuing treatment with CZP, as these patients are unlikely to go on to achieve MDA.</s><s>Also for patients with DAS28-CRP .3.2 to 5.1, the risk/benefit of continuation should be carefully considered, as reaching the target is achieved by a small percentage of patients.</s><s>Although early clinical response was not as strong a negative predictor for the lack of achievement of long-term treatment targets, these results support discontinuation of CZP treatment after 12 weeks in axial SpA patients with ,1 unit improvement in BASDAI at week 12, as they are also unlikely to achieve later treatment targets.</s><s>This negative prediction approach may enable physicians adopting a treat-to-target strategy to determine early on when to change therapy in patients not responding to CZP.</s></p></div>
