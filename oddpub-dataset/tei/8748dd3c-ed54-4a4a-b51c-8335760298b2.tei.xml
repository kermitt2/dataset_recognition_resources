<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This report is the first randomized, placebo-controlled study in euthyroid bipolar patients with refractory depression employing functional brain imaging (FDG-PET) to investigate the effects of adjunctive L-T4 treatment on regional brain metabolism.</s><s>The addition of supraphysiologic doses of L-T4 (300 mcg per day) to an otherwise stable medication regimen of standard treatments resulted in a significant decline in depression scores during the 6week, double-blind treatment phase.</s><s>At endpoint (week 6), the mean HamD score showed a group difference of 3.7 points in favor of L-T4.</s><s>Such difference is generally considered to be clinically meaningful in a short-term treatment trial for major depression.</s><s>NICE used a 3.0-point difference in HamD change scores as a criterion of clinical significance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>he major biological findings of this study are that L-T4, as compared with placebo, yields greater clinical improvement in depression, and that this improvement is strongly correlated with metabolic changes in areas of the anterior limbic network, with pronounced effects in the thalamus, striatum and the subgenual cortex.</s></p><p><s>Functional brain imaging studies (functional magnetic resonance imaging and PET studies) in depression have provided evidence for a dysfunctional interaction between frontal lobe activity and the anterior limbic network, specifically those interconnected prefrontal, limbic and the striatal regions essential for emotional homeostasis.</s><s>These regions include the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal, ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the striatum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>In our previous pilot study of L-T4 in patients with bipolar depression, which was conducted without a patient control group, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> it was not possible to differentiate to what degree changes in depression and related change in brain metabolic activity were directly in response to L-T4, or occurred during the natural course of the disorder.</s><s>This study employing a placebo-control group differentiates that the changes observed are in high probability directly related to the adjunctive L-T4.</s></p><p><s>The most pronounced differences between effects of L-T4 treatment and placebo on brain metabolic activity were the correlations between clinical and metabolic changes in the thalamus and the ventral striatum.</s><s>These changes in the active L-T4 treatment group appear associated with improved depressive symptoms.</s><s>Both the thalamus and ventral striatum have been shown previously to have abnormally high glucose metabolism in depressed bipolar patients compared with healthy controls, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> which normalized after effective treatment with L-T4 (ref.</s><s>13).</s><s>A recent review of functional magnetic resonance imaging investigations of bipolar disorder concluded that the most consistent abnormalities are activation of the thalamus and the striatum.</s><s>It has been hypothesized that excessive activation of an anterior limbic network may disturb emotional homeostasis and lead to dysregulation of positive and negative feedback loops in patients with bipolar disorder. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>ne limitation of this study is that it was a necessary subset of a larger multi-center clinical study, because PET imaging was only available at the Berlin site.</s><s>This sample of convenience had the downside of yielding both unequal sample sizes (15 vs 10) and also age differences between the groups.</s><s>The relatively small sample sizes precluded the quantification of gender effects.</s><s>Despite these limitations, for the first time, in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial of depressed bipolar patients, cerebral metabolic changes are demonstrated with the use of adjunctive L-T4 treatment.</s></p><p><s>As in previous studies, the hyperthyroxinemia induced by L-T4 treatment was well tolerated and led to a doubling of fT4 and fT3 levels (with both hormones being slightly above the reference range), while TSH was suppressed as expected after 6 weeks of L-T4 treatment.</s><s>Even in bipolar patients treated with supraphysiologic doses of L-T4 for extended periods, no serious effects, including loss of bone mineral density, were observed in those previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>The low incidence of adverse effects and high tolerability reported by patients with bipolar disorders, who are receiving high-dose thyroid hormone therapy, contrasts with that typically seen in patients with primary thyroid disease or healthy controls.</s><s>As part of an ongoing effort to define tolerability and safety parameters of supraphysiologic L-T4, we found that under comparable conditions and doses healthy subjects and depressed patients respond differently to L-T4: depressed patients exhibit less elevation in the serum levels of thyroid hormones and show fewer side effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>However, in spite of overall good tolerability, treatment with supraphysiologic L-T4 requires selection of adequate patients with a good general physical health status (especially the absence of severe cardiac disease, arrhythmia in particular) and close (cardiac) monitoring.</s><s>Given the overall lack of placebo-controlled data in this area of bipolar depression, we recommend to use adjunctive L-T4 at a dose of up to 300 mcg per day (depending on individual tolerability) as one option in difficult-to-treat depressed patients and in non-responders to standard treatment approaches, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Although we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms through which thyroid hormones exert their behavioral effects, such as those demonstrated in this paper, the brain's independence of peripheral thyroid metabolism suggests that an understanding of their therapeutic efficacy requires further central nervous system investigation.</s><s>As part of the nuclear superfamily of ligand-modulated transcription factors, thyroid hormones bind to nuclear receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> where they control, and usually increase, gene expression influencing a broad array of metabolic processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>enes that are regulated by thyroid hormones are known to encode for proteins essential for important brain function such as myelin and neurotrophines.</s><s>Non-genomic actions after binding to cytoplasmic thyroid hormone receptors include rapid activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-protein kinase pathway and thereby achievement of vasodilatory and neuroprotective effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>hyroid hormone receptors are widely distributed in the brain with high concentrations in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and the amygdala, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> the latter being limbic structures that are implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders.</s><s>The regulation of thyroid hormone homeostasis in the brain underlies a complex interaction of different mechanisms, some of which overlap with mechanisms involved in affect regulation.</s></p></div>
