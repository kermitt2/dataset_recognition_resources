<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p><s>The primary outcome in this study was a first major bleeding event after study entry (hospitalization or death associated with bleeding).</s><s>Hospitalizations associated with bleeding were defined as those in which an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems code for a bleeding event was assigned as a diagnosis for the admission, either on its own if it was the principal diagnosis (ie, the main reason for the admission) or, if the bleed was not the principal diagnosis, when there was also a blood Potential ICD codes for a major bleeding event were identified by a review of ICD code sets used by other studies to identify bleeding events <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[25]</ref> and a review (by V.S.) of all ICD-9-CM-A and ICD-10-AM codes for any additional potentially relevant codes.</s><s>The final set of ICD-9-CM-A and ICD-10-AM codes for a major bleeding event (eTable 3 in the Supplement) was compiled following a review of all potential ICD codes by V.S. and A.K. Major bleeding events were classified into 3 types: GI, intracerebral, and other.</s><s>Other types were respiratory (including epistaxis and hemoptysis), ocular (vitreous and retinal), bleeding into a joint, and bleeding into the pericardium or peritoneum.</s><s>Major bleeding associated with trauma or procedures was excluded.</s><s>Major bleeding events were classified as nonfatal (hospitalization only; patient still alive 28 days after admission) or fatal (death in which the underlying cause of death was a bleeding event or any death up to 28 days after admission).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p><s>Continuous variables were summarized as means with standard deviations and medians with interquartile ranges and categorical data as frequencies with percentages.</s><s>Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for rates (using person-time as the denominator) were calculated using the Wald interval and for proportions were calculated using the inverted score test.</s><s>Bleeding risk was plotted over time using Kaplan-Meier analyses by bleeding type, sex, and age group for nonfatal bleeding events.</s><s>To assess whether the risk of a nonfatal bleeding event was constant, the proportions of at-risk individuals experiencing a bleeding event were compared between years 1 and 5 using the χ 2 test (or the Fisher test if there were fewer than 5 events in a stratum), for each bleeding event type, sex, and age group (all P &gt; .05).</s><s>Because there was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the annual risk of a nonfatal bleeding event over a 5-year period, risk of a bleeding event (per 1000 person-years) was calculated by dividing the number of events by person-years of follow-up within each stratum.</s><s>Survival curves for men and women for each fatal and nonfatal bleeding event type were compared using the log-rank test with statistical significance set at P &lt; .05</s><s>(2-sided).</s><s>Data analysis was performed using R software, version 3.3.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/),</s><s>which included the "survival" package.</s></p><p><s>In a sensitivity analysis, nonfatal bleeding rates were assessed when patients who initiated antiplatelet or antithrombotic therapy during follow-up were retained rather than excluded because of the potential risk of upward bias in study estimates.</s></p></div>
