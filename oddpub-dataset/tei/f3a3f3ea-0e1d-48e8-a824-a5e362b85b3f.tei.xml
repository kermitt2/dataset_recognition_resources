<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p><s>Continuous variables were summarized as means with standard deviations and medians with interquartile ranges and categorical data as frequencies with percentages.</s><s>Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for rates (using person-time as the denominator) were calculated using the Wald interval and for proportions were calculated using the inverted score test.</s><s>Bleeding risk was plotted over time using Kaplan-Meier analyses by bleeding type, sex, and age group for nonfatal bleeding events.</s><s>To assess whether the risk of a nonfatal bleeding event was constant, the proportions of at-risk individuals experiencing a bleeding event were compared between years 1 and 5 using the œá 2 test (or the Fisher test if there were fewer than 5 events in a stratum), for each bleeding event type, sex, and age group (all P &gt; .05).</s><s>Because there was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the annual risk of a nonfatal bleeding event over a 5-year period, risk of a bleeding event (per 1000 person-years) was calculated by dividing the number of events by person-years of follow-up within each stratum.</s><s>Survival curves for men and women for each fatal and nonfatal bleeding event type were compared using the log-rank test with statistical significance set at P &lt; .05</s><s>(2-sided).</s><s>Data analysis was performed using R software, version 3.3.1 (https://cran.r-project.org/),</s><s>which included the "survival" package.</s></p><p><s>In a sensitivity analysis, nonfatal bleeding rates were assessed when patients who initiated antiplatelet or antithrombotic therapy during follow-up were retained rather than excluded because of the potential risk of upward bias in study estimates.</s></p></div>
