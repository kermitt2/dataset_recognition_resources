<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) is one of the most common arthropathies of the elderly.</s><s>Prevalence rates range from 4% to over 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> , depending on the age of the patient and on the diagnostic method.</s><s>According to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the diagnosis of CPPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> , synovial fluid (SF) analysis is the gold standard for diagnostic purposes, ultrasonography (US) is a promising tool that needs additional studies for demonstrating its involvement in the disease assessment, and conventional radiography is burdened by lower sensitivity compared with SF analysis.</s></p><p><s>More recently, studies demonstrated the usefulness of US in identifying CPP crystal deposits in the hyaline cartilage (HC) and fibrocartilage (FC) at different joint sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> .</s><s>However, a recent systematic literature review emphasized that even if the diagnostic accuracy of US in CPPD is relatively high in all studies, the definitions of the US characteristics of CPP crystal deposits are significantly different <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</s><s>This makes it difficult to compare US results among different studies and makes multicenter studies difficult to perform.</s></p><p><s>Our aim in this study was to define the ultrasonographic characteristics of CPP deposits in joints and periarticular tissues and to evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver reliability of expert ultrasonographers in the assessment of CPPD according to the new definitions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p><s>Study design and setting.</s><s>The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) US CPPD task force was created and held the first meeting during the American College of Rheumatology congress in 2014.</s><s>Here, the preliminary results of a systematic literature review and metaanalysis on the use of US in CPPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> were presented and the necessity of a validation process in the field was discussed.</s><s>Following the OMERACT methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> , a Delphi survey on the definition and characteristics of US-detected CPP crystal deposits was circulated.</s><s>Subsequently, a Web-and a patient-based exercise were performed with the aim of testing the reliability of US in the detection of CPP deposits at different joint and periarticular sites.</s></p><p><s>Reporting of the results in our manuscript followed previously published guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s><s>The study was reported to the local ethics committee and no further approval has been deemed necessary.</s><s>All patients gave an informed consent before participation in the workshop.</s></p><p><s>First step: Delphi survey for defining the US aspect of CPP crystal depositions.</s><s>Eighteen rheumatologists from 10 countries (1 from Denmark, 1 from France, 1 from Germany, 6 from Italy, 1 from the Netherlands, 2 from Mexico, 2 from Romania, 1 from Serbia, 2 from Spain, and 1 from Switzerland), who were experts in US and microcrystalline arthritides and members of the OMERACT US CPPD task force, participated in the study.</s></p><p><s>A preliminary survey was circulated to present the results of the systematic literature review 10 to all participants and to collect their comments and suggestions on the items to be included in the Delphi survey.</s><s>Different sets of definitions were included for FC, HC, tendon, and SF to better describe the features of deposits at different anatomical structure levels.</s><s>For each anatomical site, the following items were defined: the shape, the echogenicity, the localization, and the behavior of the deposits at dynamic scanning.</s></p><p><s>In the first round, the Delphi survey consisted of 30 statements and the participants rated their level of agreement for each according to a Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) and gave their comments.</s><s>Based on the results and comments obtained, the survey was modified and proposed again to the participants until agreement was reached for at least 1 item at each category.</s><s>Group agreement was considered achieved with a total cumulative agreement of 75% or more (a score of 4 or 5 in the Likert scale).</s><s>Statements that did not reach this cutoff were eliminated from the following rounds while statements that achieved agreement were proposed again for voting only in the case of the presence of new statements that were formulated according to the panel's suggestions.</s><s>If no statement achieved 75% of agreement, those that reached 60% or more plus new statements were proposed again for voting to avoid missing values in the definitions.</s><s>The Delphi was considered complete when agreement was achieved for all categories of the survey and the panel proposed no further modifications.</s></p><p><s>Second step: Web-based exercise.</s><s>A pool of 152 US images of the anatomical sites under examination (FC, HC, tendon, SF) were collected in an equally distributed manner by 5 participants who spontaneously offered to contribute.</s><s>The sample was estimated to be the minimum size to accurately estimate k values significantly greater than 0.4, setting α at 0.05 and β at 0.10.</s><s>The FC images included both menisci of the knees and triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>US has been increasingly used during the last decade for the diagnosis of patients with CPPD, as highlighted by a recent systematic literature review <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</s><s>Further, the utility of US in assessing patients with suspected CPPD has been recognized by the EULAR recommendations, which acknowledged US as a promising tool for the diagnosis of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> .</s><s>US is a feasible, safe, and available tool used by the rheumatologist in bedside settings.</s><s>However, agreed-upon definitions for identifying CPPD by US are lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</s><s>The OMERACT US group acknowledged those gaps regarding the use of US in CPPD, and in 2014 the OMERACT US subtask force on CPPD was created to proceed with the standardization of the technique in that disease.</s><s>According to the OMERACT procedures, the first step was to create the definitions for the US identification of CPPD through a Delphi exercise.</s><s>Division of the definitions into 4 sections (shape, form, localization, and behavior in dynamic scanning) could allow the inclusion of all previously published definitions, even if incomplete.</s><s>Then, the panel's expertise could fulfill the missing statements to achieve homogeneous and complete definitions for each anatomical site.</s></p><p><s>Before final approval of the definitions that took place during the Siena workshop, some questions related to Delphi results were raised and discussed.</s><s>The major concern was whether those definitions could be applied to all joints or only to the knee joint because most of the papers that were used for retrieving the first set of statements were dealing with the knee joint <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</s><s>The panel was not able to answer this question and agreed that the patient-based exercise could come up with some elements to address this aspect.</s><s>Another point of discussion was the final definition of tendon deposition of CPP crystals because not all experts agreed to include the word "multiple" in the shape category.</s><s>After discussing this issue, the panel conveyed that multiple depositions could increase the specificity of the finding because "single spots" could be indicative of many different kinds of pathology, and the final definition was thus approved entirely.</s></p><p><s>The Web-based reliability exercise demonstrated good results for the deposits at the level of the HC, SF, and FC while tendon assessment needs further evaluations.</s><s>The good results globally obtained in all fields demonstrate consistency in the application of the new definitions, even though the interpretation of the US findings may be different among the ultrasonographers.</s><s>For the patient-based exercise, 9 volun-  The results of the Web-based and the patient-based exercises raise some considerations.</s><s>First, as stated by the different results obtained at the FC level of knee and wrist, the new definitions may be applied only at the knee level, while they need to be retested in other FC sites.</s><s>This discrepancy may be due to either local technical difficulties at the triangular fibrocartilage of the wrist or to the presence of local abnormalities that could mimic the presence of CPP deposits and create misinterpretations.</s><s>This aspect needs further investigation.</s></p><p><s>Second, tendons and SF yielded the lowest values of interobserver agreement both in static and in the patient-based exercise.</s><s>This may be related to the difficult applicability of the definitions and the need for a standardized scanning technique.</s><s>Further, regarding tendons, in this workshop we decided not to include the Achilles tendon and the plantar fascia in our assessment, despite the high specificity of CPPD at these tendons <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> .</s><s>This choice was made to reduce the discomfort of the patient during the examination, considering that to properly assess the Achilles tendon and the plantar fascia, the patient must roll over on the examination bed.</s><s>We preferred to prevent this discomfort and also to save the time that the patient would use to take the correct position.</s><s>Perhaps assessing the Achilles tendon would provide higher k values, being a more familiar site for CPPD evaluation, but it would not reflect the reliability of assessing other tendons, less frequently involved by CPPD.</s><s>Further studies are needed to better identify the features that indicate the presence of CPP deposition in those 2 structures.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first attempt by an international panel to create US CPPD diagnostic criteria following the rigorous OMERACT methodology.</s><s>These new OMERACT definitions yielded good results in terms of reliability in the assessment of the knee HC and FC.</s><s>Results at the level of other anatomical sites proved not to be satisfactory.</s><s>However, the knee joint, and especially the medial meniscus, appears to be the most frequently involved site in CPPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> , and thus of interest in terms of US reliability.</s><s>Taking this into account, the OMERACT US definitions for identification of CPP crystal deposits can be used at the knee level (HC and FC assessments) and may be a good support for disease diagnosis.</s><s>The use of agreed and reliable definitions is of great interest, particularly in a multicenter setting.</s><s>Further studies are needed to better define the US appearance of CPP deposits and the most appropriate scanning technique in anatomical sites other than the knee, and then to test their diagnostic accuracy for CPPD identification.</s></p></div>
