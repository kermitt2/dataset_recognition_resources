IIEF-EF.</s><s>Similarly, another study concluded that the IIEF-5 might not be suitable for use in Japanese men and it might be preferable for this cohort to use the erection hardness score as an alternative to the IIEF-5 for the precise assessment of postoperative changes in EF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Therefore, erection was evaluated by using IIEF-Q1.</s><s>The definition of the recovery of erection was an IIEF-Q1 score of ≥2 for those patients with a preoperative IIEF-Q1 score of ≥2.</s><s>The recovery rate of erection was 51.7%, 58.0%, 60.4%, and 67% in the patients with a preoperative IIEF-Q1 score of ≥2 and 60.5% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively, after the RARP.</s></p><p><s>Several reports of potency after RARPs have appeared.</s><s>The potency rate

study, the recovery rates of erection were similar to those in these studies and the evaluation of erection by using IIEF-Q1 is valid for Japanese patients.</s></p><p><s>Nerve-sparing is the important factor for EF after RP.</s><s>A study concluded that NS is an independent predictor for the preservation of potency after an open RP (ORP). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>It was

difference in the positive surgical margin rates for any NS grade.</s><s>The effects on erection in the biland uni-NS procedures postoperatively were similar to previous reports that bil-and uni-NS procedures are superior to other NS procedures regarding erection after surgery, but the authors recognized that the recovery rate of erection from the bil-PNS procedure tended to be better than that from the non-NS procedure and the meaning of bil-PNS was elucidated.</s><s>Therefore, the RARP with any nerve preserved as well as possible should be the procedure of choice when considering the

small.</s><s>However, some useful conclusions from these data can be drawn regarding Japanese patients.</s><s>Time-dependent improvement was noted.</s><s>Furthermore, it is clear that it is better for

the results from a randomized controlled trial for tadalafil treatment were published.</s></p><p><s>The study concluded that 5 mg of tadalafil once daily was most effective for drug-assisted EF in men with erectile dysfunction following NS RP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Another study suggested that the use of tadalafil once daily could significantly shorten the time to EF recovery postNS RP, compared with a placebo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Yet another report suggested that the early initiation of 5 mg of tadalafil once daily prevented penile length loss
