<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The study was conducted in the Bosomtwe district of the Ashanti Region in Ghana.</s><s>Two sets of data were used for the analysis: (1) an individual-level survey containing data on residence, disease status and demography of children attending a local hospital; and, (2) a communitylevel survey containing data on community characteristics of villages located within the hospital catchment area.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study site and study area</head><p><s>The Ashanti Region is located in the forest-belt of Ghana, characterized by wet tropical climate with a main rainy season from March to July and a minor rainy season from September to November.</s><s>The vegetation in the study area is dominated by semi-deciduous forest, but farming activities thinned out much of the former closed forests.</s><s>Malaria is endemic with high transmission intensity throughout the year <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hospital survey</head><p><s>Patients were recruited at St Michael's Hospital (SMH) in Pramso, a town of about 3300 inhabitants located 20 km southeast of the regional capital Kumasi, on one of the major roads leaving the city.</s><s>SMH is the biggest health facility in the Bosomtwe district with a large general outpatient department (OPD) and four wards, one each for women, children and men and a maternity ward.</s><s>The catchment area of SMH stretches from urban Kumasi and its suburbs in the northwest to rural areas of the Bosumtwe District in the southeast.</s></p><p><s>All children &lt;15 years of age with fever (tympanic temperature â¥38 Â°C) presenting to the OPD during the study period (January to December 2012) were recruited if informed consent was given by their caregiver.</s><s>A blood sample was taken by venipuncture and a questionnaire on basic demographic data was completed.</s><s>Children were treated according to hospital guidelines.</s><s>Children attending the hospital for a second time were only considered as a new case if this visit occurred &gt;28 days after a previous visit.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Laboratory diagnostics</head><p><s>Thick and thin blood films for malaria parasite examination were prepared according to quality-controlled, standardized protocols.</s><s>Two independent readers examined the slides and the mean of these readings was used to quantify parasitaemia as asexual parasites/Âµl.</s><s>A third reading was performed in case of discrepancies in positivity, malaria species, or a less than threefold difference in quantification.</s><s>An episode of malaria was defined as fever accompanied by an asexual parasite count of â¥5000/Âµl.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community data</head><p><s>The catchment area of SMH was defined as a geographically continuous area around the hospital, which covered the residence of 95 % of SMH's patients (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Data on community characteristics used to construct the urbanicity scale were retrieved from the 'Ghana population and housing Census 2010' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Additional data on the availability of private services (e.g., banks, petrol stations) and information about road conditions and frequency of public transport were collected via systematic interviews conducted in each community.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Urbanicity scale</head><p><s>The urbanicity scale was constructed and validated according to the principles of scale development as described by DeVellis [17] and Netemeyer and Bearden <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Data used to establish the scale were selected by literature review and expert opinion.</s><s>Eight components were defined within which variables were grouped: population, economic activity, education, healthcare, transportation, service-infrastructure, sanitation, and housing.</s><s>Each component accounted for ten points.</s><s>Consequently, the final scale ranged from 0 to 80 points.</s><s>The components used to construct the scale are displayed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To calculate each community's urbanicity, score points were accumulated according to its particular characteristics.</s><s>Unidimensionality of the scale was tested by exploratory factor analysis, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was used to assess sampling adequacy and internal consistency was validated using Cronbach's alpha.</s><s>For more details on scale construction and validation see Additional files 1 and 2.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The proportion of fever cases that fulfilled the malaria criteria was calculated for each community.</s><s>To retrieve robust estimates, the malaria positive fraction (MPF), i.e., number of patients with malaria over all patients with fever from each community) was calculated only for communities with at least 20 study participants.</s><s>As it can be expected that in areas of low transmission older children are still susceptible to malaria, therefore leading to a higher mean age of malaria patients compared to areas of high transmission, the mean age of malaria cases in each community was calculated to approximate the local age at infection and to estimate the acquisition of immunity.</s><s>Summary statistics for the study participants are presented as proportions for dichotomous or categorical variables and as medians with interquartile range (IQR) or means with standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.</s></p><p><s>First, bivariate linear regression analysis was performed: (1) between urbanicity (score) and MPF, to assess the association between urbanicity and malaria prevalence; (2) between urbanicity (score) and the mean age of malaria patients in each community to assess an association between urbanicity and acquisition of immunity to malaria; and, (3) between MPF and mean age of malaria patients in each community to assess an association between malaria prevalence and acquisition of immunity to malaria.</s><s>Second, it was decided a priori to repeat the three models including insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) as a covariate, as the use of ITNs is known to be associated with malaria as well as urbanicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>, and could be a potential confounder.</s></p><p><s>To exclude age of patients at presentation as a potential confounder, linear regression analysis was also conducted for MPF and urbanicity and the mean age of presentation for all children from a village, irrespective of malaria positivity.</s><s>As no association was seen between mean age of all patients and MPF or urbanicity, age was not included in the multivariate regression model between MPF and urbanicity.</s><s>In addition, linear regression models were applied to assess the association between the particular score-components (each ranging from 0 to 10 points) and MPF to analyse which components have the strongest association with MPF.</s><s>A multivariate regression model was established to assess co-linearity between variables.</s></p><p><s>All regression estimates were weighted by the number of observations from each community as the models used proportions (MPF) and means (age) as outcome measures.</s><s>All measures of increase/decrease in the dependent variables were calculated based on a tenpoint increase in the urbanicity score.</s><s>An increase of ten points on the score would be achieved, e.g., by an increase in the proportion of households with tap water from the lowest to the highest quartile or an increase of the population from 800 to 8000 plus the availability of a post office and a bank (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>All analyses were carried out using Stata v12.1 (StataCorp LP, College Station, USA).</s></p></div>

contributing to the measurement of mean age malaria episodes was performed.</s><s>Using MPF as outcome and a continuous measure of urbanicity as exposure, a linear decrease of 5 % in MPF with every ten-point increase in urbanicity was identified.</s><s>In addition, it was found that the mean age of malaria patients increased by 2.9 months with every ten-point increase on the urbanicity scale, indicating a potential influence of urbanicity on the acquisition of semi-immunity against malaria.</s><s>This is supported by the finding of a lower mean age of malaria patients in communities with a higher MPF.</s></p><p><s>Through the use of a continuous scale of urbanicity that provides more detailed information than a binary classification, it was possible to assess linear associations with the covariates.</s><s>The vast majority of previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21]</ref> used a crude rural-urban dichotomy that is more arbitrary and cannot distinguish localities and cities on a continuum of urbanicity.</s><s>In contrast to these studies, this continuous scale is based on standardized methods of scale construction [17] that have been applied and validated to measure urbanicity in different settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The results confirm heterogeneity of malaria prevalence in areas of high endemicity as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and underpin the postulated association between urbanization and the decreasing incidence of malaria.</s><s>The most detailed study on the effect of urbanization on malaria was conducted in the Republic of Congo between 1982 and 1984 and found high spatial variation of malaria prevalence in Brazzaville <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>.</s><s>Water bodies in urban areas were scarce or polluted and thus unfavourable as breeding sites for mosquitoes.</s><s>The authors also found that the flight range of mosquitoes was reduced from several kilometres in rural areas to a few 100 m in urban areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, probably due to higher human population density.</s><s>Data from the city of Dakar showed highly focused malaria transmission and a decreasing malaria risk in urbanized areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, a study from Ouagadougou showed a decreasing risk of malaria from the periphery of the city towards the urban centre and identified urban agriculture and residence near mosquito breeding sites as risk factors for urban malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The relationship between urbanicity and malaria transmission has been modelled on a global scale in several studies.</s><s>These models found a pattern of decreasing malaria transmission coinciding with increased urbanization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of entomological inoculation rate (EIR) surveys, lower EIRs in urban or peri-urban areas compared to rural areas were found <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The decline in transmission in urban areas is best explained by a rise in socio-economic status, housing quality and access to infrastructure, sanitation and education, as well as a higher use of prevention methods (e.g., ITNs) and access to healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30]</ref>.</s><s>In the study presented here, the strongest associations between MPF and single components of the score were observed for population size, economic activity, education, and housing.</s><s>However, the observed unidimensionality of the score components supports the approach to combine the components into one measure of urbanicity rather than assessing component's associations with MPF.</s></p><p><s>The use of ITNs in the current study was not significantly associated with urbanicity, but surprisingly associated with a higher MPF.</s><s>However, the analysis was performed on an ecological level and individual risk was not assessed.</s><s>Therefore, ITN use may have been higher in communities with a high MPF as a response to higher transmission there.</s><s>The reported use of ITNs was also higher than in previous studies where 22 % of children below the age of five slept under a bed net in 2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</s><s>This difference is possibly due to a recent upscaling in ITN distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> or a result of a possible interviewer bias.</s></p><p><s>The findings of varying mean ages of malaria patients over short distances and a correlation of mean age with urbanicity and MPF indicate that the acquisition of immunity is spatially heterogeneous and possibly slower in urban areas.</s><s>The association between prevalence of malaria and the acquisition of immunity is well known and has been studied on a macro-epidemiological scale and in modelling approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>.</s><s>A recent metaanalysis found that clinical malaria is experienced at all ages, but the age of severe symptoms is inversely associated with transmission intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>.</s><s>However, data on heterogeneity in immunity on a micro-epidemiological level are scarce and there are few studies on the effect of urbanicity.</s><s>An early, cross-sectional study from southern Ghana found a markedly lower prevalence of antibodies against P. falciparum in an urban setting compared to a rural area <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>.</s><s>However, antibody responses to malaria are not necessarily correlated to immunity and may just be markers of a higher exposure in rural areas.</s><s>Several studies have looked at the mean age of malaria patients in regions or countries of low and high transmission intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref> and as a change over time with decreasing malaria incidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</s><s>All these studies consistently found a lower mean age of malaria in higher transmission settings.</s><s>However, to the authors' knowledge the only study that looked at varying age of infection over short distances is a recent ecological analysis from Kenya that also found a correlation between MPF and mean age of infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A difference in the age of infection between urban and rural areas and a possible delay in the acquisition of immunity has several implications for clinicians and intervention programmes.</s><s>First, severe disease in urban areas may be more evenly distributed across childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> and clinicians should also consider malaria as a cause of severe febrile illness in older children.</s><s>Second, intervention programmes focusing on infants may not be accurately targeted in the future even if the brunt of malaria deaths is still borne by the youngest children today <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Third, delayed and potentially waning immunity may lead to populations susceptible to severe disease and potentially to epidemics of severe malaria.</s></p><p><s>While these findings could have major implications, the data should be interpreted with care.</s><s>First, MPF is a measure of disease prevalence in patients attending the hospital and not a direct measure in the community.</s><s>Calculating malaria prevalence/incidence based on data from healthcare facilities is biased by access to care and unknown hospital coverage.</s><s>By using the MPF among children with fever, as previously done in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref>, the measure of prevalence is not biased by access to care.</s><s>MPF, as a measure within the population attending the hospital, would only be influenced by healthcareseeking behaviour if it is different between malaria cases and fever cases with other causes (e.g., if mothers took children with malaria to private clinics and attended the hospital with other infections).</s><s>As malaria is clinically indistinguishable from other febrile infections, such an effect is unlikely to have biased the results.</s><s>However, it is impossible to know whether the families attending the hospital are representative of the communities that they come from and the findings may therefore not be transferable.</s><s>Second, MPF was calculated based on all cases of malaria presenting to an OPD and did not stratify for degrees of disease severity.</s><s>The pattern of association between MPF and urbanicity might vary by disease severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> and further studies are needed to study this in detail.</s><s>Third, malaria infection may have been acquired while travelling outside residential areas and therefore falsely attributed to the community of residence in this analysis.</s><s>However, this limitation is less likely for children and the main vector in the area, Anopheles gambiae is known to be mainly endophilic <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Fourth, as immunity is influenced by changes in urbanicity, which is an ongoing process, the population immunity may not be at equilibrium with the environment.</s><s>However, as the data presented here are from children with a mean age of 3.3 years, changes in urbanicity over such a short period are unlikely to be large enough to have a strong effect on the effects seen here.</s><s>Finally, this is a cross-sectional study and the data were analysed on an ecological level, making causal inferences difficult.</s></p><p><s>The results demonstrate the feasibility of hospitalbased studies to analyse crude associations in the micro-epidemiology of malaria and acquired immunity.</s><s>However, further studies including clinical data on disease severity, especially cerebral malaria, and analyses on an individual level are needed.</s><s>Future studies should also include additional risk factors such as surrounding breeding sites.</s><s>Such studies will lead to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of both transmission and immunity and provide data for geographically targeted interventions.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Map of the study
