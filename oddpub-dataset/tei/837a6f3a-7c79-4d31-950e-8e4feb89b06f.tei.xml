<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Previous research has revealed differences in at-rest brain activity between individuals with clinically-diagnosed ASD and their typically developing counterparts.</s><s>However, few studies to date have examined resting-state EEG activity in samples of typically developing individuals with varying degrees of subthreshold ASD trait expression.</s><s>In the present study, we recorded high-density, resting-state scalp EEG and examined correlations between band-specific power and scores on three subscales of the BAP-Q instrument.</s><s>Primary analyses revealed a positive association between resting-state alpha power (8-13 Hz) and scores on the BAP-Q Rigidity subscale in the parietal region.</s><s>This association was domain-specific, as no significant associations were identified between alpha power and the other two BAP-Q subscales.</s><s>Furthermore, follow-up analyses found no significant association between the Rigidity subscale and oscillatory power in the other frequency bands.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies of resting-state brain activity have identified associations between alpha power and global measures of the ASD phenotype (i.e., without examining specific domains of function).</s><s>Both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies have found increased alpha power among individuals with ASD compared to typically developing peers, particularly in posterior and centro-parietal regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Critically, these studies found that the magnitude of alpha power correlated with overall ASD symptom severity (although it should be noted that a limited number of opposing findings have also been reported, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ).</s><s>Our study builds upon this literature by suggesting that the correlation between alpha power and global ASD symptom severity may be driven by specific subdomains of the broader autism phenotype, namely, the restricted and repetitive behaviors domain.</s><s>Indeed, it is possible that this specific domain of the ASD phenotype may have driven the association between alpha power and global ASD severity reported in the aforementioned studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>).</s><s>Future research should therefore investigate not only associations between neural functioning and overall severity, but also with specific symptom domains.</s></p><p><s>Currently, research examining specific domains of the broader autism phenotype is limited despite evidence that these domains may have dissociable neurobiological and genetic correlates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Taking this sub-domain approach may help to explain the heterogeneity within ASD from a neurobiological point of view and is in keeping with recent calls for research focusing on the neural correlates of different aspects cognition and behavior, rather than diagnostic status <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> .</s><s>In terms of previous literature, one EEG-based study of individuals with ASD found that increased resting-state alpha power in the posterior scalp region correlated with increased 'attentiveness to detail' <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>The authors found no evidence for an association between alpha power and other domains of the ASD phenotype, suggesting that the relationship was symptom-specific.</s><s>Critically, although several studies have now linked resting-state alpha power to specific domains of the ASD phenotype, the functional significance of resting-state EEG oscillations is incompletely understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> , and furthermore, evidence suggests that the correlates of oscillatory information may differ between ASD and typically developing populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> .</s><s>Evidence from event-related (i.e., task-dependent) EEG studies suggests that alpha oscillations are involved in suppressing neural responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, resting-state alpha activity may be required to attenuate the brain's response to sensory input in the absence of task demands.</s><s>Participants with decreased resting-state alpha activity may therefore exhibit increased sensitivity to environmental novelty, which may favor an aversion to change and a preference for repetitive, stereotyped routines.</s><s>However, this interpretation is speculative and requires investigation in future research.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, only one prior study has examined the association between resting-state EEG power and different domains of autistic trait expression among typically developing individuals.</s><s>In contrast to current results, the previous study found that increased alpha power in the central and parietal scalp regions correlated with increased scores on the BAP-Q Aloofness subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</s><s>Differences in how EEG data was collected, and how alpha power was measured could have contributed to the discrepancies in results.</s><s>The previous study measured alpha activity by computing the difference between power in the eyes-closed versus eyes-open conditions, whereas the current study only examined alpha power during the eyes-closed condition due to the presence of extensive artifact in the eyes-open condition.</s><s>This should be held in mind when interpreting current results, as previous work suggests there may be differences in the strength and topography of oscillatory activity between eyes-open and eyes-closed paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>We posit that measuring a difference score between eyes-open and eyes-closed alpha activity (as was done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> ) may index a fundamentally distinct neurophysiological process than measuring eyes-closed activity independently.</s><s>Furthermore, the interpretation of the prior study focused primarily on alpha activity in more lateral parietal regions, more consistent with the distribution of 'mu' activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> , whereas our analysis highlighted the centro-parietal region.</s><s>Nevertheless, future work is needed to reconcile these results and further investigate the manner in which specific computations of alpha power (e.g., eyes open vs. eyes closed vs. differential) may index distinct functional processes.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations of the present design are being addressed in ongoing research by our group.</s><s>First, the study included a modest sample size and thus requires replication.</s><s>Our constrained sample size may have limited our ability to detect smaller associations among alpha power and the other subscales or between the Rigidity subscale and the other frequency bands.</s><s>Additionally, as we did not have any information regarding the cognitive ability of participants, we could not control for intellectual ability in our analyses.</s><s>Notably, others have found no association between intellectual ability and resting-state alpha power in typically developing individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, one study found an association between cognitive function and alpha power in ASD, but no such association was observed in the typically developing comparison group <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s><s>However, the present study cannot rule out this potential effect.</s><s>The main strengths of the current work are the novel approach to understanding brain-behavior associations relevant to the ASD phenotype, and the in-depth exploration of the specificity of said associations.</s><s>If the current pattern of results were replicated in clinical samples, this would suggest that certain metrics of neural functioning, such as resting-state EEG power, could be used in conjunction with behavioral assessments to identify in which particular domains of functioning (e.g.</s><s>social motivation, restricted and repetitive behaviors, flexible and effective communication) an individual may require greatest support.</s></p><p><s>To conclude, the present results align with the emerging notion that specific domains of the ASD phenotype exhibit partially-dissociable electrographic correlates <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , even in the typically developing (i.e., subclinical) population.</s><s>Additional work is needed to understand the functional significance of resting-state oscillations and their contributions to heterogeneity within the broader autism phenotype.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
