<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SafeRä pacing mode</head><p><s>All pacemakers used in the study were SafeR TM enabled.</s><s>This algorithm provides AAI(R) pacing while continuously monitoring AV conduction, and ensures DDD(R) pacing when needed for all types of AVB.</s><s>Switching to the DDD(R) mode occurs after detection of two consecutive nonconducted beats (third-degree AVB criterion), missing AV conduction in 3 of 12 atrial beats (second-degree AVB criterion), or ventricular asystole (regardless of the underlying rhythm, asystole interval programmable to ≥2 to 3 s).</s><s>In addition, SafeR does not allow more than six consecutive intervals (between atrial and ventricular events) longer than a programmable value (ranging from 200 to 450 ms).</s><s>Upon the seventh long PR interval, the SafeR algorithm switches to DDD (first-degree AVB criterion), in order to prevent AV decoupling that has been described as an undesired side effect of a different AAI-DDD changeover mode. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>he switch back to AAI occurs after 100 beats or 12 consecutive cycles with spontaneous R waves.</s><s>The SafeR pacing mode also counts all detected AVB episodes and provides an accurate categorization of the kind of AVB. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> A more comprehensive description of the SafeR pacing mode can be found elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>llow-up and data collection After implant and enrolment, all pacemakers were programmed to the SafeR pacing mode for 1 month to allow equilibration of medical treatment.</s><s>At the end of this run-in period, patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 fashion to either the SafeR pacing mode (SafeR group) or the conventional DDD(R) pacing mode (control group).</s><s>In the control group, nominal AV delays were proposed as preferred setting (155 ms after a sensed atrial event and 220 ms after atrial pacing, with automatic shortening of the delay during a rate increase), but the programming was left to physician's discretion.</s></p><p><s>Follow-up visits were carried out after enrolment before hospital discharge, at 1 month (randomization visit), 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months.</s><s>The medication and dosages were emphasized to be prescribed as medically indicated.</s></p><p><s>The Study Steering Committee blindly reviewed and analysed all serious adverse events for relationship with the device and pacing modes.</s></p><p><s>At each visit, the device memory was downloaded.</s><s>Clinical data were retrieved and transferred to case report forms (CRFs).</s><s>Adverse events (AEs) prompted unscheduled visits and were recorded on specific CRFs.</s></p></div>

programmed AV delays, the decrease in VP was accomplished in intermittent AVB as well as in SND, whereas patients with permanent AVB had similar VP rates on both investigated modes.</s><s>Ventricular pacing reduction by the SafeR mode has been achieved without compromising safety in both indication subgroups.</s><s>In addition, VP prevention translated into a significant increase in estimated device longevity and a decrease in the rate of anticipated replacement operations in intermittent AVB and SND patients, while understandably no significant difference resulted in permanent AVB patients.</s></p><p><s>Close to half of the ANSWER population was implanted for SND, without evidence of AVB at the time of implant.</s><s>In this group of patients, VP could almost completely be prevented by SafeR, whereas the DDD mode produced a very high percentage of presumably unneeded VP.</s><s>This effect, achieved through AAI pacing with added VP in case of intermittently impaired AV conduction, is similar to what has previously been reported with a different AAI-DDD changeover mode, the MVP TM algorithm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>mportantly, also patients with intermittent AVB experienced a substantial reduction of VP under SafeR.</s><s>Two previous small studies with short follow-up reported effective VP prevention in patients with AVB through the MVP TM AAI-DDD changeover algorithm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>ut the application of the MVP TM mode in patients with AV block has been criticized, because even a marked first-degree AV block does not prompt the addition of VP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Adverse haemodynamic effects of long PR intervals through pronouncedly prolonged intrinsic AV conduction comprise shortening and impairment of LV filling, pre-systolic mitral regurgitation, and increased left atrial pressure.</s></p><p><s>In some patients, symptoms resembling pacemaker syndrome are provoked by the unfavourable prolongation of the AV electromechanical sequence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr"

this possible shortcoming, the more complexly adapting SafeR mode may be regarded as particularly appropriate to achieve low VP percentages in patients with AVB without provoking disadvantageously decoupled AV activation patterns.</s><s>The results of this sub-analysis confirm the safety and effectiveness of SafeR in intermittent AVB patients.</s></p><p><s>As expected, patients with permanent AVB did not experience any reduction in VP with SafeR, as this sub-population requires continuous VP.</s><s>But it is important to note that the investigated changeover mode appeared to be safe and well tolerated even in lasting complete AVB.</s><s>For this population, no benefit through VP prevention can be anticipated, except where the spontaneous AV conduction is recovering unexpectedly.</s></p><p><s>The estimated longevity of the devices programmed on DDD approached 10 years, which would already represent a notable improvement compared with many older pulse generators' battery durability.</s><s>The significant reduction in VP achieved by the SafeR pacing mode when compared with the standard DDD mode translated into an additional calculated gain of .1 year in device longevity.</s><s>This potential benefit resulted similarly for SND and intermittent AVB patients.</s><s>A previous study by Benkemoun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> reported longer estimated longevities on SafeR (142.7 + 29.9 months) and similar values on DDD (118.8 + 28.0 months).</s><s>This discrepancy may, in part, be explained by different programming strategies, in particular the handling of rate response settings.</s><s>Without an accountable reason, in our study, a high proportion of patients ( 60%) remained programmed in the 'LEARN' setting of the rate response algorithm, which enables the algorithm to calibrate the activity sensors according to an individual patient's activity.</s><s>By this algorithm, the rate response slope and the individualized adaptation of the pacing rate are determined.</s><s>The frequent and lasting usage of this setting may have contributed to increased battery drain.</s><s>The analysis of anticipated device longevity at preset programmed parameters and with rate response OFF confirms this hypothesis, with an estimated median longevity in SafeR of 142.0 months.</s><s>Expectedly, the gain in estimated device longevity observed in patients programmed to SafeR contributed to a decrease in the age-dependent rate of anticipated device replacement on this pacing mode.</s><s>This is certainly relevant in an elderly population, but even more in younger patients.</s><s>Taking into account the known risk of infection and the incremental cost of generator replacement surgery, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> the possible prolongation of the devices' lifecycle adds an important obvious advantage of the SafeR mode and similar VP prevention algorithms compared with standard DDD pacing.</s><s>This appears to be particularly important in the light of a recently published study (Clinical Outcome of Pacemaker patients according to pacing Modality and primary INDications: OPTI-MIND) showing considerable sub-optimal programming of dual-chamber pacing in clinical practice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the study</head><p><s>This study relates to the investigation of a proprietary algorithm by a single device manufacturer.</s><s>The analysis of VP was based on the device files collected at each follow-up.</s><s>Not all files were available at the time of the analysis, and the LOCF method was applied to account for individuals with missing outcome data.</s><s>Another limitation SafeR vs. DDD in SND or AVB patients may be the number of programming changes between the arms.</s><s>However, the very large difference in rates of VP between the SafeR and DDD arms in ANSWER means that these limitations are highly unlikely to have affected the study outcome and there is every reason to believe it reflects a true effect of SafeR vs. DDD.</s></p><p><s>The device longevity values were predicted values assessed through a device-based prediction algorithm, which may therefore differ from real device longevity.</s><s>In addition, the rate of replacement was anticipated based on a model taking into account device longevities and survival probabilities that were estimated using a computational approach.</s><s>This model does not account for those patients who, during the course of time, may have changed their underlying electrical disease (from intermittent to permanent AVB).</s></p></div>
