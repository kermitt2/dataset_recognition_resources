<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>A core principle of scientific progress is reproducibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">( 16 )</ref>.</s><s>Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator, but by the repeatability of their supporting evidence.</s><s>Scientists attempt to transparently describe the methodology and resulting evidence used to support the claim.</s><s>Other scientists agree or disagree whether the evidence supports the claim, citing theoretical or methodological reasons, or by collecting new evidence.</s><s>Such debates are rendered meaningless, however, if the evidence being debated is not reproducible.</s></p><p><s>Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.</s><s>Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( 7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8 )</ref>, and is the means of establishing reproducibility with new data.</s><s>A direct replication may not obtain the original result for a variety of reasons: known or unknown differences between the replication and original study may moderate the size of an observed effect, the original result could have been a false positive, or the replication could produce a false negative.</s><s>False positives and false negatives provide misleading information about effects; and, failure to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions to reproduce an effect indicates an incomplete theoretical understanding of the finding.</s><s>Direct replication provides the opportunity to assess and improve reproducibility.</s></p><p><s>There is plenty of concern ( <ref type="formula">913</ref>), but little direct evidence about the rate and predictors of reproducibility.</s><s>What evidence does exist suggests that reproducibility is lower than desired or anticipated.</s><s>Using Bayesian reasoning, Ioannidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">( 9 )</ref> estimated that publishing and analytic practices make it likely that more than half of research results are false, and therefore irreproducible.</s><s>In cell biology, two industrial laboratories reported success replicating the original results of landmark findings in only 11% and 25% of the attempted cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">( 10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11 )</ref>.</s><s>These numbers are stunning, but they are also difficult to interpret because no details are available about the studies, methodology, or results.</s><s>With no transparency, the reasons for low reproducibility cannot be evaluated.</s></p><p><s>Other investigations point to practices and incentives that may inflate the likelihood of obtaining false positive results in particular, or irreproducible results more generally.</s></p><p><s>Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results ( 1223 ).</s></p><p><s>In short, there are many informed hypotheses, but little direct evidence, about the reproducibility of published research.</s><s>We were inspired to redress this gap.</s><s>In this article, we report a largescale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.</s></p><p><s>Starting in November 2011, we constructed a protocol for selecting and conducting highpowered, highquality replications of a sample of published studies in psychology to maximize quality and generalizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">( 24 )</ref>.</s><s>The project was hosted at a project management site (Open Science Framework; http://osf.io/ ) where collaborators joined the project, selected a study for replication from the available studies in the sampling frame, and were guided through the replication protocol.</s><s>The replication protocol articulated the process of selecting the study and key effect from the available articles, contacting the original authors for study materials, preparing a study protocol and analysis plan, obtaining review of the protocol by the original authors and other members within the present project, registering the protocol publicly, conducting the replication, writing the final report, and auditing the process and analysis for quality control (see 25 , and Supplementary Information for method details).</s></p><p><s>Project coordinators facilitated each step of the process and maintained the protocol and project resources.</s><s>Replication materials and data were required to be archived publicly to maximize transparency and accountability of the project team to the scientific community (https://osf.io/ezcuj/).</s></p><p><s>To explore correlates of reproducibility we assessed characteristics of the original study such as the publishing journal; original effect size, p value, and sample size; experience and expertise of the original research team; rated importance of the effect as indicated by factors such as the citation impact of the article; and, rated surprisingness of the effect.</s><s>We also assessed characteristics of the replication such as statistical power and sample size, experience and expertise of the replication team, independently assessed challenge of conducting an effective replication, and selfassessed quality of the replication effort.</s></p><p><s>In total, 100 replications were completed by 270 contributing authors.</s><s>There were many different experimental designs and analysis strategies in the original research.</s><s>Through consultation with original authors, obtaining original materials, and internal review, replications maintained high fidelity to the original designs.</s><s>Analytic strategies converted results to a common effect size metric ( r , correlation coefficient) and confidence intervals.</s><s>The unit(s) of analysis for inferences about reproducibility were the original and replication studies.</s><s>The resulting open dataset provides an initial estimate of the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We conducted a largescale, collaborative effort to reproduce 100 findings from the published psychology literature.</s><s>Replication effects ( M = .198,</s><s>SD = .255)</s><s>were half the magnitude of original effects ( M = .396,</s><s>SD = .196)</s><s>representing a substantial decline effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">( 29 )</ref>.</s><s>Thirtysix percent of replications had significant results ( p &lt;.05) compared to 97% of original studies; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 38% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and, with the assumption of no publication bias in original results, 70% of the metaanalytic combinations of original and replication results were significant effects.</s><s>No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and these indicators are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility.</s><s>Nonetheless, collectively, these results offer a clear conclusion: a large portion of replications did not reproduce evidence supporting the original results despite using highpowered designs, materials provided by the original authors, and review in advance for methodological fidelity.</s><s>Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams and conducting of the replication.</s><s>The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, the evidence is just that they did not do so here.</s><s>Other investigators may develop alternative indicators to explore further the role of expertise and quality in reproducibility on this open dataset.</s></p></div>

statistically significant ( p value ≤ 0.05) and nonsignificant ( p &gt; .05).</s><s>However, original studies that interpreted nonsignificant p values as significant were coded as significant (4 cases, all with p values &lt; .06).</s><s>Using the nonsignificant p values of the replication studies only, using Fisher's ( <ref type="formula">38</ref>) method we tested the hypothesis that these studies had 'no evidential value' (i.e., the nullhypothesis of zeroeffect holds for all these studies).</s><s>The hypothesis that the proportions of statistically significant results are equal was tested using the McNemar test for paired nominal data, and a confidence interval of the reproducibility parameter was calculated.</s><s>Second, we compared the central tendency of the distribution of p values of original and replication studies using the Wilcoxon signedrank test and the t test for dependent samples.</s><s>For both tests we only used complete data (i.e., studypairs for which both p values were available).</s></p><p><s>Effect sizes .</s><s>We transformed all effect sizes into correlation coefficients whenever possible.</s><s>Correlation coefficients have several advantages over other effect size measures, such as Cohen's d .</s><s>Correlation coefficients are bounded, wellknown, and therefore more readily interpretable.</s><s>Most importantly for our purposes, analysis of

this proportion is .5.</s><s>For this test we used the data for which effect size measures were available but no correlation coefficient could be computed (e.g., if a regression coefficient was reported, but not its test statistics).</s><s>Fourth, we calculated 'coverage', or the proportion of studypairs in which the effect of the original study was in the confidence interval of the effect of the replication study, and compared this with the expected proportion using a goodnessoffit χ 2  test.</s><s>We carried out this test on the subset, further called MA, of studypairs where both the correlation coefficient and its standard error could be computed.</s><s>Standard errors could only be computed if test statistics were r , t , or F (1, df 2 ).</s><s>The expected proportion is the sum

for more complex designs, such as multivariate interaction effects, the quantitative analysis may not provide a simple interpretation.</s><s>For subjective assessment, replication teams answered "yes" or "no" to the question "Did your results replicate the original effect?".</s><s>Also, replication teams answered two questions " How much did the key effect in the replication resemble the key effect in the original study?" and "Overall, how much did the findings in the replication resemble the findings in the original study?"</s><s>The second question assessed all findings the replication team reported, allowing for a measure that encompassed more than just the key effect.</s></p><p><s>Metaanalysis of all original study effects, and of all replication study effects .</s><s>Two randomeffects

without any predictor, one with studies' standard error as predictor, and one with standard error and discipline as predictor.</s><s>Standard error was added to examine smallstudy effects.</s><s>A positive effect of standard error on effect size indicates that studies' effect sizes are positively associated with their sample sizes.</s><s>The results of this onetailed test, also known as Egger's
