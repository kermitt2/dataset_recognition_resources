<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: A major bottleneck in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of life is the assignment of function to proteins.</s><s>While molecular experiments provide the most reliable annotation of proteins, their relatively low throughput and restricted purview have led to an increasing role for computational function prediction.</s><s>However, assessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the field remain challenging.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>We conducted the second critical assessment of functional annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to assess computational methods that automatically assign protein function.</s><s>We evaluated 126 methods from 56 research groups for their ability to predict biological functions using Gene Ontology and gene-disease associations using Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3681 proteins from 18 species.</s><s>CAFA2 featured expanded analysis compared with CAFA1, with regards to data set size, variety, and assessment metrics.</s><s>To review progress in the field, the analysis compared the best methods from CAFA1 to those of CAFA2.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>The top-performing methods in CAFA2 outperformed those from CAFA1.</s><s>This increased accuracy can be attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental annotations and improved methods for function prediction.</s><s>The assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing algorithms is ontology specific, that different performance metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions, and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological process and human phenotype ontologies.</s><s>While there was methodological improvement between CAFA1 and CAFA2, the interpretation of results and usefulness of individual methods remain context-dependent.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Accurate computer-generated functional annotations of biological macromolecules allow biologists to rapidly generate testable hypotheses about the roles that newly identified proteins play in processes or pathways.</s><s>They also allow them to reason about new species based on the observed functional repertoire associated with their genes.</s><s>However, protein function prediction is an open research problem and it is not yet clear which tools are best for predicting function.</s><s>At the same time, critically evaluating these tools and understanding the landscape of the function prediction field is a challenging task that extends beyond the capabilities of a single lab.</s></p><p><s>Assessments and challenges have a successful history of driving the development of new methods in the life sciences by independently assessing performance and providing discussion forums for the researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In 2010-2011, we organized the first critical assessment of functional annotation (CAFA) challenge to evaluate methods for the automated annotation of protein function and to assess the progress in method development in the first decade of the 2000s <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The challenge used a time-delayed evaluation of predictions for a large set of target proteins without any experimental functional annotation.</s><s>A subset of these target proteins accumulated experimental annotations after the predictions were submitted and was used to estimate the performance accuracy.</s><s>The estimated performance was subsequently used to draw conclusions about the status of the field.</s></p><p><s>The first CAFA (CAFA1) showed that advanced methods for the prediction of Gene Ontology (GO) terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> significantly outperformed a straightforward application of function transfer by local sequence similarity.</s><s>In addition to validating investment in the development of new methods, CAFA1 also showed that using machine learning to integrate multiple sequence hits and multiple data types tends to perform well.</s><s>However, CAFA1 also identified challenges for experimentalists, biocurators, and computational biologists.</s><s>These challenges include the choice of experimental techniques and proteins in functional studies and curation, the structure and status of biomedical ontologies, the lack of comprehensive systems data that are necessary for accurate prediction of complex biological concepts, as well as limitations of evaluation metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Overall, by establishing the state-of-the-art in the field and identifying challenges, CAFA1 set the stage for quantifying progress in the field of protein function prediction over time.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we report on the major outcomes of the second CAFA experiment, CAFA2, that was organized and conducted in 2013-2014, exactly 3 years after the original experiment.</s><s>We were motivated to evaluate the progress in method development for function prediction as well as to expand the experiment to new ontologies.</s><s>The CAFA2 experiment also greatly expanded the performance analysis to new types of evaluation and included new performance metrics.</s><s>By surveying the state of the field, we aim to help all direct and indirect users of computational function prediction software develop intuition for the quality, robustness, and reliability of these predictions.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Accurately annotating the function of biological macromolecules is difficult, and requires the concerted effort of experimental scientists, biocurators, and computational biologists.</s><s>Though challenging, advances are valuable: accurate predictions allow biologists to rapidly generate testable hypotheses about how proteins fit into processes and pathways.</s><s>We conducted the second CAFA challenge to assess the status of the computational function prediction of proteins and to quantify the progress in the field.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The field has moved forward</head><p><s>Three years ago, in CAFA1, we concluded that the top methods for function prediction outperform straightforward function transfer by homology.</s><s>In CAFA2, we observe that the methods for function prediction have improved compared to those from CAFA1.</s><s>As part of the CAFA1 experiment, we stored all predictions from all methods on 48,298 target proteins from 18 species.</s><s>We compared those stored predictions to the newly deposited predictions from CAFA2 on the overlapping set of benchmark proteins and CAFA1 targets.</s><s>The head-to-head comparisons among the top-five CAFA1 methods against the top-five CAFA2 methods reveal that the top CAFA2 methods outperformed all top CAFA1 methods.</s></p><p><s>Our parallel evaluation using an unchanged BLAST algorithm with data from 2011 and data from 2014 showed little difference, strongly suggesting that the improvements observed are due to methodological advances.</s><s>The lessons from CAFA1 and annual AFP-SIG during the ISMB conference, where new developments are rapidly disseminated, may have contributed to this outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation metrics</head><p><s>A universal performance assessment in protein function prediction is far from straightforward.</s><s>Although various evaluation metrics have been proposed under the framework of multi-label and structured-output learning, the evaluation in this subfield also needs to be interpretable to a broad community of researchers as well as the public.</s></p><p><s>To address this, we used several metrics in this study as each provides useful insights and complements the others.</s><s>Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of current metrics and developing better metrics remain important.</s></p><p><s>One important observation with respect to metrics is that the protein-centric and term-centric views may give different perspectives to the same problem.</s><s>For example, while in MFO and BPO we generally observe a positive correlation between the two, in CCO and HPO these different metrics may lead to entirely different interpretations of an experiment.</s><s>Regardless of the underlying cause, as discussed in "Results and discussion", it is clear that some ontological terms are predictable with high accuracy and can be reliably used in practice even in these ontologies.</s><s>In the meantime, more effort will be needed to understand the problems associated Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref> Case study on the human ADAM-TS12 gene.</s><s>Biological process terms associated with ADAM-TS12 gene in the union of the three databases by September 2014.</s><s>The entire functional annotation of ADAM-TS12 consists of 89 terms, 28 of which are shown.</s><s>Twelve terms, marked in green, are leaf terms.</s><s>This directed acyclic graph was treated as ground truth in the CAFA2 assessment.</s><s>Solid black lines provide direct "is a" or "part of" relationships between terms, while gray lines mark indirect relationships (that is, some terms were not drawn in this picture).</s><s>Predicted terms of the top-five methods and two baseline methods were picked at their optimal F max threshold.</s><s>Over-predicted terms are not shown with the statistical and computational aspects of method development.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Well-performing methods</head><p><s>We observe that participating methods usually specialize in one or few categories of protein function prediction, and have been developed with their own application objectives in mind.</s><s>Therefore, the performance rankings of methods often change from one benchmark set to another.</s><s>There are complex factors that influence the final ranking including the selection of the ontology, types of benchmark sets and evaluation, as well as evaluation metrics, as discussed earlier.</s><s>Most of our assessment results show that the performances of top-performing methods are generally comparable to each other.</s><s>It is worth noting that performance is usually better in predicting molecular function than other ontologies.</s></p><p><s>Beyond simply showing diversity in inputs, our evaluation of prediction similarity revealed that many topperforming methods are reaching this status by generating distinct predictions, suggesting that there is additional room for continued performance improvement.</s><s>Although a small group of methods could be considered as generally high performing, there is no single method that dominates over all benchmarks.</s><s>Taken together, these results highlight the potential for ensemble learning approaches in this domain.</s></p><p><s>We also observed that when provided with a chance to select a reliable set of predictions, the methods generally perform better (partial evaluation mode versus full evaluation mode).</s><s>This outcome is encouraging; it suggests that method developers can predict where their methods are particularly accurate and target them to that space.</s></p><p><s>Our keyword analysis showed that machine-learning methods are widely used by successful approaches.</s><s>Protein interactions were more overrepresented in the bestperforming methods for biological process prediction.</s><s>This suggests that predicting membership in pathways and processes requires information on interacting partners in addition to a protein's sequence features.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final notes</head><p><s>Automated functional annotation remains an exciting and challenging task, central to understanding genomic data, which are central to biomedical research.</s><s>Three years after CAFA1, the top methods from the community have shown encouraging progress.</s><s>However, in terms of raw scores, there is still significant room for improvement in all ontologies, and particularly in BPO, CCO, and HPO.</s><s>There is also a need to develop an experiment-driven, as opposed to curation-driven, component of the evaluation to address limitations for term-centric evaluation.</s><s>In the future CAFA experiments, we will continue to monitor the performance over time and invite a broad range of computational biologists, computer scientists, statisticians, and others to address these engaging problems of concept annotation for biological macromolecules through CAFA.</s></p><p><s>CAFA2 significantly expanded the number of protein targets, the number of biomedical ontologies used for annotation, the number of analysis scenarios, as well as the metrics used for evaluation.</s><s>The results of the CAFA2 experiment detail the state of the art in protein function prediction, can guide the development of new concept annotation methods, and help molecular biologists assess the relative reliability of predictions.</s><s>Understanding the function of biological macromolecules brings us closer to understanding life at the molecular level and improving human health.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Time line for the CAFA2 experiment</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,64.96,600.69,467.08,112.72" type="bitmap" /></figure>
