<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accuracy</head><p><s>Similar to previous studies on associative inference (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Zeithamova and Preston, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Armstrong et al., 2012)</ref>, we first analyzed overall group performance differences across the two major categories of trials, i.e. direct trials and indirect trials.</s><s>In direct trials, we found no significant differences between the three trial types (AB-, BC-and DE-trials), neither in patients nor in controls (patients: p = 0.091; controls: p = 0,092 Friedman-ANOVA).</s><s>Direct trials were thus pooled for further analysis.</s><s>On average, patient performance in direct trials was inferior to controls (patients: 75.6 ± 5.8 %, controls: 85.2 ± 2.8 % correct, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">2</ref>).</s><s>These differences did however not achieve significance (p = 0.071; Mann-Whitney test).</s><s>In indirect trials (AC-trials), patients showed a slightly more pronounced and significant deficit (patients: 58.1 ± 5.8, controls: 76.8 ± 3.7 % correct; p = 0.038, Mann-Whitney test).</s><s>Although these differences may suggest that performance in indirect trials may have involved computational processes that were less required in direct trials, defective memory of direct associations may have contributed to impaired overall performance in indirect trials.</s><s>We therefore conducted an additional analysis, where we calculated accuracy of those indirect trials, for which both AB-and BC-stimuli were correctly remembered in the corresponding direct trials.</s><s>With this analysis, overall group differences for indirect trials were still present, but smaller and no longer significant (patients: 67.2 ± 7.2, controls: 77.7 ± 4.8 % correct; p = 0.19, Mann-Whitney test).</s></p><p><s>Next, we took a closer look at possible performance changes across cycles.</s><s>We reasoned that repeated presentation of encoding and retrieval blocks across the four cycles of the experiment may have allowed for adjustment of behavior following individual perception of performance in initial retrieval blocks.</s><s>Indeed, performance and performance differences between groups were not constant across cycles.</s><s>In cycles 1 and 2, patients and controls showed only minor performance differences in indirect trials (cycle 1: patients: 65.0 ± 7.3 %, controls: 71.3 ± 5.3 % correct, p = 0.49 group difference; cycle 2: patients 62.5 ± 6.9 %, controls: 75.0 ± 5.5 % correct, p = 0.36 group difference, Mann-Whitney test, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">3</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that -at least in certain conditions -patients are not necessarily inferior to controls in tasks that require integration of associations in memory.</s><s>However, during the course of the experiment, controls increased their performance in indirect trials up to 80.1 ± 3.2 % in cycle 3 and 80.9 ± 4.6 % in cycle 4, while patient performance decreased to chance level (50.0 ± 10.5 % in cycle 3 and 55.0 ± 6.4 % in cycle 4, respectively, p = 0.005 and 0.015 group differences, Mann-Whitney test, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">3</ref>).</s><s>In parallel, performance in direct trials remained fairly constant across cycles, both in patients and controls.</s><s>In particular, patient performance was far above chance level in all cycles and did not drop during the course of the experiment (cycle 1: 72.5 ± 6.8 %; cycle 4: 75.8 ± 7.1 %, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">3</ref>).</s><s>In order to investigate whether the observed group differences for indirect trials in the last two cycles of the experiment mainly result from distinct changes in memory integration across cycles rather than from a deficit in associative memory, we again calculated accuracy of those indirect trials, for which both AB-and BC-stimuli were correctly remembered in the corresponding direct trials.</s><s>With this analysis, in cycles 1 and 2, performance in indirect trials was almost identical in both groups (patients: 73.8 ± 10.7, controls: 75.0 ± 6.0 %; p = 0.82, Mann-Whitney test).</s><s>By contrast, in cycles 3 and 4, performance differed significantly (patients: 60.8 ± 6.0, controls: 80.8 ± 4.3 %; p = 0.015, Mann-Whitney test).</s><s>Furthermore, we quantified the contribution of memory integration to impaired performance in indirect trials by calculating an additional measure ('Integration index').</s><s>We subtracted accuracy of direct trials from accuracy in indirect trials in each subject, separately for cycles 1 and 2 and cycles 3 and 4.

for simulation and evaluation of outcomes by integration of activated representations of past experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Barron et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, coupling between both regions may be involved in valuation and biasing of choice options during memory-guided decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gluth et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The central role of hippocampal-neocortical interactions for memory integration conversely suggests a multitude of behavioral deficits, including decision making, in patients with hippocampal dysfunction that transcend the well-investigated memory deficits for 'direct' associations.</s><s>Previous studies in patients with various neuropsychiatric disorders such as amnesic mild cognitive impairment or schizophrenia suggest that this might be the case (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gleichgerrcht et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Caceda et al., 2014 for

memory integration may contribute to more complex behavioral impairments has only rarely been investigated in neuropsychiatric patients.</s><s>In studies on subjects with schizophrenia with an associative inference paradigm that uses house-face associations, patients performed inferior to healthy controls in indirect trials, while performance in direct trials was relatively preserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Armstrong et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Both the overall pattern of results and the absolute accuracy values show remarkable similarity to the performance levels in our

relationships in a complex neurodevelopmental disorder like schizophrenia or in a neurodegenerative disorder like Alzheimer's disease.</s><s>So far, there have been no lesion studies of associative inference in human patients and only a handful of studies with related paradigms.</s><s>In a study on aged human subjects with hippocampal atrophy, performance was deficient in an acquired equivalence task, i.e. a task that assesses a subjects' ability to generalize from previously trained associations on novel associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Myers et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Similar results were found in patients with amnesic syndromes following global cerebral hypoxia, a classic lesion model for hippocampal dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Myers et al.,

equivalence yields behavioral impairments that match those observed in patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moustafa et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Our data thus provide a link between imaging studies of memory integration / inferential reasoning in healthy controls and behavioral studies in neuropsychiatric patients, by showing that damage to the hippocampus is sufficient to create a memory integration deficit that manifests in inappropriate decisions, even when memory of individual associations is relatively preserved.</s></p><p><s>Our results complement recent imaging evidence that hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration are not constant, but rather modulated by contextual factors, e.g. the number of stimulus repetitions or blocked vs. mixed presentation of AB-and BC-stimuli during encoding blocks of associative inference tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Zeithamova et al. 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schlichting et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Memory integration may occur by the time an AC-decision is required and may be achieved by retrieving and integrating individual AB-and BCassociations ('recombination at retrieval', <ref type="bibr"

tasks <ref type="bibr">(Schlichting et al., 2015)</ref>, i.e. the brain region that was affected in all our patients.</s><s>By using a visual associative inference paradigm that inspired the design of our study, it has further been shown that activity in hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex during encoding of individual associations relates to later ACinference <ref type="bibr">(Zeithamova et al. 2010</ref>).</s><s>Notably, it was activity in BC-trials that showed this effect, suggesting that stimuli in BC-trials triggered hippocampal pattern completion mechanisms that reactivated preceding overlapping AB-representations <ref type="bibr">(Zeithamova et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In a subsequent study, the degree of reactivation of AB-representations in anterior MTL-regions during encoding in BC-trials directly predicted AC-inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Zeithamova et al., 2012b)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with the idea that integration at encoding reduces processing delays at retrieval, it has been shown that neural activity in hippocampal CA1 is more similar between BC-and AC-trials when the reaction time in AC-trials is short <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schlichting et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The results from our explorative correlation analyses are compatible with these findings and suggest that memory integration does not occur automatically, but may also be modulated by the repetition of encoding-retrieval cycles as contextual factor.</s><s>The differential correlations between indirect and direct trials at the beginning and at the end of our experiment must however be interpreted with caution, as the sample size of our control group was small.</s><s>Weaker but relevant correlations between memory of direct associations and inferential decisions may have remained undetected.</s><s>It would thus be premature to suggest a major strategy change for memory integration across the cycles of our experiment -in addition to likely practice effects.</s><s>Furthermore, recombination at retrieval and integrative encoding are not mutually exclusive and can both be recruited during a single task <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zeithamova et

mechanisms, with only relative predominance of one or the other.</s><s>Together with the changes in integration index, our results may thus indicate an increasing tendency of control subjects to form integrated ABC-representations during or following encoding in anticipation of future AC-decisions in indirect trials, but they do not rule out a significant contribution of recombination at retrieval.</s><s>While average performance of patients in indirect trials was -as expected -inferior to controls, the pattern of accuracy across cycles is surprising.</s><s>Despite increasing familiarity with the task, patients showed less efficient behavior with deterioration of accuracy across cycles.</s><s>It may be speculated that the underlying mechanism was the same as in controls, i.e.</s></p><p><s>the formation of integrated representations, presumably reflecting a still intact cognitive routine for new behavioral contexts that is however prone to fail, since it depends on an intact hippocampus.</s><s>It will thus be important to investigate whether it is possible to revert the increasing impairment by creating conditions that discourage reliance on integrated representations, e.g. by providing feedback about deficient performance during the experiment.</s><s>The dynamics of our patients' deficits further suggest that the role of the hippocampus within networks for memory integration is dependent on contextual factors.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, in some conditions, inferential decisions may sufficiently be supported by networks outside the damaged

the findings reported here suggest that lesions to the medial temporal lobe can impair performance in tasks requiring memory integration.</s><s>The magnitude of behavioral deficits may depend on whether a particular behavioral context promotes the formation of integrated representations in anticipation of future decisions.</s><s>It remains to be determined how this deficit translates into real-world decision making in neuropsychiatric patients and whether strategies that encourage less hippocampus-dependent mechanisms of memory integration optimize behavior in patients with disorders
