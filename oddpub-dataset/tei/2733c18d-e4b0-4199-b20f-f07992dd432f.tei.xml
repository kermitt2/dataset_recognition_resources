<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporal Association of Somatic Mutations Between Diagnosis and</head><p><s>Relapse.</s><s>A series of driver events are probably necessary for a cell to become leukemic.</s><s>However, having acquired this set of lesions might not be sufficient for (or even impair the ability of) the leukemic blasts to propagate relapse after chemotherapy treatment.</s><s>For example, a driver mutation that is found in both time points could be ubiquitously necessary for proliferation or survival of the leukemia cells.</s><s>However, it is also possible that this mutation might be important at diagnosis, but redundant in the relapse, and its persistence during relapse merely represents the common cell-of-origin.</s><s>Conversely, time-point-restricted events might allude to alterations that confer selective advantage only under certain circumstances, for example after treatment with chemotherapy.</s><s>We thus selected likely pathogenic somatic events that were recurrent in at least two paired patients and classified them to either diagnosis-restricted, relapse-restricted, or shared between time points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In agreement with a recent report <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>, we found relapserestricted mutations in MSH6 (n = 4), MLH1 (n = 2),

number of SNVs (1225), possibly because of a synergistic effect of mutations both in MSH6 and SETD2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>Although recent reports described enrichment of NT5C2 mutations in up to 19% of relapsed ALLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>, none were detected in our cohort.</s></p><p><s>Aside from the CRLF2 rearrangements, we found alterations that were predominantly shared between diagnosis and relapse in IKZF1 (12 of 14), HIST1 (7 of 9), ETV6 (7 of 10), RB1 (5 of 5), USP9X (3 of 3), and EBF1 (2 of 2).</s><s>Contrary to our expectations, JAK mutations, highly enriched in DS-ALL, were often lost at relapse: four of seven of JAK2 mutations and two of four JAK1 mutations were restricted to diagnosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>This finding prompted us to examine in more depth the dynamics of ALL subclones with signaling mutations.</s></p><p><s>The Dynamics of Signaling Mutations in DS-ALL.</s><s>As been observed by us and others, the majority (12 of 17, 70%) of CRLF2 pos ALLs had an activating mutation in components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.</s><s>We used the improved sensitivity (SI Materials and Methods) achieved by targeted sequencing to delineate the dynamics between diagnosis and relapse of major and rare mutated alleles of signaling genes.</s><s>In the eight paired patients where mutations in JAK1/2 were present at diagnosis, the dominant clone with the mutation was either undetected after therapy or, in a single case (DSALLG8), was diminished significantly [variant allele frequency (VAF) 0.8%] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, in the three patients with JAK2 mutations at relapse, we detected the surviving clone at diagnosis as a minor clone (VAF 1-5%).</s><s>An exception was patient DSALLB9, in whom JAK1 was present in the first relapse as a subclone (VAF 5.2%) and subsequently disappeared at the second relapse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>IL7R and CRLF2 SNVs and insertion/deletions (indels), which activate the receptors by mediating ligand independent dimerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>, are also common in CRLF2 pos ALLs, and in our cohort we found two patients with the IL7R mutation (p.S185C) and two patients with the CRLF2 mutation (p.F232C) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>These mutations were shared between diagnosis and relapse in two patients (DSALLG11, DSALLB5), or relapse-restricted in one patient (DSALLB1).</s><s>Thus, the data suggest that mutations in the JAK-STAT genes are secondary events and that clones harboring these mutations are mostly unstable.</s><s>RAS mutations displayed different dynamics between diagnosis and relapse.</s><s>Overall, we spotted mutations in KRAS and NRAS in 11 paired patients, clones harboring mutations in these genes were detected in 6 (24%) patients at diagnosis, in 9 (36%) patients R1 relapse, and in 4 (80%) patients at R2 relapse.</s><s>Interestingly, all six paired patients with RAS mutations at diagnosis were CRLF2 neg and in all but one patient, KRAS/NRAS were also mutated at relapse.</s><s>Moreover, in all patients with clones harboring RAS mutations that were present at both diagnosis and relapse, the relapse emerged from the same clone that was identified in the diagnosis sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>In four CRLF2 pos patients and one CRLF2 neg patient, either the primary (R1) or the second relapse (R2) emerged from RAS-mutated clones that were undetectable in the preceding time point.</s><s>This relative durability of clones with RAS mutation could be explained by increased resistance to chemotherapy, as has been suggested by Oshima et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Overall, we observed mutations in components of JAK-STAT or RAS pathways in 49 (75%) sequenced exomes from 25 (80%) DS-ALL patients (including both 21 paired and 4 diagnosis-only samples).</s><s>However, a heterogeneous clonal population, with respect to the mutated signaling effectors, often presented at the same leukemia sample.</s><s>Because leukemogenesis is assumed to be a process of gradual accumulation of mutations, we asked whether selection of clones with specific signaling oncogenes might reflect the background biology of the tumor.</s><s>To this end, we designed a three-level graph (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), where the vertices correspond to mutated signaling genes, the edges correspond to co-occurrence in a single patient, and the levels reflect the time point (i.e., DX, R1, R2).</s><s>Concretely, intralevel edges signify coexistence at the same sample, whereas cross-level edges reflect for each gene (vertex) in level x, what were the observed mutations in the succeeding levels (time points) for each patient.</s><s>We placed cross-level edges between the same gene regardless whether the relapse emerged from the same clone or from a different clone harboring mutation in that same gene.</s><s>This graphic representation allows us to evaluate the general landscape of signaling in DS-ALL.</s><s>It is clear that there are samples in which subclones with mutations in different signaling genes coexists (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>In addition, there are cases where leukemias present with JAK mutations at diagnosis can switch to a RAS mutation, but we have never observed the opposite, suggesting the dominance of RAS signaling.</s></p><p><s>USP9X Is Disrupted in CRLF2 pos ALLs.</s><s>As mentioned above, we found in our cohort several genes with mutations shared between diagnosis and relapse.</s><s>One of these genes was USP9X, which was mutated in 4 of the 17 patients with CRLF2 rearrangements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In three of the patients, we found focal chromosomal deletions that involved the USP9X locus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), whereas in the fourth patient we detected a frameshift mutation (p.F1115Lfs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, in red).</s><s>In patient DSALLG14, the deletion extended from exon 32 of USP9X to exon 2 of its nearest downstream gene, DDX3X.</s><s>This deletion could result in a chimeric transcript USP9X-DDX3X, a fusion that was recently reported in CRLF2 pos ALLs with a similar interstitial deletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>However, the nature of USP9X deletions in the two other patients was different.</s><s>In case DSALLA2, the deletion was of 5.3 MB, and stretched until the downstream gene ZNF674, whereas in patient DSALLB7, an upstream deletion of 200 kb that extended to USP9X gene body resulted in reduced USP9X expression at both diagnosis and relapse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5B</ref>).</s><s>The observations that the VAF of USP9X in the four cases corresponded to the major clone persisting at relapse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5F</ref>) are suggestive of an early event in leukemia genesis.</s></p><p><s>USP9X is a deubquitinating enzyme that has been suggested to have a protumorigenic role by preventing the ubiquitinmediated degradation of prosurvival and growth proteins, such as MCL2 and ERG <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, increased expression of USP9X was proposed to mediate resistance to glucocorticoids in ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we were surprised to identify loss-of-function mutations in USP9X.</s><s>Importantly, even the predicted USP9X-DDX3X in-frame fusion protein loses the deubuiquitination (UCH) domain of USP9X.</s><s>To further validate these findings, we explored publicly available data.</s><s>Additional mutations identified in USP9X in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr"

mutations are frameshift or missense mutations within the UCH domain, suggesting loss-of-function.</s><s>Similar to our findings, the USP9X-mutated BCP-ALLs described by Oshima et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> carried JAK2 and JAK3 activating mutations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5E</ref>) (and hence, are likely to be CRLF2 pos ).</s><s>We further analyzed RNA-seq data from the pediatric cancer (PeCAN) genomic database of childhood cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>We compared USP9X expression to CRLF2 expression in Ph-like ALL (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>We found that a subset of 7 samples of the 28 CRLF2 pos ALLs (all classified as Ph-like) demonstrated markedly diminished expression of USP9X, whereas USP9X expression was preserved in all CRLF2 neg samples (P &lt; 10 −4 , Fisher's exact test).</s><s>Additionally, four samples in the PeCAN database were annotated with the USP9X-DDX3X chimeric transcript; of these, three were among the CRLF2 rearranged group.</s><s>Taken together, these data suggest that loss of USP9X by genomic aberrations is a recurrent event in ALL and may be in up to 25% of CRLF2 pos ALLs.</s><s>Buffering of JAK-STAT Signaling by Loss-of-Function of USP9X.</s><s>USP9X was recently shown to positively regulate JAK-STAT signaling by binding to JAK2, thereby enhancing JAK phosphorylation via removal of a competing ubiquitin group <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of USP9X was shown to reduce JAK signaling.</s><s>Loss of USP9X in CRLF2 pos ALLs, thought to be driven by enhanced JAK-STAT signaling, is therefore counterintuitive.</s><s>Recent studies have suggested that B-lineage lymphocytes have limited capacity to tolerate signaling.</s><s>For example, up-regulation of phosphatases was reported to be important for lymphoid transformation by BCR-ABL <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, experimental ablation of JAK2 was shown to accelerate leukemic transformation by BCR-ABL <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>.</s><s>We thus hypothesized that loss of USP9X promote survival of CRLF2 pos cells by restricting JAK signaling.</s></p><p><s>To test this hypothesis, we simultaneously overexpressed CRLF2 and JAK2 R683G in a BCP-ALL cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</s><s>Three days after transduction, 96% of the cells expressed surface CRLF2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6A</ref>).</s><s>The cells were then treated with increasing amounts USP9X specific inhibitor BRD0476 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref> in the presence of the human cytokine TSLP (10 ng/mL).</s><s>After 2 wk of treatment, most of the cells did not express CRLF2, demonstrating a selective advantage for the nontransduced cells.</s><s>This observation reflects the toxicity of hypersignaling by mutated JAK2.</s><s>Treatment with USP9X inhibitor increased the fraction of CRLF2 pos cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>), but did not alter the fraction of

reduction in STAT5 phosphorylation (with no effect on STAT3 phosphorylation) was achieved even at low concentration of ruxolitinib (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results suggest that loss of USP9X in CRLF2 pos ALL cells may promote survival by buffering the intensity of JAK signaling.</s></p><p><s>Because USP9X interacts with both JAK1 and JAK2 (Fig.

negatively impact the survival of children with DS-ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>By focusing on DS-ALL unique leukemias and on matched diagnosis and relapse samples, our goal was to decipher the pathogenesis of relapse of DS-ALLs aiming at improved therapy.</s><s>We discovered that the genomic landscape differs significantly between the two major subtypes of DS-ALLs.</s><s>CRLF2 neg DS-ALLs are characterized by enhanced RAS signaling coupled by mutations in chromatin remodeling genes, in particular CREBBP.</s><s>This genetic architecture is similar to hyperdiploid ALL, in which the cooperation between these two genetic lesions is thought to drive relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast CRLF2 pos DS-ALLs are characterized by high dynamics of proliferative signaling.</s><s>Enhanced JAK-STAT signaling mediated by the increased expression of CRLF2, the receptor to TSLP, is an early event during the evolution of DS-ALL, as is evident by its high allelic frequency and its stability between diagnosis and relapse.</s><s>However, it also endows the leukemic cells with vulnerabilities, as evident by the presence of mutations in USP9X that attenuate JAK-STAT signaling, by the subclonal nature of downstream JAK mutations, and by decreased prevalence of JAK-activating mutation in relapse.</s><s>These results have implications to Ph-like ALLs in patients without DS and for the incorporation of JAK inhibitors for treatment of ALL.</s><s>Analysis of our cohort and publicly available databases revealed recurrent loss-of-function mutations in USP9X.</s><s>This finding was surprising because USP9X is perceived mainly as an oncogene in solid tumors and in BCP-ALL and B-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>.</s><s>Because USP9X is a deubiquitinase, its effect on tumor growth should largely be dependent on its substrates, which probably explains its ascribed role as tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>.</s><s>In a recent report describing 17 children with germ-line mutations in USP9X, one child developed ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>; however, this single case is not enough to define USP9X as an ALL tumor suppressor.</s></p><p><s>USP9X was also reported to enhance JAK2 signaling, as well as signaling of immune receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the loss of USP9X activity in up to 25% of CRLF2 pos ALLs, a subtype of leukemia believed to be driven by enhanced JAK-STAT signaling, is intriguing.</s><s>We show here that USP9X loss may promote the survival of leukemic cells by restricting the intensity of JAK2 and JAK1 signaling.</s><s>Importantly, low-dose ruxolitinib, a JAK2/ JAK1 inhibitor currently in clinical trials for CRLF2 pos ALLs, also increased the survival of leukemic cells transduced with CRLF2and JAK2 R683G , the most common JAK2 mutation in ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>This observation suggests the need for high-dose ruxolitinib in these trials.</s></p><p><s>Our discoveries are consistent with recent findings that B cells, including leukemic B-cell precursors, can tolerate a relatively narrow range of signaling, possibly reflecting the evolutionary important autoimmunity checkpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>.</s><s>Although signaling is required for their proliferation, enhanced signaling could cause their demise.</s><s>The increased lymphoid sensitivity to hypersignaling may also explain the intriguing observation that the V617F strongactivating JAK2 mutation, characterizing myeloproliferative neoplasms, is never found in ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>The buffering effect of loss of USP9X in CRLF2 pos ALLs is, therefore, similar to the buffering effect of increased expression of phosphatases observed in BCR-ABL ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, a high expression of the phosphatase PTPRC (CD45) was also recently reported to be associated with P2RY8-CRLF2 ALLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Elimination of USP9X may promote ALL through other mechanisms yet to be discovered.</s><s>The very early occurrence of USP9X loss-of-function mutations and their presence in other subtypes of ALL [including T-ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>] are consistent with additional tumor-suppressive mechanisms.</s><s>In fact, it is also possible that the selection of activating JAK-STAT mutations may have occurred to compensate for the loss of USP9X.</s><s>Hematopoietic specific elimination of Usp9x in mice results in differentiation block of both T and B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, mutations in USP9X may therefore participate in the leukemogenesis process by arresting B-cell differentiation similar to the mutations in other B-celldifferentiation transcription factors.</s><s>Clearly, additional studies are needed to clarify the leukemogenic role of USP9X loss-offunction mutations.</s></p><p><s>A major goal of our study was to decipher the mechanisms of relapse of DS-ALL.</s><s>Relapse reflects two cooperating processes: the primary leukemogenic process driving the growth and survival of leukemic cells and the selection pressure imposed by frontline therapy.</s><s>Similar to other studies of relapsed ALL <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59)</ref>, we observed increased RAS activation in relapse.</s><s>Indeed, it has been proposed that RAS may mediate resistance to chemotherapy.</s><s>This hypothesis is questioned by inspection of the clonal dynamics between diagnosis and relapse.</s><s>Both in our cohort and in published studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60)</ref> the expanded clones at relapse often carry a different RAS mutation than clones detected in diagnosis.</s><s>This phenomenon is consistent with a general role of signaling in enhancing growth and proliferation of leukemic cells and not with resistance to chemotherapy.</s></p><p><s>The subclonal nature and the complex dynamics of CRLF2 pos leukemia cells carrying either JAK-STAT or RAS suggest that inhibition of a single signaling pathway will select for leukemic clones driven by signaling of the other pathway.</s><s>Our genomic data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) also suggest that signaling by either JAK-STAT or RAS is essential for leukemia growth.</s><s>Therefore, we suggest that JAK inhibitors should be combined with MEK inhibitors for treatment of DS-ALL and CRLF2 pos Ph-like ALLs.</s></p><p><s>Mutations selected by chemotherapy, either from preexisting subclones or by the enhanced genomic instability, are likely to be enriched in relapse specimens.</s><s>The relapse-enriched mutations found in our DS-ALL cohort are similar to those found in other ALL subtypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59)</ref>.</s><s>Intriguingly, however, we have found no NT5C2 mutations in our cohort.</s><s>Previous studies identified NT5C2 mutations in 8-45% of the relapses of BCP-ALLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>.</s><s>Mutations in NT5C2 were associated with early relapses, whereas in our cohort the median time to relapse was relatively long, 1,071 d (range 375-2,226 d).</s><s>NT5C2 mutations are thought to provide resistance to 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), a key drug in the treatment of ALL.</s><s>Instead, we identified relapsespecific mutations in MMR genes in 15% of our patients.</s><s>The MMR pathway is important for repair of damage caused by drugs, such as 6MP, and changes in MMR gene expression have been reported in association with resistance to 6MP <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>.</s><s>It will be interesting to see if different mutations conferring resistance to 6MP are mutually exclusive in relapse ALL.</s></p><p><s>Strikingly, most of relapsed ALLs, in our and in published studies, are not characterized by a major clone carrying a relapsespecific chemotherapy-resistant mutation.</s><s>This finding implies that relapse may be often facilitated by one of the early founding mutations that initiated the primary leukemia.</s><s>This hypothesis is supported by the strong prognostic significance of certain mutations found already as a major clone at diagnosis.</s><s>Two such good examples, IKZF1 aberrations and CRLF2 rearrangements that often co-occur in the same leukemias <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref>, predict worse prognosis and, as clearly shown in our data, are usually shared between diagnosis and relapse samples.</s></p><p><s>A recent experimental study, modeling diagnosis and relapse ALL, suggests that relapse initiates from dormant leukemic cells that survive by adhering to protective bone-marrow stroma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref>.</s><s>According to this model, initial chemotherapy eliminates the bulk of leukemic cells (e.g., JAK and RAS mutated cells).</s><s>The slow dividing cells are eliminated by the continuous maintenance therapy (6MP and methotrexate).</s><s>In relapsing patients a few residual cells remain dormant on stroma.</s><s>Creation of full-blown leukemia depends on proliferative signaling (e.g., RAS).</s></p><p><s>IKZF1 mutations have been shown to promote adherence to bone-marrow stromal cells and therefore, through this mechanism, may promote dormancy during complete remission and relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, targeting IKZF1 by, for example, casein kinase II <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref> or FAK inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>, may be useful in targeting this dormancy stage.</s><s>Similarly, we speculate that leukemic cells carrying CRLF2 rearrangements-and, hence, expressing the TSLP receptor-may survive chemotherapy during complete remission by interacting with TSLP-producing cells in the bonemarrow niche.</s><s>The experimental examination of this hypothesis is challenging, because mouse TSLP is not reactive with the human TSLP receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref>.</s><s>The hypothesis suggests that targeting TSLP [for example, by the novel anti-TSLP antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref>] or the TSLP receptor [by for example, CRLF2 antibodies or CAR-T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70)</ref>] may be a useful additional therapy-better than JAK inhibition-to prevent relapse in patients with DS and sporadic CRLF2 pos ALL.</s></p></div>
