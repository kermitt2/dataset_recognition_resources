<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Preterm birth and low infant birth weight are among the leading causes of neonatal and early childhood morbidity and mortality in

target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The rising rates of PTB and LBW in LMICs underscore the importance of identifying targeted interventions that prevent these birth outcomes and subsequent child morbidity and mortality.</s><s>However, the wide range of biological, environmental, and social risk factors complicates identifying preventive interventions for PTB and LBW.</s><s>This study contributes to the limited evidence related to environmental causes of PTB and LBW by demonstrating that lack of household WASH infrastructure and social factors, like crime and harassment of women and girls, are risk factors for adverse birth outcomes in women in LMICs.</s><s>In particular, this study uses a large, nationally representative cohort of Indian women to demonstrate the importance of the lack of access to nearby water sources, lack of access to a toilet, crime, and harassment as risk factors for PTB and LBW.</s><s>Additionally, the findings suggest that gender norms that sanction harassment of women and girls and place the burden of household water fetching on women are key determinants of vulnerability to PTB and LBW among Indian women.</s></p><p><s>The lack of water and sanitation in the household forces women to navigate challenging, and even personally threatening social and environmental public conditions to fetch water and to find a safe, private place to defecate, bathe, or manage menstruation, leading to psychosocial stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref>.</s><s>Our findings reinforce evidence from two prior studies that open defecation, shared sanitation, and infrequent latrine use increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes in Indian and Nigerian women, but provides new potential explanations for the mechanism of these associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Our results suggest a role for both physical and psychosocial stress as mechanisms for adverse birth outcomes.</s><s>We found that increased time daily spent fetching household water increased women's risk of a LBW outcome.</s><s>Spending over two hours per day carrying water from sources outside of the home may increase the risk for injury, physical exhaustion, and maternal and fetal nutrient restriction, or psychosocial stress, depression or anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Work itself is not necessarily dangerous for pregnant women, although physical labor, standing for many hours per day, working an unusually high number of hours per day, occupational fatigue, and having many domestic dependents with no domestic support increase PTB and LBW risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</s><s>Regardless, this finding suggests reducing the water- fetching burden could reduce LBW prevalence in Indian pregnant women, a condition resolved by providing a reliable household water source.</s><s>Open defecation and using a shared latrine within a woman's building or compound were also associated with higher odds of LBW and PTB, respectively, compared to having a private household toilet.</s><s>Lack of access to a private toilet forces women to cope with urination, defecation, and menstruation needs in public areas, which increases the amount of time they could experience harassment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>The time and energy spent seeking a safe, private place to open defecate could increase the risk of LBW through physical stress, injury, or fatigue.</s><s>Due to the proximity of compound-shared latrines, this relationship with PTB is not likely due to physical stress, unless women relying on shared latrines use them infrequently (only 2% of our sample population reported using a compound-shared latrine) and experience similar exposures as women who rely on open defecation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52]</ref>.</s><s>The infrequent use of latrines in India is due, in part, to the stigma associated with handling feces <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, there may be confounding socioeconomic or cultural factors associated with the use of a shared latrine.</s><s>For example, in urban Nigeria where sharing a sanitation facility was also found to be a risk factor for PTB, shared sanitation was used as an indicator of poor housing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, sharing a within-compound latrine requires cooperation among families in maintaining those latrines, and this association might reflect stress from negotiating latrine management relationships or increased workload for women in maintaining shared latrines.</s><s>Oddly, the relationship between sharing public or community latrines and PTB trended in the opposite direction.</s><s>An extensive array of factors (e.g.</s><s>urban/rural geography, wealth, crime) were examined and ruled out as confounders or modifiers of this effect.</s><s>Our theory is that while reliance upon public or community latrines does cause stress to women <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, perhaps it significantly alleviates the stressors that trigger PTB.</s><s>For example, public latrine users may bear less responsibility to clean and maintain infrastructure or experience less social conflict over their upkeep <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Further research is needed to understand the underlying reason for the association between shared latrine use and PTB in the Indian context.</s></p><p><s>Our findings demonstrate that poor community-level social conditions are independently associated with both PTB and LBW outcomes, regardless of household WASH conditions, and modify the impact of WASH access on those outcomes.</s><s>Women who reported that genderbased harassment was common in their community had higher odds of PTB and LBW, and those who reported issues with local crime (i.e., an attack/threat, break-in, or theft) were trending towards statistically higher odds of PTB.</s><s>This expands the evidence in LMICs on the association between maternal stress and birth outcomes beyond intimate partner violence <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref>.</s><s>Although harassment and crime (often perpetrated by strangers) are different from violence committed by an intimate partner, both forms of abuse lead to increased levels of psychosocial stress, which is a known risk factor for PTB and LBW <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>More research is needed to better understand the impact of harassment on maternal stress and adverse birth outcomes, especially in areas where harassment towards women is common and often considered socially acceptable <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To elucidate the mechanisms through which sources of physical stress and psychosocial stress affect birth outcomes, we examined the interaction between WASH access and a variety of social factors.</s><s>We found trends suggesting that fetching water outside the household and open defecation were associated with adverse birth outcomes only when community-level crime and gender-based harassment were common, respectively.</s><s>The effect size for time to a primary drinking water source on PTB grew with increases in one-way walk time compared to women with a household source among women who reported crime, but had a null effect on women who did not report crime in their community.</s><s>The effect size for harassment on PTB was 33% larger for women sharing a building/compound latrine or practicing open defecation compared to women with private sanitation, suggesting lack of sanitation increases women's vulnerability to harassment.</s><s>These relationships were not statistically implicated, due, in part, to small sample sizes for some WASH categories caused by subgroup analysis.</s><s>Effect sizes for harassment and LBW did not vary across sanitation categories, suggesting that physical stress or open defecation-related risks (other than harassment) contribute to fetal growth restriction.</s><s>Although coping with uneven terrain, monsoon conditions, and wildlife may further contribute to the set of stressors experienced by women who open defecate, ultimately harassment plays a dominant role in how sanitation affects birth outcomes in this study.</s></p><p><s>We found effect modification by collective efficacy of sanitation for PTB as well as trends that suggested that collective efficacy modified the effect of water fetching on LBW.</s><s>Specifically, using a within-compound shared latrine was a risk factor for PTB among women who relied on their community to resolve water problems (an indicator of collective efficacy), but not among women who solved problems within their own family.</s><s>This finding was unexpected, but has two possible explanations.</s><s>First, it could indicate unmeasured benefits from support by one's family in managing a shared latrine.</s><s>Family-level support could reduce the likelihood of depressive symptoms in women, and therefore likelihood of PTB <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58]</ref>, or it could represent better marital relationships and better access to care <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref> and a lower likelihood of domestic violence <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[60]</ref>.</s><s>Second, women who relied on their community to resolve water problems may be an indicator of women living in communities with more water problems instead of an indicator of collective efficacy.</s><s>In a previous study on the measurement of social capital, it was found that questions about collective action were correlated with negative community attributes due to the way the question was asked <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[61]</ref>.</s><s>This is a limitation of the study since we do not have the capacity to change the way the question was asked.</s><s>Similarly, the association between water fetching and LBW occurred only among women who solved problems with their community rather than their own family, potentially reflecting unmeasured benefits of family support for water access.</s></p><p><s>Additional limitations of our study, beyond power to conduct subgroup analysis, include the use of self-reported birth outcomes, which may be subject to recall or courtesy bias, and limited information on women's social experiences related to water and sanitation.</s><s>Despite the data limitations, this is the only data set would allow us to examine environmental and social aspects of WASH access and birth outcomes.</s><s>Another limitation was the lack of information on potential maternal confounders, such as maternal BMI and reproductive tract infections.</s><s>Alternative mechanisms associated with unsafe WASH access that could explain our findings include higher risks of malarial, helminthic, or diarrheal infections due to increased contact with public soils and surface waters, or contact with environmental chemical pollutants.</s><s>Additionally, women with limited WASH access may practice unsafe hygiene behaviors that increase their risk for intrauterine infection by foreign microbes (e.g.</s><s>Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida spp. or Mycoplasma spp.) that can stimulate myometrium contractions and/or the rupture of chorioamniotic membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">62]</ref>.</s><s>Information on these health conditions were not available in this dataset.</s><s>Gender-based harassment may have been underreported <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[63]</ref>, but we believe this would be non-differential misclassification and would not affect our findings.</s><s>Caste may have been an important confounder, but we could not adjust for caste without excluding a large number of participants who may be from socially-marginalized groups.</s><s>Last, this observational study cannot confirm causality and is vulnerable to bias and residual confounding.</s></p><p><s>Maternal psychosocial stress, anxiety, and depression-due to a combination of environmental and social factors-are preventable risk factors for PTB and LBW.</s><s>In HICs, stress has been linked to domestic conditions like unemployment, poverty, and domestic violence, as well as community-level social conflict and environmental resource deprivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There is very little research on stress risk factors and maternal reproductive health outcomes in LMICs, although physical and psychosocial stress is an omnipresent part of daily life where extreme levels of poverty require households to cooperate in sharing infrastructure, like water sources and toilets.</s><s>Women's ability to meet sanitation needs is limited by both domestic labor constraints and by capacity to find places outside the home that are safe and private, and gaining access to a latrine may not eliminate stress, so much as exchange one set of stressors for others <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Based on our findings, there is a need to more closely examine the pathways through which lack of WASH access and harassment interact to impact maternal stress and, subsequently, birth outcomes.</s><s>Additionally, interventions that build social capital and change social norms related to gender-based causes of maternal stress in the context of WASH behaviors need to be evaluated, especially in locations with high levels of gender inequity.</s></p></div>
