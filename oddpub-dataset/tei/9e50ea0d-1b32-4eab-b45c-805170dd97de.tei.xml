to gain new insights on the emergence of transiently spatiotemporal structured networks among segregated brain regions by examining a whole-brain network model using a very general neural mass model known as the normal form of a Hopf bifurcation (also known as Landau-Stuart Oscillators), which is the canonical model for studying the transition from noisy to oscillatory dynamics <ref type="bibr"

target="#b27">28</ref> by studying the whole-brain network dynamics, i.e. by investigating how those local noisy oscillators interact, and how the emerging whole-brain network activity relates to fMRI resting state dynamics.</s><s>Within this model, each node of the network is modeled by a normal Hopf bifurcation, with an intrinsic frequency ω i in the 0.04-0.07</s><s>Hz band (i = 1,

of each node i is determined by its phase, ϕ i (t), and the interaction between nodes depends both on the structural couplings and the phase difference between the nodes.</s><s>The model has only two types of control parameters, namely: one single global parameter, G, that represents the global scaling of the anatomical connectivity matrix, and the bifurcation parameters a j for each node (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and methods for the general structure and strategy of the brain network model).</s></p><p><s>Maximal metastability at the optimal working point of

were able to distinguish the origin of resting activity between the two hypothesized scenarios, namely: 1) noisy excursions at the edge of a critical bifurcation <ref type="bibr"

synchronizations of the underlying local oscillatory dynamics through the underlying anatomical SC connections.</s><s>We define metastability as the standard deviation of synchrony at the network level described by order parameter R(t), where R(t) measures the phase uniformity and varies between 0 for a fully desynchronized network and 1 for a fully synchronized network (see methods and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>The present model is able to describe both types of dynamics, and the smooth transitions from one to the other, i.e. the transition from noisy to oscillatory dynamics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In order to distinguish the dynamical scenario, we investigated the capabilities of the model for fitting the grand average FC and also the time dependent characteristics of the RSN as reflected in the FCD in the different dynamical working regions (i.e. as a function of the

bifurcation, i.e. for bifurcation parameter a, at the edge of zero on the negative side, such that the oscillators remain damped still.</s><s>In this region not only the correlation between the empirical and simulated FC is maximized, but also the statistics of the rapid switching between FC(t) across time (FCD) is minimized in Kolmogorov-Smirnov sense, and the level of metastability of the

is important, because until now, brain network models have always been fitted with the grand average FC -but see also the work of Hansen and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We would like to remark that Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> characterizes some of the bifurcation behaviour of the whole system.</s><s>Indeed, the metastability for

properties of the full network dynamics.</s></p><p><s>Perhaps most importantly, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the brain network model shows maximal metastability at the optimal working point of the model (a = 0 and G = 2.85), where the metastability is reflecting the variability of the synchronization between different nodes, i.e. the fluctuations of the states of phase configurations as a function of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Further characterisation of these results is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> which

optimizing the working point the model to fit the empirical data (compare the distributions in row 3 and compare plots for FCD and FC fitting in row 1).</s></p><p><s>Dynamical core: contribution of individual brain regions to dynamics.</s><s>In order to obtain information about the dynamical characteristics of each single brain area and to generate a heterogeneous brain network model (i.e. with different dynamics at each node), we optimized each single bifurcation parameter a j independently by fitting for each value of global coupling G the spectral characteristics of the simulated and empirical BOLD signals at each brain area (see Methods).</s><s>The main results are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, where Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref> shows the evolution of the fitting of the FC and FCD statistics as a function of G.</s><s>For large enough value of the global coupling a good fitting of both is obtained, i.e. large correlation between the empirical and simulated grand average FC and low difference in the statistics of the empirical and simulated FCD (Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance).</s><s>Please note that Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref> is generated in a different way than Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref> (which uses only the optimum fit a = 0 for all regions and G = 2.85).</s><s>Instead, in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>, for each G we optimize the bifurcation value, a, for each region (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>As can be seen at a critical value of G, the bifurcation values remain the same, only scaled.</s><s>Thus the FCD fit in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref> will asymptote as G increases.</s></p><p><s>For optimizing a j values, we use a greedy optimisation strategy, where we iteratively increase or decrease the a j value according to the local power of the signal in a given region j.</s><s>Greedy algorithms exploit local optima, but often approximate optimal solutions well in reasonable time and produce good results as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>.</s><s>The local bifurcation parameters for each region for the uncoupled network (i.e.</s><s>G = 0) and for the optimal coupling (G = 5.4) can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>.</s><s>If the network is uncoupled, each single brain area fitted the spectral characteristics of the empirical BOLD signals in a very homogeneous way by local bifurcations parameters at the edge of the local Hopf bifurcation, i.e. at zero.</s><s>When the brain network is coupled, the "true" intrinsic local dynamics for the profile of optimal local bifurcation parameters a j observed at that point that fit the local empirical BOLD characteristics and the global quantities FC, FCD and metastability (Fig. <ref type="figure"

target="#fig_5">6</ref>.</s><s>We found that the dynamical core within this parcellation consisted of eight lateralised brain regions: medial orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and transverse temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere, and caudal middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, precuneus cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex and transverse temporal gyrus in the left hemisphere.</s><s>Those nodes working at the edge of the bifurcation are highlighted as a "dynamical core" whose perturbations can propagate in an optimal way to the rest of the

fitting process for brain network models more complex than fitting with the grand average FC, for which a Pearson correlation across empirical and simulated FC matrices is sufficient.</s></p><p><s>We have addressed this issue through a systematic fitting approach of the random process in FCD to the empirical data.</s><s>The conjunction of using sophisticated fitting and systematic parameter analysis allowed us to test the mechanistic hypotheses underlying the resting state, i.e. whether the brain at rest operates close to the edge of a bifurcation and/or occupies a metastable state.</s><s>Both scenarios can be mechanistically realized by non-linearly coupling Hopf bifurcators <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Hopf oscillators have been used previously in

frequencies are significantly slower and thus permit the neglect of the time delays, which simplifies the computational effort of the simulation and thus the computational fitting of the models against empirical data.</s></p><p><s>Our key finding is the demonstration that the optimal operating regime is at the edge of the local Hopf bifurcation, i.e. a balance of noisy excursions in the oscillatory state.</s><s>We not only were able to demonstrate that previous findings on the optimal operating point based on grand-average FC hold true if we take into account the temporal dynamics of FC, i.e.</s><s>FCD.</s><s>We also demonstrated that a better way of constraining brain network models is by not only fitting the grand average FC, but by also fitting the temporal structure of the fluctuations using the FCD.</s></p><p><s>Another remarkable and important finding is that high metastability is only present in a narrow range of bifurcation parameter when a is close to the edge of the bifurcation.</s><s>In other words, the FCD of the spontaneous resting state, in conjunction with brain network modelling provide evidence that the brain at rest is maximally metastable, refining and demonstrating the hypothesis of Tognoli and Kelso <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Note that there is also a region for very small G and positive a (oscillatory regime) where a

target="#b45">47</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, the level of fitting for the FC, metastability and even FCD is not as good as the one obtained in the region at the edge of the Hopf bifurcation.</s><s>On the other hand, besides the extreme sensitivity of that working point (ultra-narrow regime of optimality) which means that the result is not so robust, the qualitative description of the BOLD signals is not realistic in the pure oscillatory regime in comparison with the noisy/oscillatory excursions evidenced in the regime of the bifurcation parameter a near zero.</s></p><p><s>For constructing a heterogeneous brain network model with different local parameter values, we took into account the spectral information of the BOLD data.</s><s>We addressed the question if the oscillations at the individual nodes play a mechanistic role for the emergence of FC/FCD.</s><s>In particular, we identified a cortical core of eight brain regions with the optimal fit of bifurcation parameter a close to the edge of bifurcation.</s><s>We propose to call this the dynamical cortical core of the brain.</s><s>Interestingly, three of these regions (the medial orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate

that the brain is attending to the auditory signals (transverse temporal gyrus).</s><s>As such this information processing is available for conflict monitoring and selection for action (rostral anterior cingulate cortex and caudal middle frontal gyrus) and motor execution (precentral gyrus) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50</ref> .</s><s>Equally, the involvement of the cingulate cortex is interesting given that this region recently has been shown to be part of the common neurobiological substrate for mental illness across across six diverse diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety) based on a meta-analysis of grey matter loss in 193 neuroimaging studies of 15892 individuals <ref type="bibr"

in mediating biophysical effects.</s><s>Another note of caution: we have presented a mesoscopic phenomenological model, i.e. the dynamical equation corresponds directly to the measured BOLD signals and not to the neural signals.</s><s>It is a phenomenological model since the real coupling between regions does not, of course, occur between the hemodynamic signals, but between the underlying
