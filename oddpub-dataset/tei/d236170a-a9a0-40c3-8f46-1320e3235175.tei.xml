<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Purpose: To assess whether thoracic non-cardiac surgery has an influence on right ventricular function (RVF) compared to known impaired postoperative RV function after cardiac surgery.</s><s>Methods: In all, 50 patients (mean age: 61 years), who underwent thoracic non-cardiac surgery were included and matched using propensity score to 50 patients, receiving coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (CABG matched ).</s><s>All patients had transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) including two-dimensional speckle tracking (2D-STE) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) pre-and 1 week postoperatively.</s><s>Results: No significant changes in RV measurements including tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tricuspid annular systolic velocity (TASV), RV fractional area change (RV-FAC), and 2D-STE of the RV and RV freewall within the thoracic non-cardiac surgery patients comparing pre-and postoperative values.</s><s>Comparing RV TTE values between CABG matched patients and thoracic surgery patients, only TAPSE differed between groups preoperatively (p &lt;0.0001),</s><s>where postoperatively, all RV measurements differed significantly between the two groups: TAPSE (p &lt;0.0001), TASV (p &lt;0.001), RVFAC (p = 0.005), and RV 2D-STE (p &lt;0.0001) indicating impairment of RV function post-CABG surgery compared to thoracic non-cardiac surgery.</s><s>Conclusion: Thoracic non-cardiac surgery including an opening of the pleural cavity did not influence RV function early postoperative, whereas CABG surgery with pericardiotomy led to an impaired global RV function.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thoracic surgery patients vs. CABG matched</head><p><s>Regarding the preoperative RV echocardiography parameters, only TAPSE and SR of the RV freewall showed significant changes between thoracic surgery patients and the CABG matched group (TAPSE: 23.7 ± 4.6 vs. 19.3</s><s>± 2.5 mm, p &lt;0.0001 and RV SR freewall: −1.6 ± 0.6 vs. −1.3 vs. 0.3, p = 0.027), respectively (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>In terms of preoperative functional LV echo parameter, EF did not differ between thoracic surgery patients and CABG matched group, whereas global peak longitudinal strain average of the LV (LV GLS avg.) was significantly lower in the CABG matched group compared to the thoracic surgery group (−13.5 ± 4.0 vs. −19.3</s><s>± 4.0, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).</s><s>The mitral valve Doppler inflow ratio (MV E/A) was also significantly lower in the CABG matcherd group compared to the thoracic surgery group, preoperatively (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Postoperatively all RV echo parameters, including 2D-STE and TDI, were significantly inferior in the CABG matched group compared to the thoracic surgery group, indicating a postoperative impairment of the RV systolic function in the CABG matched group compared to preserved RV function in thoracic surgery patients (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>Regarding the postoperative LV-EF and LV GLS avg., both parameters were significantly lower in the CABG matched group compared to the thoracic surgery patients (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>The tricuspid valve Doppler-inflow parameter (TV E/A) and TDI (TV E/é) were in the normal range in both groups preoperatively, but postoperatively in the CABG matched group TV E/A decreased and simultaneously TV E/é increased significantly compared to the thoracic surgery patients (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>), which suggests a pseudonormal diastolic filling pattern of the RV in the CABG matched group equating to second-degree diastolic dysfunction.</s><s>The MV inflow parameter did not differ significantly between groups postoperatively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison within the thoracic surgery patients comparing wedge resection vs. lobectomy</head><p><s>To compare RV function after major and minor pulmonary resection, we divided the thoracic patients into two groups regarding the surgery method (lobectomy group (n = 32) vs. wedge resection (n = 16) (atypical lung resection).</s><s>In the wedge resection group (n = 14), TAPSE was 23.9 ± 3.2 mm and GLS RV 4CH was −20.1 ± 5.7% preoperatively and 23.9 ± 1.5 mm and 19.5 ± 4.4 postoperatively (p = 1.000 and p = 0.742, respectively).</s><s>In the lobectomy group, TAPSE was 25.8 ± 5.2 mm and GLS RV 4 CH was −21.5 ± 5.8% preoperatively and 24.9 ± 5.1 and −21.4 ± 7.5% postoperatively (p = 0.900 and p = 0.952).</s><s>Comparing TAPSE and GLS RV 4 CH postoperatively between wedge resection and lobectomy group, no significant differences could be detected (p = 0.803 and p = 0.987, respectively).</s><s>We could also not detect any significant difference in further RV parameters between the two groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we found that after thoracic surgery either as open or minimal invasive surgery, there were no changes in diastolic or systolic RV and LV function, whereas a striking reduction in overall RV function after cardiac surgery with pericardiotomy was detected.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">21)</ref> Some studies suggested that the impairment of RV function during cardiac surgery is due to poor myocardial protection, while on cardio-pulmonary bypass. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7)</ref></s><s>hanges in RV function after thoracic surgery are still unclear.</s><s>We demonstrated that thoracic surgery, open or minimal invasive surgery, with major pulmonary resection (bi-lobectomy), did not have any influence on diastolic and systolic function of the RV or LV.</s><s>In contrast to our findings, Reed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">22)</ref> detected RV dysfunction after pulmonary resection, and concluded that this dysfunction is multifactorial and might not only be due to a contractile impairment of the RV.</s><s>A possible explanation for this discordance between our findings and the findings demonstrated by Reed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">22)</ref> is the different selected time point in performing the evaluation of the RV function, while Reed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">22)</ref> performed the evaluation during the very early postoperative period (PODs 1 and 2) and we performed the postoperative echocardiography analysis 1 week postoperatively.</s><s>We believe that during the operation and the ICU stay many factors will influence the preload of the RV, leading to temporary changes in the RV function but the global RV function will return to the baseline value during the first postoperative week, as the RV will adapt to both pre-and after load changes.</s><s>Also contrary to our findings, Okada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">23)</ref> detected RV dysfunction post-thoracic surgery and they speculated that the main cause of RV dysfunction after major pulmonary resection might be the changes in right ventricular afterload.</s><s>The RV dysfunction was detected by Okada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">23)</ref> during the first and second PODs, while their measurements of the RV parameters on the third postoperative week demonstrated almost the same values compared to baseline.</s><s>These findings again strengthen our speculation, that the RV dysfunction, which occurs in the very early postoperative period, diminishes during the first postoperative week, after that the RV adapt to the new pre-and afterload conditions.</s><s>Major resection of the lung as, for example, in bi-lobectomy, can lead to a reduction of the pulmonary vascular system, which in return leads to reduction of the pulmonary vasculatory cross sections and may lead to PAH and subsequently to right heart failure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">24)</ref></s><s>Beside changes in the pulmonary vascular system during thoracotomy and anesthesia, an increase in intrathoracic pressures are recorded, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">25)</ref> which negatively influences the filling pressure of the RV.</s><s>However, we could not detect any changes neither of systolic RV parameters nor of TV inflow.</s><s>We speculate that in the acute phase after major lung resection, the RV afterload will increase significantly and the RV function will suffer during the very 1 week post-surgery.</s><s>Owing to the absence of randomization and the partly retrospective nature of our study, our data were subjected to potential bias with regard to patient selection and data acquisition; therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting our results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Thoracic non-cardiac surgery does not impair global RV function, while patients undergoing cardiac surgery with left open pericardium suffer significant reductions of RV function.</s><s>Patho-mechanisms of RV impairment after cardiac surgery should be examined prospectively with larger patient cohorts and new cutoffs of TTE parameters for the evaluation of RV function and are subject of an ongoing trial.</s></p></div>
