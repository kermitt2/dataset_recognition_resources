<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>PURPOSE.</s><s>To define the characteristics and time course of the morphologic and functional changes experienced by corneal sensory nerves after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).</s></p><p><s>METHODS.</s><s>Unilateral corneal excimer laser photoablation was performed in 54 anesthetized 3to 6-month-old mice; 11 naïve animals served as control.</s><s>Mice were killed 0, 3, 7, 15, and 30 days after PRK.</s><s>Excised eyes were placed in a recording chamber superfused at 348C.</s><s>Electrical nerve impulse activity of single sensory terminals was recorded with a micropipette applied onto the corneal surface.</s><s>Spontaneous and stimulus-evoked (cold, heat, mechanical, and chemical stimuli) nerve terminal impulse (NTI) activity was analyzed.</s><s>Corneas were fixed and stained with anti-b-Tubulin III antibody to measure nerve density and number of epithelial nerve penetration points of regenerating subbasal leashes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS.</head><p><s>Nerve fibers and NTI activity were absent in the injured area between 0 and 7 days after PRK, when sparse regenerating nerve sprouts appear.</s><s>On day 15, subbasal nerve density reached half the control value and abnormally responding cold-sensitive terminals were recorded inside the lesion.</s><s>Thirty days after PRK, nerve density was almost restored, active cold thermoreceptors were abundant, and polymodal nociceptor activity first reappeared.</s></p><p><s>CONCLUSIONS.</s><s>Morphologic regeneration of subbasal corneal nerves started shortly after PRK ablation and was substantially completed 30 days later.</s><s>Functional recovery appears faster in cold terminals than polymodal terminals, possibly reflecting an incomplete damage of the more extensively branched cold-sensitive axon terminals.</s><s>Evolution of postsurgical discomfort sensations quality may be associated with the variable regeneration pattern of each fiber type.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The present work confirms the occurrence of extensive morphologic and functional damage to corneal nerves after application of the photoablation procedure used in refractive surgery, and uncovers the marked differences in time course required by corneal sensory nerve fibers of different modality (polymodal nociceptors, mechano-nociceptors, and cold thermoreceptors) to regenerate, and to recover, albeit partially, their normal responsiveness to natural stimuli.</s><s>Our study additionally revealed that the functional disturbances caused by injury affect also nerve terminals outside the directly wounded area, especially in cold thermoreceptors, possibly reflecting damage by PRK to some terminal branches of parent axons that entered the wound area but that predominantly had their sensory nerve terminals in the noninjured parts of the cornea.</s></p><p><s>PRK is a procedure that completely removes the epithelium and approximately 20 lm of the anterior stroma of treated corneas, thus affecting the small and medium-sized nerve bundles running in the anterior stromal plexus, particularly its more anterior, dense part, the subepithelial plexus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>The laser beam directly destroys the more superficial nerve branches in the treated area, while the distal segments of axons running in a large extent outside the lesion, but affected by the laser beam, degenerate rapidly.</s><s>Our work confirms previous studies reporting that within hours after PRK, nerves are totally absent from the injured area and those in the surrounding periphery are reduced in number. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>n human patients, nerve regeneration is slow.</s><s>Subbasal nerve fiber bundles visualized with tandem scanning confocal microscopy are present only in 17% of the corneas 1 month after PRK, and the density of these nerve fibers is 98% less than preoperatively.</s><s>After approximately 3 months, no branched nerve fibers can be seen in the center of the ablation zone; mean subbasal nerve density remains reduced by 59% at 1 year, when compared with preoperative values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>By 2 years, subbasal nerve density after PRK is similar but morphologic alterations are still present even 5 years after PRK. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>Despite the timescale differences in regeneration speed between mice and humans, our study showed that recovery of nerve fiber density in the cornea of mice following PRK is also slow, and 1 month later has not fully reestablished the original architecture of corneal innervation.</s></p><p><s>Maintenance and remodeling of mature axons depend under normal circumstances on extrinsic signals from the environment, which activate their translational machinery, inducing the synthesis of proteins involved in the dynamic regulation of the cytoskeleton. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>9]<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> Extrinsic signals acting on

accompanying corneal wound healing may also influence axonal growth.</s><s>These forces are transmitted to the subbasal axons and to the reassembling epithelial basement membrane, likely affecting adhesion between epithelial cells, basement membrane, and subbasal axons and thereby, the navigation of regenerating axons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>Considering the numerous positive and negative regulators influencing the final trajectory and elongation of axons after injury, the slow and incomplete recovery of the prelesion innervation architecture after PRK is not surprising. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s>ur study revealed that the appearance of sprouting axons within the injured area does not imply an immediate and parallel recovery of their function.</s><s>In fact, we observed that corneal sensory terminals of different modality required variable times to recuperate responsiveness to their natural stimuli.</s><s>Cold thermoreceptor terminals began to respond 1 week after surgery as occurs with mechano-nociceptors, while the first recordings of identifiable polymodal units in the injured area were obtained only 3 weeks later.</s><s>It is well established that sensory ganglion neurons underlying the various somatosensory modalities possess different genetic signatures, immunocytochemical characteristics, and

membrane excitability and transduction properties after PRK may reflect a distinct responsiveness of these nociceptors to the injurytriggered molecular signals responsible for rebuilding the ionic mechanisms required for the transduction and coding of specific stimuli during the regeneration process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>Moreover, corneal polymodal nociceptor axons are sparsely branched, generally with simple or ramifying epithelial endings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s>It is therefore possible that in most cases destruction of polymodal axons by PRK affects most if not all the branches of a parent axon within the epithelium and subepithelium, thus requiring a longer time to regenerate.</s><s>In

the recovery of electrophysiological properties at this time is still incomplete.</s></p><p><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> Altered architecture of cold terminals and abnormal expression of ion channels involved in cold transduction and coding after injury likely decrease both the transducing membrane surface and the number of membrane points at which propagated impulses may

PRK.</s></p><p><s>Notably, abnormal background activity and altered cooling responses were also observed in some of the cold thermoreceptor endings recorded into the intact cornea surrounding the PRK wound.</s><s>We hypothesize that these terminals belong to cold thermoreceptor parent axons that had originally some branches extending into the operated area.</s><s>Their loss after PRK reduced the
