<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Excitotoxicity, a critical process in neurodegeneration, induces oxidative stress and neuronal death through mechanisms largely unknown.</s><s>Since oxidative stress activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in tumor cells, we investigated the effect of excitotoxicity on neuronal PKD1 activity.</s><s>Unexpectedly, we find that excitotoxicity provokes an early inactivation of PKD1 through a dephosphorylation-dependent mechanism mediated by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and dual specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1).</s><s>This step turns off the IKK/NF-κB/SOD2 antioxidant pathway.</s><s>Neuronal PKD1 inactivation by pharmacological inhibition or lentiviral silencing in vitro, or by genetic inactivation in neurons in vivo, strongly enhances excitotoxic neuronal death.</s><s>In contrast, expression of an active dephosphorylation-resistant PKD1 mutant potentiates the IKK/NF-κB/SOD2 oxidative stress detoxification pathway and confers neuroprotection from in vitro and in vivo excitotoxicity.</s><s>Our results indicate that PKD1 inactivation underlies excitotoxicity-induced neuronal death and suggest that PKD1 inactivation may be critical for the accumulation of oxidation-induced neuronal damage during aging and in neurodegenerative disorders.</s></p></div>

active in mature neurons and contribute to the low level of detection of tyrosine phosphorylated residues unless potent phosphatase inhibitors are used.</s><s>Next, we analyzed the effect of the

inactivation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3c, d</ref>).</s><s>Treatment with the tyrosine PPs inhibitor pervanadate (PV) also increased basal PKD activity and preserved its activation after 1 h of NMDARs overstimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>).</s><s>The PV-induced increase at the higher molecular weight band of p-Ser916 doublet suggested the presence of PKD1-tyrosinehyperphosphorylated forms in this band (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>, solid arrow head).</s><s>Together, these results suggest a critical involvement of PP1 and tyrosine PPs in the regulation of neuronal PKD basal activity and in its inactivation during excitotoxicity.</s><s>They also indicate that activity of PKD in mature neurons might undergo dynamic cycles of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events due to synaptic activity, likely with the participation of GluN2A subunits and calcium.</s><s>This fine dynamic synaptic modulation would explain the substantial increases in PKD phosphorylation and activity when all NMDARs or the PPs involved are blocked.</s></p><p><s>DAPK was dephosphorylated earlier than PKD (Fig. <ref type="figure"

striatal ischemic core (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7c</ref>) and a substantial nuclear loss in the cortical penumbra area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4e</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, we obtained similar results in human postmortem brain samples from ischemic stroke patients, where NF-κB was absent in neuronal nuclei from ischemic stroke patients but presented nuclear localization in control subjects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">4f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Collectively, our results strongly suggest that the PKD1/IKK/ NF-κB pathway is constitutively "on" in healthy neurons and suffers an early and sustained "shut-off" in human brain after ischemic stroke and in experimental models of excitotoxicity and brain ischemia.</s></p><p><s>PKD1 protects neurons through the IKK/NF-κB/SOD2 pathway.</s><s>Next we assessed the effect of a dephosphorylation-resistant and constitutively active PKD1 mutant in neuroprotection from excitotoxicity.</s><s>To engineer this mutant, we substituted the four critical residues involved in PKD activation (Tyr93, Tyr469, Ser744, and Ser748) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>) by glutamic acid, to mimic their phosphorylation state.</s><s>In vitro kinase assays confirmed its constitutive activity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>).</s><s>We fused this quadruple mutant to GFP in a lentiviral vector (PKD1-Ca) bearing human synapsin neurospecific promoter (SYNpr) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>GFP alone expressed under the same promoter was used as control lentivirus.</s><s>Neurons transduced with PKD1-Ca lentivirus expressed high amounts of active PKD1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>) and presented substantial increases in IKK activity (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>) and a highly significant induction of SOD2 levels relative to GFP-transduced cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, NMDA-induced ROS production in PKD1-Ca neurons was very low (111 ± 10.4%) and similar to that of untreated GFP neurons, compared to NMDA-treated GFP neurons (148 ± 7.8%) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Analysis of MAP2 staining confirmed that PKD1 activation confers neuroprotection against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity (Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>).</s><s>Most GFP neurons were not viable after 4 h of NMDA treatment, and presented disorganized MAP2 staining, whereas a prominent number of PKD1-Ca neurons remained viable at this time (Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, a high number of PKD1-Ca neurons survived even 24 h upon NMDA addition (50.4 ± 11%), when almost all GFP neurons were dead (13.5 ± 3%) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, NF-κB remained in the nucleus of most PKD1-Ca transduced neurons after 1 h of NMDA treatment in contrast to its cytosolic translocation in a high proportion of GFP neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>).</s><s>The possibility that PKD1-Ca increased neuronal survival by inhibiting Ca 2+ influx evoked by NMDARs overactivation was ruled out after performing Ca 2+ imaging analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To demonstrate that increases in SOD2 conferred by PKD1-Ca were dependent on IKK/NF-κB pathway, we treated transduced neurons with the IKK inhibitor SC-514.</s><s>IKK inhibition decreased SOD2 levels in PKD1-Ca transduced cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>, left and medium panels).</s><s>The action of SC-514 was confirmed by the accumulation of IκBα (Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>, left and right panels).</s><s>We finally examined the effect that pharmacological inhibition of IKK had on PKD1-mediated neuroprotection.</s><s>MTT assays showed that IKK inhibition reduced the resistance of PKD1-Ca neurons to excitotoxic death: 98.6 ± 0.6% of PKD1-Ca-transduced neurons survived after 4 h of NMDA treatment, whereas only a 73.79 ± 0.02% of them were alive after combining SC-514 and NMDA treatments (Fig. <ref type="figure">5g</ref>).</s><s>Together, our results indicate that PKD1 is neuroprotective against excitotoxic insults by busting the IKK/ NF-κB/SOD2 axis and contributing to ROS detoxification.</s></p><p><s>PKD1 protects against kainic acid-induced excitotoxicity.</s><s>To investigate PKD1 neuroprotection in vivo, we selected a model of KA-induced neurodegeneration that elicits selective excitotoxic neuronal death particularly in limbic structures (i.e., hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions) in the rat and mouse brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We first observed in cultured primary neurons that similarly to NMDA, excitotoxic concentrations of KA produced a transient activation of PKD followed by inactivation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6a</ref>).</s><s>MTT assays and MAP2 staining showed that KA reduced neuronal viability, and that KA-induced neuronal death was mediated by KA receptors (KARs) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a-c</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, KA also provoked the exit of NF-κB from neuronal nuclei (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To confirm that PKD and NF-κB were inactivated in neurons during in vivo KA-induced excitotoxicity, we examined the CA1 hippocampal area in control adult rats that received an intraperitoneal injection of saline or KA.</s><s>CA1 neurons from control saline-injected animals presented active PKD and nuclear NF-κB staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6c</ref>).</s><s>In line with our observations after cerebral ischemia, KA treatment induced condensation of neuronal nuclei in the damaged CA1 area and a marked decrease of NeuN, p-PKD and nuclear NF-κB content in neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6c</ref>), while p-PKD signal emerged in a different cell population.</s><s>Altogether, these results strongly suggest that excitotoxicity induced by NMDARs or KARs overstimulation triggers similar molecular mechanisms that result in PKD and NF-κB neuronal inactivation preceding their death.</s><s>Next we assayed the effects of PKD1-Ca neurospecific expression in neuroprotection from KA-induced death.</s><s>This was initially performed in vitro, analyzing neuronal cultures transduced with GFP or PKD1-Ca lentivirus and treated with KA for 48 h.</s><s>We found almost complete lack of neuronal death in PKD1-Ca cultures, in contrast to the extensive neuronal death provoked by KA in GFP neurons, where nearly a 60% of the neuronal population died (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, to investigate PKD1 neuroprotection in vivo, we stereotaxically injected GFP or PKD1-Ca lentiviral particles into the right and left CA1 region of the rat hippocampus, respectively, previous to KA administration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7a</ref>).</s><s>In salineinjected animals, GFP+ neurons in CA1 presented nuclear localization of NF-κB independently of whether they were transduced (GFP+) or not (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7b</ref>, see details in zoom images).</s><s>By contrast, after KA injection there was a clear damage and loss of transduced neurons in the right CA1 GFP-transduced side, as evidenced by spare fragmented GFP staining and condensation of NeuN-stained nuclei (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7c</ref>).</s><s>Remaining neurons looked damaged, presented aberrant shape and smaller compacted nuclei, and sparse nuclear NF-κB staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7c</ref>).</s><s>However, neurons in the left CA1 side appeared healthier, not only those transduced with PKD1-Ca (GFP+), but also non-transduced neurons surrounding them, many of which still contained NF-κB in their nuclei (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further support PKD1-mediated neuroprotection using quantitative approaches, we measured hippocampal CA1 neuronal degeneration by FluoroJade B staining.</s><s>We found a highly significant decrease in KA-induced neuronal death (represented as the % of FluoroJade B staining), in the left CA1 side transduced with PKD1-Ca compared with the right side GFP-transduced (12.65 ± 3% PKD1-Ca vs. 28.19 ± 3.6% GFP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7d</ref>).</s></p></div>

because they are post-mitotic cells that survive for many years, they must have well developed natural defences against oxidative stress.</s><s>Here we have discovered that a constitutively active neuronal PKD1/IKK/NF-κB/SOD2 oxidative stress-detoxifying cascade is turned off during excitotoxic neurodegeneration, depleting neurons of this antioxidant natural defence and greatly hampering their survival (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7e</ref>).</s><s>Our results support the notion that PKD1 enhances IKK activity, NF-κB nuclear localization and SOD2 expression, and decreases ROS production in neurons under oxidative stress conditions.</s></p><p><s>Excitotoxic damage accumulated along aging or enhanced by acute or chronic neurodegenerative disorders could gradually deteriorate this antioxidant pathway.</s><s>PKD1 activity withdrawal, accompanied by NF-κB nuclear exit, and subsequent decrease in SOD2 levels would decrease the threshold of the amount of ROS neurons can cope with.</s><s>ROS elimination through the action of SOD2 would be severely hampered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7e</ref>).</s><s>Cultured Prkd1 −/− immortalized fibroblasts showed increased ROS production due to a decrease in the threshold of mitochondrial depolarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , suggesting the possibility that this mechanism may also contribute to increase ROS levels in neurons.</s><s>The accumulation of ROS in PKD1-deficient neurons, by lack of clearance or by overproduction, may increase oxidative damage and neuronal vulnerability and death.</s><s>Accordingly, we observed increased MDA labeling in the brain of PKD1 KO mice relative to PKD1 floxed littermates.</s></p><p><s>This PKD-ROS detoxification pathway was identified in a pancreatic cancer mouse model and in cancer cell lines, having as a result the promotion of precancerous lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> and the potentiation of cellular survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , respectively.</s><s>Contrary to tumor cells, this activation is not sustained in neurons, as demonstrated by decreases in PKD and IKK activities and in NF-κB nuclear localization and activity preceding excitotoxic neuronal death.</s><s>A transient activation of PKD was found also in dopaminergic cells treated in vitro with hydrogen peroxide, but mechanisms of inactivation or downstream signaling cascades were not explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>Here, we identify for the first time a molecular mechanism involved in PKD dephosphorylation downstream overstimulation of endogenous NMDARs.</s><s>This inactivation mechanism depends on PP1 and DUSP1, two PPs whose activities are increased under excitotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">7e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A key point in PKD sustained activation and survival of cancer cells under oxidative stress might relay on their deficiencies in the control of PKD inactivation mechanisms achieved by PPs.</s><s>For instance, DUSP1 levels inversely correlate with NF-κB activity and their malignancy grade in prostate cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>In this context, while specific inhibition of PKD1 could provide clear therapeutic advantages in cancer, our results indicate that this type of treatments could represent a high risk for associated neurodegeneration.</s><s>Conversely, the future development and therapeutic application of PKD
