<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The panel of this year's 14th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference comprised 49 experts from 19 countries, 3 of whom were from Germany.</s><s>Recommendations are based on the majority vote of the panelists who represented various disciplines and countries with different healthcare systems and resources.</s><s>Therefore, these are rather personal opinions which are in part based on evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In light of these facts, however, it makes sense to discuss the voting results critically with regard to the national therapy recommendations of the AGO (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynäkologische Onkologie) guideline commission from 2015 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale and Voting Rules of the St. Gallen Consensus</head><p><s>The St. Gallen Consensus aims essentially at panel members forming a majority and giving a practical opinion.</s><s>Some questions were answered with 'yes' (consent), 'no' (rejection), or 'abstention' (insufficient data; inability to form an opinion) while others required choosing from several options.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgical Therapy</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resection Margin after Breast-Conserving Surgery</head><p><s>With regard to breast-conserving therapy, the panelists demand unanimously resection with tumor-free resection margins (R0) (no invasive tumor cells on ink).</s></p><p><s>Vote of the German group of experts: Consent.</s><s>According to the majority vote in St. Gallen, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) can be performed both in multifocal (yes: 71%) as well as multicentric (unilateral; yes: 80%) invasive breast cancer, provided the resection margin is tumor-free and patients receive adjuvant radiation therapy.</s></p><p><s>Comment of the German group of experts: Limited consent.</s><s>According to the 2015 AGO recommendation, BCS must be based on an individual decision in multicentric (unilateral) breast cancer <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Another option is modified mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.</s></p><p><s>The size of the resection margin should not depend on tumor biology.</s><s>An additional (larger) margin is not necessary in younger patients (&lt; 40 years) and patients with lobular breast cancer.</s><s>The same applies to surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) or if there is an extensive intraductal component.</s></p><p><s>Vote of the German group of experts: Consent.</s><s>However, for ductal carcinoma in situ, the German group recommends a resection margin of at least 2 mm after BCS <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgical Approach Following NACT</head><p><s>The question of whether it is sufficient to perform a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) or whether a complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) should be performed in a patient who has palpatory and/or sonographically suspicious lymph nodes (cN+) at presentation but clinically/sonographically uninvolved axillary nodes (ycN0) following NACT (so-called 'down-staging'), was extensively discussed.</s><s>The majority of the St. Gallen panelists believe that SNB is an adequate approach in patients following NACT.</s><s>However, the St. Gallen panel believes that ALND should be performed if 1 or more sentinel lymph nodes are infiltrated.</s></p><p><s>Vote of the German group of experts: Consent.</s><s>This recommendation is based on data of the ACOSOG study Z1071 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The German group adds that fine needle aspiration (FNA) or punch biopsy prior to NACT should be performed in clinically suspicious lymph nodes.</s><s>If possible, the lymph node in question should be marked with a clip.</s><s>In the case of ycN0, the German group recommends deciding on an individual basis whether SNB or ALND should be performed <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s>If patients with cN+ (proven by FNA or biopsy) prior to NACT undergo an SNB procedure after NACT, the decision for ALND depends on the number of removed (sentinel and non-sentinel) lymph nodes.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, the German group points out that only with 3 tumor-free lymph nodes the false-negative rate (FNR: negative sentinel node but positive axillary) is similar to the FNR with a primary surgical approach.</s><s>In these cases, the possibility to avoid ALND should be discussed with the patient.</s><s>However, ALND should be performed in a patient with histologically positive lymph node(s) (by FNA or biopsy) prior to NACT and 1-2 positive sentinel (and non-sentinel) lymph nodes following NACT (ypN+ SN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Breast surgery following NACT should be performed within the new margins.</s></p><p><s>According to the St. Gallen vote, ALND is not required if 1-2 macrometastatically infiltrated sentinel lymph nodes are detected at primary surgery, provided that ACOSOG Z0011 criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> are fulfilled (tumor 5 cm (pT1-2), no extracapsular lymph node involvement, BCS, adequate adjuvant systemic therapy, adjuvant postoperative tangential field radiation).</s></p><p><s>Vote of the German group of experts: Consent.</s><s>After mastectomy, ALND should be performed in the case of macrometastati-</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">© AGO e.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adjuvant Radiation Therapy</head><p><s>Partial Breast Radiation after BCS The majority of the St. Gallen panelists believe that partial irradiation without whole breast radiation is possible for patients who are classified as 'suitable' according to the ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) and ESTRO (European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology) criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Comment of the German expert group: ASTRO classifies patients as 'suitable' if they meet the following criteria: 60 years, no BRCA1/2 mutation, hormone receptor (HR)-positive, tumor 2 cm (T1), clear margin 2 mm, pN0, no lymph vessel infiltration (L0), unicentric/unifocal, invasive ductal or other favorable histology (mucinous, tubular, colloid), missing extensive intraductal component.</s><s>In patients with DCIS or preceding neoadjuvant chemotherapy, partial breast irradiation is not indicated.</s><s>However, first positive data have been published on intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) following NACT.</s><s>The selection criteria ('suitable') of ESTRO and ASTRO differ only slightly with regard to age ( 50 vs.</s><s>60 years) and T-stage (pT1-2 vs. T1).</s><s>Other than that, the ASTRO criteria fully apply <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The St. Gallen panel recommends for patients classified as 'intermediate' by ESTRO and as 'cautionary' by ASTRO <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref> to await the results from studies with partial breast irradiation.</s></p><p><s>Comment of the German expert group: The patient selection criteria are not sufficiently defined.</s><s>In this context, it is recommended to conduct further clinical trials.</s><s>In addition, the German expert group refers to the current AGO recommendations 2015 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Currently, there is no general standard for partial breast radiation therapy alone.</s><s>Partial breast irradiation should be discussed on an individual basis with patients who have favorable tumor biology and a low risk of recurrence (see <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypofractionated Radiation Following BCS</head><p><s>The St. Gallen panelists believe that hypofractionated radiation is indicated regardless of age.</s><s>In addition, according to the St. Gallen vote, it is also indicated for patients with prior chemotherapy or axillary lymph node involvement regardless of age; therefore, irradiation of the lymphatic drainage areas would also be indicated.</s></p><p><s>Vote of the German group of experts: No consent.</s><s>The German experts recommend a significantly more differentiated approach as specified in the current AGO recommendations (fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The German experts believe that hypofractionated radiation (without boost; 15-16 fractions with 2.67 Gy each) following BCS is preferable for patients &gt; 65 years with low risk factors (see ASTRO and ESTRO criteria) over normofractionation (25 fractions of 2 Gy each).</s><s>In 40-65-year-old patients with higher risk factors, both conventional radiation with integrated or sequential boost and hy-pofractionated radiation with sequential boost are valid treatment options.</s><s>The AGO does not believe that hypofractionated radiation is indicated in women younger than 40 years nor if irradiation of the supra-infraclavicular lymphatic drainage areas is indicated; in these cases, conventional radiation is recommended.</s></p></div>
