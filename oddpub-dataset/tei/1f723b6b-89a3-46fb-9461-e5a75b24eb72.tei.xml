<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Within the current study, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis of piRNA by microarray to screen for piRNAs differentially expressed in ccRCC and to validate their potential clinical significance as biomarkers.</s><s>RT-qPCR analyses on three selected piRNAs showed for the first time differentially expressed piRNAs in ccRCC as well as a strong relationship between piRNA expression data and the clinical endpoints of recurrence-free and overall survival.</s><s>This study design as a hypothesisgenerating approach through discovery-driven global research was recently suggested as one of the essential steps for translational research in medicine to comply with the realistic conditions in clinical settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We found that 1.56 % (n = 369) of the total 23 677 piR-NAs examined were downregulated by least two-fold in ccRCC while only 0.99 % (n = 235) were accordingly upregulated.</s><s>This significantly higher percentage (p &lt; 0.0001) of downregulated piRNAs corresponded to a higher number of decreased miRNAs as another type of small RNAs in ccRCC samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>This result of differentially expressed piRNAs prompted us to analyze three selected piRNAs (piR-30924, piR-57125, and piR-38756) in more detail.</s><s>Although piR-38756 was overexpressed in microarray analysis, its downregulation was demonstrated by RT-qPCR and verified by specific electrophoretic PCR product controls (Additional file 1: Supporting Information Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>This underscores again that specific RT-qPCR measurements remain indispensable for the validation of microarray analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>Other studies found approximately 6-10 % discordant microarray results compared to RT-PCR measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, piR-30924, which we selected for comparative purposes as a strongly upregulated piRNA in other cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> was expressed at a lower level in ccRCC than in normal tissue.</s><s>This discordant expression behavior between different tumors conforms to a similar phenomenon observed in case of miRNAs, probably as a consequence of their different effects or resulting from specific signaling pathways in various tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although all three selected piRNAs were downregulated in non-metastatic ccRCCs in comparison to normal tissue, they were characterized by different expression patterns in the metastatic primary tumor and metastatic tissue from bone metastases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The uniformly reduced expression of piR-57125 in the sequence from the nonmalignant tissue over the primary non-metastatic and primary metastatic tumor to the distant metastases contrasted with the differently regulated expression of piR-30924 and piR-38756 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The expression of these two piRNAs in samples from metastatic primary ccRCC and distant ccRCC metastases was higher than in nonmetastatic ccRCC samples and reached again the level in normal tissue distant from tumor.</s><s>These differences of the piRNAs were partly reflected by different expression levels, depending on tumor stage and grade (Additional file 1: Supporting Information Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).</s><s>Similarly characteristic behavior was also observed for miRNAs in ccRCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to these particularities, the evidence of the investigated piRNAs as independent factors in multivariate Cox regression analyses together with conventional clinicopathological variables like tumor stage and/or tumor grade demonstrates the potential of piRNAs as orthogonal biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>This type of biomarker is characterized by its uncorrelated differential expression to established disease variables.</s><s>In this case, piRNAs provide an additional degree of information.</s><s>Thus, the specific feature of orthogonal markers offers the advantage of discovering associations with new disease-related pathways and downstream conditions that had not been considered previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>For predicting overall survival both in non-metastatic and metastatic ccRCC patients after nephrectomy, all three piRNAs were highly significant indicators in univariate analyses (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>More importantly, both piR-30924 and piR-57125 remained independent factors, together with the decisive variable metastasis, in the Cox regression backward model for these patients (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>piR-38756 alone was an independent factor together with tumor grade for predicting recurrence and survival in non-metastatic patients (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, these data show that piRNAs might be considered as potential new molecular markers that are capable of improving risk stratification and prediction of the therapeutic response in RCC patients.</s><s>Recent prognostic models, generally based only on clinicopathological and imaging data, are of limited accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>This view and the potential improvement of these models using The Youden index as a measure of overall diagnostic effectiveness is calculated by (sensitivity + specificity) -1.</s><s>When equal weight is given to sensitivity and specificity of a test, the cutoff at the maximum value of this index, which graphically corresponds to the maximum vertical distance between the ROC curve and the diagonal line, is referred to as optimal criterion b Calculated by full binary logistic regression c Calculated by stepwise binary logistic regression with all three miRNAs (backward likelihood elimination; entry p = 0.05, removal p = 0.10).</s><s>In case of the differentiation between non-malignant and malignant tissue, the backward elimination did not result in a reduced model piRNAs as adjunct biomarkers are also supported in our by the higher C-indexes of the Cox-regression models if piRNAs were used in combination with standard clinicopathological factors in comparison to models with only clinicopathological variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Expression studies of piRNAs with a focus on their diagnostic and prognostic validity and their functional role have been examined in only a few other cancers <ref type="bibr">[19-21, 23, 25]</ref>.</s><s>As already mentioned, piR-30924 was found to be upregulated in gastric cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Transfection of an inhibitor of this piRNA into gastric cancer cells reduced cell proliferation by arresting cells in the G 2 /M phase.</s><s>An oncogenic role of this piRNA was assumed.</s><s>In bladder cancer, 106 up-and 91 down-regulated piRNAs were described when similar differential expression criterion of a &gt;2-fold change was applied, as in our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The authors used the same piRNA microarray and found piR-60152 as the most profoundly downregulated piRNA.</s><s>Over-expression of this piRNA in bladder cancer cell lines reduced cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis.</s><s>TNFSF4 was identified as a target gene of this piRNA.</s><s>piRNA-mediated effects were also characterized for other Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Kaplan-Meier analyses of overall survivals after surgical removal of non-metastatic

differences between the survival probabilities genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s><s>The identification of piRNA targets is one of the key challenges in our understanding of the function of this class of small non-coding RNAs.</s><s>Such findings could lead to novel therapeutic implications of piRNAs.</s><s>In the case of the three studied piRNAs, piR-30924 is located on chromosome 2 and 5 and piR-57125 on chromosome 5 whereas the sequence of has been found at approximately 300 multiple loci.</s><s>However, the recently reported comprehensive molecular characterization of ccRCC did not mention any relationships between typical RCC hot spots and piRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, sophisticated search machines for target predictions of human piRNAs like for miRNAs are planned but are currently not available <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr"

the hazard ratios and the p values of the final model were obtained after bootstrapping studies.</s><s>All these facts highlight that our understanding of piRNAs is still very limited.</s><s>Thus, although research on piRNAs is still very much in its infancy and their functional role remains widely unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, these few first results suggest that piRNAs could gain a comparable importance for cancer research in the future as miRNAs achieved some years before <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s>Some limitations of this study, like its retrospective design, the limited number of cases, and the small number of analyzed piRNAs as well as the single-center character of our analysis need to be addressed.</s><s>Another critical point was the missing normal tissue samples from all nephrectomy samples.</s><s>We explained it in the section "Materials and methods".</s><s>Thus, statistical tests for matched pairs samples could not be performed.</s><s>In comparison to matched paired samples that consider the intra-individual variability, the variability in groups is generally higher and results in lower statistical power when differences of group data are statistically tested.</s><s>On the other hand, statistically significant differences detected between groups, as in our study, are consequently a more stringent proof of excluding a possible type II error.</s><s>Further arguments for the validity of our study are that all measurements were performed in a blinded manner.</s><s>In addition, at least 10 % more patients were analyzed than the calculated sample size and an internal validation by bootstrapping was performed to avoid type I and II errors.</s><s>Despite consideration of all these reasonable points, our study results need to be validated by larger multicenter, prospective studies.</s><s>In such a study including sufficient cases for separate training and test sets, more highly differentially
