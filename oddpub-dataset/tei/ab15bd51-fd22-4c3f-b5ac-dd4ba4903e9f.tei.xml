the genotypes, this single statistically significant data point is biologically questionable.</s><s>Alternatively, in the context of Ifnγ mRNA decrease at early time points (see below) in Clca1 -/mice, this may indicate changes in metabolism in Clca1-deficient mice only.</s><s>Importantly, Clca1deficiency had no impact on any clinical parameter tested which is in line with the previous respiratory challenge model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Histopathologically, Clca1-deficiency did not result in any effect on the extent and nature of inflammatory cells,

infiltration and regeneration (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b and c</ref>) increased in proximal and distal colon, clearly reflecting the expected inflammation.</s><s>At 24 und 48 h, no significant immune cell infiltrations or histopathologic alterations were observed (Additional file 4).</s><s>In contrast to previous studies on airway inflammation in which neutrophil responses were either decreased in Clca1 -/mice after S. aureus infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or increased after LPS challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, no difference was observed histopathologically in the colitis model between the genotypes.</s></p><p><s>As expected, mRNA expressions of Cxcl-1, Cxcl-2, Il-17, Tnf and Ifnγ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3a</ref> to e) were overall upregulated in distal and, sporadically, also in proximal colon during DSS colitis.</s><s>These cytokines, except for Il-17, occasionally were slightly elevated at earlier time points.</s></p><p><s>However, Cxcl-1 and Il-17 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3a and c</ref>) showed a greater than two-fold increase of mRNA copy numbers in distal colon of Clca1 -/compared

mice, respectively.</s><s>Ifnγ showed a more than five-fold decrease in the distal colon of DSS-challenged Clca1 -/compared to WT at 24 and also at 48 h.</s><s>Expression of f Tff3 in distal Clca1

differentially expressed in one model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The prominently higher mRNA expression levels of Cxcl-1 and Il-17 in Clca1 -/-DSS colitis mice may point towards initial regulatory events.</s><s>This may become obvious on protein level at later time points as had been seen in the S. aureus pneumonia model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The increase (1.4 fold) of IL-17A in the Clca1 -/mice of the 7-d group may confirm this notion.</s></p><p><s>Despite being opposite to the S. aureus pneumonia model in which Cxcl-1 and Il-17 were decreased in Clca1 -/mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the DSS colitis data are in line with increased CXCL-1 responses following respiratory LPSchallenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Early Clca1-linked immune response modulation therefore seems to depend on the stimulus used.</s><s>As solely LPS-mediated Toll-like receptor 4 signaling seems to be important for neutrophil recruitment, control of bacterial translocation and epithelial repair in acute DSS colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, this model possibly shares similarities with the respiratory LPS challenge.</s></p><p><s>Our findings confirm the link of CLCA1 to early immune response modulation with a specific effect on Cxcl-1 and Il-17 albeit not decisive for clinical outcome.</s><s>Potentially overlapping effects of CLCA1, including anion conductance and cellular differentiation, will have to be taken into account when further deciphering the interaction of Clca1
