poor clinical condition precluding aggressive chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, there is a strong need for new, effective and well-tolerated treatment approaches.</s><s>An interesting alternative approach may be photodynamic therapy (PDT) which is already in clinical use for the treatment of barret's dysplasia and esophageal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28)</ref>.</s><s>besides elimination of the neoplastic tissue, PDT treatment may also decrease the risk of esophageal stricture and perforation.</s><s>Moreover, technological improvements (e.g., light emitting fabrics or optical fibers), enabled a rapid progress in the field of PDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(29)</ref>.</s><s>However, there is still a need for new and highly effective photosensitizers.</s><s>In a previous study we proposed tetra-triethyleneoxysulfonylsubstituted zinc phthalocyanine as a promising photosensitizer for photodynamic treatment of different types of gastrointestinal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we focused on the suitability and effectiveness of a PDT treatment with the novel ZnPc in human esophageal cancer of either adenocarcinomatous or squamous cell carcinomatous histology.</s></p><p><s>PDT efficiency is highly dependent on the photophysical properties of the employed PS as well as on its intracellular accumulation and distribution in the target cells/tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31)</ref>.</s><s>for example, Shao et al and Tynga et al showed that comparable ZnPc primarily accumulates in mitochondria and lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33)</ref>.</s><s>Employing confocal laser microscopy, we could demonstrate a time-and dose-dependent uptake of non-photoactivated ZnPc in esophageal cancer cells of both entities.</s><s>However, in contrast to the above-mentioned studies, we observed rather homogeneous cytoplasmic distribution of PS in both cell lines.</s><s>nonetheless, photoactivation of ZnPc caused ROS formation not only in the cytoplasm but also in mitochondria and nucleus, pointing to its high phototoxic potential.</s></p><p><s>The particular PDT protocols have a great impact on the therapy outcome and differ from one cancer type to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35)</ref>.</s><s>The time interval between the application of a photosensitizer and subsequent PDT is very important due to the different intracellular uptake kinetics of each particular photosensitizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(36)</ref>.</s><s>To estimate the optimal incubation time of ZnPc in esophageal cancer cells, different pre-incubation times (1-30 h) were evaluated.</s><s>We could show figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>. non-photoactivated ZnPc is non-toxic in vivo.</s><s>Animals were injected peritoneally with increasing doses of ZnPc (0.5-5 mg/kg) or naCl (0.9%) and were kept in light-protected cages.</s><s>(A) Continuous monitoring of the weight of the animals showed that they constantly kept or even slightly gained weight, as expected for these young animals, which were still in their growth phase.</s><s>(b) The organ coefficient is the ratio of the total weight of an animal divided by the weight of a respective organ (liver, spleen, kidney).</s><s>no significant differences in the organ coefficient of liver spleen and kidney were observed between control animals and ZnPc-treated animals, indicating that the organs did not become edematous or shrunken upon the treatment, underlining the non-toxic character of non-illuminated ZnPc.</s><s>Mean values ± SD of at least 3/group.</s><s>figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>. non-photoactivated ZnPc does not induce systemic inflammation.</s><s>Without photoactivation no significant change in the number of leukocytes of ZnPc-treated animals was observed, suggesting that the intraperitoneal injection of increasing doses of non-photoactivated ZnPc (0.5-5 mg/kg) does not induce any systemic inflammation.</s><s>Means ± SD of at least 3 animals/ group.</s><s>that approximately 24 h were required to achieve pronounced antineoplastic PDT-effects with ZnPc concentrations as low as 1 µM in EC cells.</s><s>Prolonging the incubation time to &gt;24 h did not further enhance the PDT outcome at this concentration, but the data also showed that at higher concentrations of the PS (5 µM) comparable results were achieved with much shorter pre-incubation times of only 10 h.</s><s>Thus for the determination of optimal treatment protocols for patients, it will be interesting to figure out the reasonable compromise between a preferably short preincubation time and a well-tolerated but still highly effective PS concentration.</s></p><p><s>To estimate the cytotoxic potential of ZnPc-PDT, proliferation studies were performed.</s><s>We observed a significant decrease in the cell number of esophageal adeno-and squamous cell carcinoma cells of ≥90% after ZnPc-PDT, showing that the treatment is working well in both histologies.</s><s>Kyse-140 cells seemed to be even more susceptible to the treatment, as shown by the lower IC 50 -value of ZnPc of 1.41 µM, as compared to 3.35 µM in OE-33 cells.</s><s>Another difference between squamous and adenocarcinoma cells became apparent when looking at the longevity of the PDT-induced growth inhibition.</s><s>While squamous Kyse-140 cells which escaped from being immediately killed by the initial PDT treatment did not seem to be able to (re-)proliferate in the following days, PDT-surviving adenocarcinomatous OE-33 cells started to re-grow 48 h after treatment.</s><s>This effect could be compensated by using higher concentrations of PS for the specific cell line.</s><s>further studies are required to reveal if specific cellular responses e.g., cell cycle regulation might play a role in the different behavior of the two cell types and the respective mode of action.</s></p><p><s>Generation and localization of free radicals and singlet oxygen species have a strong influence on the efficiency of PDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(37)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we demonstrated ROS formation in esophageal cancer cells by ZnPc-PDT for the first time.</s><s>by employing green and orange fluorescent dyes, which distinguish between free radical formation and localization in the cytoplasm (orange) or cell organelles such as the mitochondria or the nucleus (green), we observed a dose-dependent production of ROS after ZnPc-PDT in both esophageal carcinoma entities.</s><s>Prominent increases in the ROS production of Kyse-140 and OE-33 cells resulted in cell death rates of 70-90% already 24 h after PDT.</s><s>The increase in green fluorescence indicates ROS formation near or in the nucleus and mitochondria.</s><s>This notion may be of importance when deciphering the underlying signaling events and pathways of ZnPc-PDT in terms of apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(38)</ref>.</s><s>nucleus and mitochondria specific ROS formation was partially blocked by pre-incubation with the antioxidant vitamin C, supporting the idea that ROS formation may be of particular importance for the antiproliferative effects of the novel photosensitizer.</s><s>This is consistent with the findings of Grimm et al who investigated the influence of different exogenous antioxidants on melanoma cell proliferation after PDT with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-AlA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(39)</ref>.</s><s>After exposure to 5-AlA, human melanoma cells were incubated with vitamin C at different doses and then irradiated with light followed by a significant decrease of the cell death rate.</s></p><p><s>In the last decade, a significant progress has been made in the development of apoptosis-modulating cancer therapeutics which are currently examined in several human clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Most importantly, the induction of apoptosis, unlike necrosis, does not cause inflammation and is thus preferred over cytotoxic and necrotic treatment strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41)</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that PDT can induce apoptosis and in a previous study we demonstrated that ZnPc-PDT induced apoptotic cell death of gastrointestinal cancer cells.</s><s>However, it was unclear whether extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways were involved <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>In this study we investigated the changes in the expression of proteins associated with mitochondria-driven apoptosis.</s><s>Photoactivated ZnPc caused a downregulation of antiapoptotic bcl-2 and a concomitant upregulation of proapoptotic bax.</s><s>Importantly, an increase in cytochrome c was detected.</s><s>Together with the marked increase in caspase-3 activity, the data indicated that ZnPc-PDT induces a mitochondria-dependent, intrinsic induction of apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(38)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The main goal of PDT treatment is the elimination of the neoplastic tissue.</s><s>numerous studies on new photosensitizers showed their efficiency to eliminate cancer cells in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43)</ref>.</s><s>However, the therapeutic potential and suitability of a new PS can only be assessed in a combination of in vitro and respective in vivo studies.</s><s>In our in vivo model (CAM-assay), we showed strong antitumor effects of photoactivated ZnPc on esophageal tumor plaques, which were significantly smaller (&gt;70%) than ZnPc-untreated control tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(44)</ref>.</s><s>based on the encouraging data, it is at least conceivable that ZnPc-PDT will show equivalent effectiveness in animal models.</s></p><p><s>Destructive effects of PDT on the microvasculature are well known and have been successfully used for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization or age-related macular degeneration <ref type="bibr">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">46)</ref>.</s><s>In oncology, damage of tumor vascularity and blood flow stasis are significant aspects of PDT that contribute to tumor regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(47)</ref>.</s><s>However, it has been reported by Weiss et al that PDT-damaged vasculature can regenerate within 48 h after PDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr">45)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we also demonstrated that ZnPc-PDT exerts a destructive influence on the blood vessel formation and the microvasculature, but in contrast to the findings by Weiss et al these effects were comparably long-lasting, as even 72 h after treatment no regeneration of the vascular network of the CAM could be observed.</s><s>long-lasting antiangiogenic effects of enhanced PDT-treatment with ZnPc may be of particular importance if looking for suitable combination treatments in which the PDT is combined with chemotherapeutics that are antiangiogenic or whose antineoplastic potency depends on an antiangiogenic environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(48)</ref>.</s><s>last but not least, clinical safety, good tolerability and absence of toxicity in its non-photoactivated state (dark toxicity) are important features of appropriate photosensitizers.</s><s>Checking for dark toxic effects of the novel ZnPc in vitro and in vivo, we showed that non-photoactivated ZnPc does not affect cell survival or proliferation nor does it exhibit any sign of toxicity in in vivo experiments.</s><s>Testing embryonic survival of fertilized chicken eggs after intravenous application of ZnPc did not lead to signs of toxicity either.</s><s>Embryonic development as well as survival was not even affected by the highest doses of ZnPc.</s><s>In line with comparable results of Zhang et al, who investigated dark toxic effects of phthalocyanines we felt encouraged to perform first animal tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(22)</ref>.</s><s>young Wistar rats injected with ZnPc (0.5-5 mg/kg bodyweight) did not show signs of dark toxicity or incompatibility towards the non-photoactivated compound.</s><s>All animals behaved normally, did not show changes in water or food consumption and did not lose but even slightly gained weight during the experiment.</s><s>Even more important, the white blood cell count of ZnPc-treated animals did not differ significantly from control animals.</s><s>Moreover, no changes in the organ coefficients were observed, indicating that no inflammatory processes or organ specific disturbances occurred.</s><s>Taken together, the novel photosensitizer ZnPc appears to have an excellent biotolerability thus rendering it an interesting photosensitizer for further in vivo studies.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, in this study we showed the extraordinary potential of ZnPc for PDT-treatment of esophageal cancer.</s><s>Further in vivo investigations are warranted to estimate antitumor activity of photoactivated ZnPc in animal models.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>figure 5
