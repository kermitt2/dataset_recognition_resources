<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Saxe et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">de Vignemont and Singer, 2006)</ref> and has been related to a network of brain regions including the bilateral insula, the anterior cingulate and mid-cingulate cortex (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wicker et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for a quantitative meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies on empathy see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fan et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to this informative social influence (including the aforementioned phenomena: emotion anticipation, anticipatory emotion regulation and empathic responses) people tend to conform to the opinion of others because they want to behave correctly, obtain social approval or maintain a favorable self-concept (normative social influence; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Recent studies have shown that effects of group opinion on likeability and attractiveness ratings were related to activity in the ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berns et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Klucharev et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Klucharev et al. , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Zaki et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we investigated how emotional arousal ratings and physiological responses elicited by affective pictures are influenced by another person's communicated arousal rating in a one-to-one social interaction.</s><s>To this end, we invited two participants at a time and asked them to report their emotional arousal when confronted with affective pictures.</s><s>That is, participants rated how emotionally agitated they felt and then the rating was shown to the interaction partner.</s><s>Participants took turns in being the first or second rater.</s><s>In the position of the second rater (on which we specifically focused with regard to our research question), participants were influenced by the interaction partner's rating, which was shown before the picture.</s><s>Notably, our task distinguished the different phenomena involved (e.g.</s><s>emotion anticipation and empathic responses, and conformity) on the basis of the temporal sequence.</s><s>That is, emotion anticipation and empathy could be measured when participants were presented with the interaction partner's rating, whereas conformity played a role during picture rating.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that participants would align their arousal ratings to conform to the interaction partner's ratings.</s><s>This 'emotional conformity' or rather alignment should be accompanied by increased anticipatory activity in anterior insula when the interaction partner reports increased emotional arousal in response to an upcoming picture.</s><s>Specifically, we expected activity in anterior insula to correlate with the interaction partner's arousal ratings.</s><s>On the basis of the recent reports on the neural correlates of conformity, we hypothesized that social influence on an individual's emotional experience would be reflected in altered neural activity in the ventral striatum and in emotion processing regions such as the amygdala.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactive rating task and stimulus material</head><p><s>To investigate how emotional arousal is influenced by another person's arousal ratings, we used an interactive rating task.</s><s>In this task, participants rated their emotional arousal elicited by affective pictures together with an interaction partner.</s><s>Both participantsone inside and one outside the MRI scannertook turns in being the first or second rater.</s><s>In the position of the second rater ('second-rater' condition), they first saw the rating of the interaction partner and then the picture.</s><s>Importantly, participants could anticipate how emotionally aroused they would feel on the basis of the interaction partner's rating.</s><s>Emotional arousal was measured because it is easier to compare emotional arousal with an interaction partner than comparing emotional valence or the quality of a specific emotion (such as fear and disgust).</s></p><p><s>Pictures were taken from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS, <ref type="bibr">Lang et al., 2005)</ref> based on their mean normative ratings for valence and arousal, which are given on a nine-point scale in the technical manual.</s><s>We selected 90 negative/unpleasant and emotionally arousing pictures (valence: M ¼ 2.69, s.d.</s><s>¼ 0.90; arousal: M ¼ 6.04, s.d.</s><s>¼ 0.69) and 54 neutral pictures (valence: M ¼ 5.25, s.d.</s><s>¼ 0.55; arousal: M ¼ 3.10, s.d.</s><s>¼ 0.55).</s><s>Negative pictures displayed threatening scenes, objects, animals or wounded people (44.44% of the negative pictures were threat-related, 11.11% represented sad and 44.44% represented disgust pictures) 1 .</s><s>Neutral stimuli consisted of pictures of household objects, landscapes, buildings, animals and social gatherings.</s></p><p><s>To reliably generate three different conditions for the second rater, the rating of the interaction partner (i.e. the 'other' person) was predetermined: (i) ratings could be two points lower than the original IAPS norm rating of the respective picture (underestimation ¼ 'negative under' condition), (ii) equal to the original IAPS norm rating ( ¼ 'negative equal' condition) or (iii) two points higher than the original IAPS norm rating (overestimation ¼ 'negative over' condition).</s><s>Importantly, pictures in the different conditions were in fact matched on the basis of the IAPS norm ratings.</s><s>In addition to these three 'second rater' conditions with negative pictures, our task also included a neutral second-rater condition ('neutral').</s><s>Because 1 We used the following neutral and negative IAPS pictures <ref type="bibr">(Lang et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr">): Neutral: 1602</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2038</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2191</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2272</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2358</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2383</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2385</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2393</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2396</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2397</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2435</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2480</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2485</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2513</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2514</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2516</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2560</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2570</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2580</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2595</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2630</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2745</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2749</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2791</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2840</ref><ref type="bibr">, 5410, 5500, 5510, 5520, 5530, 5531, 5635, 5740, 7000, 7004, 7009, 7010, 7025, 7035, 7041, 7050, 7057, 7060, 7100, 7130, 7150, 7175, 7190, 7217, 7233, 7235, 7500, 7710, 9210.

see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Meshi et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schilbach et al., 2013a)</ref>.</s><s>Participants were influenced by the interaction partner's appraisals, although they might have been aware that there are great individual differences in emotional reactivity between people.</s><s>That is, people usually respond differently to affective pictures, and one can never be sure for a given picture whether the interaction partner would respond as 'most people would' to that specific image (although participants in our study were all students, of same sex and similar age and, thus, might have perceived each other as similar).</s><s>In contrast, subjects in our study experienced that the interaction partner reported a higher or lower emotional arousal than most other people would in two-thirds of the cases.</s><s>In sum, our study investigating the modulation of emotional arousal using the interactive rating task should have a high ecological validity and allowed us to also investigate effects of emotion anticipation in addition to the examination of conformity effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anticipatory responses to a reported emotional experience</head><p><s>During the picture anticipation phase, the interaction partner's ratings correlated positively with activity in a network of brain regions comprising the bilateral anterior insula extending into IFG and DLPFC.</s><s>That is, the more negative the rating of the interaction partner was, the more activity occurred in this network.</s><s>Activation of this network has been observed when participants were presented with a cue indicating that another person receives a painful stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Singer et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>In our experimental paradigm, the interaction partner's rating not only indicated the other person's emotional response but also served as a social cue that helped to anticipate the upcoming affective stimulus.</s><s>A number of studies showed that the anterior insula is involved in anticipation of aversive stimuli elicited by non-social cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Herwig et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carlson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Simmons et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Denny et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Anticipation of high arousing pictures in our study was also accompanied by increased skin conductance.</s></p><p><s>Investigating effects of conformity with regard to likability ratings of music songs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berns et al.

(2010)</ref>, for instance, argue that striatal activity is related to reward when participants agree with the opinion of others.</s><s>Activity in ventral striatum has also been associated with the processing of prediction errors, that is, discrepancies between expectations and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Schultz, 2006</ref>; with regard to aversive emotional events see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Delgado et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, previous studies on social conformity have interpreted striatal activity signaling the need for 'going along' with a group opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Klucharev et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we found a negative correlation between activity in ventral striatum and the interaction partner's ratings.</s><s>Although participants agreed with their interaction partners' ratings in all conditions (i.e. in both over-and underestimations), the need for going along with the other person's opinion was greater the (unexpectedly) lower the rating of the interaction partner was (e.g. in trials of the negative under condition that led to emotional downregulation).</s><s>This result has to be interpreted in the context of our interactive rating task.</s><s>As mentioned earlier, our interactive rating task differed from previous conformity tasks in which participants received social information about a stimulus 'after' forming their own opinion of it.</s><s>Here, participants received social information 'before' seeing an affective picture, which might have enabled the aforementioned anticipatory processes.</s><s>Therefore, we do not only interpret activity in the ventral striatum with respect to social reward elicited by the agreement with others but also with respect to emotional downregulation.</s><s>Although amygdala and ventral striatum activity cannot be interpreted as pure markers of negative and less-negative (or positive) emotion (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Paton et al., 2006)</ref>, recent meta-analyses suggest that activity in amygdala and activity in the ventral striatum are biased toward negative and positive affective experience, respectively (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wager et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In sum, our results indicate that emotional alignment as found in our study differs from other types of conformity.</s></p><p><s>Our study makes predictions for generalizations from the current design that should be tested in future studies.</s><s>First, because we focused on negative emotion (in contrast to the conformity studies that investigated positive affective phenomena such as likability and attractiveness), it would be interesting to also investigate the social modulation of positive emotion.</s><s>Second, it should be noted that participants in our study interacted with each other by communicating their emotional arousal on a verbally labeled scale.</s><s>In real-life social interactions, however, emotional alignment may often include non-verbal communication (e.g.</s><s>gesture, emotional facial expressions, prosody).</s><s>Thus, future studies should clarify whether verbal and non-verbal types of social alignment differ from each other.</s><s>Third, emotional alignment could be investigated from the perspective of cue integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zaki, 2013)</ref>, which suggests that Bayesian inference provides a benchmark for understanding social information processing as it does for physical perception.</s><s>For example, if people receive ratings about affective pictures from two different persons, they should update their estimates of the other persons' reliabilitya process that has been associated with the ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Klucharev et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Meshi et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The ratings from the two persons should then be integrated according to their reliability.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>Our study is one of the first that could show emotional alignment in a social setting, that is, an effect of social influence on emotional arousal exerted by a single interaction partner.</s><s>The tendency to emotionally align was related to activity in bilateral anterior insula/IFG, and DLPFC in anticipation of the pictures.</s><s>This anticipatory neural activity was positively correlated with individual differences in reappraisal use.</s><s>During picture viewing, social influence was reflected in altered neural activity in ventral striatum in response to the interaction partner's ratings.</s><s>Our approach is in concordance with the recent proposal of an interaction-based 'second person' approach to social neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Schilbach et al., 2013b)</ref>.</s><s>This approach stresses that social cognition is fundamentally different when people are in interaction with others rather than merely observing a social interaction.</s><s>For example, reciprocally engaging in eye contact with another person differs conceptually and neurally from passively perceiving the eye gaze of another person.</s><s>Our task mirrored a social interaction, in which participants exchanged their opinion about an affective picture via ratings.</s><s>Taken together, by showing that people integrate information from others into their own emotional appraisals and by investigating the neural correlates of such an emotion alignment in a social interaction, our study is in line with that 'second person' approach to and provides a step toward investigating real-time social encounters in a truly interactive manner.</s><s>Because social influenceability, emotion regulation and the tendency to communicate about emotion differ between cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bond and Smith, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Leersnyder et al., 2013)</ref>, it would be interesting to use our interactive rating task to also investigate cultural differences.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 4 Changes in neural activity in the picture rating phase.</s><s>(A) BOLD signal changes in bilateral amygdala correlated positively with own arousal ratings in all conditions.</s><s>(B) Left panel: BOLD signal changes correlated negatively with the interaction partner's ratings (displayed in the anticipation phase) in bilateral ventral striatum.</s><s>Right panel: We plotted parameter estimates (mean and standard error of the mean in arbitrary units) within the functional ROI in the three second-rater conditions.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,319.64,353.65,240.46,253.47" type="bitmap" /></figure>
