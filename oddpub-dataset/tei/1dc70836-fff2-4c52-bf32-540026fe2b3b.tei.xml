<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Current concepts of depression are largely based on cognitive theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> according to which depression is characterized by a negative bias in perception.</s><s>In line with this notion, there is substantial empirical evidence showing that perception in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by blunted responsiveness to emotionally positive information as well as an increased tendency to perceive emotionally neutral visual information as negative <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A critical point for the understanding of the etiological and developmental aspects of MDD is the question whether such a negative bias represents a stable vulnerability factor which persists beyond a depressive episode.</s><s>In this case the trait-like characteristic of a negative bias could prove useful for the identification of persons at risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>If, in contrast, a negative bias is confined to the depressive episode, it could serve as a state marker for MDD, for instance to objectively monitor treatment responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Previous research has yielded heterogeneous results regarding temporal stability of such a negative perceptual bias.</s><s>In some studies biased emotion recognition was observed even after recovery from major depressive episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, while other studies reported a reduced negative perceptual bias and improved emotion discrimination after symptom remission <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Two important factors may primarily account for the inconsistencies between previous studies.</s><s>Firstly, the ability to differentiate between state and trait markers of MDD crucially depends on the experimental design.</s><s>In a number of previous studies perceptual biases in remitted MDD patients were compared to never-depressed healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>A more direct assessment of the temporal stability of perceptual biases would be provided by a repeated-measures design in which patients with MDD are tested during a depressive episode and after remission.</s><s>With this approach, the development of a perceptual bias can be directly related to the development of depressive symptomatology.</s><s>A second important factor is the stimulus material used to probe biased perceptual processing of emotional information in MDD.</s><s>In several previous studies, participants were exposed to face stimuli displaying emotional expressions at full intensities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, to schematic faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> or to drawings of facial expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Misclassifications of emotional expressions of such stimuli may lack the sensitivity to capture altered emotion processing in MDD.</s><s>Greater sensitivity can be achieved by varying the intensity of the facial expression including rather subtle changes in emotional expressions.</s><s>Recognition of such subtle expressions is more closely related to emotion recognition in everyday life, since emotions displayed by others are usually less intense than in standard face stimulus sets.</s><s>The use of morphed emotional faces can yield relevant information on the nature of biased emotion perception along a particular dimension (e.g. for the transition from happy to sad expressions).</s><s>Moreover, such an approach can also help to differentiate whether impairments in emotion recognition are due to misclassification of ambiguous expressions, that is, a shift in categorical emotion recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, or rather a general uncertainty in emotion recognition.</s><s>The latter would be reflected by a flattened response pattern.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, the stability of the MDD-related perceptual bias in the recognition of subtle changes in emotional face expressions has not yet been tested in a repeated-measures design.</s></p><p><s>In the current study we investigated the temporal stability of negative perceptual bias in patients with MDD.</s><s>We used a repeated-measures design, in which patients were tested during a depressive episode (T1) and three months later (T2).</s><s>In a forced-choice task, participants were asked to indicate the valence of expressions of face stimuli that varied with respect to their degree of expressed happiness or sadness.</s><s>In line with previous research, we expected biased emotion recognition in patients with MDD in comparison to healthy participants at T1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>For the comparison between the two time points, we hypothesized that an unchanged perceptual bias at T2 would represent a stable trait marker of MDD, whereas a reduction in negative perceptual bias from T1 to T2 would argue for a state marker.</s></p><p><s>A second focus of our study was the question whether a negative perceptual bias in emotion recognition may be related to previously reported biases in automatic emotion processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In line with this notion we recently found that faces with sad expressions had privileged access to awareness compared to happy faces in patients with MDD, indicating an automatic bias towards negative emotional stimuli in MDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study we therefore included a second task that probed the effects of emotional expressions on the potency of face stimuli to gain access to awareness.</s><s>The purpose of this task was to investigate whether a negative bias in the recognition of morphed emotional expressions-reflecting the conscious evaluation of the stimuli-would correlate with preferential access of negative emotional information to awareness-reflecting automatic stages of visual information processing.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>Experiment 1: Emotion recognition.</s><s>Each trial began with the presentation of a face on a grey background in the center of the screen.</s><s>After 1000 ms the face was removed from the screen.</s><s>Participants were instructed to indicate via key press whether they judged the face to display a happy or a sad expression.</s><s>They were informed that there might be ambiguous expressions, but that they should always decide whether it was a rather happy or rather sad face.</s></p><p><s>Right and left arrow keys on the keyboard were marked with a happy and a sad schematic face, respectively.</s><s>Participants were instructed to press the button as soon as they had made a decision, but without time pressure.</s><s>After the participant had pressed a key and an additional inter-stimulus-interval of 2000 ms, the next trial followed.</s><s>If no key was pressed, the next trial followed after 20 s.</s><s>Each of the eleven morph increments was presented 16 times, i.e., each face identity twice in one morph increment which amounts to a total of 176 trials.</s><s>Participants were excluded if their hit rate was below 75% in one of the 100% conditions.</s><s>Four control participants and none of the depressed patients were excluded according to this criterion, resulting in a final sample of n = 26 patients and n = 24 healthy control participants at T1.</s><s>For T2, this exclusion criterion led to a final sample size of n = 21 patients and n = 20 control participants.</s></p><p><s>Experiment 2: Access to awareness.</s><s>The experimental design of experiment 2 largely resembled the design of a previous study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>It was originally based on a behavioral study in healthy volunteers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Stimuli were displayed on a grey background.</s><s>During the experiment, two white-line squares (8.5°x 8.5°) were presented side by side on the screen and were viewed through the mirror stereoscope such that only one square was visible to each eye.</s><s>In the center of each square a white fixation cross (0.5°x 0.5°) was displayed.</s><s>Participants were asked to maintain stable fixation during the experiment.</s><s>The experiment comprised a continuous-flashsuppression (CFS) condition, in which high-contrast Mondrian-like pattern masks <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> measuring 8.3°x 8.3°were flashed to one eye at a frequency of 10 Hz, while a face stimulus (2.5°x 3.6°) was faded-in to the other eye in one of the four quadrants of the display.</s><s>The contrast of the face stimulus was ramped up slowly from 0% to 100% within a period of 2 s to ensure invisibility of the face at the beginning of each trial, and then remained constant until the participant made a response on a computer keyboard (keys F, J, V and N) indicating the face's location.</s><s>The high-contrast Mondrian-like pattern mask was faded out by linearly decreasing its contrast from 2 s until the end of each trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> unlike the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> where the mask was stopped abruptly at the end of each trial.</s><s>Observers were instructed to respond as fast and as accurately as possible as soon as any part of the face became visible.</s><s>Yet another difference to the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was that no fearful faces were included, as no effect had been shown for fearful faces in this earlier study.</s><s>In addition to CFS, a control condition was used that did not involve binocular rivalry.</s><s>Control trials started with the presentation of only a flashing Mondrian pattern to one eye.</s><s>A face stimulus was then shown in one of the four possible locations as in the CFS condition, but with full contrast and to both eyes at a random time between 2 and 8 s after trial onset.</s><s>Note that the control condition was not designed to match the CFS condition perceptually, but merely to control for possible systematic between-group differences in reaction times to the appearance of faces with different emotional expressions.</s><s>Both CFS and control trials ended after the participant's key press.</s><s>CFS trials were discarded if no key was pressed within 10 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The inter-trial interval was 2 s.</s><s>The experiment started with a short training block.</s><s>The whole experiment comprised 216 trials (144 CFS and 72 control trials) split up into six blocks.</s><s>CFS and control trials were intermixed randomly within each block.</s><s>For a more detailed description be referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>Sample characteristics.</s><s>In order to test for between-group differences in age and verbal intelligence, two-sample t-tests were performed.</s><s>Chi-square-test was used to probe differences in the proportion of male and female participants and Mann-Whitney U-tests for differences in years of education, training degree and score on the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI).</s></p><p><s>Experiment 1: Model selection.</s><s>The following models were fitted to each individual's responses to identify the model providing the best fit to the observed behavior.</s><s>For all models, participants' behavior was operationalized as the proportion of 'happy' responses for each respective morph step.</s><s>Firstly, logistic functions of the following form were fitted to each participant's individual manual responses on the basis of a non-linear least squares approach:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">f ðxÞ ¼ 1 1 þ e aðbÀxÞ<label>ð1Þ</label></formula><p><s>In this equation, a denotes the slope of the function and b denotes the point of subjective equality (PSE), that is, the location of the function on the continuum of the morphed faces from fully expressed sadness to happiness.</s><s>The two parameters allow for a specific characterization of participants' response profiles: The steepness of the slope (a) indicates participants' behavior in the transition from sad to happy faces.</s><s>A higher value for slope reflects a more abrupt switch from sad to happy.</s><s>The PSE (b) indicates the location of the inflection point of the fitted function, that is, the morphing step at which faces are equally often judged as happy and as sad.</s><s>It thus reflects each participant's criterion for the discrimination between happy vs. sad expressions.</s><s>Hence, the greater the PSE, the greater the proportion of the happy expression that the individual needs to judge the face as being happy.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, we fitted logistic functions with four parameters to participants' behavioral responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the two-parameter model explained above, the lower (c) and upper asymptotes (d) of the logistic curves are included in the model as free parameters:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f ðxÞ ¼ d þ c À d 1 þ x b À Á a<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p><s>Thirdly, we performed linear regressions between the logit of participants' responses and the corresponding morph steps with β 0 being the intercept and β 1 being the slope of the regression line:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">f ðxÞ ¼ b 0 þ b 1 Ã log x 1 À x<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p><s>To identify the most appropriate model, the goodness of fit of each model was assessed on the basis of R² values adjusted for degrees of freedom, that is, for the number of parameters of the respective model.</s><s>To this end, individual R² values were transformed to z-values using Fisher's z transformation, averaged across all participants and time points, and finally transformed back to R² values.</s><s>According to this procedure, the linear regression model (Eq (3), R² = 0.844) was clearly outperformed by the logistic models, for which the four-parameter model (Eq (2), R² = 0.949;
