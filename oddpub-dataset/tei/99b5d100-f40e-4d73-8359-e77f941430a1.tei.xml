<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>A total of 18 postlingually deafened adults participated in this study; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for patient demographics.</s><s>Participants ranged in age from 32 to 81 years old (mean age 62 [SD 15] years).</s><s>All were experienced bimodal users, unilaterally implanted with the Advanced Bionics (AB) HiRes 90K implant by surgeons from 4 different CI teams in The Netherlands.</s><s>All participants had used their CI for at least 6 months prior to this study (mean 4 [SD 3.5] years).</s><s>All participants used either the AB Naída Q70 or Q90 sound processor in daily life.</s><s>In the study, all participants used the AB Naída Q90 sound processor to gain access to the bimodal beamforming function "Stereozoom" (Phonak, Sonova Netherlands, Vianen, The Netherlands).</s><s>In addition, all had open-set speech recognition of at least 70% correct phonemes at 65 dB SPL on the clinically used Dutch consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) word lists <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Bosman and Smoorenburg, 1995]</ref> with the CI alone.</s><s>Only participants with unaided hearing thresholds in the nonimplanted ear of ≥80 dB HL at 250 Hz were included.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the unaided audiograms of the nonimplanted ear of the individual participants.</s><s>All participants used an HA prior to the study, which was replaced by the Phonak Naída Link UP HA for the tests in the study.</s><s>All participants were native Dutch speakers who signed an informed consent letter before participating in the study.</s><s>The approval of the Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre was obtained (protocol No. METC306849).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HA and CI Fitting</head><p><s>The HA was fitted with the Phonak bimodal-fitting formula, a special prescriptive fitting formula for bimodal hearing which was developed for this HA.</s><s>This formula differs from more standard-   fitting formulas in 3 aspects: the frequency response, the loudness growth, and the dynamic compression.</s><s>Firstly, this formula aims to align the frequency response by optimizing low-frequency gain and bandwidth.</s><s>Low-frequency gain optimization uses the model of effective audibility to ensure audibility of speech recognition in quiet environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Ching et al., 2001]</ref>.</s><s>Frequency bandwidth is optimized, making frequencies between 250 and 750 Hz audible <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Sheffield and Gifford, 2014]</ref>, to maximal width <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Neuman and Svirsky, 2013]</ref>, and amplification does not extend into presumed dead regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Zhang et al., 2014]</ref>.</s><s>Secondly, the loudness growth is aligned by implementing the input-output function of the CI in the HA.</s><s>Thirdly, the dynamic compression behavior is aligned by porting the Naída CI dual-loop AGC into the HA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Veugen et al., 2016]</ref>.</s><s>The Naída Link HA is able to communicate wirelessly with the AB Naída CI Q90 and Q70.</s><s>With the Q90, the communication is extended to obtain a narrow binaural beamformer, the Stereozoom.</s><s>This beamformer combines the 4 omnidirectional microphones from the Phonak Naída Link HA and the AB Naída CI Q90.</s><s>First, on each side, the 2 microphones are processed to obtain a standard dual microphone system.</s><s>These directional signals are then exchanged over the wireless link between the HA and the CI.</s><s>Utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function, the HA and the CI then linearly combine the ipsilateral and contralateral directional signals to create a binaural directivity.</s><s>The binaural beamwidth is controlled by the weighting function, and is typically narrower than what a simple monaural 2-microphone beamformer is able to achieve.</s><s>No fine-tuning of the HA or volume adjustments were performed.</s></p><p><s>For the test session the participant's current "daily" CI program was used, which was made during clinical programming.</s><s>The participants had been using their current CI program for 10 months (SD 6 months) on average before the start of the study.</s><s>The method of CI programming, completed clinically before study participation, was as follows.</s><s>The upper electrical current levels (M-levels) were set to a most comfortable level for each individual electrode through an ascending loudness judgment procedure.</s><s>Subsequently, electrodes were checked for equal loudness between them.</s><s>The minimum current levels (T-levels) were set to threshold levels measured for 0% detection on each individual electrode.</s><s>Threshold levels were obtained using an ascending presentation, followed by a standard bracketing procedure.</s><s>After that, the overall level of the M-level profile was adjusted to make live speech sound comfortable and easily understandable.</s><s>Additional fine-tuning of the T-and M-level profiles were applied based on the feedback of the CI user and the professional judgement of the clinical audiologist.</s><s>Noise reduction algorithms on the CI (ClearVoice, WindBlock, SoundRelax) and HA (Noise-Block, SoundRelax, WindBlock) were turned off during the test sessions.</s><s>Omnidirectional microphone modes were used for conditions 1-4.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Procedures</head><p><s>This prospective study used a "within-subjects repeated-measures" design.</s><s>Two factors were used: listening modality (CI only, bimodal, binaural beamformer), and speaker location (S0 or S-45/45).</s><s>The study consisted of 1 visit in which speech-in-noise tests were performed for 6 different combinations of factors mentioned above: (1) CI only, S0, (2) CI only, S-45/45, (3) bimodal, S0, (4) bimodal, S-45/45, (5) binaural beamformer, S0, and (6) binaural beamformer, S-45/45) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The order of the 6 conditions was randomized to prevent any order effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Test Environment and Materials</head><p><s>Dutch speech material developed at the VU Medical Centre <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Versfeld et al., 2000]</ref> was used for testing speech recognition in noise.</s><s>From this speech material, unrelated sentences were selected.</s><s>A list of 20 sentences was presented at a fixed level of 70 dB SPL for each test condition.</s><s>This level is representative for a raised voice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[Pearsons et al., 1977]</ref> in background noise.</s><s>The sentences were presented in a reception babble noise.</s><s>We scored the correct words per sentence per list.</s><s>An adaptive procedure was used to find the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), targeting at a score of 50% correct words (speech reception threshold [SRT]).</s><s>For each condition and  each participant, a list with 20 sentences was randomly selected from a total of 25 lists.</s><s>An extensive description of the speech reception in noise test is given in the paper by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dingemanse and Goedegebure [2015]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For the static condition, sentences were presented from a loudspeaker that was located at 1 m at 0° azimuth for conditions 1, 3, and 5.</s><s>For the dynamic condition, sentences were presented randomly from a loudspeaker at -45° or 45° for conditions 2, 4, and 6, reflecting frequently occurring social situations in which a listener has to understand speech coming from &gt; 1 location.</s><s>Four uncorrelated reception babble noises were presented with 4 loudspeakers located at -45°, 45°, -135°, and 135° azimuth.</s><s>The rationale for this loudspeaker set-up was to simulate a diffuse, uncorrelated noise that exists in typical noisy daily life situations.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> displays a schematic of the test environment.</s></p><p><s>All testing was performed in a sound-attenuated booth.</s><s>Participants were seated 1 m in front of a loudspeaker.</s><s>For the speechin-noise tests, research equipment was used consisting of a Roland UA-1010 soundcard and a fanless Amplicon PC.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>An a priori power analysis was performed with a required power of 0.8 and a significance criterion of 0.05, using the Wilcoxon singed-rank test with G*Power software.</s></p><p><s>For speech perception, we decided to choose a difference of ≥15% as clinically significant.</s><s>With a slope of the psychometric function of 7.5%/dB on average, the difference between 2 test conditions must be ≥2 dB to be clinically significant.</s><s>We planned paired comparisons between several test conditions.</s><s>With a minimum of 2 dB between groups the effect size, d z is 0.71.</s><s>With these input parameters, the required number of participants is 15.</s></p><p><s>Data interpretation and analysis were performed with SPSS v23.</s><s>Due to the low number of participants, nonparametric statistical methods were used.</s><s>For the speech recognition in noise, the Friedman test was used to compare SRT over all listening conditions.</s><s>Afterwards, post hoc comparisons with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed.</s><s>We used the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate for multiple comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The results for the speech recognition in noise test are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Significantly different SRT were found across the listening conditions (Friedman test: χ 2 (5) = 42.9, p &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>Post hoc comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the S0 condition showed no significant difference between the bimodal and the CI- only condition (Z = -1.76,</s><s>p = 0.11), but a significant improvement was found for the binaural beamformer condition compared with the bimodal condition (4.7 dB, Z = -3.55,</s><s>p &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>For the S45/-45 condition, a significant improvement of the SRT was found for the bimodal condition compared with the CI-only condition (3.1 dB, Z = -3.11,</s><s>p = 0.005), while no significant difference was found between the bimodal condition and the binaural beamformer (Z = -1.67,</s><s>p = 0.11).</s><s>Comparing the results of the 2 different loudspeaker set-ups (S0 and S45/-45), the binaural beamformer provided a significantly better SRT for the frontal target speech than the dynamic speech condition (3.3 dB, Z = -3.20,</s><s>p = 0.004).</s><s>For the bimodal hearing and CI-only condition, no difference between the 2 loudspeaker conditions was found (Z = -1.33 [p = 0.184] and -1.98 [p = 0.08], respectively).</s><s>Reported p values were corrected for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> shows the SRT scores for the individual participants for the static and dynamic listening conditions.</s><s>SRT scores varied largely among participants, from 0 to 20 dB; however, almost all participants showed the same pattern between the listening conditions.</s><s>Only a few participants did not show a benefit for the binaural beamformer condition, and in 2 participants, the binaural beamformer deteriorated the SRT for the dynamic and/ or static condition.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit of a binaural directional beamforming algorithm for bimodal CI users in term of better SRT for the frontal speech target signal.</s><s>This is in agreement with our hypothesis.</s><s>Speech was within the spot of the beamformer, and the noise sources, coming from other directions, were attenuated.</s><s>Our results are comparable with the HA-only studies investigating the effect of binaural beamformers, where improvements in SNR were also found, together with large variability between participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Best et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kidd et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Neher et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Picou et al., 2014]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results suggest that directionality reduces the localization performance of the participants, as no improvement was found in a more dynamic listening condition which is a more demanding task in terms of sound localization.</s><s>Most probably, the listeners could not localize the sound source optimally, as their face was not turned towards it, leaving the target source outside the spot of the beamformer.</s><s>These results are comparable with the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Best et al. [2015]</ref>, who also found reduced SNR for dynamic speech targets.</s><s>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Picou et al. [2014]</ref>, a deterioration in localization ability was found.</s></p><p><s>The bimodal hearing test condition was tested with the omnidirectional microphone mode to maximize the localization ability for the dynamic speech target.</s><s>However, it is possible that with a conventional directional micro- phone mode in the CI and the HA, separately, a better SNR would have been found, especially for the frontal target signal.</s><s>Future research with comparisons of different directional microphone algorithms is needed to provide more data as to in which situations which algorithm provides the largest benefit for bimodal CI users.</s><s>We chose to evaluate the effect of this binaural beamformer with the settings of the HA according to the clinical recommendations of the manufacturer, in order to be able to mimic daily clinical practice as much as possible.</s><s>One of these recommendations is the use of the specially developed bimodal fitting rule, which we used in this study.</s><s>However, although all different subparts of this fitting rule are based on scientific research <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Ching et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Neuman and Svirsky, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sheffield and Gifford, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Veugen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhang et al., 2014]</ref>, the effect on auditory functioning of the bimodal fitting formula as a whole has not been tested before.</s><s>We found a relatively small effect of bimodal hearing compared to in the CI-only condition.</s><s>A possible explanation could be that this is not the optimal fitting formula for all participants.</s><s>Further investigations into this specially developed HA fitting formula and its effect on bimodal hearing are needed.</s><s>Another limitation of the study is that we only tested the effect of the binaural beamformer in experimental conditions.</s><s>Future studies should also contain field studies to evaluate if the found effect of the beamformer is consistent with the experiences of participants in their normal daily life.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>The use of a binaural beamformer for bimodal CI users significantly improves the SNR for frontal target speech.</s><s>Therefore, application of this binaural beamformer for bimodal users is an effective way to deal with challenging listening conditions, as it optimally uses hearing capacities while enhancing the SNR.</s><s>However, counseling CI users about the function of this binaural beamformer is very important, as they need to know where the target signal is coming from to be able to obtain the optimal benefit.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>The hearing thresholds of the individual participants for the ear with the hearing aid.</s><s>The dashed line displays the mean hearing loss.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,326.77,75.48,199.44,154.32" type="bitmap" /></figure>
