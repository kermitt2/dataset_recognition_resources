<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Relapse of the underlying disease is a major drawback of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) evolved from MDS, in particular as a consequence of the increasing numbers of HSCT with reduced intensity conditioning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>As in other diseases, there is no defined standard approach to the management of post-transplant relapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>5]<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> However, a specified analysis for MDS was usually not performed, or included only limited numbers of patients.</s><s>Hence, no largescale analysis of risk factors, different treatment strategies and outcomes of MDS relapse after HSCT is available.</s><s>The Chronic Malignancies Working Party (CMWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) performed a retrospective, registry-based analysis on adults with hematological relapse after allogeneic HSCT.</s><s>Data are intended to serve as a baseline and comparison for future trials using innovative approaches.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>Inclusion criteria for patients from the CMWP registry comprised: (i) first allogeneic HSCT for MDS or sAML, using matched related, mismatched related or matched unrelated donors; (ii) age at HSCT ≥18 years; (iii) first hematological relapse after transplant (excluding decreasing chimerism or cytogenetic/molecular relapse); and (iv) reliable documentation about the management of posttransplant relapse.</s><s>Patients had agreed to reporting data to national and international registries before transplantation.</s><s>The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical Faculty, University of Essen.</s><s>All procedures complied with the ethical standards of the responsible committees (institutional and national) and the revised version of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.</s></p><p><s>Based on the first treatment received during the first 6 months after relapse, three treatment groups were defined: (i) patients who did not receive any cellular therapy; (ii) patients who received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI); and (iii) patients who underwent a second allogeneic HSCT (HSCT2).</s><s>The 6-month cutoff was chosen, since &gt;95% of HSCT2 and &gt;98% of DLI reported in published studies were performed within the first 6 months after relapse.</s><s>Hence, the cumulative use of these strategies, as well as the outcome of patients treated without cellular therapy, could be studied.</s><s>Patients who both received DLI and underwent a subsequent transplant proceeded to the DLI group, if HSCT2 was given &gt;90 days after DLI, because 90 days were regarded as sufficient to evaluate the effect of DLI.</s><s>Patients who received a second transplant &lt;90 days after DLI entered the HSCT2 cohort, since HSCT was considered as the decisive intervention for the long-term outcome.</s><s>Although being somewhat arbitrary, this classification enabled patients receiving both DLI and HSCT2 to be included in the analysis without uncontrolled bias.</s><s>Conditioning, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> and remission before HSCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> were defined as described previously.</s><s>As suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , the transfusion of peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow was defined as DLI, if no prior conditioning and no prophylactic immunosuppression was given, whereas HSCT2 was defined as infusion of donor peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow following a conditioning regimen and with prophylactic immunosuppression (refer to the Online Supplement for details).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p><s>Overall survival from relapse was the primary endpoint. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref></s><s>Variables considered included characteristics of patients and their disease, donors, transplant procedure, and relapse (see the Online Supplement for details).</s><s>Variables were compared among treatment groups, using the chisquare test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous ones.</s><s>In patients receiving DLI or HSCT2, cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality were analyzed by competing risks models, with the starting time being the moment of DLI/HSCT2.</s><s>In addition to the factors mentioned above, the characteristics of the DLI/HSCT2 were considered for risk analysis.</s><s>Outcomes of subgroups were compared using a log-rank test.</s><s>Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for multivariable analyses of factors for time-to-event endpoints.</s><s>Variables were included if considered relevant based on the univariate analysis (P-value &lt;0.2), or known to be so from the literature.</s><s>Patients with missing predictor data were included in the analysis by assigning them to separate categories of the pertaining variables.</s><s>Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are reported.</s><s>R Version 3.1.0,</s><s>packages 'survival', 'cmprsk' and 'mstate' <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> and SPSS versions 18 and 23 (SPSS Inc.</s><s>Chicago, IL, USA) were used.</s></p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">HSCT: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; RA: refractory anemia; RARS: refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts; RAEB: refractory anemia with excess of blasts; sAML: secondary acute myeloid leukemia. CR: complete remission. GvHD: graft-versus-host disease. *The 'no cellular therapy' group contained patients who never received cellular therapy due to early death, as well as patients whose follow-up was not long enough to ascertain if they had received cellular therapy or not. To avoid bias, only those patients were included into the comparison among treatment cohorts, of whom it was certain that they survived for ≥6 months from relapse and had not received any cellular treatment.** Patients initially classified as having RAEB-T have been classified as having sAML, using the current WHO definition of AML (≥ 20% blasts in the bone marrow).</note>
