<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Integration of family planning services into HIV care was implemented in South Africa as a core strategy aimed at reducing unintended pregnancies among childbearing women living with HIV.</s><s>However, it is unclear whether this strategy has made any significant impact at the population level.</s><s>This paper describes the prevalence and correlates of self-reported unplanned pregnancy among HIV-infected parturient women attending three large maternity centres in the Eastern Cape, South Africa.</s><s>We also compare unplanned pregnancy rates between HIV-infected parturient women already in care (who have benefitted from services' integration) and newly diagnosed parturient women (who have not benefitted from services' integration).</s><s>Methods: Drawing from the baseline data of the East London Prospective Cohort Study (ELPCS), data of 594 parturient women living with HIV in the Eastern Cape were included.</s><s>Chi-square statistics and binary logistics regression were employed to determine the correlates of unplanned pregnancy among the cohort.</s><s>Results: The prevalence of unplanned pregnancy was 71% (n = 422) with a higher rate among parturient women newly diagnosed during the index pregnancy (87%).</s><s>Unplanned pregnancy was significantly associated with younger age, single status, HIV diagnosis at booking, high parity and previous abortion.</s><s>Women who reported unplanned pregnancy were more likely to book late and have lower CD4 counts.</s><s>After adjusting for confounding variables, having one child and five to seven children (AOR = 2.2; CI = 1.3-3.1),</s><s>age less than 21 years (AOR = 3.3; CI = 1.1-9.8),</s><s>late booking after 27 weeks (AOR = 2.7; CI = 1.5-5.0),</s><s>not married (AOR = 4.3; CI = 2.7-6.8) and HIV diagnosis at booking (AOR = 3.0; CI = 1.6-5.8)</s><s>were the significant correlates of unplanned pregnancy in the cohort.</s><s>Conclusion: Unplanned pregnancy remains high overall among parturient women living with HIV in the region, however, with significant reduction among those who were exposed to integrated services.</s><s>The study confirms that integration of HIV care and family planning services is an important strategy to reduce unplanned pregnancy among women living with HIV.</s><s>The study's findings have significant implications for the elimination of mother-tochild transmission of HIV in South Africa.</s><s>Innovative interventions are needed to further consolidate and maximise the benefit of the integration of family planning services with HIV care.</s></p></div>
