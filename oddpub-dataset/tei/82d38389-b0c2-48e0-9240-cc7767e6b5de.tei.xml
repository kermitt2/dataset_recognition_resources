<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Through the correction procedure, the mean differences between reported and measured height and weight become remarkably smaller and thus the estimated prevalence rates are more accurate.</s><s>The corrected proportions for overweight and obesity are less under-reported, while the corrected proportions for underweight are less over-reported.</s><s>This holds except for the proportion of normal weight, which showed the smallest deviation before getting corrected and which is overestimated after the correction procedure.</s><s>For girls, the formula estimated with Model B (including linear terms and/or fractional polynomials of age and height r , or weight r as well as body perception (in three categories)) seems to result in the smallest discrepancies in weight status prevalence rates after correction, whereas for boys all models showed similar results.</s><s>ROC curves and AUCs confirmed that.</s><s>Thus, to simplify the correction procedure, the use of the formulas of Model B for girls and for boys is recommended.</s><s>The formula of Kurth and Ellert <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> , which directly corrects the prevalence rates of weight status showed the smallest difference.</s><s>However, for further analyses, e.g., analyses of association of weight status with socioeconomic status, correction on an individual level with a formula developed in this study is necessary.</s></p><p><s>The KiGGS study is part of the health monitoring system of the RKI.</s><s>Recently, a follow-up -KiGGS Wave 1 (2009-2012) -was carried out as a telephone-based survey.</s><s>The collected self-reports of height and weight need to be corrected in order to evaluate if the reported plateau of prevalence rates for overweight and obesity in children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> will be reflected by the current, nationwide KiGGS Wave 1 data.</s></p><p><s>In the validation process the formulas were tested out of sample.</s><s>This resulted in more accurate prevalence rates and shows that the formulas can also be used for other studies which have only collected self-reported height and weight from adolescents in the same age range.</s></p><p><s>In a previous comparison of adolescents' self-reported height and weight with measured data, the authors had identified age, gender, and body perception as main predictors of the difference <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> , and thus these factors were used for estimating the equations.</s><s>However, for studies in which no information about the body perception of the adolescents is collected, the equation which does not include body perception (Model E) could be used.</s><s>Furthermore, for estimation of the correction equations the exact age was used.</s><s>If only 1-year age groups are available in other studies, the authors recommend to use the mid-year value, for example for the age group of 11-year olds, 11.5 years should be entered into the correction formula.</s></p><p><s>The comparison of different correction formulas and statistical indices are focused on overweight and obesity and thus on high BMI values.</s><s>The correction is more accurate in girls even if they over-report their height and under-report their weight to a greater extent than boys.</s><s>An explanation might be that a satisfied body image leads to less under-reporting of weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> .</s><s>Due to the social desirability of thinness, which is a burden especially in girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref> , girls are more often unsatisfied with their body ('too fat': 55% of the girls vs. 36% of the boys;
