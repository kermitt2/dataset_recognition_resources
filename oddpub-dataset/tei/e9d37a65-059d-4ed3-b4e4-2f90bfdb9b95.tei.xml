<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation</head><p><s>Our results provide a perspective on why parents take their infant to the emergency department, highlighting that both parents and health care providers see neonates as in need of expedient, often same-day, care and that unilateral interventions are unlikely to be successful.</s><s>The finding that a majority of parents reached out to health care providers before making a decision to go to the emergency department suggests an opportunity to direct parents to other available resources.</s></p><p><s>Our results also show that, although parents have an opinion as to the severity of their infant's condition, they are uncertain.</s><s>This is likely a major contributor to the decision to seek care in the emergency department rather than in another health care setting.</s><s>This is reinforced by our finding that nearly half of respondents said they would have gone to their health care provider if they could have been seen the same day, whereas if the appointment were the next day, just over a quarter of respondents would have gone to their health care provider.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies showed that a high proportion of children have an identified primary care provider, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and our findings confirm this for the neonatal population.</s><s>In the current study, failure to ask whether the family had an appointment with their health care provider before discharge from the birth hospital was a missed opportunity to reinforce the importance of early postdischarge follow-up in nearly 20% of cases.</s><s>Like other investigators, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> we found that low-acuity presentations of gastrointestinal issues, including jaundice and problems with feeding or stooling, were the most frequent causes for emergency department visits, along with respiratory concerns, crying and rash.</s><s>Also consistent with the pediatric literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> repeated visits to the emergency department, often for the same issue, were frequent, even though most respondents reported having a health care provider for their baby.</s><s>This suggests that the emergency department consultation may not always provide complete reassurance or support for parental concerns.</s><s>The fact that most parents had seen their health care provider between discharge from the birth hospital and the emergency department visit indicates that an early appointment did not prevent presentation to the emergency department.</s><s>This may be in part due to the fact that, although most parents reported a high level of confidence for taking care of a sick or injured child, a large proportion were unsure of the severity of their infant's condition and believed that it was sufficiently urgent to warrant being seen the same day.</s><s>Even in cases in which parents thought that their infant's condition was not serious, many thought that being seen the same day was important.</s><s>This is consistent with previous studies indicating that parents, including those of children whose condition is triaged as nonurgent, have difficulty discerning the urgency of the situation and frequently report it as very/extremely urgent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>urthermore, even though the majority of parents sought advice before going to the emergency department, health care providers generally advised that the baby be seen in the emergency department, a trend that is well documented in older pediatric patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>ducation is often used to modify health behaviours, and there is evidence that education can affect rates of presentation to the emergency department in the infant population.</s><s>For example, a provincial public health prevention program focused on crying led to a decreased rate of emergency department presentation among infants less than 5 months of age. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>However, education alone may not be sufficient.</s><s>Our finding that parents of babies presenting with jaundice were more likely than other parents to have received information on hyperbilirubinemia may indicate that families were sensitized to the issue but were not well informed as to where to seek care.</s><s>Parents in our study had generally received</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OPEN</head><p><s>Research information on a broad range of topics, and they rated human-based resources, including more ready access to physicians or nurses, as potentially more helpful than further information-based resources, regardless of format.</s><s>This underlines the potential positive impact of health care providers in the care of infants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Conducting the survey in large hospitals may have affected the generalizability of our findings to more rural settings.</s></p><p><s>Although we knew the number of completed surveys and the number of potentially eligible neonates, we did not know the number of surveys distributed and could not calculate a true response rate.</s><s>We received surveys from 17.8% of all visits in the study period.</s><s>The surveyed population closely reflects the age <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and income 25 of Ontario parents, but the surveyed parents were somewhat more educated than average, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> which may represent a response bias.</s><s>There may have been selection bias in those who chose to complete the survey.</s><s>The fact that patients requiring resuscitation were excluded may have decreased our numbers of more severe presentations.</s></p><p><s>Recall bias may have affected answers to questions about more remote times, including pregnancy and visits to the emergency department with other children.</s><s>Comments by emergency department staff may have affected parents' interpretations of the seriousness of the illness compared to their decision to go to the emergency department.</s><s>Finally, all data were selfreported and could not be correlated to final diagnosis or assessed severity in the emergency department.</s></p></div>
