<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and population</head><p><s>The detailed objectives and procedures of the multicentre, cross-sectional RODAM (Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants) study have been published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In brief, we recruited 6385 Ghanaian adults, aged ≥18 years living in urban Ghana (Kumasi and Obuasi, n = 1619), rural Ghana (Ashanti Region, n = 946), Amsterdam (n = 1900), London (n = 1258), and Berlin (n = 662).</s><s>The primary aim of the RODAM study was to identify the relative contributions of demographic, socio-economic, psychosocial, lifestyle and (epi)genetic risk factors for obesity and type 2 diabetes in this West African population.</s><s>Data collection comprised an extensive general questionnaire applied by trained personnel, a series of qualitative interviews regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and a detailed documentation of the dietary habits.</s><s>Further, physical examinations were conducted and biological samples (fasting blood, urine) were drawn for biochemical, genetic, and epigenetic analysis.</s><s>Ethical approval was obtained from the local ethics committees at all study sites and all participants gave informed written consent.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> presents the flow diagram of excluded participants because of missing or implausible data, resulting in a sample size of 4543 participants for the characterisation of dietary behaviour and a sample size of 3905 participants for the examination of sociodemographic factors of pattern adherence.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nutritional assessment</head><p><s>The methods of dietary assessment and calculations of energy and nutrient intakes are provided in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>At all RODAM study sites, food intake was assessed with a standardised Food Propensity Questionnaire (Ghana-FPQ) that queries for the usual intake frequencies of food groups in the preceding 12 months.</s><s>The Ghana-FPQ covers 134 items and is based on the multi-language, semi-quantitative European Food Propensity Questionnaire (EFPQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, we incorporated typical Ghanaian foods that were identified in the Ghana Demographic and Heath Survey (2008, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>) and in previous studies among Ghanaians in Amsterdam (the GHAIA study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>) and urban Ghana <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Common Ghanaian household utensils facilitated standardised description of portion sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>To estimate the usual daily intake of foods in grams per day we combined intake frequencies with standard portion sizes.</s><s>For European foods, portion sizes of the EFPQ were applied and for Ghanaian items, we conducted 24 h-dietary recalls (24hDR) in a random sub-sample (n = 251) to obtain portion sizes.</s><s>Lastly, the German Nutrient Database (BLS 3.01) (2010) and the West African Food Composition Table (2012) were used to translate usual food intake (g/ d) into energy consumption and intake of nutrients (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of socio-demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle factors</head><p><s>The general questionnaire was either self-administered or applied in face-to-face interviews by trained study personnel.</s><s>We obtained data on demographics, socio-economics, migration-related factors, psychosocial vulnerability, health status, and health behaviour.</s><s>The assessment of educational status was adapted to local circumstances at the different study locations and comprised four categories: never been to school or elementary school; lower vocational schooling or lower secondary schooling; intermediate vocational schooling or intermediate/higher secondary schooling; and higher vocational schooling or university.</s><s>Height was measured with a portable stadiometer, weight with a digital scale, and waist circumference with a measuring tape (all devices SECA, Germany).</s><s>Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/ height 2 (kg/m 2 ).</s><s>Physical activity was assessed using the WHO Global Physical Activity Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and was categorised as high, moderate, or low, according to Haskell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Smoking status was assessed through the question 'Do you smoke at all?' and participants were categorised as current, former, or non-smokers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of dietary patterns</head><p><s>The 134 Ghana-FPQ food items were collapsed into 30 food groups according to their culinary use and nutrient profile (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In 4543 RODAM study participants, dietary patterns were identified by means of principal component analysis (PCA), using the PROC FACTOR procedure in SAS 9.4.</s><s>This procedure identifies latent factors that explain the maximum of the total variance of food intake.</s><s>The factors were orthogonally rotated (varimax rotation) to facilitate the interpretability of the factors and to ensure that the factors remain uncorrelated.</s><s>The decision on the number of factors that should be retained was based on the inspection of the scree plot, an eigenvalue &gt;1, and the plausibility of the factors.</s><s>Rotated factors with |factor loading| ≥ 0.30 were considered to contribute to the pattern.</s><s>Every participant received a score for each of the identified factors to rank the participants according pattern adherence.</s><s>This score was computed by summing up intakes of each food group weighted by its factor loading, which represents the relative contribution of that food group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>For the RODAM study population, socio-demographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle characteristics, including daily energy consumption and nutrient intakes, are presented as mean (± standard deviation, SD) for normally distributed continuous variables and as median (IQR: interquartile range) for non-normally distributed continuous variables.</s><s>Categorical variables are presented as percentages.</s></p><p><s>In 3905 participants with complete data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we examined the distributions of socio-demographic and anthropometric characteristics across quintiles of the pattern scores using trend test (continuous variables) and χ 2test (categorical variables).</s><s>For non-normally distributed variables the median per quintile was subjected to the trend test.</s><s>Lastly, multiple linear regression models with a backward elimination procedure (p &lt; 0.05) were calculated to identify independent socio-demographic factors of adherence to the identified dietary patterns.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this cross-sectional study among a large sample of middle-aged Ghanaian men and women in Europe and their compatriots in Ghana, we assessed dietary behaviour by means of culture-specific instruments and observed differences across the study sites.</s><s>The diet in Ghanaspecifically in rural areasrelied more on simple carbohydrates and traditional foods, whereas the diet in Europe appeared to be less starch-based and more diversified.</s><s>Mainly, three dietary patterns, differentially associated with socio-demographic factors, were identified.</s><s>While adherence to the 'mixed' patterns was more associated with female sex and European residence, the 'rice, pasta, meat, and fish' pattern was associated with male sex, younger age, more physical activity, and residence in urban Ghana but also in Europe.</s><s>Both patterns were associated with higher education and current or former smoking status.</s><s>The described 'roots, tubers, and plantain' pattern was mainly characterised by residence in rural Ghana and slightly associated with higher age.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RODAM dietary behaviour and nutrition transition</head><p><s>In 1993, Barry Popkin coined the term 'nutrition transition' <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>This theory assumes that human diet changes over time and alongside economic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Within the RODAM population we have observed distinctions between Ghanaians living in Europe, urban Ghana, and rural Ghana with respect to their macro-nutrient consumptions, arguing for the presence of a nutrition transition in West African populations who are facing rapid environmental changes.</s><s>We observed that in Ghana the diet was richer in carbohydrates than that in Europe, and this was also true for rural Ghana in comparison with urban Ghana.</s><s>The inverse tendency was discernible for fat and protein intake.</s><s>Indeed, similar nutrient distributions between rural and urban areas were reported from Cameroon where the intakes of protein and saturated fats were higher in urban places than in rural areas.</s><s>Yet, this trend was less clear-cut for carbohydrates and total fat <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Also, different trends in the intake of fibre and micro-nutrients were observed for the three different dietary patterns identified.</s><s>These differences in macro-and micronutrient intakes may reflect the differences in food group consumption, which additionally corroborate the phenomenon of nutrition transition upon urbanisation and migration.</s><s>We observed a trend towards higher intakes of westernised foods, such as condiments, sodas and juices, and Beta coefficients (β), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values were calculated by multiple linear regression models, including all factors listed for each pattern.</s><s>Independent factors of adherence to each pattern were identified using backward elimination procedure.</s><s>* Physical activity was categorised into three levels: low, moderate, and high, according to Haskell et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>cakes and sweets in Europe followed by urban Ghana and rural Ghana.</s><s>Still, the same was seen for food groups with proved beneficial health effects, including whole grain cereals and vegetables.</s><s>The opposite trend was discernible for typical Ghanaian fermented maize products, palm oil, and roots, tubers, and plantain.</s></p><p><s>So far, in West African populations, only few studies in mainly urban areas have been conducted to identify dietary patterns by exploratory analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Zeba et al. as high in local cereals, legumes, and traditional green leafy vegetables <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The 'traditional' pattern identified by Frank et al. was characterised by high intakes of plantain, green leafy vegetables, beans, garden egg, fish, maize (banku), palm oil, okra and fruits, quite similar to our described 'roots, tubers, and plantain' pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, this 'roots, tubers, and plantain' pattern accords with the previously described traditional Ghanaian diet consisting of a main energy dense component (yams, maize, millet, black-eyed peas, maize, cassava, yams, cocoyam, and plantains) served with either a soup or a stew <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies also identified a more diversified dietary pattern that could be interpreted as a synthesis of the identified 'mixed' pattern and 'rice, pasta, meat, and fish' pattern.</s><s>Another study conducted in Yaoundé, Cameroon, described two patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>: the 'fruit and vegetables' pattern, typified by high intakes of fruits, vegetables, tubers, and legumes, and the 'meat' pattern, characterised by high intakes of bush meat, poultry, and red meat.</s><s>Similarly, in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, a meaty pattern named as 'modern food' pattern was identified that was rich in meats and poultry, eggs, and processed meat, The second pattern was named 'snacking' and was characterised by high intakes of fried foods, vegetable source fats, sugar and sweetened products and drinks, cereals, vegetables, dairy products, nonfatty meats and poultry, fresh fish, and roots and tubers.</s><s>Clearly, comparing food patterns across Sub-Saharan African populations is challenging due to the different nature of the applied exploratory methods.</s><s>Furthermore, the extraction of the patterns involves subjective decisions from the formation of the food groups to the number of factors that are finally retained.</s></p><p><s>The dietary behaviour of the RODAM participants based in Europe suggests that the new European scene offers a wide variety of new products and choices, leading to changes in their usual diet.</s><s>Something similar was observed in a study among 213 migrants from Equatorial Guinea (Bubis) living in Madrid; the diet was richer in protein intake and lower in fat than the original Guinean diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Among the Bubis in Madrid, two dietary patterns were identified.</s><s>Most participants adhered to the 'healthier' pattern, which was associated with a higher consumption of fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes, dairy products and bread <ref
