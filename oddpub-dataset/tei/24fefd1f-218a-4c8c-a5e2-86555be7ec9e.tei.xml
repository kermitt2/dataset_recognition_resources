<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease with a prevalence of approximately 0.5 % in central Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>The economic impact of RA is significant for the society as well as for the individual taking into account both direct and indirect costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The effectiveness of conventional and biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has improved considerably the treatment outcomes in RA over the past 15 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>However, despite excellent medical treatment options, a high proportion of RA patients still complains about loss of physical function <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Hence, physical exercises and physiotherapy are of high importance for maintenance of joint function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</s><s>International guidelines for long-term treatment of RA also recommend non-pharmacological interventions as adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, many publications underline that physical therapy plays an important role regarding preventative, curative and rehabilitative aims in the treatment of RA patients.</s><s>Especially patients with progressive and aggressive arthritis benefit from physiotherapy and physical exercises.</s><s>These RA patients can delay or even avoid an early invalidity as well as improve their fitness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Following these recommendations and guidelines, RA patients should be encouraged to be as physically active as possible.</s><s>Even high-intensity exercises have been described as safe and effective for RA patients without increasing disease activity.</s><s>In this setting, rheumatologists and physical therapists only have to take into account individual patient requirements and current joint damage before approving weight bearing and/or high-intensity exercises <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, arthritis patients should try different activities to find those they enjoy and to have a variety of physical activity options <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Development and evaluation of programs and strategies to promote long-term, selfdirected physical activity in community-based settings are recommended for future research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, many RA patients report about a lack of access to physical therapy and supervised community-based exercises.</s></p><p><s>By considering these difficulties, an animated physical exercise program using a game console could be an alternative approach.</s><s>The exercise-based game software Wii-fit for the Nintendo™ Wii game console was released in 2007 and has generated a specific interest of investigation.</s><s>Recent publications have shown positive effects of the Wii activity games and exercises on physical and psychosocial conditions of patients with different underlying diseases.</s><s>The results of a randomized cross-over trial of children with movement difficulties appreciate the use of Wii fit within the therapeutic programs.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> To quote another example, present results support the use of the Wii-fit program as a feasible, safe and potentially effective therapeutic tool to augment the rehabilitation of young children with developmental delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The exercise based game-software also demonstrated positive outcomes at the impairment and functional levels of a person with cerebral palsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s>It had been illustrated in a case study that the use of Nintendo Wii™ fit training and body weight support were effective interventions to achieve functional goals also in elderly patients with lower limb amputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, this tool has inspired the use especially in the domain of neuro-rehabilitation as a training device for balance ability.</s><s>From 2007 to 2010 only ten Wii-fit balance related scientific papers have been published on the medical usefulness of the Wii-fit program, but afterwards the number of papers has shown an exponential increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In the field of osteology, this animated program has been investigated only once showing beneficial results of balance training in patients with osteoporosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, it shows that the Wii console can be a serious object of investigation and a valid instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, a home-based animated physical exercise program could be also cost-effective.</s><s>It is freely available and adjustable to the individual situation.</s></p><p><s>In this pilot study, we aimed to investigate at first the feasibility and patients acceptability of a mainly home based animated physical exercises program in RA in order to potentially proof the concept.</s><s>Furthermore, different physical outcome measures and PRO's were captured to allow a comparison of treatment effects and estimation of needed sample size for further studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This pilot study was conducted as an investigator initiated, not manufacturer supported, single-center, crossover trial with two treatment arms over 24 weeks.</s><s>Six game consoles were purchased and distributed for free to the patients.</s></p><p><s>Patients fulfilled the 1987 and 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>.</s><s>Inclusion criteria included patients achieving a self-reported disease activity (patients' global assessment, PtGA) &lt; 30 mm under therapy with a biological DMARD therapy according to label.</s><s>Thus, all patients were inadequate responders and/or showed intolerance to conventional DMARDs [cDMARDs]).</s></p><p><s>Patients only on cDMARD therapy were excluded with the aim to investigate a homogeneous cohort with established and advanced RA.</s><s>We addressed the question whether such a cohort could further benefit from standard physiotherapy in comparison to an animated exercise program.</s><s>Key exclusion criteria were epilepsy, flare of RA and a previous use of a Wii console for more than 5 h.</s><s>To ensure standardized instruction for the animated exercise program, this was a mono-centric study and all participants were recruited from the out-patient department of the Department of Rheumatology at Charité University Hospital Berlin.</s><s>The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charité university hospital in Berlin.</s><s>All subjects' written consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The consoletool of investigation</head><p><s>The Wii console by Nintendo™ is a home video game console.</s><s>The primary controller for the console (Wii Remote) can be used as a handheld pointing device which detects movement in three dimensions.</s><s>It uses a combination of built-in accelerometers and infrared detection to sense its position in 3D space, when pointed at the LEDs in the sensor bar, which is located on the top of the TV.</s><s>This allows users to control the game with physical gestures as well as button activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Wii fit plus, the software we used for this study, was released in 2009 and contains more than 50 exercises and activity games.</s><s>The exercises are separated into four categories: Yoga, muscle strength, balance games and aerobic <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The fitness software Wii-fit plus comes together with a balance board.</s><s>This peripheral device is like a scale with four sensors (left side/right side and front/back) and looks most similar to a step-board.</s><s>The Balance board was found to be a valid tool for assessing standing balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref> and is also sensitive for lateral movements and shifting of weight on the toes or heel.</s><s>In general, the Wii console is an easy, rather inexpensive and intuitively to use device which does not require a special education.</s><s>Furthermore, the integrated tutorial is sufficient to guide the user through the menu.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment plan</head><p><s>Fifteen patients started with the animated exercise program by using the Wii game console (Wii-group) for 12 weeks and 15 patients started with a conventional home-based physical exercise program (PT-group).</s><s>Afterwards, patients were crossed-over to the other treatment arm for another period of 12 weeks.</s><s>The recruitment strategy comprised informational events for the local patient groups as well as presentations at public meetings.</s><s>The highest number of attendees was recruited from the outpatient unit of the rheumatology department at the Charité.</s><s>Patients were enrolled in an alternate mode and at the beginning of each program, the participants were instructed in detail.</s><s>The patients were asked to participate in 2 or 3 supervised sessions (approximately 1 h/session) in order to rehearse the exercises of the conventional physical exercise program or to become acquainted with the game console, respectively.</s><s>At the end of the introduction phase, all patients received a manual, which was conducted in cooperation with physiotherapists.</s><s>According to the training schedule, every patient was stimulated to exercise 3 times a week for approximately 30 min/session.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approach in the Wii-group</head><p><s>Before study start, the exercises and activity games of the Wii™ fit plus software were judged by physiotherapists and the study group in order to exclude such exercises in advance, which do not qualify for RA patients.</s><s>As a result, the manual for the Wii-fit exercise program comprises five illustrations (screenshots) of the software menu, where improper exercises were crossed out.</s><s>In more specific terms, this means that patients could select from at least 12 Yoga exercises, 11 muscle-strength exercises, 7 balance games and 6 aerobic exercises.</s><s>For the duration of the study, patients in the Wii group loaned a commercially available game console (Wii-console) together with the Wii-fit software and the balance board for use at home.</s><s>The intention of this study group was that patients were allowed to choose the exercises by themselves, but with the obligation of doing at least two exercises from each category.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approach in the PT-group</head><p><s>In preparation of this study a compilation with 31 exercises especially for RA was developed by physiotherapists and the study group.</s><s>The conventional home-based physical exercise program was also divided into four categories: strength training (10 exercises), coordination (2), joint mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>The ambition of this treatment arm was to reflect the routine of a home-based physical exercise program as exact as possible.</s><s>First and foremost, the physiotherapists assessed the patients status during the first session of the introduction phase (i.e.</s><s>stage of RA, joint mobility, age, deficiency of muscle strength).</s><s>Secondly, the physiotherapists chose individual exercises from the study specific compilation and practiced each exercise with the patient.</s><s>Finally, every patient in the PT-group received a manual with 10 to 12 exercises, adapted to his/her individual needs.</s><s>Intensity, rest interval and repetitions of the exercises were not pre-defined with respect to the diversity of the participants and to avoid therapeutic problems.</s></p><p><s>A multi-methodical approach was used for this study to determine effects and estimate feasibility: analysis of qualitative and quantitative data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative data collection</head><p><s>Qualitative research approach in its diversity is a meanwhile accepted approach in order to understand the why and how of human actions.</s><s>Both qualitative and quantitative methods complement each other, including medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</s><s>For this trial, we chose the approach of a qualitative data analysis (QDA), in detail a 'summarizing qualitative content analysis' of interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Semi-structured, face to face interviews were performed and recorded at baseline, week 12 and week 24.</s><s>The decision to use semi-structured interview technique was based on the opportunity for both interviewer and interviewee to discuss some topics in more detail.</s><s>With open ended questions the patients were asked to explain their experiences of the last 12 weeks.</s><s>In addition, a series of predefined questions helped the interviewee to express his/her experience.</s><s>All interviews were transcribed into a written form and patient's explanations were analyzed by using special software for coding patient's response (open code 4.0.1 <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The analysis of interview material followed three steps: First, transcripts were organized, reduced and prioritized to identify issues and ideas that are relevant to the focus of the evaluation.</s><s>Second, the words and phrases of each patient, which were used to describe the experience with the exercise program, were extracted and coded.</s><s>As a third step, an inter-individual comparison was done by structuring and grouping of similar kinds of codes into categories.</s><s>These categories were developed exclusively on the basis of the interview data in an inductive approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>.</s><s>The codes as well as categories were discussed and revised continuously by the study group (2 physicians, 1 sports scientist) in order to increase the inter-individual consensual comprehension and to avoid counterproductive coding.</s></p><p><s>Due to its nature, these qualitative data do not qualify for statistical analysis but are useful for evaluation of feasibility.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of high-responder, low-responder &amp; nonresponder</head><p><s>Patients' response was judged on the basis of the interviews and the consoles diary function.</s><s>Participants were rated as high-responders if a high motivation was expressed at the end of each treatment arm according to the interview.</s><s>In addition, high-responders were evaluated as overachievers by diary and/or described an interest in continuation of the exercise.</s><s>A patient was classified as a low-responder, if the training schedule was met and a neutral point of view displayed regarding the exercise program.</s><s>Non-responders were defined as underachiever by practicing less than two times a week and expressing a low level of motivation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient reported outcomes (PRO's)</head><p><s>Patient reported outcomes cover 3 domains and were assessed at baseline, week 12 and week 24 visits: physical function was measured using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI), disease activity was evaluated using patient's global assessment on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (PtGA) and quality of life was assessed using the Short Form 36-Item (SF36) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">44]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physical function tests</head><p><s>At Baseline, week 12 and week 24 visits, nine muscle groups were assessed using a hand held dynamometer (isometric measurement).</s><s>Measured muscle groups included neck extensors, neck flexors, shoulder abductors, elbow extensors, elbow flexors, 3-point grip strength, hip flexors, knee extensors and knee flexors.</s><s>The mean value of a triple measurement of each muscle group was used for further calculation.</s><s>The hand held dynamometer (CITEC by CIT Technics) had been utilized before in clinical trials to investigate myositis and has been described as a reliable tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Changes of physical status were further assessed using respiratory function test.</s><s>At each visit, the peak expiratory flow was taken by a peak flow meter (Vitalograph® peak flow meter by Vitalograph, Ireland).</s><s>The mean value of a triple measurement was used for further calculation.</s><s>A change of +8 % and -11.8 % was defined as being medically important <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>.</s><s>At the end of each visit, the patients were asked to perform a six-minute walk test (6-MWT).</s><s>The 6-MWT is an appropriate tool to assess the submaximal level of functional performance and is utilized in many conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[47]</ref>.</s><s>A MCID of 20 meters have been specified for this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">49]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p><s>To compare both groups statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (Version 20.0.0.1) using the ' Analysis of Covariance' (ANCOVA), adjusted for baseline status.</s></p><p><s>Due to the fact of different pre-conditions at the beginning of the second treatment period (after cross-over), we focused on statistical 'head to head' analysis of the week 12 results.</s><s>A paired t-test was used to compare mean changes of the cohort.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>A total of 30 RA patients (25 females, 5 males) with a mean age of 56 (SD ± 9) years were enrolled.</s><s>The mean disease duration was 13 (SD ± 9) years at baseline.</s><s>12 patients were currently treated with Rituximab, 10 patients with Tocilizumab, 5 with Abatacept, 2 with Etanercept and 1 patient was treated with Certolizumab during the study.</s><s>21 patients (70 %) had been treated before with another bDMARD, 15 patients (50 %) with ≥2 other bDMARDs.</s><s>Mean patients VAS was 16.8 mm (SD ± 8) at baseline with a corresponding DAS28 of 2.8 (SD ± 1.2).</s><s>The mean DAS28 slightly decreased at week 12 visit (-0.2) but returned to baseline level at the end of the study.</s><s>The detailed baseline characteristics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Three female patients dropped out prior to the cross-over visit.</s><s>Two of these patients dropped out due to motivational reasons during the study phase with conventional home-based physical exercises.</s><s>One patient complained about lack of time to use the Wii console.</s></p></div>
