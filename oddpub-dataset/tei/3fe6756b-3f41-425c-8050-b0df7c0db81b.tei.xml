<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This study (Clinical Trials Registry # NCT01208207, Sponsor Protocol MK-0663 Protocol 108) was conducted at 187 study centers in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Columbia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Lithuania, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</s><s>The study was initiated in September 2010 and completed in November 2014.</s><s>The protocol for the study was approved by local institutional review boards or ethical review committees and was conducted according to principles of Good Clinical Practice.</s><s>Subjects provided informed consent prior to participation in the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>Subjects who were included were male or female, at least 18 years of age, and had a diagnosis of AS by the Modified New York criteria (determined/assessed at Visit 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Subjects were to have had a history of positive therapeutic benefit with NSAIDs and were to have taken an NSAID on a regular basis and at a therapeutic dose level for at least 30 days prior to study enrollment.</s><s>If subjects were using anti-rheumatic therapies other than NSAIDs, these were to be held at stable doses throughout the study duration.</s><s>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) questionnaires were completed at each treatment visit and consisted of 6 questions pertaining to fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, areas of localized tenderness, morning stiffness duration and morning stiffness severity.</s><s>Subjects were required to have a baseline score on BASDAI Question 2 (Spinal Pain Intensity [SPI]; 0-100 mm on a visual analog scale [VAS]) at Visit 1 that was &lt;77 mm.</s><s>After "washout" of prestudy NSAID, subjects had to satisfy flare criteria before randomization.</s><s>This flare criteria (i.e., worsening of spinal pain) was defined as a score on SPI after withdrawal of baseline NSAIDs that was: ≥40 mm, AND ≥30 % higher than the SPI score prior to NSAID withdrawal, AND ≥12 mm higher than the SPI prior to NSAID withdrawal.</s></p><p><s>Subjects were excluded from the study if they had conditions that would confound study results including a history of gastrointestinal (GI) surgery that causes clinical malabsorption, neoplastic disease, or a bleeding disorder (inherited or acquired).</s><s>Additional conditions leading to exclusion were active peptic (gastric or duodenal) ulcer or history of inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery occlusive disease, class II-IV congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension at Visit 1 or 2, BMI ≥40 kg/m 2 and significant health problems stemming from obesity, estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤30 mL/min, or hepatic insufficiency (Child-Pugh score ≥5).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This was a 2-part, double-blind, active-comparatorcontrolled study in subjects with AS.</s><s>Part I was a 6-week, active-comparator-controlled period to compare the efficacy of etoricoxib 90 mg to naproxen1000 mg, the efficacy of etoricoxib 60 mg to naproxen 1000 mg and the efficacy of the 60 and 90 mg doses to each other.</s><s>Part II was a 20week, long-term treatment period that evaluated subjects who remained on naproxen 1000 mg, etoricoxib 90 mg, and etoricoxib 60 mg as well as subjects who escalated from etoricoxib 60 to 90 mg.</s><s>Subjects were randomized at baseline (Visit 2) to one of four treatment sequences (treatment in Part I/treatment in Part II) in a 4:9:9:4 ratio: 1) naproxen 1000 mg/naproxen 1000 mg; 2) Etoricoxib 60 mg/ etoricoxib 60 mg; 3) Etoricoxib 60 mg/etoricoxib 90 mg; 4) Etoricoxib 90 mg/etoricoxib 90 mg.</s><s>Randomization was stratified by the presence or absence of chronic peripheral arthritis.</s><s>Subjects were evaluated at Weeks 2, 4 and 6 in Part I.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy parameters</head><p><s>The primary endpoint in this study was the timeweighted average change from baseline in SPI (100-mm VAS) over 6 weeks.</s><s>The primary hypotheses were that etoricoxib 90 mg once daily is not inferior to naproxen 1000 mg according to the primary endpoint and that etoricoxib 60 mg once daily is not inferior to naproxen 1000 mg according to the primary endpoint.</s><s>The Per Protocol Population (excludes subjects with important protocol deviations) was used for the analysis of the Primary Endpoint.</s><s>Key Secondary Endpoints included time-weighted average change from baseline in SPI (VAS) in Part I (etoricoxib 90 mg vs. etoricoxib 60 mg; using the Modified Intention to Treat population [mITT]) and average change from Week 6 in SPI (VAS) over the average of Weeks 10 and 12 among inadequate responders to etoricoxib 60 mg (inadequate responder defined as a subject with &lt;50 % improvement from baseline in SPI [VAS] at Week 6).</s><s>Other Secondary Endpoints included time-weighted average change from baseline in SPI (VAS) over 26 weeks, time-weighted average response in Patient Global Assessment of Response to Therapy (PGART; Likert) over 6 weeks, proportion of subjects who discontinue due to lack of efficacy over 6 weeks, average change from Week 6 in PGART (Likert) over Weeks 10 and 12, and change from baseline in SPI (VAS) at each week of the study.</s><s>We also evaluated the BASDAI composite score (VAS) and the morning stiffness duration and severity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety parameters</head><p><s>Safety assessments included physical examinations, vital signs, limited hematology and chemistry (i.e., hemoglobin, hematocrit, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], creatinine, and serum digoxin for subjects on digoxin), hematology [hemoglobin and hematocrit], urinalysis, serum or urine pregnancy testing, and serum FSH.</s><s>Spontaneous adverse experience (AE) were monitored and reported up to 28 days (+2 days) after the last dose of study medication.</s><s>All thrombotic CV SAEs and upper GI events (such as perforation, ulcer, or upper GI bleeding) that occurred in subjects in this study were subject to adjudication by a committee external to the Sponsor during the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical planning and analysis</head><p><s>The primary population analyzed for the primary hypothesis was the per-protocol population.</s><s>The mITT population (randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication, had at least 1 post-randomization measurement for the analysis endpoint, and had baseline data) was used for a supportive analysis of the primary efficacy analyses and was the primary analysis population for all the secondary objectives.</s><s>For evaluation of the primary objectives, the sample sizes in this study provided 91 % power (α = 0.025, 1-sided) for etoricoxib 90 mg vs. naproxen, &gt;99 % (α =0.025, 1-sided) for etoricoxib 60 mg vs. naproxen.</s><s>For secondary objectives, this study had 91 % power (α =0.20, 2-sided), and 80 % power (α =0.20, 2sided) for etoricoxib 60 mg/90 mg vs. etoricoxib 60 mg/ 60 mg in inadequate responders.</s></p><p><s>The primary endpoint was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</s><s>For the comparison of etoricoxib 90 mg vs. naproxen and the comparison of etoricoxib 60 mg vs. naproxen, non-inferiority was established if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95 % confidence interval of the between-treatment difference in the Least Square (LS) means (etoricoxib minus naproxen 1000 mg) was no larger than 8 mm VAS (non-inferiority margin based on a previous etoricoxib study in ankylosing spondylitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</s><s>Etoricoxib 90 mg was declared superior to etoricoxib 60 mg if the difference in LS means for the primary endpoint was significant (p ≤ 0.20) in favor of the 90-mg dose.</s><s>A difference of 6 mm VAS in the time-weighted average change from baseline over 6 weeks between two doses on SPI (VAS) is considered to be a Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID; i.e., a clinically important difference in means).</s><s>This value was assigned after taking into account advice from consulted experts and data from dose range-finding studies since no specific literature was identified to aid in the assignment of MCID between doses in an AS population.</s></p><p><s>The comparison of inadequate responders in Part II was analyzed using ANCOVA.</s><s>A difference of 6 mm VAS, as measured by the average change from Week 6 to Weeks 10 and 12 in SPI, was also assigned as a MCID for the comparison of etoricoxib 60 mg/etoricoxib 90 mg and etoricoxib 60 mg/etoricoxib 60 mg treatment sequences.</s><s>The benefit of a dose increase from 60 to 90 mg was indicated if the nominal p-value (without multiplicity adjustment) for difference in LS means between the 2 treatment sequences was ≤0.20 in favor of the 90-mg dose.</s></p><p><s>The All Patients as Treated (APaT) population was used for the analysis of safety data (i.e., all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment).</s><s>For pre-specified AEs of interest, p-values and/or 95 % CI's were provided using the Miettinen and Nurminen method for treatment group comparisons.</s><s>All other AEs were summarized with counts and percentages.</s></p></div>
