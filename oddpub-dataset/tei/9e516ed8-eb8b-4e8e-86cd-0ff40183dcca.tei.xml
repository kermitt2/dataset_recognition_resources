<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Immunological memory is one of the hallmarks of adaptive immunity.</s><s>During infection, pathogen-specific naı ¨ve T cells differentiate into shortlived effector and memory T cells.</s><s>The latter facilitate long-standing protection against a secondary infection of the same pathogen.</s><s>CD8 + CD44 + CD62L + central memory (CM) T cells have the capability of expansion, self-renewal, and generation of cytotoxic effector T cells upon repeated encountering of their cognate antigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Graef et al, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, some T cells with an apparent memory phenotype are specific to antigens which the host organism has not been exposed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haluszczak et al, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Su et al, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>There are two possible explanations of their origin: (i) They could be cross-reactive T cells that have encountered another foreign cognate antigen previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Su et al, 2013)</ref> or (ii) they are generated via homeostatic mechanisms independently of the exposure to any foreign antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haluszczak et al, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The strong evidence for the role of homeostatic mechanisms in generation of CD8 + memory-like T cells was provided by the detection of these cells in germ-free mice.</s><s>Since these T cells had limited prior exposure to foreign antigens, they were called virtual memory (VM) T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haluszczak et al, 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Generation and/or maintenance of VM T cells depends on transcription factors Eomes and IRF4, type I interferon signaling, IL-15 and/or IL-4 signaling, and CD8a + dendritic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akue et al, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sosinowski et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kurzweil et al, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tripathi et al, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">White et al, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that VM T cells express slightly higher levels of CD122 (IL-2Rb) and lower levels of CD49d (integrin a4, a subunit of VLA-4) than true (i.e., foreign antigen-experienced) CM T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sosinowski et al, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Based on these markers, VM T cells constitute for a majority of memory-phenotype CD8 + T cells in unimmunized mice and around 10-20% of total CD8 + T cells in lymphoid organs.</s><s>Moreover, it has been proposed that memory-phenotype T cells, that accumulate in aged mice, are VM T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chiu et al, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, with the notable exception of the very initial study that identified CD44 + CD62L + CM T cells in germ-free mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haluszczak et al, 2009)</ref>, all other published experiments used specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice that have significant exposure to microbial antigens.</s><s>There are three major hypothesis of how virtual memory T cells might be formed in a homeostatic manner: (i) The differentiation into VM T cells occurs purely on a stochastic basis, (ii) lymphopenic environment in newborns induces differentiation of the first wave of thymic emigrants into VM T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akue et al, 2012)</ref>, or (iii) the VM T cells are generated from relatively highly self-reactive T cells that receive strong homeostatic TCR signals at the periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(White et al, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>However, none of these hypotheses has been addressed in detail.</s></p><p><s>Although VM T cells form a large CD8 + T cell population, their biological role is still unknown.</s><s>VM T cells share some functional properties with true CM cells, including rapid production of IFNc upon stimulation with a cognate antigen or cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Haluszczak et al, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lee et al, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>On a per cell basis, ovalbumin-specific VM T cells provide a protection to ovalbumin-expressing Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), comparable to true CM T cells, and surpass naı ¨ve T cells with the same specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lee et al, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, it has been proposed that VM T cells are capable of by-stander protection against infection, i.e., independently of their cognate antigen exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chu et al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">White et al, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Altogether, these data pointed toward the superior role of VM T cells in protective immunity to infection.</s><s>In a marked contrast to the above-mentioned findings, Decman et al showed that CD44 + CD8 + T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells isolated from unprimed mice (i.e., putative VM T cells) expand less than CD44 À CD8 + T cells expressing the same TCR upon antigenic stimulation in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Decman et al, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, VM T cells from aged mice were shown to be hyporesponsive to their cognate antigens in comparison with their naı ¨ve counterparts, mostly because of their susceptibility to apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Decman et al, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Renkema et al, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As VM T cells develop independently of infection, the understanding of mechanisms that guide their development is critical in order to elucidate their biological roles.</s><s>One hint is the observation that levels of CD5 (a marker of self-reactivity) on naı ¨ve T cells correlate with their ability to differentiate into VM T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(White et al, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we demonstrate that virtual memory T cells originate exclusively from relatively highly self-reactive T-cell clones and acquire only a partial memory gene expression program.</s><s>Moreover, the interaction between CD8 and Lck (and possibly the overall intrinsic sensitivity of the TCR signaling machinery) determines the size of the virtual memory compartment.</s><s>These data highlight the virtual memory T-cell formation as a T-cell fate decision checkpoint, when the intensity of TCR signals induced by self-antigens plays a central role in the decision-making process.</s><s>Although virtual memory T cells show augmented responses to their foreign cognate antigen in some experimental setups in comparison with naı ¨ve T cells, the potency of VM T cells to induce pathology in an experimental model of autoimmune diabetes is not higher than that of naı ¨ve T cells.</s></p></div>
