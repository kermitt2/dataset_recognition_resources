<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Photolipid syntheses.</s><s>In an effort to mimic FAs with a chain length of 18 carbons, we prepared a series of 8 photoswitchable FA derivatives, FAAzo1-8.</s><s>Each of these compounds contained an azobenzene photoswitch, which allowed for controllable cis/trans-isomerization along the length of the chain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>FAAzo1-8 were prepared in between two and six steps in moderate yield (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In their dark-adapted state, the FAAzos existed predominantly in the transconfiguration.</s><s>Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy showed that isomerization from trans-to cis-could be achieved by irradiation at l ¼ 365 nm and this process could be reversed by l ¼ 460 nm light.</s></p><p><s>Supported by structure-activity relationships and recent structural data <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , we envisioned a unique opportunity to create a series of photoswitchable vanilloids for the optical control of TRPV1.</s><s>Our approach combined the vanilloid head group of CAP with the FAAzos, which would act as a photoswitchable tail mimicking that of N-arachidonoyl dopamine, anandamide, olvanil or arvanil (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>The preparation of these compounds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) required only a peptide coupling between vanillamine and the appropriate FAAzo to afford eight photoswitchable vanilloids, AzCA1-8, in good yields (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Photoswitching of AzCA1-8 was also achieved using l ¼ 365/460 nm and they showed similar photoswitching properties when compared with the FAAzos (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>As such, both FAAzos and AzCAs could be classified as 'regular' azobenzenes that require ultraviolet-A light for isomerization to their thermally unstable cis-form.</s></p><p><s>Optical control over TRPV1 in HEK293T cells.</s><s>We evaluated the photopharmacology of AzCA1-8 using whole-cell electrophysiology in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells transiently expressing the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged ion channel (TRPV1-YFP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Each compound (1 mM) was continuously applied while alternating between irradiation at l ¼ 350 nm and at l ¼ 450 nm, until a steady state of activity/ desensitization was achieved on photoswitching.</s><s>Their relative light-dependant activities were then assessed by performing voltage ramps ( À 100 to þ 100 mV over 5 s) under irradiation at both wavelengths (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>Among the eight derivatives tested, three compounds-AzCA2, AzCA3 and AzCA4 (at 1 mM)-showed the most profound TRPV1 photoswitching effect (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</s><s>For all three derivatives, larger currents were observed under irradiation at l ¼ 350 nm, indicating that these compounds had higher efficacies towards TRPV1 in their cis-configuration.</s><s>At higher concentrations (4300 nM, bath application), smaller cellular currents were observed on application of the AzCAs in their dark-adapted states.</s><s>This showed that in both configurations, the AzCAs were TRPV1 agonists; however, in all cases a larger current was observed under l ¼ 350 nm irradiation.</s><s>Working at an optimized concentration (1 mM by puff pipette), the AzCAs could be applied to cells in the dark without any observable effect and this allowed immediate TRPV1 activation on irradiation with ultraviolet-A light (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>Photoswitching could be repeated over multiple cycles and only minor channel desensitization was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The washout of AzCA4 with buffer was very slow and photoswitching currents persisted for minutes under constant perfusion.</s><s>However, application of capsazepine (5 mM), a TRPV1 antagonist known to bind competitively against CAP, was capable of displacing AzCA4 and rapidly abolished inward currents on ultraviolet stimulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>In control experiments, no light-induced activity was observed in cells lacking TRPV1, before the application of an AzCA derivative (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>) or after the application of CAP (1 mM) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</s><s>The application of FAAzo2, FAAzo3 and FAAzo4 caused no effect (5 mM, nZ3 for each) in TRPV1responding cells.</s></p><p><s>In voltage clamp experiments, the magnitude of the cellular currents could be controlled by adjusting the ON wavelength between l ¼ 350-390 nm.</s><s>As shown by an action spectrum, the largest currents were observed under l ¼ 350 nm and they became smaller towards l ¼ 390 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Current clamp experiments revealed that the cellular membrane potential could be controlled in a similar manner, with l ¼ 360 nm yielding the largest depolarization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>).</s><s>Through exponential curve fitting, we evaluated the effects of irradiation on the TRPV1 activation kinetics.</s><s>The fastest ON response was observed at l ¼ 360 nm and all other t on values were normalized to this t-value for comparison (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>).</s><s>At longer wavelengths, a slower response was observed.</s><s>Taken together, these results indicate that the AzCAs permit precise, optical control over the activity of TRPV1 that cannot be achieved with other lipophilic agonists, such as CAP, alone.</s><s>As AzCA4 could be prepared in high yield at low cost, we decided to focus our future investigations on this compound.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AzCA4 responders</head><p><s>We then demonstrated that AzCA4 was a powerful modulator of DRG neurons in wt mice and the Trpv1 Cre/GCaMP3 mouse line.</s><s>Control experiments in untransfected HEK293T cells and Trpv1 À / À mice showed no response to AzCA4, even on light stimulation.</s><s>These results rule out the possibility of action through off-target mechanisms.</s><s>This characteristic is essential for the study of signal transduction in the nociceptive neurons involved in inflammatory pain.</s><s>To this end, we envision that AzCA4 could be used to study TRPV1-mediated hyperalgesia and the physiological processes involved with the inflammatory state that occurs at sites of tissue injury.</s><s>We showed that application of components of the so-called 'inflammatory soup', such as BK or 5-HT, could sensitize TRPV1 to AzCA4 in DRG neurons.</s><s>Furthermore, we proved that AzCA4 could be used in conjunction with genetic tools such as the GCaMP3 Ca 2 þ indicator selectively expressed in TRPV1-positive mouse neurons.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, AzCA4 allowed for greater temporal control over TRPV1 than that which can be achieved by other small-molecule agonists such as CAP, olvanil and arvanil.</s><s>By working at an optimized concentration, AzCA4 showed no activity towards TRPV1 in its trans-configuration, but rapid TRPV1 activation was observed when it was isomerized to its cis-configuration.</s><s>This ON and OFF effect became even more pronounced in neuronal systems when the nonlinear, 'all or nothing,' nature of the AP took effect.</s><s>Previous studies have suggested that the rate of TRPV1 activation determines the balance between agonist potency and pungency <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> .</s><s>Molecular weight and lipophilicity normally define the pharmacodynamics of TRPV1 agonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>In the case of AzCAs, light provides another level of control.</s><s>We showed that the magnitude and rate of cellular activation could be precisely tuned by adjusting the ON wavelength between l ¼ 350 and 390 nm.</s><s>Therefore, AzCAs could provide a platform for the further understanding of hyperalgesia and could lead to the development of new anaesthetics.</s></p><p><s>When using CAP to stimulate C-fibres in the saphenous nerve, a relatively slow increase in AP firing was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b,c</ref>).</s><s>This effect was probably caused by the time required for CAP to diffuse through the skin and plasma membrane to reach the vanilloid binding site <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> .</s><s>We showed that AzCA4 could be applied to neurons as its dark-adapted, relatively inactive configuration.</s><s>On isomerization, TRPV1 was activated and AP firing was immediately observed.</s><s>It is this characteristic that makes AzCA4 a useful tool for the study of nociception, a process that relies on the rapid transmission of noxious stimuli from the periphery towards the coordinating centres of the central nervous system.</s><s>AzCA4 also possesses significant advantages when compared with other small molecules that have been used to place TRPV1 under the control of light.</s><s>Caged CAP is a useful tool that has increased the level of control with which we are able to activate TRPV1 (ref.</s><s>49).</s><s>However, compound uncaging and TRPV1 activation is a non-reversible, one-shot process.</s><s>Repeated activation by uncaging relies on fast-acting transporters or deactivating enzymes to clear the synapse of the free ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>The fact that CAP and its analogues exhibit long-lasting effects suggests that they do not undergo transporter-mediated reuptake or significant enzymatic hydrolysis.</s><s>These aspects are circumvented by the use of AzCA4, which allows for successive rounds of activation/inactivation without the requirement for washout of the drug.</s><s>Previously, we showed that photoswitchable TRPV1 antagonists can optically control the activity of a constitutively active agonist on photoswitching <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>In comparison, AzCA4 greatly simplifies this system and is capable of activating TRPV1 directly.</s><s>This permits the optical control of neuronal excitability without the use of a second factor.</s><s>Advantageously, AzCA4 is relatively inactive in the dark; therefore, a more rapid and reproducible initiation of activity can be achieved after it has distributed itself uniformly within more complex tissues.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study provides the first application of photopharmacology to lipid signalling.</s><s>Given the ubiquitous distribution of FA derivatives at all levels of nature, we envision that the FAAzos and their conjugates will emerge as broadly applicable tools for the optical control of biological functions which rely on protein-lipid interactions.</s></p></div>
