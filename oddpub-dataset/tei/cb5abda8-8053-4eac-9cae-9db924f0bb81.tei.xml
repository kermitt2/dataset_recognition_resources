supplemental Table 1).</s><s>To mimic physiologic conditions, DMF was solubilized at pH 7.4 in RPMI 1640 medium before treatment to allow partial hydrolysis, as it occurs in the organism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref></s><s>As expected, MMF, the partly hydrolyzed metabolite of DMF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> failed to induce cell death (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>;
