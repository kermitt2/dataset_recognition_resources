loss in the chronic late phase of colitis, while regeneration of colonic tissue in terms of histopathology was not observed.</s><s>Importantly, treatment  of colitic mice with anti-CD4 antibodies after disease onset did not result in complete remission of mice either.</s><s>Of note, in the model used here, colitis progressed very rapidly, and remission was not achieved, probably due to the composition of the microbiota, which contained segmented filamentous bacteria and helicobacter species, both shown to promote colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr"

dictates whether colitis is induced with the transfer of T-bet-deficient Th cells in Rag1 À/À mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, disease progression reached a terminal stage between 10 and 13 days after Th lymphocyte transfer.</s><s>Thus, the time for achieving complete remission as determined by tissue regeneration was probably not enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, with this model we could show that antagomir-148a treatment is capable of depleting pro-inflammatory Th1 cells with a history of repeated activation resulting in mild but significant amelioration of inflammation in the colon.</s></p><p><s>While the depletion of pro-inflammatory Th1 cells in ongoing inflammation was efficient, we wondered whether antagomir-148a treatment is selective for these cells and spares protective memory.</s><s>Our data obtained from experiments with healthy, immunized mice do not indicate that systemic antagomir-148a treatment interferes with protective immune responses both during the effector phase and the memory phase.</s><s>This conclusion is based on equal numbers and functionality (i.e.</s><s>cytokine production) of NP-CGGspecific T memory cells and the generation of specific IgG antibodies.</s><s>Importantly, not only the NP-CGG-specific T cell memory but the global pool of resting T cell memory in BM and secondary lymphoid organs, which had been generated by natural exposures to antigens during life, was also not affected.</s><s>Moreover, FoxP3 þ regulatory T cell numbers were also not altered by injection of antagomir-148a, indicating that the balance between immunity and tolerance was not skewed by this treatment.</s><s>Taken together, these experiments confirm the selectivity of antagomir-148a for repeatedly activated Th1 cells during chronic inflammation.</s><s>These data fit to what we observed previously in vitro, namely, that upregulated expression of miR-148a is confined to repeatedly activated Th1 cells to counterbalance the function of Bim which otherwise drives these cells into apoptosis.</s><s>Further, our results corroborate the hypothesis that the mode of T cell activation (e.g., repeated or chronic activation of T cells) can be used as a discriminator for targeting cells found in chronic inflammation while sparing resting memory T cells that are important in protecting the host from recurring infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The fact that we do not observe changes in the pool of memory T cells and protective antibody titers upon treatment with antagomir-148a is surprising to some degree, since miR-148a is expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and by plasma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that miR-148a represses the secretion of IL-12, IL-6,

type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>We did not observe a significant increase in numbers of memory T cells after antagomir-148a treatment.</s><s>The apparent refraction of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to antagomir-148a treatment could be due to the fact that dendritic cells also express miR-148b and miR-152, which are inefficiently inhibited by antagomir-148a <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and might not depend on the miR-148/-152 family.</s><s>Bim is also a target of miR-148a in plasma cells.</s><s>However, plasma cells in turn might be resistant to antagomir-148a treatment because they depend more on the Mcl-1/Noxa than Bcl2/Bim intrinsic apoptosis-pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> for their survival and can potentially survive antagomir-148a treatment.</s></p><p><s>Functions of miR-148a have also been reported in kidney glomerular cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and thrombocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Histological analyses of kidney sections did not reveal any pathological changes of their architecture after antagomir-148a treatment, suggesting that the viability of

for IgG IIA)-mediated activation and thrombosis in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>However, tissue sections of highly perfused organs, such as the heart, kidney, lung and liver
