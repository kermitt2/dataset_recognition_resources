<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We explored sensory and motor inhibitory functions in CD and healthy controls.</s><s>We tested a non-affected body part.</s><s>Therefore, our results cannot merely be a secondary consequence of abnormal posture, but must reflect an underlying deficit in sensorimotor cortical processing more generally.</s><s>We found a significant deficit in the dystonic group, compared to the control group, in two measures of somatosensory spatial inhibition (GOT, IFSI).</s><s>In contrast, somatosensory temporal inhibition measures (TDT, FSI) showed comparable performance between the two groups.</s><s>We found a weak trend for less SI in patients than in controls, but no difference in the SICI measure of homotopic temporal motor inhibition.</s><s>These results demonstrate for the first time a specific pattern of inhibitory deficits for sensorimotor inhibitory functions in CD.</s></p></div>
