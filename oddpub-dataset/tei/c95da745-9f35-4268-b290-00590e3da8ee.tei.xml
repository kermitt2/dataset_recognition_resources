<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Postoperative mortality and morbidity of surgical patients are still unsolved puzzles for the clinician <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In a multicentre study, the rates of death for patients who underwent surgery varied substantially across hospitals.</s><s>A recent European study confirmed these results <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>This finding was taken up by initiatives to improve care for the surgical patient.</s><s>Worldwide, routine care began including goal-directed optimization in the perioperative period to avoid hypoperfusion and secondary organ failure.</s><s>According to recent meta-analyses, this strategy showed improved outcomes in the cohort of optimized patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, this approach will be successful only if the haemodynamic goal still holds.</s></p><p><s>Cardiac surgery has been shown to be a life-saving procedure in a selected group of patients with coronary heart disease and valve dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>However, this procedure carries a significant risk of death and major complications.</s><s>In recent years, there has been substantial progress in perioperative intensive care management in decreasing the risk for unfavourable outcomes in this group of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>One major step forward was the adoption of early goal-directed, evidence-based haemodynamic treatment strategies in cardiac surgery patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Goal-directed administration of perioperative fluids has been shown to guarantee the best possible optimization of volume therapy in these patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Several single-centre studies and meta-analyses have shown improved outcomes by using additional haemodynamic parameters to adjust individual therapy in the perioperative setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> of general and cardiac surgery.</s><s>In cardiac surgery patients in particular, cardiac dysfunction must be detected as early as possible to facilitate adequate therapy using positive inotropic drugs as well as fluids and vasodilators <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Central venous saturation (S cv O 2 ) monitoring has been suggested as one goal to address the issue of adequate cardio-circulatory function in the context of cardiac surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>This parameter seems especially attractive as venous saturation is readily measurable without additional monitoring technology and is an excellent indicator of the match/mismatch between cardiac output, arterial oxygen saturation, and haemoglobin level as determinants of both oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption.</s><s>Several studies in the cardiac-surgery patient population and in other surgical specialties have shown that low S cv O 2 and mixed venous saturation (S v O 2 ) are associated with unfavourable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, high venous saturation has been shown to be associated with increased complication rates in emergency room patients, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and cardiac-surgery patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>However, the results of these studies may be biased by the small number of patients.</s><s>The aim of this retrospective cross-sectional study, therefore, was to investigate the impact of low, normal, and high S cv O 2 on postoperative mortality and organ dysfunction in a large cardiac surgery ICU database that reported data from three distinct ICUs at our institution.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>With the written consent of the federal data protection officer and the hospital ethics commission (ethics committee -Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, EA1/034/ 13), clinical routine data from all patients who underwent cardiac surgery between 2006 and 2013 were extracted from the two electronic patient data management systems at our hospital (COPRA System, Sasbachwalden, Germany, and SAP, Walldorf, Germany) into an anonymized study database.</s><s>Individual patient consent was waived by the ethics commission.</s><s>Cardiac surgery was defined as a documented procedure on valves or vessels in proximity to the heart or coronary vessels.</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass and anaesthesia management were performed in accordance with the department's standard operating procedures described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Haemodynamic optimization was continuously accomplished in accordance with the German guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To be included in our study, patients had to be admitted postoperatively to one of our three ICUs serving postoperative cardiac surgery patients.</s><s>Patients who were under the age of 18 by the time of surgery or who had a pulmonary artery catheter were excluded.</s><s>Patients were grouped on the basis of first measurement of S cv O 2 after ICU admission as low, normal, or high according to a normal range defined as 60% to 80%. S cv O 2 in the ICU was determined by point-of-care blood gas analysis (ABL800 FLEX; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark).</s><s>Mortality, length of stay, time of ventilation, renal dysfunction, and days without organ failure were defined as outcome criteria.</s><s>Information on long-term mortality, defined as 3 years after ICU admission, was acquired, with clearance from the federal data safety officer, by consulting the registry office in Berlin, Germany.</s><s>Patients with shorter observation intervals (that is, less than 3 years between ICU admission and the date of inquiry at the registry office) were excluded in analyses of long-term mortality.</s><s>Renal dysfunction was evaluated in accordance with the creatinine criteria of the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Patients with pre-operative haemodialysis were excluded in analysis on renal outcome parameters.</s><s>Days of organ failure were assessed in accordance with the criteria of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score with a tolerance of 1 point in each category (respiration: partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 / FiO 2 ) of less than 300; circulation: use of epinephrine or norepinephrine; central nervous system: Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 13; bilirubin of at least 2.0 mg/ dL; kidneys: serum creatinine of at least 2.0 mg/dL).</s></p><p><s>To control for possible confounding variables, we assessed the risk of cardiac surgery by using the Age, Creatinine, and Ejection Fraction (ACEF) risk score by Ranucci et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and post-operative ICU admission scores-Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS)-in addition to basic patient characteristics.</s><s>The design of this observational cohort study and the results are reported in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we report haemodynamic and outcome data from a large database including data from three different ICUs serving postoperative cardiac surgery patients.</s><s>The most important findings of this study were that patients with a presumed 'safe' initial S cv O 2 above 80% had the highest in-hospital mortality and the highest mortality in 3-year follow-up.</s><s>Additionally, these patients showed increased length of mechanical ventilation, a higher incidence of renal dysfunction including increased rate of RRT, evidence of severe postoperative inflammation indicated by increased leukocyte counts and PCT levels, and prolonged lengths of ICU and hospital stay compared with patients with a 'normal' S cv O 2 (60% to 80%).</s><s>In the multivariate analysis, patients from group H had an almost threefold risk of dying in hospital and a 1.3 ratio for 3-year follow-up survival compared with group N. Patients in the high S cv O 2 group differed from the other S cv O 2 groups with respect to the type of surgery and the pre-operative ACEF score and more frequently received inotropic and vasoactive drugs.</s><s>Also, the patients in the high S cv O 2 group had more frequent atrial fibrillation as a complication diagnosis.</s><s>Thus, it was (per se) not astonishing that these patients also had a higher morbidity and mortality.</s><s>Based on the classic pathophysiological concept, low levels of S cv O 2 or S v O 2 are reflective of tissue hypoperfusion and associated with higher complication rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Our finding that patients with a seemingly 'safe' S cv O 2 above 80% showed even worse outcome is in clear contrast to previous studies.</s></p><p><s>Pre-existing chronic haemodialysis with arterialvenous shunts is known to lead to increased venous saturation.</s><s>Therefore, a possible explanation for unfavourable outcome in group H could be this bias as patients with chronic renal failure are known to have an inferior outcome after surgery, including cardiac surgery.</s><s>However, for this study cohort, this is not the explanation for the observed outcomes in group H as including incidence of pre-operative haemodialysis with arterial-venous shunts did not result in substantial changes of previously calculated hazard ratios.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the high S cv O 2 group also presented with significantly increased plasma lactate levels.</s><s>It is well accepted that increased lactate levels are associated with increased mortality after cardiac surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it is of note that a recent retrospective study revealed a link between elevated lactate levels during normal or even high S cv O 2 and unfavourable outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In that study with 629 patients, elevated lactate levels in the setting of a normal S cv O 2 were associated with significantly higher incidence of major complications.</s><s>However, high lactate levels not only may be Values are presented as number (percentage) or as median

but also may be induced by factors stimulating glycogenolysis, glycolysis, and hyperglycemia (that is, lactic acidosis type B).</s><s>It is of note that epinephrine is an important trigger for the latter effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and that the patients in the high S cv O 2 group more frequently received norepinephrine and epinephrine than the normal and the low S cv O 2 groups, suggesting that the hyperlactatemia may be, at least in part, an effect of catecholamine treatment.</s><s>Additionally, as we found a significant higher occurrence of epinephrine application in group H, it cannot be ruled out that the use of epinephrine aggravates the shunting effects in postoperative cardiac surgery patients.</s><s>If so, the question of whether epinephrine is what we are aiming for or just creates good numbers in the charts (for example, higher cardiac index and higher mean arterial pressure) clearly arises.</s></p><p><s>Totaro and Raper <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> have shown that 30% of patients receiving epinephrine after cardiac surgery developed lactic acidosis but that plasma lactate remained unchanged in patients who received norepinephrine.</s><s>Comparably, small observational studies and case reports have shown an association between epinephrine use and hyperlactatemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>A small randomized trial in cardiac surgery patients with postoperative lowcardiac output syndrome revealed significantly increased glucose and lactate levels and an increased lactatepyruvate ratio in patients who received epinephrine in comparison with milrinone treatment, suggesting that epinephrine not only stimulated glycogenesis but also led to a situation with tissue malperfusion and anaerobic metabolism despite improved haemodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In line with this, Levy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have shown that muscle tissue is a major source of lactate in patients with sepsis during treatment with epinephrine.</s><s>The authors showed that patients with septic shock had increased skeletal muscle lactate production and that these metabolic alterations could be blocked by the Na + /K + -ATPase blocker ouabain, suggesting that the increased lactate levels were of a metabolic nature.</s><s>Nonetheless, the lower oxygen extraction in the high S cv O 2 group clearly suggests that-besides the metabolic effects of the infused catecholamines-tissue hypoperfusion may be another important component explaining the significantly increased rate of organ dysfunction and the higher mortality.</s></p><p><s>The concept of venous saturation monitoring to guide haemodynamic therapy is neither new nor peculiar.</s><s>The first reports that used venous saturation monitoring to guide therapy in critically ill patients date back to the last century <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, several reviews on this topic have been published in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> and concluded that venous saturation measurements may be used to monitor the adequacy of the circulation and to guide haemodynamic therapy in the perioperative period <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Venous saturation depends on the balance between oxygen delivery with its covariates-arterial oxygen saturation, cardiac output, and haemoglobin level-and oxygen consumption.</s><s>With some limitations, S cv O 2 can be used as a substitute for S v O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>In clinical practice, S cv O 2 is often measured as the use of pulmonary arterial catheters in the context of critical illness; surgery has declined over the last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Studies using venous saturation as a goal to optimize patients in the ICU reported beneficial results.</s><s>In the landmark study by Rivers et al., performed in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, this concept has been shown to decrease mortality in the patient group undergoing a treatment algorithm aiming for an S cv O 2 of at least 70% <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Another study in a cardiac surgery patient population reported a decreased overall complication rate in patients optimized to an S v O 2 of at least 70% and lactate below 2.0 mmol/L during ICU treatment after surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In that study, patients of the protocol group had a shorter length of stay in the hospital and overall morbidity was lower by the time of hospital discharge.</s></p><p><s>In older as well as in recent studies, low S cv O 2 and S v O 2 were linked to unfavourable outcomes <ref type="bibr"

patients with S cv O 2 below 60% is in line with previous reports.</s><s>A study by Perz et al. investigated venous saturation measurements after cardiac surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, indicating that an S cv O 2 below 60.8% in patients undergoing cardiac surgery was associated with an unfavourable outcome.</s><s>Values are presented as median

day.</s></p><p><s>However, optimizing venous saturation above a certain cutoff may carry some risks that lie within the physiology of venous saturations.</s><s>Our finding of increased mortality and complication rate in patients with S cv O 2 above 80% accords with smaller reports from critically ill patients and from patients after cardiac surgery.</s></p><p><s>Pope et al. reported data from 619 emergency department (ED) patients.</s><s>In regard to the maximum S cv O 2 during treatment in the ED, mortality rates of both the hypoxia group (40%) and the hyperoxia group (34%) were significantly higher than the rate of mortality in the normoxia group (21%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, in line with our results in cardiac surgery patients, central venous hyperoxia in ED patients with suspected sepsis seems to be associated with unfavourable outcomes as well.</s><s>Yet another study provided evidence that hyperoxia in patients with sepsis is linked with unfavourable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>That study retrospectively analysed data from all ICU admissions of patients with septic shock and reported the maximum S cv O 2 within the first 72 hours after the onset of shock.</s><s>In conclusion, high levels of S cv O 2 (more than 80%) in the first 72 hours after resuscitating patients in septic shock were associated with increased mortality which might reflect an impaired use of oxygen as evidenced by increased lactate levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Owing to the retrospective nature of our data, it is possible only to report associations and not causality.</s><s>Therefore, we can only speculate about possible mechanisms leading to the increased complication and mortality rate in the group with high venous saturation measurements after cardiac surgery.</s><s>Also, we cannot exclude that changes in management between 2006 and 2013 contributed to this finding.</s><s>One further point of concern might be that S cv O 2 measurements after admission to the ICU were missing in about one fourth of the total population.</s><s>However, this seems negligible as baseline characteristics of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery regardless of effectuated S cv O 2 measurements did not differ statistically (data not shown).</s><s>Nevertheless, we believe that it is important to provide evidence that high venous saturation measurements should not be misinterpreted as safe but should be considered to be associated with increased mortality and complication rates.</s><s>Additionally, despite the increasing use of S cv O 2 in clinical practice, several lines of evidence point out that, at least during states of increased oxygen extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, the difference between S cv O 2 and S v O 2 may increase.</s><s>In these situations, S cv O 2 levels do not reliably reflect the 'true' systemic balance between oxygen delivery and demand.</s><s>Nonetheless, with respect to the frequent use of S cv O 2 in routine practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and current recommendations for the use of S cv O 2 for titrating haemodynamic therapy in cardiac surgery patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the findings of the present study have relevant practical implications.</s></p></div>
