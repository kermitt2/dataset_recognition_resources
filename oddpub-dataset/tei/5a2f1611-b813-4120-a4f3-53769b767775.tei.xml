<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>A total of 333 school children (boys: 71.5%), who were hypertensive after three separate visits, finally participated in the assessment of TOD.</s><s>Boys had higher height and weight and systolic BP, and were more likely to be obese, but they had lower diastolic BP than girls (p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>Similar results were presented by z scores of these indicators controlling for age and sex, with the reference data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the prevalence of obesity was high in each age group, with the corresponding figures as 71.7, 62.9, 74.2, and 52.9%, in age groups of 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, and 15-17 years, respectively.</s><s>Levels of cIMT were significantly higher in boys than in girls, while other markers were not significantly different between boys and girls.</s><s>Levels of RWT, cIMT, uric acid, urinary creatinine, ALT, and AST were significantly different within age groups; however, there were no discrepancies regarding metabolic data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Among 333 school children with hypertension, 47.4% had elevated cIMT, 34.5% had abnormal left ventricular geometry (LVG) (including 12.2% who had concentric hypertrophy, 20.2% who had eccentric hypertrophy, and 2.1% who had concentric remodeling), 32.4% had LVH (15.0% with severe LVH), 29.2% had dyslipidemia and 22.6% had abnormal fasting plasma glucose, 7.6% had abnormal liver function, and 4.1% had microalbuminuria.</s><s>The prevalence of subclinical TOD was much higher in hypertensive children who were overweight and obese than those with normal weight, except microalbuminuria (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>There was significant difference in the prevalence of abnormal LVG and elevated cIMT across age groups, with the prevalence being higher in children aged 9-14 years.</s><s>Girls had a higher proportion of microalbuminuria than boys (8.2 vs. 2.6%).</s><s>No sex difference was observed regarding the prevalence of other TOD and metabolic abnormalities (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The present study showed that subclinical TOD was common in Chinese hypertensive children and adolescents.</s></p><p><s>The prevalence of elevated cIMT and LVH was 47.4 and 32.4%, respectively.</s><s>In addition, cardiovascular damages were more prevalent in children aged 9-14 years.</s></p><p><s>LVH is a well-established independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adulthood.</s><s>In this study, we used two criteria to define LVH.</s><s>One was based on the age-and sex-specific 95th percentile values of LVMI (pediatric Chi-squared analyses are performed to assess the differences in prevalence of TOD across sex or age groups.</s></p><p><s>criteria) proposed by Khoury et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>The other one was based on the cutoff of 51 g/m 2.7 (adult criteria) recommended by the 2017 updated American Academy of Pediatrics guideline <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, which had been shown to predict risk of cardiovascular disease in adults.</s><s>Using the criteria proposed by Khoury et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, one study conducted in Michigan showed that 35% (49 of 141) of hypertensive children had LVH <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Litwin et al. reported that the prevalence of LVH was 46.5% in 86 children and adolescents with untreated primary hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Based on the adult criteria (LVMI ≥ 51g/m 2.7 ), one previous study of 129 children with hypertension showed that the prevalence of severe LVH was 15.5% <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>Despite possible ethnic difference in LVM levels, the prevalence of LVH seemed to be similar, especially for severe LVH.</s><s>All these studies demonstrated that LVH was prevalent in hypertensive children.</s><s>However, only a quarter of children with hypertension underwent echocardiography examination to assess the presence of LVH <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, though it was recommended as a routine examination in pediatric hypertensive patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>LVH can be further described by LVG, classified by the presence of LVH or high RWT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, which was also associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes in adults.</s><s>A cross-sectional study of 141 hypertensive children reported that 40% had abnormal LVG, including 11% who had concentric hypertrophy and 16% who had eccentric hypertrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, which are similar to our study.</s></p><p><s>cIMT, the most common method to assess vascular structure, has been regarded as an index of increased cardiovascular risks.</s><s>A study reported that children with hypertension had elevated cIMT compared to their control groups (0.46 ± 0.06 vs. 0.35 ± 0.12 mm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Kollias et al. reported that cIMT was correlated with systolic BP <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>These results are consistent with our findings.</s><s>Furthermore, in our study, cardiovascular damages were more prevalent in children aged 9-14 years old.</s><s>This may be due to intense hormonal changes and elevated insulin resistance during this early pubertal period.</s><s>Actually, evidence has suggested that puberty exerts negative influence on endothelial function and antioxidant mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Kidney is another target organ impaired in hypertensive children.</s><s>In 2012, Seeman et al. reported that the incidence of microalbuminuria was 20% in children with hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, much higher than our result (4.1%).</s><s>Different methods used for urine collection and the severity of hypertension may explain the discrepancy between the two studies.</s><s>The study by Seeman et al. used random urine samples, while our study used morning urine samples.</s><s>Evidence suggested that morning urine samples usually contain lower albuminuria than daytime samples due to daily physical activities.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, the prevalence of obesity among hypertensive children and adolescents was high (64.0%).</s><s>Based on data from the first occasion (n = 7,840), the prevalence of obesity was 20% in the general population.</s><s>In addition, the prevalence of obesity was also low (17.5%) in normal BP children from the same population.</s><s>This is expected since obesity is a well-documented main risk factor for childhood hypertension.</s><s>Previous studies also showed that the prevalence of overweight and obesity ranged from 51 to 72% among hypertensive children, which are consistent with our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>The prevalence of most TOD was much higher in overweight and obese children than their normal weight counterparts in our study, except for microalbuminuria.</s><s>This finding is as expected since overweight and obesity are well-documented risk factors of TOD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>However, microalbuminuria was more prevalent in normal weight hypertensive children.</s><s>This can be explained by the fact that normal weight children usually do more physical activity than obese ones, and hence they may be more likely to excrete more albumin <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, we found that the prevalence of an increased cIMT was high in both normal weight and obese children although it was more prevalent in obese children, which indicates that childhood hypertension may be associated with vascular damage independent of the effect of obesity.</s><s>Our finding is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The current study showed comprehensive descriptions of hypertension-related TOD including the heart, arteries, kidney damages, and dyslipidemia in hypertensive children and adolescents screened across three separate visits from the general population.</s><s>However, our study also has several limitations.</s><s>First, only children who were diagnosed with hypertension were assessed TOD measures, and there were no normal BP controls in our study.</s><s>Thus, we cannot assess whether hypertensive children are more likely to develop related TOD.</s><s>Future studies should consider using age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls for the comparison.</s><s>Second, we used Chinese children and adolescents' BP references <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> to define elevated BP across three visits, which made our results incomparable with other studies.</s><s>Third, BP re-assessments were only made in children who had elevated readings on the preceding visits.</s><s>This may cause some underestimation in prevalence of hypertension, especially when some children had normal BP at initial visit, but actually had elevated BP at subsequent visits.</s><s>Fourth, there was less consensus on criteria used for the definitions of TOD in the pediatric population, and some criteria were based on the adult references, which may lead to under-estimations for the true abnormal status.</s><s>Fifth, it is worth mentioning, however, that the reproducibility of TOD measurements was not assessed in the present study, which may impact the stability of results.</s><s>Sixth, other more sensitive indices of subclinical target organ damage, e.g., arterial stiffness measurements, cardiac strain imaging echocardiography, and liver transient elastography were not assessed in the present study.</s></p></div>
