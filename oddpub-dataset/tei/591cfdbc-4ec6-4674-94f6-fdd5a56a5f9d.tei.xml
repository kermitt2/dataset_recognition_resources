<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nurses' Health Study II</head><p><s>Study population-The Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) is an ongoing cohort study established in 1989 when 116,429 US nurses ages 25-42 years completed a baseline questionnaire.</s><s>Every two years, information on reproductive variables, lifestyle factors, and disease outcomes was collected via questionnaires.</s><s>Follow-up rates at each questionnaire cycle consistently have been 85-90%.</s></p><p><s>Migraine assessment-On the 1989 baseline questionnaire, participants were asked if they had physician-diagnosed migraine.</s><s>This question was also included on the 1993 and 1995 follow-up questionnaires.</s><s>Once a woman reported that she was a migraineur, she was considered a migraineur for all subsequent follow-up cycles.</s></p><p><s>Ovarian cancer assessment-In the NHSII, women indicated that they had been diagnosed with incident ovarian cancer on the biennial questionnaires.</s><s>For each participant who reported a new ovarian cancer diagnosis, or diagnoses identified through death certificates, we requested medical records and pathology reports from the participant or next of kin.</s><s>A gynaecologic pathologist, blinded to migraine status, reviewed the records to confirm the diagnosis and abstract information on the tumor, including invasiveness and histologic subtype.</s><s>For a subset of 215 ovarian cancer cases, we compared the histologic type abstracted from the pathology report with a standardized review of pathology slides completed by a gynaecologic pathologist.</s><s>As the concordance was 98 percent for invasiveness and 83 percent for histology, we used histologic type from the medical record for all cases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Women's Health Study</head><p><s>Study population-The Women's Health Study (WHS) was a randomized, placebocontrolled trial of the effects of low dose aspirin and vitamin E on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 39,876 US female health professionals aged 45 and older.</s><s>Since the end of the trial in March 2004, participants have been followed on an observational basis.</s><s>Twice during the first year and yearly thereafter, women completed a questionnaire asking about demographics, lifestyle information and disease outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Migraine assessment-At baseline, the women were asked, "Have you ever had migraine headaches?"</s><s>Women who answered yes were classified as migraineurs.</s><s>Previous validation studies in the WHS have demonstrated good agreement between self-reported migraine and the International Classification of Headache Disorders II. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>arian cancer assessment-Women reported diagnoses of ovarian cancer on followup questionnaires.</s><s>For all self-reported cases or cases identified through death certificates, we requested medical records and pathology reports from the participant or next-of-kin.</s><s>An endpoints committee of physicians, blinded to migraine status, reviewed the records to confirm the diagnosis and abstract information on the tumor, including invasiveness and histologic subtype.</s></p><p><s>Statistical analysis-Participants accrued person-time from the return date of the baseline questionnaire until the date of ovarian cancer diagnosis, diagnosis of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), bilateral oophorectomy, pelvic irradiation, death, or the end of follow-up (2013 in NHSII and 2014 in WHS).</s><s>To ensure we do not exclude women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer as a result of their bilateral oophorectomy, we use bilateral oophorectomy data from the questionnaire cycle prior to the two-year follow-up cycle when censoring.</s><s>In NHSII, at baseline, we excluded women with cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer (N=1050), bilateral oophorectomy (N=2225), or menopause due to pelvic irradiation (N=30).</s><s>In WHS, at baseline, we excluded women missing information on migraine status (N=119), women with a history of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer (N=61), bilateral oophorectomy (N=6196), or menopause due to pelvic irradiation (N=10).</s></p><p><s>To control as finely as possible for confounding by age, calendar time and any possible twoway interactions between these two time scales, we stratified the analyses jointly by age in months at start of follow-up and calendar year of the current questionnaire cycle.</s><s>The time scale for the analysis was then measured as months since the start of the current questionnaire cycle, which is equivalent to age in months.</s><s>Cox regression with timedependent covariates stratified by age and time period was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</s><s>In the multivariable model, we adjusted for body mass index (BMI), tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral oophorectomy, parity, oral contraceptive use, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, smoking status, alcohol use, NSAID use, menopausal status, and type of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) use (estrogen only, estrogen and progesterone, and other HT).</s><s>We used interaction terms and stratified analyses to assess effect modification by age (&lt;45, 45-&lt;55, 55+) and menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal, unknown).</s></p><p><s>We used Cox proportional hazards competing risk analysis, stratified by time period to allow for different associations by tumor histology (serous/poorly differentiated versus non-serous [endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell]). <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>The estimates for age, parity, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, and estrogen only HT use were allowed to vary by tumor histology based on prior analyses, whereas estimates for the remaining covariates were constrained to a single effect estimate across subtypes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>To test for heterogeneity by tumor subtype within cohort, we compared a model allowing the association for migraine to vary by subtype to a model that constrained the migraine estimates to be the same across subtypes.</s><s>We considered a two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 to be statistically significant and used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) for all analyses.</s><s>This investigation was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Brigham and Women's Hospital.</s></p></div>
