<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study demonstrates that IV FCM is effective and well tolerated in pregnant women with IDA during late-stage pregnancy and that women using this treatment give birth to healthy newborns.</s><s>The increases in Hb levels were comparable between treatment arms in this study population.</s><s>Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met (FCM did not show superiority at week 3), this treatment did improve Hb levels to a significantly greater extent than oral iron by week 6 (P = 0.032).</s><s>Furthermore, we have demonstrated that FCM more rapidly and more effectively established normalized Hb levels (Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL) and was significantly more effective at replenishing iron stores than FS.</s></p><p><s>In preparation for childbirth, Hb levels are known to rise as pregnancy progresses and peak before delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The loss of blood at childbirth can be considerable -it is the most common cause of postpartum anemia -therefore, sufficient iron stores are of particular importance during delivery and the postpartum period to overcome the recurrence of ID/IDA in the mother <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and newborn <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, however, mean Hb levels appeared to be lower at the prior-to-delivery time point than at week 12 for both the FCM and the FS groups, inferring a decrease in Hb levels immediately prior to delivery.</s><s>It is important to note that, because many women had already given birth by week 12 of this study, patient numbers for all hematological parameter assessments were lower at week 12 than at the prior-to-delivery time point.</s><s>As a result, caution is warranted in interpreting week 12 data in the context of the other assessment time points.</s><s>Furthermore, measurements prior to delivery were taken approximately 2 weeks before birth and therefore may not reflect the peak levels seen at delivery.</s></p><p><s>A conservative FCM treatment regimen was used for this study.</s><s>This was based on dosage calculations according to the original label (with each single dose not to exceed 15 mg iron per kg of body weight); more recently, a single higher dosage of FCM (20 mg iron per kg of body weight) has been approved <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Use of the lower dose of FCM in our study may have impacted on the outcomes and it must be considered that use of a higher dose, in accordance with the current label, may lead to greater efficacy.</s><s>Our study is the first to compare FCM with FS in pregnant women; as such, confirmatory data are lacking in this particular patient population.</s><s>However, FCM treatment in postpartum women has been comprehensively investigated and evidence from three large randomized controlled trials performed across Europe and North America support our findings: FCM was found to be at least as effective as FS at increasing Hb levels, and it showed superiority in providing more reliable anemia correction and in a shorter time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>FCM has also been compared with IV iron sucrose in pregnant women in a retrospective, observational study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Here, the mean increase in Hb levels was numerically greater with FCM (1.54 g/dL) than with iron sucrose (1.17 g/dL), although this difference was not statistically significant.</s><s>What was markedly different was the mean follow-up between the two groups (28.4 vs 41.2 days, respectively; P = 0.01), indicating that restoration of normal Hb levels was achieved much more quickly with FCM <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to hematological effectiveness, a number of additional benefits of FCM over FS were demonstrated in our study.</s><s>FCM had a dramatically reduced burden of treatment: comparable improvements in Hb levels were achieved with a 12-fold lower total dose and a 12-fold lower duration of exposure to FCM compared with FS.</s><s>Outside the "compliance-friendly" environment of a clinical trial, a high burden of treatment can result in low compliance of patients with their medication, subsequently leading to worsening of disease and ultimately increased healthcare costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>For some patients, a single dose of FCM may correct IDA with no repeated administration required, thereby providing a more convenient option than other iron treatments and potentially increasing compliance.</s><s>In addition, treatment with FCM provided holistic benefit to these women in the later stages of their pregnancies.</s><s>Our findings demonstrated that improvements immediately prior to delivery in the vitality of pregnant women treated with FCM were clinically relevant, and it is worth noting that these effects were evident using a generic quality-of-life assessment tool, SF-36, that was not specifically designed for application in anemic populations.</s><s>It should be noted that study participants were not blinded to treatment and, therefore, the assessment of quality-of-life could have been influenced by subject bias.</s><s>However, our findings are in accordance with those from a previous randomized, controlled trial in which FCM was found to significantly improve symptomatic fatigue in iron-deficient women <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Increased vitality can be of particular benefit in coping with the extreme physical stresses experienced by women during pregnancy and childbirth.</s></p><p><s>FCM was well tolerated in pregnant women during their second and third trimesters.</s><s>The safety profile was consistent with what has been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and there were no unexpected safety concerns.</s><s>As expected, treatment with FCM led to fewer gastrointestinal adverse events than FS; this considerable and clinically relevant lower burden of gastrointestinal complications is likely to be beneficial to the overall feeling of wellbeing and quality of life for women in the late stages of pregnancy.</s><s>Gastrointestinal TEAEs led to discontinuation of FS in five women in our study and, as previously mentioned, such non-compliance increases the risk of IDA recurrence in these women.</s><s>The frequencies of serious TEAEs experienced after FCM treatment in this trial (which included "failed trial of labor", "fetal distress syndrome", "premature delivery" and "premature rupture of membranes") are in line with those seen in a recent Cochrane review of iron supplementation in pregnant women (pregnant women receiving placebo or no treatment: preterm birth, 7.3%; premature rupture of membranes, 12.2%; pre-eclampsia, 2.2%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Bronchospasm occurred in one woman treated with FCM that led to treatment withdrawal; this was considered to be a transient hypersensitivity reaction that resolved following discontinuation.</s><s>Parenterally administered iron preparations can cause hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm is recognized as an adverse event that can occur rarely with ferric carboxymaltose treatment and is listed in the approved label [rare event ( ≥ 1/10,000 to &lt; 1/1000 of the treated population)] <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>No complications associated with FCM treatment of the mothers were evident in the newborns.</s><s>Cord serum ferritin levels were found to be numerically (although not statistically significantly) higher following FCM treatment, compared with oral iron treatment.</s><s>Such cord serum ferritin levels reflect good iron reserves in the newborns for growth and development, thereby diminishing the risk of ID that can have important implications on infant morbidity and ongoing brain development and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, excessive levels of serum ferritin could indicate iron overload that can lead to serious complications for the newborn <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Such excessive levels were not observed in this study -all newborns of mothers treated with FCM had serum ferritin levels that fell within normal ranges <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and were completely healthy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>During the second and third trimesters, FCM has comparable efficacy to first-line oral iron treatment and is well tolerated in pregnant women with no complications evident in their newborns.</s><s>In late-stage pregnancy, when time to delivery is a limiting step, administration of FCM may be a more appropriate option than oral iron for rapid and effective anemia correction.</s><s>FCM is also a valuable alternative for pregnant women who lack a response to, are non-compliant with, or are intolerant of oral iron treatment, as well as those who have severe IDA.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1: Participant disposition.</s><s>TEAE= treatment-emergent adverse event.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
