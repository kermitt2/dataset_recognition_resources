<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Exclusion Criteria. Exclusion criteria were as follows:</head><p><s>patients aged less than 8 years at the time of completion of the questionnaire, non-German speaking families, children who were unable to understand and answer the questions due to severe disabilities, and families without written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Study Population.</head><p><s>Study participants were enrolled between August 2008 and August 2011 (patients with HBD) and in January 2010 (patients with TIA/stroke).</s><s>Out of 354 initial study participants 37 were older than 17 years (10.5%).</s><s>Of the remaining 299 study participants, 23 did not fill out the "revised KINDer Lebensqualitätsfragebogen" (KINDL-R, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>).</s><s>Thus the final dataset consists of 144 patients.</s><s>Of these 74 were patients with HBD (51.4%) and 70 were patients with stroke or TIA (48.6%).</s><s>The 74 patients with HBD were patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B ( = 36), patients with von Willebrand disease type 2 and type 3 ( = 22), patients with hereditary fibrinogen deficiency ( = 5), and patients with factor V, VII, and XI deficiency ( = 9).</s><s>Of these, 12 healthy siblings were willing to participate in this cross-sectional investigation.</s><s>Additionally, data were collected from 34 healthy unrelated peers recruited from the same catchment areas as the patients [kindergarten/school mates and friends].</s><s>Data from patients with stroke or TIA, their siblings ( = 14), and peers ( = 72) were derived from a previous investigation at the University of Münster <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Patients completed the questionnaires during a routine ambulatory follow-up visit (i) by themselves or (ii) if unable to read and write with the help of a study nurse but not with the help of their parents or other accompanying persons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">HrQoL Outcome.</head><p><s>The "revised KINDer Lebensqualitätsfragebogen" (KINDL-R) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is a generic instrument to assess HrQoL and was originally developed in German language (http://www.kindl.org/).</s><s>This 24-item self-administered or proxy-report questionnaire generates a total score (overall wellbeing) as well as scores for 6 subscales (physical wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, selfworth, family-related wellbeing, friend-related wellbeing, and school-related wellbeing).</s><s>Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better Hr-QoL.</s><s>The KINDL-R instrument is validated for use in healthy children and pediatric patients aged 4 to 16 years, in 3 age groups (4 to 7 years/8 to 12 years/13 to 16 years).</s><s>Out of 17,000 children and adolescents participating in a representative population sample, the German Health Survey for Children and Adolescents (Studie zur Gesundheit von Kindern und Jugendlichen in Deutschland, KIGGS), more than 6,800 completed the KINDL-R questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The psychometric properties for children ≥ 11 years were published in 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Data on the number of siblings and the current educational status were additionally collected.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p><s>In patients with HBD more than 40% (22 of 52 complete datasets) were in need of prophylactic substitution and additionally 16/52 (30.89%) were in need of both prophylactic and on-demand factor substitution.</s><s>Mean age of the study participants with HBD was 11.5 years while the mean age of study participants with stroke/TIA was 11.6 years (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The majority of patients had one sibling, while 20 (27%) patients with HBD and 6 (8.6%) patients with stroke/TIA had no siblings.</s><s>Less than 5% of children with HBD attended other than mainstream schools (e.g., schools for physically handicapped children).</s><s>The majority of children attended secondary schools.</s><s>Multivariate analyses within patients, siblings, and peers revealed no differences in self-reported overall wellbeing and all KINDL-R subdimensions in group 1 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; all  &gt; .05).</s><s>In group 2, differences occurred in multivariate analyses in self-reported overall wellbeing and all subdimensions (overall wellbeing  &lt; .001,</s><s>physical wellbeing  = .016,</s><s>emotional wellbeing  = .007,</s><s>self-worth  = .046,</s><s>familyrelated wellbeing  = .010,</s><s>friend-related wellbeing  &lt; .001,</s><s>and school-related wellbeing  = .003).</s><s>When testing for pairwise differences in group 2 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>), no differences were seen between patients and their siblings while significant differences were apparent between patient and peers in overall wellbeing and all subdimensions (all  &lt; .016)</s><s>and between siblings and peers regarding family-related and school-related wellbeing, respectively (both  &lt; .016).</s><s>In adjusted multivariate analyses, group 1 showed no differences in self-reported HrQoL between patients and siblings and between patients and peers, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>), while differences were apparent in group 2 between patients with stroke/TIA and their healthy peers regarding self-worth and friend-related wellbeing (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The psychometric characteristics of the KINDL-R questionnaires, that is, the internal consistencies of self-reported KINDL-R questionnaires, are displayed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>. Taking a cut-off of  = 0.7, overall wellbeing in both patients and healthy controls met the definition of acceptable internal consistency, as did the internal consistency in the representative German population sample, the KIGGS-study (last column in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Internal consistency of the subdimension was somewhat lower but followed pattern comparable to the population norms deriving from the KIGGS-study.</s><s>Only one subdimension, friend-related wellbeing in healthy controls, showed poor results (Cronbach's  below 0.5).</s><s>However,  several other subdimensions (emotional wellbeing and school-related wellbeing) showed a reliability just above the lower threshold of a modest reliability (Cronbach's  between 0.5 and &lt; 0.7).</s><s>Comparison is limited by the fact that norm data were solely available for the age group of 11 years and older.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The most relevant finding in this investigation was the overall good health-related quality of life (HrQoL)-as measured with a generic instrument, the KINDL-R questionnaire-in children with hereditary bleeding disorders.</s><s>No differences in HrQoL occurred compared with their siblings.</s><s>In children with stroke/TIA, differences in self-reported HrQoL were apparent in univariate analyses and related to differences between patients and their peers.</s><s>These differences in selfreported HrQoL remained in multivariate models for selfworth and friend-related wellbeing.</s><s>Internal consistency of the KINDL-questionnaires was good for overall wellbeing for all study groups and followed pattern of population based findings for the KINDL-R subscales.</s></p><p><s>When considering the adjusted differences between patients and siblings and patients and peers, respectively, in this investigation, observed differences in overall wellbeing were small (less than one point) indicating comparable   HrQoL between groups.</s><s>However, when looking for differences in HrQoL subdimensions, it appeared that differences between patients and siblings as well as between patients and peers in group 1 (hereditary bleeding disorders) were altogether less pronounced than in group 2 (stroke, TIA).</s><s>Furthermore, in this group absolute differences were more pronounced in the comparison of patients and peers than in the comparison of patients and their siblings.</s><s>Across all four comparisons (see Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2 and 3</ref>) absolute differences between groups were largest in self-worth.</s><s>Choosing an arbitrary cut-off of 5 points for a clinical significant and meaningful difference between two groups, patients with stroke/TIA showed in five out of six KINDL-R domains lower HrQoL than their peers (of these two showing statistical significance either, even when applying strict constraints due to multiple testing) while there were solely two domains clinically relevant affected between patients with stroke/TIA and their siblings and only one in group 1.</s><s>Thus intense medical care of patients with HBD (38 out of 52 HBD patients were in need for prophylactic and/or on-demand factor substitution) may enable young patients a quality of life similar to their sisters, brothers, and friends.</s><s>The probable clinical (although in this investigation not statistical) significant impairment in selfworth in patients with HBD compared to their healthy friends may nevertheless indicate a need for psychological support and for improvement of self-esteem.</s></p><p><s>In other chronic medical conditions with no necessarily functional restrictions in daily life comparable findings were reported: no differences between HrQoL in juvenile patients with sickle cell disease and their siblings were found, but siblings scored in three out of 10 domains of the KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire worse than Dutch population norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In children with stroke/TIA with ongoing neurological deficits in &gt;90% <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> clinical relevant impairments were more apparent.</s><s>This concerned-apart from self-worthadditional social dimensions, both in comparison to siblings and, even more pronounced, in comparison to peers.</s><s>When looking at absolute values, differences were more pronounced in psychological and social domains than in physical wellbeing.</s></p><p><s>Our findings in patients with stroke/TIA reflected earlier findings from other groups of children and adolescents with chronic medical conditions leading to functional restrictions: in patients with cardiac disorders, Manlhiot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> found in 10-20-year-old patients after Fontan procedure compared with their healthy siblings impaired HrQoL in all domains of the generic Peds-QoL questionnaire.</s><s>Adult survivors of Tetralogy of Fallot (224 survivors out of 1,693 repairs over a period of 44 years) showed likewise impaired general health and physical functioning (as assessed with the generic SF-36 questionnaire) compared with their siblings, especially in those with surgery at older age <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Likewise in patients with neurologic conditions, Mowry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> found worse HrQoL in children with multiple sclerosis (mean age 14 years) in comparison with their siblings; HrQoL was evaluated with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and impairment in HrQoL was associated with neurologic deficits.</s><s>Likewise impaired HrQoL in juvenile patients with other severe chronic medical conditions in comparison with their healthy siblings was found in children with cystic fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, in children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, except for the social-relationship domain of the WHOQOL-Bref <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and in children with hereditary retinal disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Points</head><p><s>These findings are based on small sample sizes in a crosssectional study design, all analyses were exploratory, and results should therefore be interpreted with caution.</s><s>There were no data on nonresponder; thus the representativeness regarding the source population remains unclear.</s><s>The intercorrelation among test items measured with Cronbach's  was good: in all study subgroups overall wellbeing scores showed an acceptable internal consistency ( &gt; 0.7).</s><s>In subdimensions of the KINDL-R score however some subgroups showed poorer results but in the representative KIGGS population sample (only children ≥ 11 years) some subdimensions were also below acceptable internal consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The poor internal consistency in healthy controls in one subdimension and the modest reliability in all but one subdimension in both patients and healthy controls may reflect limitations of the questionnaire per se as well as specific limitations of the small sample size in this investigation.</s><s>When combining all study subgroups Cronbach's  was 0.82 and subscales ranged between 0.52 and 0.67 (data not shown).</s><s>Thus, the use of the generic KINDL-R questionnaire seems applicable in this specific setting.</s><s>Self-reported measures of health status are regarded as the primary method for assessing HrQoL in children and adolescents once they have reached a certain age and level of cognitive development <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Longitudinal data were necessary to elucidate whether adolescents or adults with HBD who showed as children a HrQoL comparable to population norms exhibit over time, relative to the population level, a deterioration of their self-reported Hr-QoL, especially regarding physical wellbeing.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Inclusion Criteria.</s><s>Inclusion criteria were as follows: pediatric patients with HBD, aged 8 to 16 years, admitted to 6 specialized treatment centers in Germany.</s><s>Patients were recruited during their routine outpatient's visits in clinics in major cities in Germany (2 centers in Berlin [ = 36], Duisburg [ = 10], Leipzig [ = 3], Münster [ = 15], and Munich [ = 11]).</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
