<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION Background</head><p><s>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder characterised by recurrent collapse of the upper airway.</s><s>This chronic condition may be diagnosed by the presence of symptoms and, depending on the specific criteria used for making the diagnosis, more than five episodes of apnoea, hypopnoea or respiratory effort-related arousal per hour of sleep (apnoea hypopnoea index, AHI, ≥5/h). <ref type="bibr">1 2</ref> Daytime symptoms refer to excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headaches, decreased concentration, memory loss, decreased libido and irritability.</s><s>Other OSA-related symptoms include witnessed apnoea, snoring, nonrefreshing sleep, and gasping or choking at night. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Recent epidemiological data report that an estimated 70 million people in the USA alone are affected by OSA, making it the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). <ref type="bibr">4 5</ref></s><s>In the general adult</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations of this study</head><p><s>▪ This work uses a large clinical database consisting of preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative patient data.</s><s>▪ Our prediction model draws on well-established clinical characteristics associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) as well as new measures aimed at improving dynamic risk assessment in a perioperative setting.</s><s>▪ The results of this study may enable perioperative clinicians to identify adult surgical patients at highest risk for OSA, optimise preoperative interventions, and appropriately triage care postoperatively based on intraoperative events.</s><s>▪ Potential limitations relate to the need for validation studies in data sets from other institutions to determine generalisability of prediction score.</s><s>population, approximately 13% of men and 6% of women have moderate-to-severe SDB, defined as AHI ≥15/h. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>It is also estimated that 14% of men and 5% of women have AHI ≥5/h plus daytime symptoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>The prevalence of SDB without daytime symptoms is even higher and reaches values of up to 9% in women and 24% in men. <ref type="bibr">2 6</ref> It is possible that such epidemiological data underestimate the frequency of OSA among today's general population since obesity, a major driver of OSA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> has greatly increased in the last decade. <ref type="bibr">5 8</ref></s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Upper airway collapse in the perioperative setting results in hypoventilation and is an important component of the mechanism of PRCs.</s><s>In studies previously reported by our laboratory, independent of OSA, reintubation and unplanned ICU admission result in a 70-fold to 90-fold increase in in-hospital mortality. <ref type="bibr">15 16</ref></s><s>However, despite an increased rate of PRCs, SDB, as identified by diagnostic codes, was paradoxically associated with lower mortality, hospital length of stay and costs among certain surgical specialties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>The mechanisms of the opposed effects of OSA on respiratory complication rate and mortality are unclear.</s><s>We speculate that reintubation in patients with OSA is typically the consequence of upper airway dysfunction rather than pulmonary pathology, and the former can be treated more efficiently.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanism of perioperative obstructive sleep apnoea</head><p><s>Quantification of perioperative vulnerability to upper airway collapse requires consideration of preoperative and perioperative risk factors that affect the balance between collapsing forces and dilating forces of the upper airway.</s><s>Perioperative anatomical and physiological factors need to be taken into account.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anatomical abnormalities increase collapsing forces</head><p><s>Anatomical risk factors in patients with OSA include a reduction in the size of the retropalatal and retroglossal airway. <ref type="bibr">17 18</ref></s><s>Perioperatively, anatomical vulnerability is augmented, thereby increasing upper airway instability.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> summarises perioperative risk factors that can compromise upper airway anatomy.</s><s>Mechanical loads to the collapsible segments of the retropalatal and retropharyngeal upper airway lead to physical compression of the airway.</s><s>Clinically, such an extraluminal mechanical load can occur as a consequence of a postoperative haematoma following cervical, otolaryngology or thyroid surgery. <ref type="bibr">19 20</ref></s><s>In addition, peripharyngeal oedema may occur in perioperative medicine as a consequence of fluid overload.</s><s>Bradley and colleagues studied the effects of antishock trouser inflation on upper airway size, and reported narrowed pharynx and enlarged neck circumference measured by acoustic pharyngometry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>Congestive heart failure increases the AHI, which presumably, is the consequence of nocturnal rostral fluid shift. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>Airway patency may also be affected by peripharyngeal inflammation and oedema in the setting of intubation and extubation.</s></p><p><s>Impaired caudal traction on the trachea increases collapsibility Isono and colleagues have conducted extensive investigations of position-dependent effects on airway obstruction.</s><s>In anaesthetised and paralysed patients with OSA, the authors found that the lateral and sitting positions improve the collapsibility of the passive pharyngeal airway. <ref type="bibr">23 24</ref></s><s>mong patients with OSA, the supine position not only promotes a more obstructive orientation of the pharyngeal soft tissues, but also reduces caudal traction, thereby increasing vulnerability to upper airway collapse.</s></p><p><s>During inspiration, caudal traction on the airway due to lung expansion dilates and stabilises the upper airway, a force that opposes the negative intraluminal pressure and prevents collapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>The supine position during surgery, immediate postoperative period, and transition to sleep impairs tracheal traction on the airway and promotes collapse, <ref type="bibr">23 24</ref> as illustrated in figure 1A.</s><s>Tracheal traction is also impaired by any event that reduces lung volume, often secondary to diaphragmatic dysfunction.</s><s>Impaired function of the respiratory pump muscles (diaphragm and intercostal muscles) results in ineffective expansion of the lung and occurs in the setting of surgery and trauma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>Pain-induced splinting and pharmacological agents, such as opioids, decrease drive to the respiratory pump muscles, thereby preventing full lung inflation and reducing tracheal traction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>Studies in the intensive care unit have demonstrated how systemic inflammation and mechanical ventilation dramatically disrupts diaphragmatic function. <ref type="bibr">28 29</ref></s><s>uromuscular mechanisms of perioperative airway collapse A balance between the upper airway dilator muscles (genioglossus, tensor palatine) and the respiratory pump muscles (diaphragm, intercostal muscles) exist to maintain upper airway patency during wakefulness and sleep, as illustrated in figure 1B.</s><s>Respiratory pump muscles generate inspiratory airflow associated with negative intraluminal pressure, which is detected by mechanoreceptors and transmitted to the upper airway dilator muscles via the hypoglossal nerve.</s><s>As a result, the genioglossus contracts and stabilises the upper airway.</s><s>Respiration is also stimulated by hypoxia and hypercarbia, which are detected by chemoreceptors.</s><s>In addition to wakefulness, information transmitted by mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors stimulate respiratory arousal, which has been previously defined as arousal from sleep and other drug-induced or endogenous impairments of consciousness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s>Cortical effects on respiratory arousal are important, and any decrease in arousal can impair the voluntary effort to breathe spontaneously through a patent upper airway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s> variety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological perioperative factors affect respiratory arousal.</s><s>While the specific effects of perioperative pharmacological agents depend on agent, dose and specific muscle group, studies have shown that such agents largely dampen stimulation to the nerves controlling respiratory muscles.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anaesthetics and sedatives</head><p><s>Studies in humans and animals have demonstrated the effects of anaesthetics on the upper airway by a variety of mechanisms.</s><s>Anaesthetics decrease muscle and neural activity important for respiration as well as wakefulness through varying mechanisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>Propofol, an agent commonly used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, dose-dependently increases collapsibility of the upper airway through depressed respiratory drive to and direct inhibition of upper airway dilator muscle activity in humans. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref></s><s>In humans, anaesthetised with isoflurane, reflexive activity or the responsiveness of upper airway dilator muscles to negative pressure, was found to be greatly reduced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref></s><s>The diminishing effects of anaesthetics on neuronal activity also differ between hypoglossal and phrenic nerve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref></s><s>With a focus on neural mechanisms for altered upper airway activity, Nishino et al 36 investigated the differential effects of anaesthetics and found greater dampening of hypoglossal nerve input relative to the phrenic nerve.</s><s>This effect may result in greater anaesthesia-induced impairment of upper airway dilators compared to respiratory pump muscles, increasing the upper airway's propensity for collapse.</s><s>While this effect was observed across three classes of drugs (volatile, barbiturate and benzodiazepine), ketamine reduced neural input to the upper airway dilator muscles and respiratory pump muscles equally.</s><s>Furthermore, ketamine's effect on the upper airway dilator muscles was less relative to GABAergic anaesthetics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s>Such findings are corroborated by mechanistic studies in rats that demonstrate a dissociation between loss of consciousness and upper airway dilator muscle function under ketamine anaesthesia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref></s><s>Taken together, studies suggest that patients with OSA, who have preoperative upper airway instability, may be at a heightened risk of upper airway collapse when under the influence of anaesthetics.</s><s>The unique effects associated with ketamine, however, suggest that this drug may be a safer choice for patients with OSA.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opioids</head><p><s>The use of opioids for postoperative pain management has been increasingly identified as a contributor to postoperative exacerbation of SDB. <ref type="bibr">38 39</ref></s><s>Studies in human and animal subjects have investigated the mechanism by which patients with preoperative OSA may be vulnerable to the effects of perioperative opioids.</s><s>Patients with OSA have increased sensitivity to pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> as well as increased sensitivity to the respiratory depressant effects of Caudal tracheal traction stabilises the upper airway such that it is less vulnerable to collapse.</s><s>CPAP treatment can evoke caudal tracheal traction and increase end-expiratory lung volume.</s><s>Collapsing physical forces are those that increase the mechanical load on the upper airway (haematoma, oedema, fat) and those that reduce caudal tracheal traction (atelectasis, supine, flat position).</s><s>(B) Pathological physiology.</s><s>The vulnerable perioperative upper airway physiology is illustrated as a scale, demonstrating the fragile balance between activation of respiratory pump muscles and upper airway dilator muscles (green zone).</s><s>When activated, pump muscles generate negative inspiratory pressure and tip the balance to upper airway collapse (red zone).</s><s>In normal physiology, upper airway dilator muscles activate to counterbalance the negative inspiratory pressure and dilate the upper airway.</s><s>Underactivation of airway dilator muscles, such as the tongue muscle, will result in collapse (red zone).</s><s>A variety of perioperative events affect respiratory arousal, which can impair airway patency by overactivating pump or underactivating dilator muscles, respectively.</s><s>Patients with OSA are at higher vulnerability towards collapse, and the specific pathophysiological mechanism of the increased perioperative vulnerability to collapse in OSA are emphasised in yellow colour and denoted with an asterisk.</s><s>CPAP, continuous positive airway pressure; OSA, obstructive sleep apnoea.</s></p><p><s>opioids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref></s><s>Such findings are particularly relevant to the patient with postoperative OSA given the effects of opioids on upper airway patency.</s><s>Animal studies have shown that opioids increase upper airway resistance, resulting in obstruction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref></s><s>Opioids directly inhibit hypoglossal motoneurons, which leads to suppressed genioglossus activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref></s><s>Thus, the use of opioids during and immediately after surgery is an important perioperative factor to consider in patients with OSA when assessing the risk of upper airway instability and the PRCs that may arise as a consequence.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal agents</head><p><s>Neuromuscular blockade agents act longer than the duration of surgery and postoperative residual curarisation affects postoperative respiratory outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref></s><s>Upper airway dilators are more vulnerable to minimal effects of neuromuscular blocking agents compared to the respiratory pump muscles. <ref type="bibr">47 48</ref></s><s>This differential activation of pump versus dilator muscles may set off an unwanted chain of events such that the relatively more active respiratory pump muscles generate excessive negative intrathoracic pressure, resulting in negative pressure pulmonary oedema. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref></s><s>Even at levels producing minimal blockade, as measured by train-of-four ratio 0.5-1, neuromuscular blocking agents increased upper airway collapsibility and impaired compensatory genioglossus response to negative pharyngeal pressure challenges. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref></s><s>tudies in surgical patients have demonstrated the dosedependent association between intermediate-acting neuromuscular blocking agents and PRCs, an effect shown to be unyielding despite neostigmine-based reversal at end of surgery. <ref type="bibr">16 51 52</ref></s><s>On the basis of the pathophysiology of the disease, patients with OSA should have an increased vulnerability to the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal agents. <ref type="bibr">47 50 53</ref></s><s>However, population-based studies aiming to quantify the effects of residual neuromuscular blockade in patients with and without risk of OSA are currently missing.</s></p><p><s>The impact of such pharmacological agents commonly used in anaesthesia care on the risk of respiratory outcomes in patients with OSA has yet to be determined.</s><s>Our study will address the unmet need of evaluating the perioperative effect of neuromuscular blocking agents, reversal agents, opioids, sedatives and anaesthetics in patients at risk of OSA.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-pharmacological events</head><p><s>Non-pharmacological perioperative events, such as rapid eye movement (REM) rebound, encephalopathy, delirium, can disrupt respiratory arousal and result in upper airway collapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s>In the immediate postoperative period, patients commonly experience poor quality, disrupted and reduced sleep, resulting in a deficit of REM sleep. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54</ref></s><s>Sleep studies in surgical patients have identified an REM rebound effect, in which REM sleep returns acutely and suddenly. <ref type="bibr">54 55</ref></s><s>Increased amounts of REM during sleep is associated with impaired respiratory arousal and more frequent episodes of nocturnal hypoxaemia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56</ref></s><s>Patients with OSA also have diminished or lost airway reflex during non-REM sleep, so patients with OSA may be at an even greater propensity for upper airway collapse and hypoxaemia with phenomenon of REM rebound.</s><s>While patients with OSA have been shown to compensate for diminished airway sizes with higher basal genioglossus muscle activity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57</ref> this neuromuscular compensation has been found to be present only during wakefulness, and thus, futile in the setting of REM-predominant sleep.</s><s>Recent prospective studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in REM sleep in patients with and patients without OSA during the early postoperative period. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58</ref></s><s>Postoperatively, time spent in REM sleep did not consistently predict postoperative OSA severity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> which may be the consequence of REM suppression secondary to postoperative pain, as well as administration of opioids and sedatives.</s><s>Of note, studies have also identified other important contributors to SDB.</s><s>Events that impair a patient's level of consciousness also disrupt respiratory arousal and result in upper airway instability.</s><s>Such events include delirium, stroke, septic encephalopathy, systemic inflammation and metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycaemia and hypothyroidism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study rationale</head><p><s>In order to evaluate the perioperative risk of patients presenting with OSA, it is important to take into account the 'true' prevalence of the disease in the perioperative cohort.</s><s>An important limitation of the existing literature relates to the focus on patients who carry the clinical diagnosis of OSA.</s><s>As a consequence of analysing only those patients with an International Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) diagnostic code for SDB, a large subpopulation with undiagnosed OSA remain undetected.</s></p><p><s>The gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA is polysomnography.</s><s>According to current clinical guidelines for OSA evaluation, patients are prompted to undergo this sleep study if determined to be high risk by their physician. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>As a routine evaluation for OSA, polysomnography is impractical because of its limited availability, discomfort to the patient and high cost. <ref type="bibr">59 60</ref></s><s>The use of screening tools for OSA helps identify patients at risk of OSA.</s><s>Widely used scores include the Perioperative Sleep Apnea Prediction Score, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61</ref> the STOP-Bang <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62</ref> and Berlin Questionnaires, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref> and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64</ref></s><s>uch scores rely on a clinical exam to determine neck circumference and/or patient questionnaire of daytime OSA symptoms.</s><s>Not all patients are able to have their necks measured, and many patients are asymptomatic or unaware of their symptoms, limiting the ability of the existing scores to assess true prevalence of OSA.</s><s>Anaesthesiologists have also used scores, such as the Mallampati Score and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Checklist, to assess difficulty of intubation as related to a narrow upper airway, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65</ref> but there is inconsistency in reported sensitivity and specificity of the Mallampati score as a predictor of OSA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64</ref></s><s>urthermore, the currently available scores require data not routinely available from clinical databases, such as history of snoring and witnessed apnoea.</s><s>This proposal is based on the consideration that other data available in the patient's electronic medical record may be sufficient to predict OSA and its associated increased risk of PRCs.</s><s>Application of our prediction score on large perioperative data sets will permit research endeavours, such as the evaluation of the effect of OSA on patient outcomes and the justification of healthcare resource usage.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, understanding how pharmacological agents commonly used in perioperative care impact postoperative outcomes among patients with high risk of OSA will improve our ability to provide better care for this vulnerable surgical population.</s><s>Traditionally, anaesthesia providers have determined dosing of various drugs based on standard parameters of age, gender, height and weight.</s><s>However, such practices may not sufficiently guide providers in optimal drug administration, especially in a subpopulation more vulnerable to the effects of those drugs as already demonstrated in the literature.</s><s>More specifically, we would like to better understand the interaction between the disease OSA and opioids, neuromuscular blocking agents, neostigmine, sedatives and anaesthetics to optimally predict postoperative respiratory outcomes.</s><s>Using our prediction score for OSA in a large perioperative database, we will evaluate how the use of pharmacological agents modifies the risk of PRCs in patients with OSA.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS AND ANALYSIS Study overview</head><p><s>The proposed study is a retrospective cohort analysis using hospital-based electronic patient data and perioperative data on medications administered and patient vital signs.</s><s>We will use data from major clinical databases at Massachusetts General Hospital, a tertiary care facility and teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.</s><s>In addition, polysomnography data will be extracted from clinical databases at several hospitals affiliated with Partners Healthcare.</s></p><p><s> The Research Patient Data Registry contains demographic and billing data regarding patient comorbidities and postoperative outcome and survival.</s><s>The Anesthesia Information Management System contains physiological data from patient monitors as well as information on medical history and documentation of important surgery and anaesthesia-related events, including adverse events, perioperative procedures, and drug and fluid therapy.</s><s>In addition, we will extract data related to hospital length of stay, discharge, and cost of care from our institution's administrative database, EPSi.</s><s>Patient data from these databases are linked through unique patient identifiers, and the variables described in this protocol will be abstracted to form one database.</s><s>The present database spans January 2007 to August 2014, and includes 140 000 surgical cases.</s><s>On the basis of previous work, we will conservatively anticipate that 25% of the cases will not satisfy inclusion criteria due to patient's age, emergency status and missing data. <ref type="bibr">15 51</ref></s><s>Thus, we estimate 100 000 patient cases will meet our inclusion criteria.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject selection</head><p><s>For the three primary objectives, we will include all adult surgical patients who underwent general anaesthesia and received endotracheal intubation or airway management by supraglottic airway device at our institution, for whom inpatient admission was planned, between January 2007 and August 2014.</s><s>Because reintubation is a component of our composite outcome of PRCs, we will only include those patients who have had removal of all airway management devices within the operating room after the procedure.</s><s>Surgical procedures followed by reintubation for an additional scheduled surgical procedure in the operating room after initial extubation or removal of airway device will be excluded from the study, as we presume that such cases did not require reintubation in the setting of adverse postoperative respiratory status.</s><s>Patients who underwent surgery in the 4 weeks prior to the study case will be excluded.</s><s>Finally, all patients with an intraoperative death will be excluded from the study since OSA is not a biological mechanism of intraoperative death when a patient's airway is secure by an airway device.</s><s>Patients will be identified using anaesthesia data obtained from Research Patient Data Registry and Anesthesia Information Management System.</s></p><p><s>The study methods are outlined in three sections to address the three primary objectives.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective 1: Development of prediction model for OSA Prediction model reference standard</head><p><s>The reference standard for the prediction model will be defined as patients with an ICD-9 OSA diagnosis following the appearance of a polysomnography procedural (CPT, Current Procedural Terminology) code in our medical databases (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>From this specific sequence of events, we infer that these patients had their clinically suspected OSA diagnosis confirmed by polysomnography.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validation of reference standard for the diagnosis of OSA</head><p><s>Prior to the development of the prediction model, we will conduct a medical chart review of 100 randomly selected patients in order to determine whether or not such patients actually have evidence of OSA in the time between their polysomnography and surgery.</s><s>This cohort of patients will consist of 50 cases of OSA, according to our criteria of ICD 9 diagnostic code and polysomnography CPT code, and 50 cases without OSA.</s><s>A blinded chart review will be performed on this mixed group of 100 cases.</s><s>Confirmatory evidence of OSA would include a reported AHI ≥5 as documented in a patient's medical chart, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> or treatment with continuous positive airway pressure.</s><s>The predictive model will be performed if the ICD-9 and CPT code combination has an acceptable positive predictive value (≥0.8).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictor variables</head><p><s>A number of variables have been found to be associated with an increased prevalence of OSA and are currently used for different screening tools for OSA in surgical patients. <ref type="bibr">62 65 67</ref></s><s>From the Anesthesia Information Management System and Research Patient Data Registry databases, we will obtain and include the following data in our prediction score: age, BMI, gender and the ASA physical status classification (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We will incorporate medical comorbidities using ICD-9 diagnostic codes, some of which are defined by the Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68</ref></s><s>All covariates included in the prediction model must be present within 1 year of surgery date.</s><s>In addition, as a departure from current literature on developing OSA screening scores, we will consider oxygen desaturation immediately after extubation as a predictor.</s><s>This strategy will most likely increase the predictive value of our score-patients with OSA are very vulnerable to desaturation after surgery, and we have the unique opportunity to use this characteristic of OSA desaturation after anaesthesia that has not yet been used in existing prediction scores.</s><s>Postextubation oxygen desaturation will be defined as an oxyhaemoglobin reading &lt;90%, and &lt;80% for at least 1 min, as measured by pulse oximetry during the first 10 min after extubation in the operating room.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of prediction model</head><p><s>We will use an unconditional logistic regression model with an automated forward selection procedure to select for predictors of our a priori defined reference standard.</s><s>To determine the goodness-of-fit of the final prediction model, we will use the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which indicates that there is no significant difference between observed and expected OSA status if p value ≥0.05.</s><s>A point value will be assigned to each predictor variable proportional to the estimates from the logistic regression.</s><s>The predictive value of the score for OSA will be assessed using c-statistics, which is equivalent to the area under the ROC curve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69</ref></s><s>We will aim to achieve a minimum c-statistic of 0.8.</s><s>In addition, we will evaluate if the addition of a variable that can be obtained by anaesthesiologists at the end of the surgical case, for example, postextubation desaturation, improves the predictive ability of the score.</s><s>For this purpose, we will use risk reclassification analysis to compare the clinical impact of these two models. <ref type="bibr">70 71</ref></s><s>The net reclassification improvement will be generated by balancing the proportion of subjects whose risk was more accurately classified using the expanded prediction model with postextubation desaturation compared with the prediction model without postextubation desaturation against the proportion of participants whose risk was less accurately classified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70</ref></s><s>e will calculate positive and negative likelihood ratios for each stratum of the score.</s><s>We will use bootstrap techniques to determine the robustness of included variables, which are close to the p value cut-off of 0.05.</s><s>We will then use classification tables to determine the best cut-off value for the prediction score to classify patients at high risk for OSA.</s><s>We will also use cross-validation to evaluate any potential overfitting of our prediction model.</s></p><p><s>Objective 2: Effect of high OSA risk on postoperative respiratory complications Exposure variables Our primary exposure variable of interest is OSA risk, as defined by our prediction model developed in aim 1.</s><s>We will identify patients in our population as having a high, moderate and low risk for OSA using our prediction model, and produce three cohorts of patients, which we will follow for the occurrence of outcome events.</s></p></div>
