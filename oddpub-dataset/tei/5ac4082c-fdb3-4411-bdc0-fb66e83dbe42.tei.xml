<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KCNJ1 mutations</head><p><s>The following KCNJ1 mutations were identified: c.197T &gt; A, heterozygote, exon 2, codon 66, protein p.I66N (ATC &gt; AAC); Ile66Asn c.875G &gt; A, heterozygote, exon 2, codon 292, protein p.R292Q (CGG &gt; CAG); Arg292Gln Discussion aBS II is also called the neonatal variant of BS because it presents with severe symptoms in the neonatal period.</s><s>In this study, we identified a novel KCNJ1 missense mutation (p.I66N) in a compound heterozygote setting with a previously recognized pathogenic mutation (p.R292Q) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in an adult woman leading to an unusual mild clinical presentation of aBS II.</s><s>Based on the autosomal recessive pattern of aBS II, both missense mutations are expected to disrupt KCNJ1 gene function.</s><s>However, the KCNJ1 mutation p.I66N could represent a mutation causing only a mild phenotype.</s><s>Our experimental approach of NGS-based mutation screening combined with Sanger sequencing proved to be a reliable approach for molecular diagnosis in our patient with a clinical unclassified phenotype resembling a late-onset BS.</s><s>Two different in silico NGS software approaches were employed for mapping, base calling and variant detection.</s><s>Both approaches detected the two mutations.</s><s>These approaches included (i) Exomiser <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and (ii) customized SeqNext (JSI Medical Systems) approaches for data analyses.</s></p><p><s>Our findings confirm a recent observation that aBS II can present as late-onset disease in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, this case and our case presented with nephrocalcinosis as incidental presentation of BS.</s><s>Although different KCNJ1 mutations were found, both patients exhibited unusual mild clinical manifestations of aBS II, i.e. hypokalaemia, modest or tendency towards metabolic alkalosis, mild hypercalciuria and modest aBS II | 597 hyperreninaemic hyperaldosteronism due to renal salt wasting.</s><s>Therefore, oral potassium replacement (80 mmol/day) was sufficient for improvement of serum potassium levels to near normal values.</s><s>Both patients maintained normal serum Mg 2þ levels, which is consistent with previous observations demonstrating that Bartter's patients with hypomagnesaemia rarely reach the levels seen in patients with Gitelman syndrome (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Upregulation of NCCT via aldosterone may contribute to the increase in expression of TRPM6 Mg 2þ channels in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and be protective against hypomagnesaemia in BS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Although patients with salt-losing nephropathy have an increased salt intake (salt craving) while they consume their normal ad-lib diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, oral salt supplementation has no or little effects on potassium homeostasis in adult BS.</s><s>Klaus et al. examined a 20year old female with BS (although not genetically tested) and found that neither low-salt diet (30 mval or 10 mval Na þ ) nor salt-rich diet (240 mval Na þ /day) over 5 days improved hypokalaemia and potassium excretion in the urine.</s><s>These manoeuvres also did not affect plasma renin levels, indicating insignificant effects on volume regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is noteworthy that the addition of potassium-sparing diuretics or an aldosterone antagonist may improve hypokalaemia in lateonset aBS II <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our patient initially presented with hypercalciuric nephrocalcinosis associated with chronic renal impairment.</s><s>BS patients commonly develop nephrocalcinosis.</s><s>This is presumed to be due to their hypercalciuria, however the mechanisms are poorly understood.</s><s>For example, nephrocalcinosis is less prevalent among Bartter's patients with CLCNKB and BSND mutations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>), who have less hypercalciuria <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that bone reabsorption from elevated PTH levels leads to increased urinary phosphate wasting, and that this accounts for the development of nephrocalcinosis, though this is poorly documented in patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with this possibility, Pattaragarn et al. found that suppression of PTH by a calcimimetic agent attenuated nephrocalcinosis in furosemidetreated young rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Since thyroid/parathyroid ultrasound examination, computed tomography neck/thorax scan, parathyroid scintigraphy, osteodensitometry, X-rays of hands and plasma calcium levels were unremarkable despite elevated plasma iPTH levels, there is no evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in our patient.</s><s>Instead, the slight increase of PTH can be explained by the reduction of eGFR (MDRD) (58 mL/min).</s><s>Another potential mechanism contributing to the occurrence of nephrocalcinosis might involve renal luminal pH; i.e. the increased acidification of the distal nephron due to increased epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity might protect from calcium phosphate crystal formation in the distal parts of the nephron <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Kleta and Bockenhauer propose that under no circumstances should treatment with thiazides be instituted for hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis since the additional blockade of salt reabsorption in DCT deprives the kidney of an important compensatory mechanism with potentially disastrous consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An additional feature of Bartter's patients is that they produce high levels of prostaglandin E2 by cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) in the macula densa, which can exacerbate renal salt wasting.</s><s>Cyclooxygenase inhibition by indometacin is widely used for therapy of BS in children.</s><s>The use of indometacin improves growth rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and early treatment in the neonatal period may decrease nephrocalcinosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, data about the long-term outcome of patients with BS with indometacin treatment are not available.</s><s>Instead, nephrotoxicity associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX2 inhibitors is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, which limits enthusiasm for long term treatment of Bartter's patients with a mild phenotype in adulthood.</s><s>Nevertheless, a tentative treatment with indomethacin at a low dose, with a careful monitoring of GFR, could be a therapeutic option in our patient in order to reduce (or even normalize) calcium excretion in urine, and thus to prevent progression of nephrocalcinosis.</s></p><p><s>Walsh et al. reported that the degree of hypokalaemia (as an index of chronic potassium depletion) does not correlate with GFR, and that on-going sodium and water losses, consequent secondary hyperaldosteronism, may play a more important role in the aetiology of chronic renal impairment in BS and possibly other hypokalaemic nephropathies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>This view is supported by renal histopathological findings in BS, which are initially normal except for hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and glomerular atrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, this contrasts with chronic kaliopenic nephropathy by laxative abuse, which is characterized by vacuolar changes in renal tubular epithelium accompanied by inflammatory interstitial changes in patients with potassium losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, Walsh et al. suggested that long-term blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor in BS with spironolactone or eplerenone (or perhaps even be direct renin inhibition) may be justified more for renal protection than for trying to correct hypokalaemia per se.</s><s>Similarly, angiotensinconverting-enzyme inhibitors may be justified for renal protection in Bartter's patients, unless they produce symptomatic orthostasis, hypotension or lethargy.</s></p><p><s>Our study suggests a high degree of variability of aBS II regarding severity of disease as shown in another report in adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Mutations in KCNJ1 should thus be considered even beyond the neonatal period in patients who present with nephrocalcinosis, hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis or symptoms of renal salt wasting (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>
