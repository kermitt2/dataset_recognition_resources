80 mL/kg) was equivalent to the total blood volume of an average 1-year-old child weighing approximately 10 kg.</s><s>The observed dramatic drop in PLT and fibrinogen level after surgery could have been caused by the massive hemorrhage.</s></p><p><s>ROTEM TM analysis was performed before and after surgery to evaluate the changes in overall coagulation status.</s><s>Prolonged CFT and a substantial drop in A10 and MCF in the EXTEM test at the end of surgery were attributed, in part, to decreased PLT and fibrinogen level from their respective baseline values in both groups.</s><s>Significant blood loss was treated with packed RBC and FFP transfusions in the control group, which could have contributed to the reduced PLT and fibrinogen level.</s><s>Consequently, no significant differences in the results of the ROTEM TM analysis were found between the two groups.</s><s>In the control group, FIBTEM A10 and MCF, which are indicative of clot strength and fibrinogen activity, significantly reduced compared to their respective baseline values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2I and 2J</ref>).</s><s>This might have been due to a dilution effect caused by the significantly large amount of FFP transfused during surgery.</s><s>Therefore, transfusing more concentrated fibrinogen supplements, such as cryoprecipitates, may be a better option when treating children with a smaller circulation volume.</s><s>Moreover, although it had been restricted to 20 mL/kg/day, the significantly large amount of colloid as a volume expander prior to transfusion in the case of acute and massive perioperative bleeding, may have affected the coagulation status and interfered with the ROTEM TM analysis.</s><s>Colloids enhance fibrinolysis by diminishing α 2 -antiplasmin-plasmin interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, thereby impeding fibrin formation and reducing fibrinogen-dependent clot strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>.</s><s>Although clinical data on the safe use of colloids in children are insufficient, some studies have shown that colloid infusions do not affect renal and coagulation systems in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</s><s>One noticeable benefit of TXA during surgery is the decreased incidence of postoperative respiratory-related complications.</s><s>Transfusion of packed RBC (&gt;
