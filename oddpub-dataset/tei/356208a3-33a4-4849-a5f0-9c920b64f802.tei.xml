<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Four species of Leishmania are known to cause cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Ethiopia: L. major, L. tropica, L. aethiopica and, in some cases, L. donovani, which mainly causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL) but, also, cutaneous lesions without patent signs and symptoms of visceral infection and, also, in some cases, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) as a cutaneous sequel, following the chemotherapeutic treatment of VL.</s><s>Of these four leishmanial species, only L. aethiopica is restricted to Africa and even there, as far as has been recorded, just to the highlands of Ethiopia and Kenya.</s><s>In Djibouti and Eritrea cases of CL have been reported, but the causative species has not been determined.</s><s>This restricted distribution is, probably, owing to the restricted geographical range of the sand fly vector species Phlebotomus longipes and P. pedifer that transmit L. aethiopica among their animal reservoirs and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>A strain of L. aethiopica, which proved to be the type strain of a new zymodeme of the species, was isolated from a female sand fly of the species P. sergenti caught in Awash Valley, north-eastern Ethiopia, in the 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Alvar et al. have also listed P. sergenti as a vector of L. aethiopica together with P. longipes and P. pedifer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>They have also listed P. pedifer and P. aculeatus (also named P. elgonensis in some articles) as the vectors of L. aethiopica in Kenya <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>However, some taxonomists working on sand flies maintain that the female sand flies of the species P. pedifer are morphologically indistinguishable from the non-vector P. aculeatus although they can be distinguished by isoenzyme analysis.</s><s>In Ethiopia, the animal reservoirs are hyraxes of the species Procavia capensis and Heterohyrax brucei <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>In Israel and Namibia, hyraxes of the species Procavia capensis have also been incriminated as reservoir hosts of L. tropica <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In Kenya, the giant pouch rat Cricetomys sp. has been suggested as serving as reservoir host of L. aethiopica in addition to hyraxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In Ethiopia, human cases of leishmaniasis caused by L. aethiopica occur as one of three possible clinical conditions: localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL); diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL); and, rarely, muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL).</s><s>In Kenya, only cases of LCL have been recorded <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>When strains of L. aethiopica were first isolated from human cases of LCL and DCL, they were considered to be strains of L. tropica.</s><s>However, owing to various criteria they were described and named a new species, L. aethiopica: the restricted geography of human cases and the association of some of the strains with DCL, a condition, at that time, only known from the New World; the specificity of the sand fly vectors; the animal reservoir hosts being hyraxes, which was unusual at that time; and the antigenic specificity of the strains shown by serotyping using indirect haemagglutination <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The antigenic specificity of strains of L. aethiopica was later corroborated by excreted factor (EF) serotyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Many of the Ethiopian and Kenyan strains of L. aethiopica collected over the past 30 to 40 years have been serotyped according to the type of EF they produced.</s><s>All those examined were of the EF sub-serotype B 1 , a sub-serotype that has, so far, been unique to the species L. aethiopica, separating its strains antigenically from those of all the other Old and New World species of Leishmania.</s><s>However, some phylogenetic studies based on targeting different cellular components of the parasites have indicated that L. aethiopica has a closer relationship to either L. tropica or L. major.</s><s>For example, several studies based on the electrophoretic mobilities of enzymes (MLEE) exposed a closer relationship between L. aethiopica and L. tropica on comparing the enzyme profiles of various leishmanial strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>However, other MLEE studies based on the mobility profiles of other enzymes exposed a closer relationship between strains of L. aethiopica and L. major with them forming a monophyletic group <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Sequencing of a 370 bp fragment of the coding region of the heat shock protein gene hsp20 supported a closer relationship between L. aethiopica and L. major <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>A further hint for the close relationship between L. aethiopica and L. tropica, although not statistically supported, is the disability to distinguish between these two species by RFLP of the hsp70 gene with the restriction enzyme HaeIII <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>A further enzyme, BsaHI is required to discriminate between these two species <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The need for the second restriction enzyme BsaHI was also the case in distinguishing between the species L. donovani and L. infantum, which both belong to the L. donovani species complex.</s><s>A study combining internal transcribed spacer 1-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (ITS1-RFLP), using ten different restriction enzymes together with DNA fingerprinting combined the analysed strains of L. aethiopica and L. major into a monophyletic group, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In reverse line blot hybridisation, two of three probes developed for L. tropica also gave positive signals for L. aethiopica, indicating genetic similarities in the DNA of strains of these two species <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>None of the other probes prepared for that study gave positive results using the DNA of any other leishmanial species.</s><s>Finally, a Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) of 552 polymorphic sites on a 4,677bp-long concatenated sequence spread over seven single copy DNA coding sequences located on six different chromosomes produced a monophyletic group consisting of strains of L. aethiopica and strains belonging to the L. tropica complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although the phylogenetic inter-relationship of the species L. aethiopica, L. tropica and L. major differs, depending on the methods used to differentiate strains, all the above methods and many others like ITS1-RFLP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and PCR approaches using species-specific primers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> clearly separate L. aethiopica from the other species.</s><s>Kebede et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> developed five microsatellite markers for typing and identifying strains of L. aethiopica, a battery considered too small to adequately determine precise genetic relationships among strains of Leishmania.</s></p><p><s>Multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) has been used successfully to reveal intra-species phylogenetic relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> but have not been applied to revealing inter-species relationships except for strains of L. infantum and L. donovani, the two species forming the L. donovani species complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Although single microsatellite markers can be amplified in several different species, there are always markers in a set that are species-specific and fail to get amplified in other species.</s><s>In the set of 12 microsatellite markers prepared previously to type strains of L. tropica <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, four (LIST7010, LIST7011, 4GTG, 27GTG) were originally developed for genotyping strains of L. major <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, four (LIST7027, LIST7033, LIST7039, LIST7040) for genotyping strains of L. donovani <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and four (GA1, GA2, GA6, GA9) for genotyping L. tropica <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Since the species L. aethiopica and L. tropica have been shown to display a high degree of genetic similarity, the 12 microsatellite markers that were used to genotype strains of L. tropica were applied in this study to genotype strains of L. aethiopica isolated from eight human cases of CL; and by using the same set of microsatellite markers on strains from both species, a phylogenetic analysis was enabled, based on comparing and combining the microsatellite profiles encompassed by the species L. aethiopica and L. tropica that attempted to determine their genetic inter-relationship.</s></p></div>
