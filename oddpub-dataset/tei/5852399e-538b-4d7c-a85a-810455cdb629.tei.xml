<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an effective treatment for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) .( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) While continuous stimulation is still the standard clinical procedure, its use is limited by side-effects and battery consumption, which results in periodic implanted pulse generator (IPG) exchanges that increase the risk of complications related to surgery.</s><s>These limitations have inspired a search for innovative stimulation protocols, like temporally irregular <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and adaptive closed-loop stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>The latter showed promising results with improved motor outcome, reduction in energy requirements when compared to continuous DBS <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, and reduced side effects such as dyskinesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>This was achieved by using beta band (13-30 Hz) oscillatory activity recorded from the DBS electrodes as a biomarker to trigger stimulation.</s><s>Local field potential (LFP) recordings from STN-DBS electrodes have previously revealed exaggerated beta band synchronization in PD patients that is reduced by levodopa and STN-DBS.</s><s>Furthermore, the relative DBS induced beta suppression correlates significantly with motor improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, beta activity is a putative biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation in PD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>However, due to technical constraints the reported results have been obtained using laboratory hardware connected to externalized DBS leads before IPG implantation.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of post-implantation LFP recordings from a fully implantable new generation IPG in PD patients ON and OFF DBS.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Eight patients with Parkinson's disease who underwent bilateral implantation of DBS electrodes in the STN were included in the study.</s><s>Further clinical details are given in the table.</s></p><p><s>Informed consent was obtained before inclusion in the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee in accordance with the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>The macroelectrode used was model 3389 (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).</s><s>Surgical details are described in <ref type="bibr">Kühn et al., 2005 (6)</ref>.</s><s>Contacts 0 and 3 were the lowermost and uppermost contacts, respectively.</s><s>Correct placement of the DBS electrodes was confirmed by intraoperative microelectrode recordings in all patients and post-operative MR or CT in 7/8 patients (except case 5).</s></p><p><s>All patients were studied 1-4 days after implantation of the new Activa PC+S (Medtronic) pulse generator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> that has previously been tested in non-human primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Recordings were performed after the patients underwent a 12 hour withdrawal from dopaminergic medication.</s><s>Dopamine agonist therapy was discontinued one week prior to the recording.</s><s>The sessions always started OFF DBS, followed by a 15 min break during which the stimulator was already switched ON before the ON DBS recording.</s><s>DBS was performed bilaterally with standardized monopolar stimulation on contact 1 at 140 Hz, pulse-width of 60 microseconds and a constant voltage of 2 V (except for case 1, who was stimulated at 1.8 V on the left and 2.6 V on the right) with simultaneous bipolar LFP recordings from adjacent contact pairs 0-2 to reduce stimulation-induced artefacts.</s><s>Stimulation amplitudes were selected as they achieved clinical responses whilst sparing the patients any uncomfortable side-effects.</s><s>LFPs were amplified (x2000), filtered at 1-100 Hz and recorded at a sampling Rate (SR) of 422 Hz (optimized SR for simultaneous DBS) onto the IPG.</s><s>During recordings, patients were seated comfortably in an armchair.</s><s>LFP recordings of one minute length were obtained in OFF and ON DBS conditions in the same session.</s></p><p><s>All data were downloaded to a personal computer for offline analysis using telemetry.</s><s>Short recording lengths were chosen to keep battery discharge related to telemetric data transfer minimal.</s><s>The sampled data traces were interpolated to 300 Hz, visually inspected for artefacts and saturation.</s><s>Remaining data were analyzed using custom MATLAB code.</s><s>All continuous rest recordings were divided into epochs of 3.4133 s (1024 samples) and transferred to the frequency domain using fast Fourier-transform-based methods.</s><s>Powerspectra were normalized to the percentage of total power over the 7-32 Hz, 38-45 Hz, 55-87 Hz and 73-95 Hz ranges for each contact-pair.</s><s>Relative rather than absolute power was analyzed to allow comparison across subjects, as absolute power is more likely to be dependent on proximity to the LFP source and the local electrical properties of the surrounding tissue.</s><s>The 0-7 Hz, 46-54 Hz, 33-37 Hz and 68-72 Hz ranges, were omitted so as to avoid contamination by movement artefacts, mains noise and artefacts in the subharmonic range of 140 Hz DBS, respectively.</s><s>Spectral power below 7 Hz was omitted from the analysis, because the combination of a 422 Hz sampling rate and 140 Hz stimulation frequency can lead to folded artefacts in the low-frequency range (2-6 Hz).</s><s>Recordings from one contact-pair (case 1, right electrode) were contaminated by cardiac pulse artefacts and excluded from further analysis, leaving a total of 15 contact-pairs in 8 patients.</s><s>All individual OFF DBS power spectra were visually inspected for peaks in the beta range (13-30 Hz).</s><s>To visualize the beta peaks across patients, an average of all spectra realigned to the individual peak frequency (range -5 Hz to +10 Hz) was plotted (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Power spectra were averaged across alpha (7-12 Hz) and beta frequency bands (13-30 Hz).</s><s>Data were not normally distributed (Kolmogorov Smirnov test), so that band averages OFF DBS were compared to ON-DBS using the non-parametric Wilcoxon's signed rank tests.</s><s>Results are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).</s><s>Multiple comparisons were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The stimulators' sensing function allowed recording of local field potential activity ON and OFF DBS without the need for external recording equipment.</s><s>An example of raw LFP data traces is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> with the corresponding power-spectra demonstrating a distinct beta peak that is reduced during stimulation (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Comparison of the group average relative power revealed a frequency band-specific reduction in the beta band (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C-E</ref>).</s><s>Averaged beta band power was reduced by 14 ± 5% (p=0.002;</s><s>median: 17%, range: −41% -−0.42%) from 0.59 ± 0.04% (median: 0.54%, range:0.34%</s><s>-0.85%) OFF DBS to 0.51 ± 0.03% ON-DBS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>; median: 0.53%, range: 0.29% -0.81%).</s><s>No change was found for the alpha band (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>There was no discrete peak in the beta band in the group average illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>.</s><s>Additional analysis using only those contact pairs with beta peaks (12/15) demonstrated a stronger relative reduction in beta activity during DBS (18 ± 4%, median: −16%, range: −41% -−3%, p&lt;0.001 Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>However, again there was no discrete peak in the subgroup (n=12) average.</s><s>Accordingly, we tested whether the lack of a discrete peak in group average data was due to jitter in the frequency of beta band peaks in individual spectra.</s><s>To this end we aligned the individual peaks (n=12) in relative power before averaging.</s><s>This recovered a discrete peak in the group average data.</s><s>Moreover, this revealed a significant difference between ON and OFF DBS over the frequency range from − 1.4 Hz to +5.8 Hz surrounding the re-aligned and averaged peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here we demonstrate for the first time recordings of human deep brain activity from a technically advanced implanted pulse generator with recording capabilities and that is suitable for chronic DBS in PD patients.</s><s>Discrete peaks in beta activity could be recorded from the subthalamic area from 12 (80%) out of 15 electrodes when patients were OFF medication.</s><s>This incidence is arguably slightly lower than generally seen <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, and may relate to the recording from a single fixed dipole (contact 02) or post-operative stun effects.(</s><s><ref type="formula">6</ref>) However, it should also be noted that the implantable device used has an amplification of x2 000, compared to the ×9 000 -×50 000 utilized when recording with external amplifying systems.</s><s>It is therefore possible that the signal-to-noise ratio of the implantable device may be less, although this also depends on the bits of the converter, noise floor and other system characteristics.</s><s>Therefore, future generations of sensing enabled IPGs should be engineered with low noise floor and high amplification to allow constant and reliable monitoring of oscillatory synchronisation phenomena that are low in amplitude.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, the implanted pulse generator was able to identify significant suppression of beta band activity during DBS, in line with previous reports (5).</s><s>However, although there is some evidence that beta oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus remain stable over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>, further studies are required to confirm the stability in frequency and amplitude to ensure long-term effectivity of adaptive stimulation.</s><s>In this regard, previous studies have used fixed thresholding criteria that would need repeated reassessment related to long term beta amplitude fluctuations.</s><s>Therefore, adaptive thresholds or more flexible and sophisticated classifiers based on multiple LFP features may be advantageous to secure long-term benefit in the use of adaptive stimulation.</s><s>In conclusion, this study affords further evidence for beta band activity being a useful state biomarker in PD patients and demonstrates that beta can be followed with implantable systems; this paves the way for trials of chronic adaptive DBS of this target.</s><s>Examples of raw data traces (A) and corresponding power spectra (B) showing a broad 13 -20 Hz peak that is suppressed by deep brain stimulation in case 5. Averaged normalized power spectra (C, colored shaded areas display the 95 % confidence intervals) show a significant reduction of 14 % in beta band activity (D, p = 0.002), but no modulation of alpha band activity (E, p = 0.3).</s><s>Averaged frequency bands are highlighted as light and dark grey shaded areas for alpha and beta frequency bands in figures 1B, C, respectively.</s><s>A stronger effect was found when only contact pairs with distinct beta (13-30Hz) peaks were included in the analysis (F, 18 % beta band reduction, p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>Direct comparison of peak aligned, then averaged spectra (G, 0 Hz on the x-axis is the individual peak for each contact pair, mean frequency of peak before alignment 17 Hz ± 0.8 Hz) revealed a significant band from − 1.4 to +5.8 Hz surrounding the peaks (shown as gray shaded area; FDR corrected for multiple comparisons; significant threshold p ≤ 0.03).</s></p></div>
