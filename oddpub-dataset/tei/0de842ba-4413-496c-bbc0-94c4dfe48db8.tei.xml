<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Dyslipidemia, including hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, represents a hallmark of the metabolic syndrome and triggers a host of obesity-associated comorbidities.</s><s>Liver and adipose tissues orchestrate systemic lipid homeostasis, and reciprocal dysfunction in these organs propels a vicious cycle of metabolic derangements.</s><s>Hepatic steatosis is a key pathogenic factor in hepatic insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and perturbed cholesterol handling accelerates atherosclerosis, thus positioning dyslipidemia at the interface of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD).</s></p><p><s>Inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis via statins provides clinically relevant reductions in circulating cholesterol and proportionally lowers CHD risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Nicholls et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, a considerable number of patients still fail to meet target reductions in cholesterol, and a significant limitation of statin therapy is its near exclusive focus on cholesterol lowering with no benefit to glycemic control or body weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Diamond and Ravnskov, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, a pharmacological agent that lowers cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, hepatic fat, and body weight would offer a transformative advancement for treatment of the metabolic syndrome that should decrease mortality risk from cardiovascular events.</s></p><p><s>Thyroid hormones powerfully influence systemic metabolism through multiple pathways, with profound effects on energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and cholesterol metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mullur et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, adverse side effects of thyroid hormone treatment include increased heart rate, cardiac hypertrophy, muscle wasting, and reduced bone density <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ochs et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Discovery of thyromimetics capable of separating lipid metabolism benefits from adverse cardiovascular effects has remained a desire.</s><s>This guided attempts to rationally design small molecules with selective preference for thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRb) to treat dyslipidemia without inducing cardiac damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grover et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Second generation thyromimetics sought isoform specificity and tissue-specific function by derivatization with chemical moieties to promote tissue selectivity.</s><s>These liver-targeted thyromimetics initially showed promising pre-clinical effects on handling hepatic lipids and atherogenic lipoproteins.</s><s>No loss in body weight has been achieved as their mechanism of liver-targeting precludes lipolytic effects in adipose tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baxter and Webb, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, selective but broadened thyroid hormone action that includes liver and adipose depots, yet spares the cardiovascular system, could offer comprehensive metabolic benefit.</s></p><p><s>Glucagon also offers many benefits for metabolic diseases independent from its glycemic effects, including lowering lipids in circulation and in the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Habegger et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The benefits of glucagon action are not solely constrained to the liver as adipose tissue is a secondary target organ for glucagon action to promote lipolysis and energy expenditure through thermogenic mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Habegger et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>These coordinated actions demonstrate the validity of glucagon-based agonists as an antiobesity therapy, but only if the inherent diabetogenic liability can be properly controlled <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Habegger et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We have shown that the hyperglycemic propensity of unopposed glucagon action can be effectively counterbalanced by incorporating incretin peptide activity into a glucagon-based single peptide, including unimolecular mixed agonists with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Day et al., 2009)</ref> and/or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Finan et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Finan et al., , 2015))</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we envisioned that we could turbo-charge the livermediated lipid-lowering properties of glucagon, as well as the adipose-mediated thermogenic properties of glucagon, by introducing thyroid hormone activity into a single molecule, glucagon-based mixed agonist.</s><s>We envisioned that this approach could also unleash the therapeutic utility of thyroid hormone by selectively targeting its action profile to liver and adipose tissue with a glucagon shuttle.</s><s>Our vision gained momentum when we recently succeeded with an approach that allowed us to selectively, efficiently, and safely target estrogen action to the hypothalamus and pancreas using GLP-1 as a shuttle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Finan et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tiano et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Schwenk et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>We have expanded that technology to include other hormonal combinations.</s><s>Here, we report glucagon-mediated selective delivery of thyroid hormone to the liver results in coordinated actions that synergize to correct hyperlipidemia, reverse hepatic steatosis, and lower body weight through liver-and fat-specific mechanisms.</s><s>Importantly, the liver-directed thyroid hormone action overrides the diabetogenic liability of local glucagon action resulting in a net improvement of glycemic control, while glucagon-mediated delivery spares adverse action of thyroid hormone, notably on the cardiovascular system.</s><s>degradation and C-terminally extended by 11 residues as the peptide backbone to make conjugates of glucagon and T 3 <ref type="bibr">(Figure S1A)</ref>.</s><s>This 40-mer glucagon analog, herein referred to as just glucagon, has a comparable in vitro activity profile at GcgR as native glucagon (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S1B</ref>).</s><s>We constructed three different glucagon/thyroid hormone conjugates.</s><s>Two of these conjugates include the most bioactive form of thyroid hormone, 3,3 0 ,5-triiodothyronine (T 3 ).</s><s>In the first conjugate, herein referred to as ''glucagon/T 3 ,'' the T 3 moiety is covalently attached to the side chain amine of the C-terminal lysine through a gamma glutamic acid (gGlu) spacer added to the carboxylate of T 3 <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1A and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glucagon/T 3 Synergistically Improves Hepatic Cholesterol and Lipid Handling</head><p><s>To determine whether glucagon-mediated delivery of T 3 can reverse dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in metabolically compromised mice, we administered the glucagon/T 3 conjugates, along with mono-agonist controls, to mice maintained on a highfat, high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD).</s><s>After chronic treatment, the amount of T 3 observed in the liver increased following treatment with glucagon/T 3 and matches that observed with T 3 mono-therapy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to quantify the amount of T 3 that accumulated in the liver after chronic treatment, thus it is confirmed that native T 3 is released from the conjugate.</s><s>Glucagon/T 3 lowered levels of total plasma cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner with an onset as early as 4 days of treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S3A</ref>).</s><s>At the highest dose and similar to T 3 , glucagon/T 3 reduced circulating levels of total cholesterol (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1C and S3A</ref>) and the fraction of cholesterol bound to both low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>Glucagon/T 3 reduced circulating levels of triglycerides to a similar extent as the glucagon analog (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Glucagon/T 3 lowered hepatic cholesterol content (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>) and hepatocellular vacuolation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>) compared to vehicle controls.</s><s>Plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S3D</ref>), urea nitrogen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S3E</ref>), and creatinine (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S3F</ref>) were unchanged.</s><s>Plasma levels of ketone bodies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S3G</ref>) and citrate synthase activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S3H</ref>) were elevated with glucagon/T 3 treatment.</s><s>These beneficial effects of glucagon/T 3 on dyslipidemia were similar to the effects observed after equimolar co-administration of glucagon and T 3 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C-1E</ref>, S4A, and S4B), demonstrating that both constituent actions are responsible for the combined effects on lipids of the conjugate.</s><s>The cholesterol lowering effect, which is mostly attributable to T 3 action, was not evident after treatment with glucagon/iT 3 or glucagon/rT 3 <ref type="bibr">(Figures S4A and S4B)</ref>.</s><s>This demonstrates that the specific form of thyroid hormone and its molecular orientation are vital for eliciting the coordinated hormonal actions.</s><s>The effect to lower plasma cholesterol is greater than the effect observed with equimolar treatment of two thyromimetics (GC-1 and KB-2115) selective for TRb whereas the effects on plasma triglycerides are comparable <ref type="bibr">(Figures S4C and S4D)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore exclusively used glucagon/T 3 as the conjugate for preclinical assessment of coordinated glucagon and T 3 action in vivo.</s></p><p><s>We analyzed the livers from these mice for genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">1H and S3I</ref>).</s><s>Glucagon/T 3 increased the expression of key genes involved in cholesterol metabolism and uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and triglyceride cycling.</s><s>Glucagon/T 3 also increased mRNA expression and plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21; Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H and 1I</ref>).</s><s>These changes in lipid metabolism gene programs reflect integrated hormonal actions that resulted in decreased levels of cholesterol and lipids in circulation and in the liver.</s></p><p><s>Glucagon/T 3 Improves Lipid Handling and Ameliorates Atherosclerosis in Ldlr À/À Mice To test in a murine model that more closely resembles human physiology of exaggerated dyslipidemia and to parse out cholesterol-lowering mechanisms, we used low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout mice (Ldlr À/À ).</s><s>Both the hepatic accumulation of T 3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J</ref>) and lowered plasma cholesterol following glucagon/T 3 treatment was confirmed in Ldlr À/À mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1K</ref>).</s><s>The conjugate primarily lowered cholesterol stored in the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL fractions without influencing HDL levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1L</ref>).</s><s>Beyond the translational relevance, this finding indicates that complementary mechanisms independent of LDLR-mediated uptake contribute to the overall efficacy in cholesterol-lowering.</s></p><p><s>Because Ldlr À/À mice display atherosclerotic plaque development and aortic lesions similar to human pathophysiology, we explored whether glucagon/T 3 can reverse atherosclerotic plaque formation in Ldlr À/À mice.</s><s>In this restorative treatment paradigm, 2 weeks of treatment with glucagon/T 3 reduced atherosclerotic plaque size and lesion coverage at the aortic root compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1M and  1N</ref>).</s><s>Our results demonstrate that glucagon/T 3 improves lipid metabolism to an extent that leads to the regression of established atherosclerosis.</s></p></div>

to glucagon alters the pharmacokinetics of the parent molecules, we measured the plasma half-life of the administered compounds following a single bolus subcutaneous (s.c.) injection to lean rats.</s><s>The pharmacokinetic profile of glucagon/T 3 more closely resembles the profile of the glucagon analog as opposed to native T 3 (Figure <ref type="figure"

of glucagon/T 3 , we labeled glucagon/T 3 with the fluorescent probe on the peptide backbone.</s><s>The labeling of glucagon/T 3 (herein called glucagon*/T 3 ) did not influence in vitro GcgR activity (glucagon/T 3 EC 50 = 0.050 nM and glucagon*/T 3 EC 50 = 0.058 nM), or serum halflife (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5B</ref>).</s><s>Plasma level of glucagon*/T 3 peaked within 3 hr and
