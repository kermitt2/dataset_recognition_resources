<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixture Inhalation Study</head><p><s>As PG is known to be widely used as an emulsifier, we tried to evaluate the toxicological effect of the mixture of SM+PG.</s><s>For this, rats were divided into five groups: control, vehicle control, low-, medium-, and high-exposure groups.</s><s>The actual concentration of SM in the chamber was measured as 3.91 ± 1.26, 35.73 ± 6.01, and 80.98 ± 5.47 mg/m 3 in the low-, medium-, and high-exposure groups, respectively, and the actual concentration of PG was measured as 5.5 ± 1.07 mg/m 3 (vehicle control), 6.47 ± 1.25 mg/m 3 (low), 8.68 ± 0.6 mg/m 3 (medium), and 8.84 ± 1.77 mg/m 3 (high) in each of the stated groups.</s><s>The MMADs were between 1.70 and 2.75 µm with a GSD from 1.69 to 2.08 in each chamber.</s><s>Clinical symptoms such as nasal sounds, sneezes, and eye irritations which were not observed in the SM single exposure study were observed in the rats exposed to the high SM+PG mixture.</s><s>The body weight of the high-dose group rats was significantly decreased compared to that of the control group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>The analyses of the blood and serum from the rats indicated that all results were within the normal ranges with no significant differences between the control and the exposure groups (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>To observe the toxicological effects on the rat lung caused by inhalation of SM+PG mixtures, the total numbers of BAL fluid and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) cells were counted.</s><s>The total number of cells in the medium-recovery group was increased significantly and there was an increase in the lowrecovery group without significant difference (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8A</ref>).</s><s>The number of PMNs was significantly increased in the medium and high groups (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8B,C</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the total protein (TP) and LDH levels of BAL fluid samples were measured; slight increases in the low-and medium-recovery groups were found (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>).</s><s>Various inflammation-related cytokines were measured and IL-1β and TNF-α were found to be increased in the low-dose recovery group, which suggested that SM may have caused prolonged inflammation in the rat lungs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Histopathological examinations of lung, liver, and nasal cavity were performed in the rats exposed to the mixture of SM and PG for the sub-acute toxicity study (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In the liver, multifocal mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in all treatment groups as well as in the non-treated control group.</s><s>In the lung, no specific abnormal findings were evident, although focal vascular mineralization in the vascular wall of arteries was often found in a few rats with no difference between the control and the mixture treatment groups in the incidence and severity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>).</s><s>In the nasal cavity, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium of the section level I was evident in one rat of the medium-dose group and all rats of the high-dose group, while the lesion was not observed in the non-treated control, vehicle, and the low-dose group.</s><s>The lesion was characterized by replacement of respiratory epithelium by squamous epithelium with complete loss of cilia.</s><s>This observation in the nasal cavity of mixture exposure group is clearly different from results of the SM single chemical inhalation study because any specific effects were not observed in SM only treated experiment.</s></p><p><s>In the 1 week recovery study, various background lesions were found in a few rat livers of the control and the mixture treatment groups, including multifocal mononuclear cell infiltration, focal bile ductule hyperplasia, and tension lipidosis (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12A,B</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, vascular mineralization in the arterial wall, focal foamy macrophage aggregation, and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in the lungs in the control and the mixture treatment groups without toxicological significance (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12C,D</ref>).</s><s>The squamous metaplasia, which occurred in the section level I of nasal cavity when exposed to the mixture at the medium and high dose for 2 weeks, was not evident 1 week after termination of the exposure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">13</ref>).</s></p></div>

(2013)</ref> insisted that the potentiation character of chemical was a specific phenomenon, rather than a general effect, and that the reason was related to the chemical structures of the mixture.</s><s>Although we found the potentiation of SM in the cell viability assay, only A549 cells were used, and only PG was mixed with SM in our study.</s><s>Therefore, future studies should include follow-up works designed to evaluate the potentiation of SM in various kinds of cells when mixed with other chemicals.</s></p><p><s>Both PMNs and macrophages have an important role in the first-line defense against xenobiotics, through phagocytosis and the recruitment of cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Djeu et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Di Carlo et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wesselkamper et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, we have revealed that the significant increase of PMNs in the high-dose group and medium-, high-recovery groups after exposure of SM and PG mixture.</s><s>In both medium-and highdose groups, the percent of PMNs was higher in the recovery groups than in the exposure groups, indicating the mixture of SM and PG could have persistent toxic effect in the lung.</s><s>In addition, whereas there was no symptom in the rats of the SM single exposure, clinical symptoms such as nasal sounds, sneezes, and eye irritations were observed in the rats of the high SM+PG mixture exposure group.</s><s>According to the histopathological results, SM alone was found not to give any toxic effects to the liver, lung, and nasal cavity; however, the mixture of SM and PG induced squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium in the section level I of the nasal cavity, indicating the potentiating effect of PG in the SM toxicity in nasal cavity.</s><s>The lesion, characterized by replacement of respiratory epithelium by squamous epithelium, is considered to be an adaptive change following repeated or prolonged insult.</s><s>However, the lesion was completely recovered by 1 week discontinuation of the exposure to the mixture of SM and PG, indicating it was a reversible change depending on the exposure.</s><s>The differences in toxicity between SM alone and SM+PG mixture could be explained by the distribution of aerosol particle, as the count of large-sized aerosol particles increased when the concentration of SM+PG increased.</s><s>In detail, the increased number of particles with the size of 1 µm and over was predominantly observed in the SM+PG exposed chamber compared to the SM single chemical exposed chamber, suggesting that aggregation of chemicals possibly be occurred in the generated aerosols.</s><s>As the size increases, the particles could deposit easily in the nasal cavity of rats, resulting in such histopathological alterations in the high-dose mixture groups compared to the SM single exposed rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Shang et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Other lesions observed in the liver, lung, and nasal cavity in the termination and recovery studies were not related to the exposure of SM and PG mixture, because they occurred not only in the treatment groups but also in the non-treated or vehicle control groups without significant difference in their incidence and severity.</s></p><p><s>People are generally exposed to the mixture of chemicals rather than single chemical in their daily lives.</s><s>However, we could not easily assume the toxicity of mixture because chemical interactions could occur through various ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Deneer, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jarvis et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Many researchers have insisted that the effects caused by a single chemical may differ when they are mixed with other chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fortoul et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kortenkamp, 2014)</ref>, also evidenced in our present study.</s><s>Our study revealed a difference in the toxic effects between the single chemical and the mixture of chemicals, although it has some limitations owing to the few endpoints of cytotoxicity and the short exposure periods of inhalation.</s><s>Future studies should therefore include follow-up of various in vitro tests and longer-term inhalation studies.</s></p><p><s>In summary, it was found in the present study that PG potentiated the toxicity of SM in human lung epithelial cells, also observed in the 2-week inhalation study in rats.</s><s>Therefore, the present study clearly showed the potentiation of SM toxicity through addition of PG both in in vitro and in vivo systems.</s></p></div>
