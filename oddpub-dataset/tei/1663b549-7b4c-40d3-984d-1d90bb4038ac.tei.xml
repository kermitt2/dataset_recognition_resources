<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Vitro Results</head><p><s>Live/dead staining demonstrated that after 3 hours of incubating the hASCs in Bulkamid, the hASCs were mostly alive.</s><s>However, there were also some dead cells in the mixture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>The hASC phenotype was assessed at passage 7 using flow cytometry.</s><s>The hASCs expressed surface markers CD73 (99.9%),</s><s>CD90 (99.9%), and CD105 (99.6%).</s><s>Expression of CD14 (1.4%), CD45RO (0.6%), and HLA-DR (0.3%) was very low, and expression of CD19 (6.0%), CD34 (8.1%), and CD54 (8.5%) was low.</s><s>This confirms the mesenchymal origin of the hASCs.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anorectal Manometry Results</head><p><s>First, the four groups were compared based on the ARM results before injury and at 2 and 4 weeks.</s><s>The measured variables were the median resting pressure and the peak pressure during spontaneous contraction of the anal sphincter complex.</s><s>The median resting and the peak contraction pressures were higher in the hASC treatment groups at 2 and at 4 weeks (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Further analysis showed that the trend of the contraction pressure was significantly higher in the both hASC-groups compared with the saline and Bulkamid control groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>The difference between the groups remained statistically significant when adjusted for baseline measurement.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histology</head><p><s>In the histological analysis, no hASCs were recognized in the preparations neither at 2 nor 4 weeks according the Vimentin, STEM121, or Perls Prussian blue staining.</s><s>This was confirmed with CD68 staining of rat macrophages.</s><s>Rat endogenous macrophages containing iron stained positively with Perls Prussian blue and rat specific CD68 immunoperoxidase reaction located into the same cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Vimentin and STEM121 were positive in a cytoblock section prepared from the same cells that were injected into the rats (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>There was no statistical difference in sphincter muscle continuity, fibrosis, or collagen formation between the four groups.</s><s>The Bulkamid-hydrogel was well integrated in the tissue with minor foreign body reaction according to the HE staining.</s><s>There was more inflammation in the hASC-groups, especially in the 0.9% NaCl 1hASC-group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, Supporting Information Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>mCT Analysis</head><p><s>The mCT image datasets were used to confirm independently the continuity of the sphincter muscle shown in the histology.</s><s>By viewing the image data in multiple orthogonal views, greater confidence could be attested to the histological assessment.</s><s>(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, Supporting Information video).</s><s>There was total agreement between histology and lCT interpretation in 76% of the samples.</s><s>There was minor disagreement in 11 samples and serious disagreement in muscle continuity in 3 samples (5%).</s><s>This did not affect the statistical difference between the groups.</s><s>Thus, the ability to conduct nondestructive histomorphometric analysis on samples provides valuable image data that can be used to perform robust 3D analyses when necessary.</s><s>In some samples with Bulkamid, small regions with high x-ray attenuation regions were observed that could indicate cells or remains of PMP-50 particles (data not shown).</s><s>However, it was not possible to confirm whether these regions indicate the presence of PMP-50 particles or whether they were the result of local aggregation of iodine.</s><s>As iron specific staining of the histological samples failed to detect PMP-50 in any of the samples, the presence of PMP-50 particles could not be confirmed.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>ASCs combined with either saline or synthetic nondegradable hydrogel is a novel and attractive, mini-invasive treatment method for acute anal sphincter rupture and AI.</s><s>Due to low inflammatory response and good tissue integration, Bulkamid hydrogel appears to be a suitable injection agent and carrier for the ASCs.</s><s>The technique of anal sphincter injection therapy is simple in an animal setting and the use of human ASCs in rat AI model is feasible.</s><s>The 3D lCT is a valuable addition to the traditional histology in analyzing soft tissue samples.</s><s>Further studies with suitable chronic injury animal models with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm the functional restoration and to develop a truly effective treatment method for AI patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 2.
