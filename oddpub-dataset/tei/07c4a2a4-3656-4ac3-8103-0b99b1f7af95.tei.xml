<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>Indeed, equimolar infusions of GnRH result in greater serum LH amplitude when compared to kisspeptin, implying that some pituitary GnRH receptors may not be directly contiguous with GnRH nerve terminals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>ta from previous studies have suggested that the observed rates of OHSS following different triggers may not be entirely explained by their relative durations of stimulation and could additionally be due to direct ovarian actions.</s><s>In this context, hCG has been shown to directly increase VEGF expression and raise VEGF levels in human granulosa cells to increase the risk of OHSS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> whereas GnRHa may act directly on ovarian GnRH receptors to induce luteolysis to reduce the risk of OHSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>Furthermore, the kisspeptin receptor has been hypothesised to play a key role in the pathogenesis of OHSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>Exogenous kisspeptin administration has been reported to reduce VEGF levels via a direct action on ovarian kisspeptin receptors to mitigate the risk of OHSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>This is in keeping with a recent clinical study comparing one or two doses of kisspeptin to trigger oocyte maturation, whereby a second dose of kisspeptin significantly increased the duration of the LH-surge by 4-10 hours in a cohort at high risk of OHSS, but did not result in increased ovarian volume or frequency of OHSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>arian volume is dramatically enlarged following controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF treatment.</s><s>The normal range for ovarian volume outside the context of IVF treatment in premenopausal women aged 23-38 years is ~4-10 ml. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>Ovarian volumes have been reported to be 73.4 cm 3 at 5 days after oocyte retrieval following hCG trigger in the short IVF protocol (~9-fold prestimulation volumes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and ~22 cm 3 at 6 days after oocyte retrieval following a GnRHa trigger in women with normal ovarian reserve. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Oyesanya and colleagues observed that mean ovarian volumes just prior to hCG trigger were larger in women who later developed moderate to severe OHSS (271 ml) when compared to women who did not develop OHSS (157 ml). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>These data are consistent with the higher ovarian volumes observed in the present study as our cohort was selected based on follicle count to be at high risk of OHSS.</s></p><p><s>Due to the frequency of segmentation in patients treated with hCG (51%) or GnRHa (13%) as compared to kisspeptin triggering (3%),  it was not possible to reliably assess parameters of late OHSS.</s><s>Whilst processess for vitrification of embryos have improved significantly in recent years, segmentation has been associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>abling safe fresh embryo transfer through the avoidance of hCG trigger may facilitate a reduced "time to pregnancy," which is often favoured by patients.</s><s>Whilst the immediate welfare of otherwise healthy women undergoing fertility treatment is of paramount concern, OHSS occurrence may also increase the risk of late gestational complications such as prematurity and low birthweight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>Thus, there are a number of drivers to the use of safer triggers of oocyte maturation especially in the woman at high risk of OHSS.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F I G U R E 2</formula><p><s>Preventing premature ovulation during controlled ovarian stimulation prior to trigger using a GnRH agonist to downregulate the GnRH receptor (long IVF protocol) can be associated with a higher risk of OHSS than when this is achieved using a GnRH antagonist (short IVF protocol).</s><s>Therefore, clinicians are more likely to treat patients at higher risk of OHSS with a GnRH agonist trigger in the short IVF protocol rather than to use an hCG trigger in the long IVF protocol.</s><s>In patients triggered with hCG in the present study, 55% (22 of 40) had controlled ovarian stimulation using the long IVF protocol and 45% the short IVF protocol.</s><s>Nevertheless, rates of moderate to severe OHSS were similar to those triggered with hCG in the context of the long protocol (40.9%) as in the short protocol (33.3%).</s></p><p><s>Toftager and colleagues reported the frequency of OHSS symptoms at 5 days postoocyte retrieval using hCG trigger in the short IVF protocol in an unselected population to be: abdominal discomfort 67%, abdominal pain 44%, abdominal distension 31%, nausea 17%, vomiting 1% and shortness of breath 7%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Moreover, in the 11% of their patients with "irregular cycles" (implying the presence of polycystic ovarian syndrome), the rate of severe OHSS was increased almost 3-fold at 11.1% (vs 4.4% in those with regular cycles) after hCG triggering in the short protocol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>They observed that mean Mild OHSS-Patients with at least one symptom consistent with OHSS and maximal ovarian volume (either left or right ovary) of 65-903 ml (approximated to 5-12 cm diameter) were graded as mild OHSS.</s></p><p><s>Moderate OHSS-If patients met the above criteria for mild OHSS and additionally had at least 50 ml of total ascitic fluid in the pouch of Douglas, adnexae and abdomen, they were graded as moderate OHSS.</s></p><p><s>Severe OHSS-If patients met the above criteria for moderate OHSS, but additionally had at least 50 ml of fluid in the pleural space, they were graded as severe OHSS.</s></p><p><s>Rates of OHSS were compared by logistic regression: as no baseline variables were significant during univariate analyses, unadjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) are presented for hCG and GnRH agonist trigger as compared to kisspeptin trigger.</s><s>Mild to severe OHSS was compared to "no OHSS," whilst moderate-severe OHSS was compared to "normal to mild OHSS." a As no patient with kisspeptin was diagnosed with moderate OHSS, Laplace smoothing was applied.</s></p><p><s>ovarian volume is ~29% higher and symptoms of OHSS 1%-3% more frequent in patients triggered with hCG in the long protocol when compared to the short protocol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>However, greater differences in ovarian volume and frequency of OHSS symptoms between the trigger cohorts were observed in the present study than could be attributed to differences in the stimulation protocol alone (median ovarian volume was increased by 214% following hCG and 66% following GnRHa compared to kisspeptin; ≥1 symptom of OHSS was present in 82% following hCG; 43% following GnRHa; 20% following kisspeptin).</s><s>Additionally, the use of the long IVF protocol was statistically adjusted for when deriving odds ratios for parameters of OHSS.</s><s>Thus, the published data are consistent with the high rates of symptoms observed in the present study given that this population was at increased risk of OHSS (mean number of oocytes retrieved in this cohort was ~20 as compared to ~9 in the Toftager cohort). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>l patients in this study were treated and assessed at the same centre and no more than 9 different IVF physicians/ultrasonographers conducted ultrasounds over the 3-year study period.</s></p><p><s>Limitations of the study include that insufficient data on blood results were available to assess for haemoconcentration and thus rates of severe OHSS may be underestimated.</s><s>Indeed, patients in all three groups were at markedly increased risk of OHSS (median AFC ≥36 in all 3 groups) and the rate of severe OHSS encountered in the hCG group (15%) was consistent with the published literature for women with PCOS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>All patients in the kisspeptin group, 96% of the GnRHa group and 75% of the hCG group had an antral follicle count ≥23, conferring an ~4-fold increased risk of OHSS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>Remaining patients with antral follicle counts &lt;23 were included in the study (predominantly in the hCG group) if they had ≥23 follicles on the day of trigger (mean number of follicles on day of trigger was 35.9 in these patients suggesting that antral follicle count had been underestimated in these patients).</s><s>However, this could have led to an underestimate of the difference between the trigger groups.</s></p><p><s>There were some differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment groups in this retrospective cohort study (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>); however, sensitivity analyses suggest that these were unlikely to have significantly altered the findings of this study.</s><s>In 113 patients with at least 25 follicles ≥11 mm on day of trigger, mean ovarian volumes were (hCG 168.6, GnRHa 98.2, kisspeptin 66.9 ml), rates of mild to severe OHSS (hCG 87.5%, GnRHa 33.9%, kisspeptin 16%) and rates of moderate to severe OHSS were (hCG 37.5%, GnRHa 1.7%, kisspeptin 0%).</s><s>In 114 patients with at least 20 oocytes retrieved, mean ovarian volumes were (hCG 176 ml, GnRHa 90.7 ml, kisspeptin 60 ml), rates of mild to severe OHSS (hCG 90.5%, GnRHa 32%, kisspeptin 10%) and rates of moderate to severe OHSS were (hCG 28.6%, GnRHa 2.7%, kisspeptin 0%).</s><s>Whilst there was minor variation in the day of OHSS screening (≤0.6 days), 90% of assessments were conducted at 3-5 days following oocyte retrieval and results were similar in 138 patients screened for OHSS only on day 5 following oocyte retrieval (mean ovarian volume: hCG 173.2, GnRHa 73.6, kisspeptin 50.1 ml).</s><s>Although odds ratios were adjusted for relevant variables to account for differences in baseline characteristics, future prospective randomised clinical trials with objective grading of OHSS are required to confirm the results observed in this study.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we observe that the likelihood of clinical parameters of early OHSS was higher when triggering oocyte maturation with hCG than following GnRHa or kisspeptin.</s><s>These results suggest that triggering oocyte maturation by the induction of endogenous gonadotrophin release is preferable to the use of hCG in women at high risk of
