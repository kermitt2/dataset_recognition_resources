<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>In 2012, 3.3 million children were living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) worldwide, with more than 90 % in sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Regardless of HIV, sub-Saharan Africa is also the region of the world the most seriously affected by malnutrition, 21 % of children under 5 years are underweight, 39 % are stunted, and 9 % are wasted <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Malnutrition is the underlying cause of death among 35 % of children aged &lt;5 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref>, and could lead to irreversible damages such as cognitive impairment, chronic diseases and growth failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, malnutrition is a major problem for children and especially for HIV-infected children since it creates a vicious circle with HIV infection.</s><s>Indeed, on the one hand, malnutrition worsens HIV disease as it has similar effects on the immune system as HIV infection.</s><s>For example, among malnourished people, lymphoid tissues are damaged, and CD4 T-cell concentration is decreased <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Deficiencies in vitamins and minerals contribute to oxidative stress, which can accelerate immune cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> and increase HIV replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, HIV infection increases the risk of malnutrition, because of a high pro-inflammatory cytokine activity which can cause growth impairment among children <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>.</s><s>HIV-related opportunistic infections such as persistent diarrhoea or oral and oesophageal candidiasis have a negative impact on nutritional status among children <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>.</s><s>HIV infection can also indirectly affect the child's nutritional status, when it has an impact on the child's social environment.</s><s>In some contexts, when HIV concerns the most productive members of the family, the household economic capacities and the agricultural production are reduced, leading to a situation of food insecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, poor weaning practices among HIV-infected mothers can also have an impact on the child's nutritional status <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, malnutrition is a common complication among HIV-infected children.</s><s>Low weight-for-age has been reported in up to 50 % of untreated HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Among children with severe malnutrition, mortality risk is three times higher in HIV-infected children than in non-HIV-infected children <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, nutritional care is fully part of the paediatric HIV healthcare package.</s><s>The World Health Organisation recommends that an asymptomatic HIVinfected child should increase his energy requirements by 10 %, compared to a non-infected child; this is extended to 20 to 30 % during symptomatic HIV infection or episodes of opportunistic infections, and up to 50 to 100 % when a severe malnutrition episode occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>.</s><s>However, the burden of malnutrition remains difficult to quantify in HIV-infected people, most of all in children.</s><s>A better understanding of this problem and its associated factors is necessary to improve HIV paediatric healthcare, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.</s><s>Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study, to assess the prevalence and associated factors of acute and chronic malnutrition among HIV-infected children followed up in the HIV-care programmes in Central and West Africa funded by the Growing Up programme.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>The Growing Up programme is supported by two French NGOs: Sidaction and Initiative Développement, and supports 17 associations in 10 Central and West-African countries, taking care of HIV-infected children and their families through a comprehensive approach.</s><s>Twelve of the associations participated in the study, in seven African countries: Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Chad and Togo.</s><s>Nine of these associations are located in capital cities and three in other major cities, mainly in urban or peri-urban areas.</s><s>After HIV diagnosis, children received medical treatment (Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, treatment of acute opportunistic infections, antiretroviral therapy [ART] if eligible according to the 2010 WHO guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>, and nutritional support).</s><s>Children were followed-up at least every 2 months.</s></p><p><s>Nutritional support was usually provided to severely malnourished children identified according to the sites modalities, usually composed of, either an enriched flour or flour-sugar-oil mixture, or ready-to-use therapeutic foods such as Plumpy nut.</s><s>For every centre, nutritional support was mainly used for children under two years of age to assist the weaning period.</s><s>No specific nutritional protocol was defined for older children.</s><s>The nutritional assessment was not yet routinely implemented at the time of the survey.</s></p><p><s>Data from each centre were collected and entered into a database with the formal approval of each participating clinical site.</s><s>There were neither extra exams nor blood draws, nor extra data collection compared to the standard of care offered in each site.</s><s>This study has been conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association.</s><s>Parent's verbal consent was collected during the conduct of the study, and all data records analysed in the database were anonymized.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>A cross-sectional study was conducted between September and December 2011 among all HIV-infected children enrolled in 12 of the Growing Up Programme partnering associations.</s><s>Children included in the study were those with a confirmed HIV-infection (a positive serology for children older than 18 months, or a positive polymerase chain reaction [PCR] whatever the age), aged between 2 and 19 years old, ART-treated or not, with available data for gender, age, weight and height and HIV care at the time of the survey, and who had been seen at least once in the programme during the study period.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data management and variables</head><p><s>Data collection was standardised for each participating site, with a fact sheet.</s><s>Data were collected during the follow-up routine visits and extracted from the medical records to be further centralised in a global database.</s><s>Several types of data were collected: weight and height, measured during the survey visit according to the WHO recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>, age during the survey expressed in categorical form ( <ref type="bibr">[2-5[, [5-10[, and [10-19[ years)</ref>, the last CD4 count in cells/μL or in % less than 6 months before the study, clinical stage defined by the 2006 WHO guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>, orphan status, information on HIV treatment, type of ART regimen and its duration (more or less than 6 months) and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, and the type of the nutritional support (flour, powdered milk, solid or semi-solid foods, or Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food [RUTF]) received during the study period and during the last six months prior to the study period.</s><s>If a child had received at least one nutritional support before the study, we hypothesised that he had suffered from malnutrition and created a variable "malnutrition history".</s><s>CD4 was used in percentage for children &lt; 5 years and in cells/μL for children ≥ 5 years and we defined immunodeficiency for age according to the 2006 WHO definitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Severe immunodeficiency was defined by CD4% &lt; 15 or CD4/μL &lt; 350, and moderate immunodeficiency by CD4% = [15-25[, or CD4/ μL = [350-499[.</s></p><p><s>To define malnutrition, several anthropometric indicators are used according to WHO definitions: Height-for-Age, for children up to 19 years, Weight-for-Height for children &lt; 5 years and BMI-for-Age for children ≥ 5 years, and Weight-for-age, for children &lt; 10 years.</s><s>These indicators are standardised using Z-scores, which quantify how many Standard Deviations (SDs) child's weight and height is from the median value of a child of the same age and sex, in a reference population.</s><s>For this analysis, we used the 2006 WHO growth charts for children &lt;5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>, and the 2007 WHO growth charts for children ≥ 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Each indicator allows to define three types of malnutrition: wasting when Weight-for-Height Zscore (WHZ) or BMI-for-Age Z-score (BAZ) &lt; -2 SD, stunting when Height-for-Age Z-score (HAZ) &lt; -2 SD, and underweight when Weight-for-Age Z-score (WAZ) &lt; -2 SD.</s><s>A child is defined as moderately malnourished if the Zscore is between -3 and -2 SD, and severely malnourished if the Z-score &lt; -3 SD.</s><s>Z-scores were calculated using WHO Anthro Software (version 3.2.2,</s><s>January 2011) and WHO AnthroPlus.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we combined these indicators to define three categories of malnutrition: (1) acute malnutrition defined by WHZ or BAZ &lt; -2 SD and HAZ ≥ -2 SD; (2) chronic malnutrition defined by WHZ/BAZ ≥ -2 SD and HAZ &lt; -2 SD, and (3) mixed malnutrition as WHZ/ BAZ &lt; -2 SD and HAZ &lt; -2 SD.</s><s>WAZ was not used here.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Characteristics of the HIV-infected children included were first described by age group, then by the type of malnutrition (acute, chronic, and mixed malnutrition).</s></p><p><s>Comparisons were made using the Pearson χ2 test for qualitative variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for quantitative variables.</s><s>Prevalences of malnutrition according to the three anthropometric indicators were calculated with their 95 % confidence interval.</s><s>A multinomial regression model was fitted to study the associated factors to the three types of malnutrition.</s><s>All explanatory variables with P &lt; 0.25 in bivariate analyses were selected for multivariate analyses.</s><s>Potential explanatory variables included age group, gender, immunodeficiency for age, history and duration on ART, malnutrition history, orphan status, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and country.</s><s>Missing data were conserved in the analysis, creating a separate modality.</s><s>Because WHO clinical stage is determined by severe clinical manifestations including malnutrition status <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>, we chose to exclude this variable from multivariate analyses.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this cross-sectional study conducted in 2011 among 1350 HIV-infected children receiving paediatric care in 12 associations of the Growing up Programme in sub-Saharan Africa, we documented a high prevalence of 42 % of malnutrition, with acute, chronic and mixed  This study provides also a snapshot of the nutritional practices in field conditions.</s><s>Among the malnourished children in this study, more than half of the children didn't receive any nutritional support during the study or within the 6 months prior to the study.</s><s>Regarding associated factors, we report higher prevalence of malnutrition, whatever the type, among boys compared to girls.</s><s>Children between 2 and 5 years had more often chronic or mixed malnutrition compared to children between 5 and 10 years.</s><s>Furthermore, as a marker of HIV-disease progression, children with severe immunodeficiency or recently initiated on ART were more at risk for acute or mixed malnutrition.</s><s>Our findings show overall, a high rate of malnutrition in such a healthcare programme.</s><s>Comparisons with others studies are difficult because of the differences between study population and definitions of malnutrition.</s><s>Among children aged 2-5 years in our study, 45 % were stunted (chronic + mixed malnutrition) and 14 % were wasted (acute + mixed malnutrition).</s><s>Compared to a crosssectional survey conducted in Tanzania among ARTtreated HIV-infected children, we observe similar results for wasting but report higher proportions of stunting <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The prevalence of malnutrition, whatever the type, was higher than in our study for children initiating ART in Malawi, with more than half of children malnourished <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Among children between 2 and 5 years of age, we also report similar rates of malnutrition than those in the general population of children under five years in West and Central Africa (39 % and 12 % for stunting and wasting respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s>We observed that among HIVinfected children, chronic malnutrition was more frequent than other types.</s><s>Indeed, because of HIV disease, these children could have underlying problems of nutrition and repeated opportunistic infections.</s></p><p><s>In our study, children aged 5-10 years suffered less from chronic or mixed malnutrition than children aged 2-5 years.</s><s>We can hypothesise that the younger children were more advanced in the HIV-disease progression, and were enrolled in the programme precisely because they were more ill, causing malnutrition.</s></p><p><s>Boys were more likely to be malnourished than girls in our study.</s><s>A meta-analysis of 10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa has reported the same result among the general population of children less than five years <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In a study conducted in Tanzania among children born to HIV-infected mothers, boys were 28 %, 40 %, and 28 % more likely to be stunted, wasted, and underweight, respectively, compared to girls <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The reasons of this association between gender and malnutrition remain unclear and need further investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We also noticed that children severely immunodeficient were more likely to be malnourished than nonimmunodeficient children, supporting the fact that malnutrition and HIV infection are linked in a vicious circle.</s><s>Despite this association, we saw that overall half of the malnourished children presented no signs of immunodeficiency.</s><s>For these children, malnutrition could not be explained by HIV-infection, but rather by an insufficient nutritional support.</s><s>Moreover, only 30 % of malnourished children were classified at WHO clinical stage III or IV, whereas malnutrition is one of the definitions for stage III and IV for the WHO classification of HIVrelated diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>, suggesting that malnutrition is not well detected in routine.</s><s>We found also an association between recent ART initiation, marker of the HIV-disease progression and mixed malnutrition.</s><s>We advise caution in interpreting this result since we are unable to access which came first, malnutrition or ART initiation.</s><s>However, considering previous studies describing the benefits of ART on weight and height gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>), we hypothesise that these children were probably initiated on ART based on clinical criteria such as malnutrition.</s><s>Furthermore, we found that non-ART-treated children were more likely to present acute malnutrition compared to ART-treated children.</s></p><p><s>Similarly, as a marker of malnutrition, children who received a nutritional support six months prior the survey suffered more from chronic malnutrition than those who didn't received any nutritional support.</s><s>These children have probably been experiencing malnutrition problems for several months, perhaps several years, leading to chronic malnutrition, which is difficult to reverse.</s></p><p><s>In our study, orphan status was not associated with malnutrition, which is concordant with other results among HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>, although other results have reported otherwise <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In our context, we can explain our observation by the specific healthcare received by orphaned children in participating associations, reducing differences between orphans and non orphans.</s></p><p><s>We didn't find any association between cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and growth in our study, whereas other studies have reported positive effects of such prophylaxis on growth.</s><s>A study conducted with the Zambian CHAP trial in HIV-infected children, who had not yet received ART, reported that cotrimoxazole prophylaxis slowed decrease in weight and height <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study presents several limitations.</s><s>First, children included in this study had access to paediatric HIV healthcare, mostly in urban areas where the standard of care may be higher than that offered in rural areas, making results difficult to extrapolate to rural areas.</s><s>Second, we excluded the children &lt; 2 years, because too few respected the inclusion criteria.</s><s>However, this population is precisely known to be more vulnerable and having more malnutrition problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, since 50 % of HIV-infected children not initiated on ART die before their second birthday <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>, the sickest children could not have survived until the survey period, leading to a survivor bias.</s><s>So, the selection of the study population is not representative of a birth cohort of HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of malnutrition.</s><s>Third, there are possible measurement errors in weight and height; we limited this by using a standard measurement protocol for all centres, following the WHO recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>.</s><s>However, peripheral oedema, sign of severe malnutrition, was not collected, despite their effect on increasing artificially weight.</s><s>Furthermore, because of our definition of malnutrition (acute, chronic and mixed), 20 children with a low weight-for-age were not defined as malnourished and were misclassified in the analyses.</s><s>Finally, the cross-sectional study design didn't allow to establish a causal relationship between malnutrition and explanatory variables.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, the study included nearly all children enrolled in the 12 participating associations of the Growing up Programme representing as best as possible HIVinfected children enrolled in HIV care programmes in West and Central Africa.</s><s>Data collection was of high quality in this study context, with more than 97 % of anthropometric data available.</s><s>Most of all, very few studies have reported the nutritional practices in HIV-infected malnourished children, and although practices are not detailed in our study, it highlights this gap and the need to focus on these interventions in such children.</s><s>Finally, despite the possible biases that could have all underestimated the prevalence, we hypothesize that we provided a conservative estimate of the prevalence of malnutrition in a large sample size of Central and West African children, which can give us an idea of the picture of the burden of malnutrition among HIV-infected children in this region.</s></p><p><s>As a result, we report that anthropometric measurements are not enough routinely performed in the field conditions, and nutritional supplementation is not optimally used and monitored in this context.</s><s>Indeed, we have seen that close to half of malnourished children didn't receive any nutritional support, before as well as during the survey, whereas a substantial part of nonmalnourished children still had a nutritional support at the moment of the survey.</s><s>However, taking better into account data on growth in HIV-care programmes could be major to improve long-term paediatric HIV-care.</s></p></div>
