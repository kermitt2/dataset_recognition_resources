<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Two samples of children, both ranging in age from 6 years to 14 years, participated in this study.</s><s>The first sample consisted of 91 Tupinamba ´indigenous children.</s><s>Drawing sessions and interviews were conducted in 10 indigenous schools between 2013 and 2016.</s><s>Our initial contact with the Tupinamba ´took place in 2010.</s><s>Since then, we have obtained formal authorization from the indigenous leadership to ask children to draw pictures, conduct interviews with them, and observe their activities in schools and in their community.</s><s>The Tupinamba ´, who have had contact with European settlers since 1500, follow the modern practice of sending their children to schools taught in Portuguese, but the schools seek to maintain indigenous customs such as body art and circular dances.</s><s>The Tupinamba ´also go barefoot and, according to ancient custom, the entire community gives children names associated with animals and plants.</s><s>Economically, the Tupinamba ´continue to engage in collective cassava flour production and use plants for medicine.</s><s>The Tupinamba ´also spend long stretches of time simply observing nature, which is a practice that seems old.</s></p><p><s>The second sample consisted of 53 children in New York.</s><s>Drawings and interviews were conducted in 2016.</s><s>All but four attended a private Catholic school in the New York City Borough of Queens.</s><s>The school is located in a neighborhood known for its ethnic diversity.</s><s>Our study distinguished 30 different nationalities cited by children as their background.</s><s>Unlike research conducted with indigenous communities in which we visited 10 schools for almost 3 years, data collection among New York children was much narrower in terms of time and scope in the academic context of a postdoctoral stage.</s><s>Although the enormous differences between the samples is recognized, a first comparative approximation can be useful for the understanding of the cultural differences with respect to children's environmental perception of nature.</s></p><p><s>The two samples were similar in gender: 49.5% of the Tupinamba ´sample and 47.2% of the New York sample were girls (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Matching the samples by age became problematic.</s><s>In the course of the New York school interviews, a winter storm disrupted school schedules, and some children could not be interviewed to match the Tupinamba ´sample by age.</s><s>Therefore, four more children were interviewed in Manhattan and upstate New York to achieve a good balance between samples.</s></p><p><s>Despite these efforts, the Tupinamba ´sample was slightly younger than the New York sample.</s><s>The mean age of the Tupinamba ´sample was 8.55 (SD = 1.86) compared with 10.40 (SD = 2.47) for the New York sample.</s><s>For this reason and following previous studies with similar methodology, the samples were split into age group.</s><s>The first group comprised children between 6 and 9 years old, and the second group consisted of children aged between 11 and 14 years (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</s><s>As a consequence, any significant Tupinamba ´/New York differences can, theoretically, reflect sample differences in age.</s><s>The efforts to evaluate this possibility are reported in the Results section (beginning with the variable labeled "Liveliness").</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics statement</head><p><s>All children were allowed to participate in the survey both from their parents or guardians and from the school authority who formally granted this permission by signing an informed consent term.</s><s>For the study with the Tupinamba ´children, we obtained authorization from the Committee of Ethics in Research with Human Beings / Brazil-CAAE: 17984513.6.0000.5526.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p><s>As stated above, drawing sessions and interviews with Tupinamba ´children were carried out in the context of broad research on indigenous childhood.</s><s>The author and her team of five undergraduate students and a Master's student visited the participating schools from 2013 to 2016.</s><s>Compared with the children of New York, the Brazilian Tupinamba ´group answered to a much larger questionnaire about their knowledge of biodiversity and questions regarding their school and indigenous condition.</s><s>For the New York sample, the author and two academically advanced high school students held the drawing sessions in the school library.</s><s>All children drew in small groups that varied from 6 children to 18 children.</s><s>The additional four children living in Manhattan or upstate New York were asked to draw pictures individually by a faculty colleague.</s></p><p><s>No predetermined time limit was given for the children to draw.</s><s>The indigenous schools, due to their own dynamics, did not set strict timetables for the duration of research activities.</s><s>As the children finished their drawings, they were interviewed by one of the team members, usually made up of five people, which meant that the waiting time between drawing and interview was as short as possible.</s><s>Notably, each child's drawing time was different, which made it possible, with rare exceptions, to always have an available interviewer.</s><s>At the New York school, the only time available was while the class stayed in the library, which was 40 min.</s><s>In this way, these interviews were objective and punctual and conducted by a team of only two interviewers.</s><s>American children who were interviewed out of the school had no time restrictions.</s><s>Without the systematic recording of time, one can estimate, from empirical experience, that the time a child takes to draw the suggested theme is between 10 and 15 min, although enormous individual variations may exist.</s><s>This aspect should be observed in future investigations.</s><s>The variable of Drawn Elements was subjected to normality test (Kolmogorof-Smirnov) in the Tupinamba ´and New York groups separately (p = 0.00 and 0.02, respectively), indicating that the variable did not follow a regular distribution.</s><s>Therefore, nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U tests and chi-square tests) were performed to estimate statistical significance according to social group (Tupinamba ´vs.</s><s>New York), gender, and age group.</s></p><p><s>Every child was given a box and pencils with 12 colors and a sheet of 21 cm × 21 cm sheet of paper.</s><s>The children were asked to draw a picture of nature and of nature around them.</s><s>They were instructed to draw whatever they wanted and concentrate on their own drawings, regardless of the artwork of their friends and classmates.</s><s>The researchers emphasized that all children can draw, and nothing in the drawings or answers was right or wrong.</s></p><p><s>After the children finished their drawings, we interviewed all individuals using to the following script.</s><s>First, each child was asked his or her name, age, background, and whether the task is easy or difficult.</s><s>Then, the child was asked to tell us about his or her drawings.</s><s>The following five questions were asked to explore the children's feelings about nature: What's your feeling about nature?</s><s>What's the usefulness of nature?</s><s>What's good in nature?</s><s>What's bad in nature?</s><s>What should the relationship between humans and nature be like?</s><s>Finally, each child was asked if he or she had anything to add and if we could keep her or his drawing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analyses</head><p><s>Drawings were analyzed from quantitative and qualitative categories.</s><s>To assess the amount of detail in the drawings, the total number of each element (e.g., each animal, each human, the sky, the sun, and the rain) was counted.</s><s>These quantitative categories separately indicate the frequency of human, plant, animal, and celestial elements in the pictures.</s><s>Elements of the natural landscape (such as mountains and rivers) and those that refer to construction, roads, and artificial objects were also noted.</s><s>Together, these elements make up the total elements drawn by each child.</s><s>These quantitative categories were the same ones adopted in previous studies and reflect the totality and proportion of the elements drawn by each child <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Qualitative categories in the drawings indicate the amount of Liveliness and Animism.</s><s>Given that Liveliness struck us as possibly involving a degree of subjectivity, we assessed interrater reliability between independent three raters with respect to 20 randomly selected participants for these variables.</s><s>The raters knew the purpose of the study, but the drawings were analyzed with concealment of the country, age, or gender of the participants.</s><s>Liveness was coded as None, Some, or A Lot. Liveliness demonstrates whether the drawing evokes the perception that its elements are actively interconnected (not just put together) and suggest that something is happening in the picture.</s><s>Agreement among the three raters, indicated by Cohen's Kappa, was 0.767.</s><s>By contrast, Animism, scored as the presence of facial features in non-human and non-animal figures, gave little chance of subjective assessment.</s><s>The three raters were in complete agreement with respect to the coding of this variable.</s></p><p><s>Answers given by the children to the five questions described above were divided into categories.</s><s>These categories were not defined a priori and were organized from the answers given by the participants and will be discussed further during data analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The research activities were carried out in different periods.</s><s>The Tupinamba ´children participated in the research activities between the years of 2013 and 2016 when the 10 schools were visited at least twice each.</s><s>The group of children in New York participated in the research only in the year 2016.</s><s>In terms of methodological design this small temporal difference is not ideal but we believe that it is compensated by the high degree of interest that the comparison between the groups allowed us.</s></p><p><s>To assess age differences, the total sample was divided into younger children (ages 6-9) and older children (ages 10-14) following the trend observed in previous studies.</s><s>The division into these two age groups most evenly divided the total sample.</s><s>The older children drew more elements (mean = 14.62,</s><s>SD = 9.22 vs. mean = 11.24,</s><s>SD = 7.98).</s><s>In addition, girls drew more elements than boys (mean = 14.50, SD = 9.66 vs. mean = 11.18,</s><s>SD = 7.40).</s><s>Mann-Whitney Utests indicated that the age difference approached statistical significance (p &lt; 0.06) and the gender difference was significant (p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>However, the number of elements in the Tupinamba ´and New York drawings (mean = 13.13,</s><s>SD = 9.75 vs. mean = 12.21, SD = 6.58) did not significantly differ (p &lt; 0.88).</s><s>As previously indicated, the quantitative categories refer to the frequency of the following elements: people, plants, animals, celestial elements (e.g., sun and clouds), natural landscape (e.g., mountain and river), and human-built objects (e.g., houses and cars).</s><s>The first part of the interview consisted of a description of the elements present in the drawing by the participating child.</s><s>Each element was nominated by the child, which left very little room for ambiguity in its categorization.</s><s>Simultaneously, the Tupinamba ´drawings, considered a group, revealed a highly differentiated conception of the biotic world.</s><s>When talking about their drawings, the Tupinamba ´children cited a total of 30 different plant species compared with 12 cited by the New York children (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, the Tupinamba ´children referred to 43 different animal species compared with 22 described by the New York children.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Human presence</head><p><s>We were interested in the extent to which children saw themselves or people as integrated into nature, rather than perceiving nature as a separate entity.</s><s>Therefore, we counted the number of humans and human-built structures, such as buildings and roads, present in the nature drawings.</s><s>Mann-Whitney U tests did not reveal significant age differences (under 9 years and 9 years and above) with respect to the number of humans (mean = 0.42, SD = 1.01 vs. mean = 61, SD = 2.43, p &lt; 0.67) or human-built structures in the landscape (mean = 1.23,</s><s>SD = 1.59 vs. mean = 0.94, SD = 1.38, p &lt; 0.10).</s><s>Similarly, no significant gender differences were found for these variables (mean = 0.30, SD = 0.74 vs. mean = 0.70, SD = 2.4, p &lt; 0.74 for number of humans and mean = 1.14, SD = 1.05 vs. mean = 0.21, SD = 1.01, p &lt; 0.21 for human-built structures).</s><s>Humans were more frequently present in the drawings of the Tupinamba ´children than in the drawings of the New York children, but this difference was not statistically significant.</s><s>However, the Tupinamba ´children included more human-built structures (mean = 1.38,</s><s>SD = 1.53 vs. mean = 0.60, SD = 1.32, p &lt; 0.01) than the New York children.</s></p><p><s>To several New York children, nature was not just a land apart, but a land that humans have violated.</s><s>For example, in the drawing below (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">)</ref>, a 12-year-old New York boy divided the sheet into "before" and "after."</s><s>On the left, we see a person in nature on a sunny day and blue sky.</s><s>On the right, we see the effects of human intervention.</s><s>Under a black sky, the tree is dead and only a few flowers have survived.</s></p><p><s>By contrast, a vivid drawing by an 11-year-old Tupinamba ´boy shows people having fun and enjoying nature (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>One of the characters is surfing while the others are playing at a coconut tree.</s><s>To this Tupinamba ´child, nature is simply a good place in which to live.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liveliness</head><p><s>One major concern was the extent to which the children might perceive nature as a living presence.</s><s>Therefore, the drawings were evaluated in terms of their liveliness: "a lot," "some," or "none."</s><s>For example, the drawing below depicts "a lot" of liveness (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>A doe and fawn are snuggling, and a bird is carrying a worm.</s><s>There is also rain at the top.</s><s>Other drawings expressed just a little action, coded as "some" liveliness, or none at all.</s></p><p><s>The variable Liveness was significantly associated with age; the younger children's drawings were livelier, as assessed by the chi-square test (p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>No gender difference was found with this variable.</s></p><p><s>Chi-square test also indicated that the Tupinamba ´children expressed significantly more liveliness (p &lt; 0.01) than their New York counterparts.</s><s>Given that the younger children's drawings were significantly livelier, the Tupinamba ´/New York difference might have reflected the fact that the Tupinamba ´sample was younger.</s><s>To evaluate this possibility, we compared Tupinamba ´versus New York drawings separately for the younger (9 and under) and older (10 and older) children.</s><s>Chi-square tests indicated that Tupinamba ´/New York differences failed to reach statistical significance for the younger children but only approached significance for the older children (p &lt; 0.06).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animism</head><p><s>Young children sometimes draw faces in the sun, plants, or elements such as clouds.</s><s>Such drawings, which are widely considered to be examples of youthful animism, provided us with No significant difference in animism was found by gender, but animism was related to age: 74.4% of the children in the 9 and under age group versus 24.6% of those in the 10 and over age group drew a face in some non-human or non-animal being.</s><s>This difference was significant at the 0.05 level as indicated by the chi-square test.</s></p><p><s>Even more striking was the difference between the Tupinamba ´and New York samples.</s><s>Forty-one Tupinamba ´drawings (45.1% of the sample) but only two New York drawings (3.8% of the sample) contained animism (p &lt; 0.01, chi-square test).</s></p><p><s>Tupinamba ´/New York differences also were significant for each age group examined separately.</s><s>Among the younger children, 49% of the Tupinamba ´drawings contained animism, whereas only 7% of the New York children's drawings contained animism.</s><s>Among the older children, the Tupinamba ´/New York difference was 36% to 3%.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interview questions</head><p><s>As indicated earlier, the answers given to the five questions were grouped from the emerging content itself.</s><s>For the first question, What is your feeling about nature?, responses were grouped into five categories.</s><s>The first category refers to the answers that indicate good feelings such as happy, joy, beautiful, nice, good, wonderful, fun, peace, calm, nice place, and interesting and were organized around the label "Good feelings" (74.3%).</s><s>The second category was called "Bad feelings" and encompasses terms such as fear, pain, and danger (1.4%).</s><s>The third category indicates the answers that cited nature as a source of "Resources," such as humans, animals, plants, and wind (2.8%).</s><s>A fourth category nominated as "Ethical and Environmental concern" groups the answers that bring the idea of care, respect, and protection (12.5%).</s><s>Finally, the fifth category labeled as "Other" brings together the children who did not respond and also the answers that did not fit into the previous categories (9%).</s><s>Chi-square tests were performed, but no difference was considered significant between countries (p &lt; 0.74), gender (p &lt; 0.87), or age group (p &lt; 0.15).</s></p><p><s>For the second question, What is the usefulness of nature?, four categories of answers were discerned.</s><s>The first category, labeled "Resources and Ecosystem Services," refers to food, shelter, air, water, and other products extracted from nature for human and animal use (49.3%).</s><s>´.</s></p><p><s>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0203870.g004</s></p><p><s>The second category, designated as "Human well-being," refers to the use of nature to relax, calm, live, life, socialize, play, have fun, good feelings, and explore (25%).</s><s>It differs from the previous category by not indicating a specific natural resource to be exploited.</s><s>The third category, named "Environmental Problems," indicates nature as an object of human concern and care but also its own ability to mitigate the environmental problems generated by humans (6.9%).</s><s>The fourth category covers children who did not respond and answers that did not fit the options described above (18.8%).</s></p><p><s>The second interview questions revealed no significant differences between countries (p &lt; 0.07), gender (p &lt; 0.86), or age group (p &lt; 0.06), as indicated by the chi-square test.</s><s>Notably, a large portion of Tupinamba ´children (26.4%) did not answer or stated they "didn't know," suggesting that they did not understand the question.</s><s>In the sample of New York children, this number represented only 5.7% of respondents.</s></p><p><s>The third question, What is good in nature?, provided four categories of responses.</s><s>The first one was labeled "Animals, Plants, and Landscape Elements" and indicates the existence of these beings and natural environments without the mention of its usefulness for humans (49.3%).</s><s>The second category, called "Resources, Ecosystem Services, and Human Wellbeing," brings together responses that cite beings, environments, and natural resources that are expressly linked to human well-being (33.3%).</s><s>The third category brings together global answers like "Everything (9%)," and the fourth category includes children who did not respond to this question and the answers that could not be classified in the previous categories like "I don't know" (8.3%).</s><s>Here a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.00) between the Tupinamba ´and New York children was found in the overall distribution.</s><s>More specifically, most Tupinamba ´children referred to natural beings and environments as good (56%) without any mention of usefulness to humans, whereas the New Yorkers most frequently pointed to the human benefits of natural resources (47.2%).</s><s>The New York children were more utilitarian than their Tupinamba ´counterparts.</s></p><p><s>The fourth question, What is bad in nature?, suggested four categories of responses.</s><s>The first category brings together "Aggressive Animals, Poison, Dangerous Plants, and Natural Disasters" (44.4%).</s><s>A second category refers to human behaviors that damage nature (16%).</s><s>The third category consists of those who answered "Nothing" (29.2%), and the fourth category indicates the children who did not respond or whose answers did not fit into the previous categories like "I don't know" (10.4%).</s><s>For this question, significant differences were noted between countries (p &lt; 0.00), gender (p &lt; 0.02), and age group (p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>With respect to country, most Tupinamba ´children stated that they found nothing bad in nature, whereas most Americans indicated that animals, plants, and natural disasters were bad.</s><s>At the same time, 34% of American children said that what is bad in nature was the work of human beings, whereas that response was only given by 5.5% of the Tupinamba ´children.</s><s>Nature for New York children was a much more dangerous and destroyed place than that for Tupinamba ´children.</s><s>As mentioned with respect to the drawings, the New Yorkers, living in cities, imagined nature as an environment inhabited by menacing beings and people vulnerable to environmental disasters.</s><s>Tupinamba ´children, living in nature, displayed a more benign view than the New Yorkers.</s></p><p><s>For the last question, How do you think the relationship between people and nature should be?, responses were classified as "Anthropocentric" (privileges for humans) (1.4%), "Ecocentric" (proposing a balance between humans and nature; 40.3%), "Biocentric" (prevailing nature; 45.8%), and "Undefined/No answer" (12.5%).</s><s>The answers as nice or good were also classified as "Ecocentric" because they convey the idea that it should be good for both parties.</s><s>Only two children took a definite anthropocentric approach.</s><s>Here, differences were significant between the two countries (p &lt; 0.01) and age groups (p &lt; 0.05) but not between genders (p &lt; 0.85).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The quantitative analyses of elements in each drawing and the presentation of the results on biodiversity revealed that the landscape of the Tupinamba ´children is more diverse than that of the children of New York.</s><s>The greater specificity on the part of the Tupinamba ´children was too extensive to simply reflect the larger Tupinamba ´sample size.</s><s>This difference certainly relates to the quantity and quality of interactions between the children of the two different groups with nature.</s><s>Tupinamba ´children live in the natural environment and depend directly on their livelihood and grow much of their food, whereas New York children live in a large urban center where interactions with nature are scant and punctual, their families draw their sustenance from activities thatr are rarely linked to other living beings and acquire their food more or less processed in supermarkets.</s><s>Simultaneously, we can not fail to consider the characteristics of the biomes in which the participating children live.</s><s>Tupinamba ´children live in the Atlantic Forest biome with a high biodiversity level, whereas American children in New York live in the temperate deciduous forest with low biodiversity.</s></p><p><s>Numerous anthropological observations have suggested that indigenous societies regard nature as more alive compared with Western societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>When the sample's drawings were coded for Liveliness, the Tupinamba ´drawings were livelier, but the difference was not statistically significant among younger children, and it only approached significance among older children.</s><s>Our judgments for the Liveliness variable were possibly too global and imprecise.</s><s>Interrater reliability, while adequate, was not as high as we would have liked.</s><s>By contrast, coding for another indication of life and emotion-the presence of animism-was easy and without disagreement.</s><s>Animism, operationally defined as facial expressions in the sun, flowers, and other non-human and non-animal beings, appeared far more frequently among the Tupinamba ´drawings in both age groups than in the American drawings.</s></p><p><s>The magnitude of this difference was surprising.</s><s>We realized that New York children, as part of Western culture, are gradually socialized to give up animism.</s><s>They come to view nature in a more impersonal manner than their Tupinamba ´counterparts.</s><s>However, society has grown accustomed to seeing animism in young children's drawings, before the effects of socialization take hold.</s><s>We were unprepared for the nearly total absence of animism, even among our younger children, in our New York sample.</s><s>Further research is needed to ascertain if our finding is representative of a more prevalent trend in children's drawings, and if so, to determine the causes of it.</s></p><p><s>The extensive prevalence of animism in the Tupinamba ´drawings drawings was unsurprising.</s><s>True, scholars frequently described indigenous peoples as perceiving the entire world animalistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, we had questions in the back of our minds.</s><s>Was this description of animism really valid, or was it something of a stereotype?</s><s>Even if animism was prevalent in indigenous cultures when they were studied in the past, is it still pervasive in today's increasingly Westernized world?</s><s>If the Tupinamba ´are representative, the answer is "yes."</s><s>Animism appeared in drawings with considerable regularity.</s><s>It was even present among over a third of the older children.</s><s>The results for animism indicate that Tupinamba ´culture views all of nature as a living, feeling presence.</s></p><p><s>The drawings and speeches of the Tupinamba ´and New York children manifest the natural scene as it is perceived by them.</s><s>In particular, they are effective instruments used to assess children's environmental perception and evaluate their ecological knowledge.</s><s>However, results from research with different design methodologies do not yet allow consistent comparative analyses.</s></p><p><s>One aspect that caught the attention of New York children was a realistic tone in the face of the environmental problems caused by humanity.</s><s>Environmental problems such as industrial pollution, deforestation for urban occupation and logging for paper production were mentioned in the participants' responses to questions asked by a team of two interviewers.</s><s>This generation is already fully aware of the vulnerability of the natural environment they are receiving from previous generations; they know that it is a disfigured and distant nature whose resources are running out.</s><s>This worried maturity that can be found among American children goes hand in hand with the full awareness that this lack of nature does not do well for their own well-being and development.</s><s>Thus, the children know they need more nature in their daily lives.</s><s>Children in New York seem especially concerned about the pollution of the air they breathe than those in Tupinamba</s></p><p><s>´.</s><s>The Tupinamba ´children, in turn, are fully aware of the importance of nature to their survival and of their community and seem less stressed and worried about wide environmental problems.</s><s>Their concern is the quality of the water that is available in the rivers and streams of the indigenous territory.</s><s>Given that these children spend most of their time outdoors, the beings and processes of nature can influence a realistic view of the interaction between people and nature and promote their well-being.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>This research highlights differences among age groups in the way they perceive nature as well as how to express it through drawings and questionnaire responses.</s><s>Results support the theory that a young child has an initial affective approach to nature that is expanding as the cognitive dimension is integrated.</s><s>Thus, environmental education actions for children up to 9 years should seek strategies that are more sensitive and perceptive than those with a more cognitive and knowledge approach that should be used with older children.</s><s>Gender differences were not conclusive in the research and should be further evaluated in future studies.</s></p><p><s>The concept of biophilia continues to be an important theoretical reference for the study of the interaction between children and nature.</s><s>It is independent of being inborn or learned, and it can only be effective in a socio-cultural context that encourages it in everyday life.</s><s>Currently, children are spending an increasing amount of time indoors using electronic devices and are spending less time in outdoor environments in interaction with nature and its beings.</s><s>Humans need the natural world to become humans; by contrast, we are creating new generations that do not feel like they belong in nature and already present disturbances in their physical and mental health.</s><s>Through this research, the Tupinamba ´and New York children warn us that the interaction between people and nature is essential to address environmental problems and ensure healthy development and well-being.</s></p><p><s>As demonstrated in this research, the proximity to nature and its cultural references influence children's drawings.</s><s>Unfortunately, children living in a big city like New York do not bring liveness to nature in their drawings when we know the importance of nature for the development and well-being of all children.</s><s>This kind of result should be better explored by future investigations.</s><s>However, all children are aware of current environmental problems and are willing to participate in their solution.</s><s>This opportunity is one that we should not waste.</s><s>Engaging children in community decision making and environmental management is an effective way to make them greener and livelier.</s><s>study and the Foundation for Research Support in the State of Bahia/Fapesb, which financed part of the research project.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Brazil and scholarship payment for undergraduate students.</s><s>Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruzhttp://www.uesc.br</s><s>(CP) -scholarship payment for undergraduate students in Brazil.</s><s>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientı ´fico e Tecnolo ´gico -www.cnpq.br</s><s>-Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientı ´fico e Tecnolo ´gico (CP)scholarship payment for undergraduate and graduate students in Brazil.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
