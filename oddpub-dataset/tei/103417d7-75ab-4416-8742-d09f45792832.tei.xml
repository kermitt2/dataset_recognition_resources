<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions</head><p><s>The data of this study are based on the first RCT comparing BRIA psychotherapy sessions with a weak comparison group, BWA.</s><s>In order to guarantee treatment integrity, we took important steps during selection, training and supervision of therapists, as well as concerning the provision of therapy material for the therapists.</s><s>However, we did not assess integrity and therapy processes with measures of therapist and client verbal language and nonverbal behavior during therapy, and we did not collect data on client motivation at follow-up.</s><s>Therefore, it could not be investigated to which extent participation in BRIA sessions might have been related to an increase of the patients' motivation to change and readiness for subsequent psychotherapy.</s><s>Moreover, there are no data on the extent to which the therapists balanced interventions of MI and CBT during the specific BRIA sessions.</s><s>Consequently, it remains unclear which specific components of BRIA contributed to improve patients' active search for therapy and engagement in therapy, and which components were, in turn, more related to a decrease of psychological distress.</s></p><p><s>The moderator analyses of this study could not be adjusted for therapist allocation, because the BWA patients were not allocated to therapists.</s><s>Since BWA was a computerized intervention without therapists, it is rather unlikely that the moderator effect of readiness to change on treatment allocation is due to a therapist effect.</s><s>However, we cannot rule out that the findings might have been different with a more homogeneous or heterogeneous therapist team.</s><s>From a very strict perspective, one might even argue that the effect of the BRIA psychotherapy sessions might only be due to the fact that it was performed by therapists whereas BWA was a computerized intervention.</s><s>Indeed our data cannot reveal which ingredients of BRIA contribute to which extent to its therapy effect.</s><s>Moreover, until now, there is no validated therapist-delivered face-to-face intervention for this specific setting with which the BRIA psychotherapy sessions could have been compared.</s><s>Independent from the question why BRIA sessions are superior to BWA, the current moderator analyses identified an interesting interaction effect showing that patients who are less ready to change profit remarkably from a more intensive intervention including face-to-face contacts, MI and basic elements of CBT.</s><s>In patients with high readiness, however, the therapy outcomes of BRIA sessions and BWA do not differ from each other.</s></p><p><s>It has to be mentioned that the primary engagement outcomes, participation in or having contacted psychosocial mental health care options, were based on self-report data since we could not collect objective data because of professional discretion and data protection.</s><s>In order to ensure the validity of the outcome, the assessment of therapy engagement was done by means of a semi-structured interview including an interview booklet, training of evaluators, calibration sessions, blinding of evaluators and also measures to prevent response bias.</s><s>Furthermore, it can be assumed that there was no reason for patients to answer in terms of social desirability, because they did not receive any reward for answering in one specific direction.</s></p><p><s>Whereas the inclusion of patients with diverse mental disorders can be seen as an example for the feasibility of transdiagnostic psychotherapy programs, it is also related to methodological limitations concerning the measurement of psychological symptoms.</s><s>The BSI was chosen as major secondary outcome measure in order to have a symptom scale that would be applicable to assess general psychological distress of all patients.</s><s>Given the relatively small GSI-BSI outcome differences between BRIA psychotherapy sessions and BWA that were found in the primary analyses of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the question arises of whether the GSI-BSI was suitable to measure change of symptoms in a sample that consisted of small subsamples of patients with heterogeneous disorders and the corresponding symptoms.</s></p><p><s>A formal limitation of this study is that the data sets are not publicly available because there is no approval of the study participants.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, future studies that aim to investigate the relations between motivation to change and combinations of MI and CBT should assess the behavior of therapists with appropriate observational instruments, e.g. the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[72]</ref>), the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Code (MITI 4; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[73]</ref>), or the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[74]</ref>).</s><s>It is also advisable to perform repeated measurements of patients' motivation to change by analyses of within session language during therapy and by self-report questionnaires at follow-up.</s><s>Finally, the inclusion of patients with homogeneous groups of disorders would facilitate the assessment of therapists' application of specific CBT interventions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Previous studies of interactions between motivation and treatment allocation were mainly based on therapy research of substance use disorders.</s><s>This investigation included surgical patients with diverse mental disorders, and the results suggest that combinations of MI and CBT are particularly effective in patients with low to moderate readiness to change.</s><s>These data contribute to recent research showing that integrating MI with CBT is a promising therapy approach for patients with a variety of psychological problems that are not related to substance use disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[77]</ref>.</s><s>The results of patients with high readiness to change are difficult to interpret.</s><s>Since they did not achieve significantly better outcomes in BRIA sessions compared with BWA, the question arises whether low-intensity interventions might be sufficient for patients with high readiness to change.</s><s>An alternative interpretation suggests that BRIA sessions might not have contained enough specific CBT elements to treat patients with high readiness to change who might not have profited significantly from MI because their motivation had already been increased before the therapy.</s><s>In order to investigate this topic in more detail, future research could analyze interactions between readiness to change and treatment allocation to lowintensity interventions like BWA, or to high-intensity MI-CBT combinations focusing either on MI or on CBT interventions.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the findings of this study suggest that motivation to change may act as a moderator of the efficacy of psychosocial therapy and that combinations of MI and CBT are particularly effective in patients with a variety of mental disorders and with low readiness to change.</s><s>This efficacy seems to be especially observable in proximal outcomes that are assumed to be associated with motivation, like active search for therapy and engagement in therapy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.1Flow of participants through the trial.</s><s>+ Numbers in brackets refer to patients lost to follow-up and drop outs concerning the secondary outcome.</s><s>Numbers of patients lost to follow-up differ between primary and secondary outcomes because the primary outcome was assessed via a telephone interview, and the secondary outcome as a postal questionnaire.</s><s>Kerper et al., Effects of an innovative psychotherapy program for surgical patients -Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology: A randomized controlled trial.</s><s>Anesthesiology 2015;123:148-59<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref></s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
