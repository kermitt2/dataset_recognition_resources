<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>As the number of people with diabetes has quadrupled since 1980, so has the need for new therapeutic interventions.</s><s>The major aspect of type 2 diabetes is chronic hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance in muscle, fat, and liver.</s><s>Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is mediated by GLUT4, the most important glucose transporter in muscle and adipose tissue.</s><s>GLUT4 is downregulated in diabetes patients and its expression levels are correlated with whole-body glucose homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>The antidiabetic drug Rosiglitazone, the strongest known PPARγ agonist, has been withdrawn from the European market since adverse drug reactions like severe cardiovascular events and increased bone fracture rates upon long-term use have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Hence, there is a strong need to identify new insulin-sensitizers and to unravel molecular processes involving PPARγ modulation in adult adipose tissue.</s></p><p><s>Bone/body morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted growth factors originally discovered by their ability to induce bone and cartilage formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>There are more than 20 different members of BMPs known with distinct roles in organ development and homeostasis as shown by their individual gene knockout phenotypes.</s><s>Beside their classical role in development, BMPs regulate several biological processes such as adipogenesis, iron metabolism in the liver, and differentiation and thermoregulatory activity of brown adipose tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>BMPs exert their function by binding to hetero-oligomeric complexes comprising of BMP type I (ACVR1A, BMPR1A, and BMPR1B) and type II (BMPR2, ACTR2A, and ACTR2B) receptors.</s><s>Interestingly, also mechanical forces are integrated and contribute to the BMP signaling network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Genetic and evolutionary analyses revealed expression of the BMP type II receptor (BMPR2) gene in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, which suggests a role for BMPR2 in the pathophysiology of human adiposity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, expression levels and genetic variants of the BMP type 1A receptor (BMPR1A) gene correlate with obesity in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Conditional ablation of Bmpr1a in aP2 (also known as FABP4) expressing tissues prevents age-related impairment of insulin sensitivity in normal and HFD fed mice.</s><s>Further, the Adipoq-Bmpr1a-KO strain, in which mature adipocytes are more specifically targeted, recapitulates the observed phenotype in aP2-Bmpr1a-KO mice only partially, suggesting that BMP signaling is very versatile in mature adipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, the distant TGF-β family member growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) induces weight loss through decreased food intake in obese rodents and primates via its recently identified receptor GDNF Family Receptor Alpha Like (GFRAL) which is expressed in the area postrema of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The most extensively studied member of the BMP ligand family is BMP2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>BMP2 and its closest relative BMP4 promote white adipogenesis in various precursor cell lines by induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ, whereas BMP7 exclusively promotes brown adipogenesis <ref

human preadipocytes is enhanced by BMP4 and BMP7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In the context of brown adipogenesis, a potential cross-talk between insulin and BMP signaling has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>BMP4, BMP7, and BMP9 are expressed in adipose tissue and act as adipokines regulating glucose homeostasis in several other tissues <ref

the blood stream of healthy individuals, BMP6 is best known for its role in iron metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>However, BMP6 has been proposed to induce brown fat differentiation of skeletal muscle precursor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Recently, the expression of BMP2, especially in visceral adipose tissue, was found to positively correlate with BMI and diabetic status in the Leipzig Cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In mature adipocytes, BMP signaling has never been investigated systematically.</s><s>Moreover, BMP2 and BMP7 are clinically used to promote bone healing in cases of bone fracture nonunions and in spine surgery.</s><s>Taken together, there is an emerging need to understand the precise role of BMP signaling in adult tissues, particularly in the context of glucose metabolism.</s></p><p><s>Here we show that both BMP2 and BMP6 act on mature adipocytes as insulin-sensitizers.</s><s>BMP signaling leads to transcriptional upregulation of the adipocyte master regulator PPARγ, which in turn upregulates GLUT4 and several other genes involved in lipid metabolism as revealed by whole transcriptome analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>BMP2 and BMP4 are well known for their function in white adipogenesis and BMP2 was proposed to play an important role in energy storage partitioning and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , while BMP7 is involved in brown adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>The role of BMP6, structurally most similar to BMP7, in adipocytes has never been addressed.</s><s>In addition, the physiological relevance and molecular mode of action of BMPs in adult adipose tissue remain largely elusive.</s><s>To uncover the role of BMP signaling in mature i.e. terminally differentiated adipocytes and adult glucose metabolism, we conducted a comparative study addressing the impact of BMP2 and BMP6 on signal transduction, gene expression and metabolism.</s></p><p><s>For this purpose, we used 3T3-L1 cells which were terminally differentiated, stimulated with BMP2 or BMP6 and subjected to various molecular and physiological analyses.</s><s>To assess the efficiency of 3T3-L1 differentiation, cells were stained for adipocyte-typical lipid droplets with the lipophilic fluorochrome BODIPY 493/503 and analyzed via flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1a</ref>) and microscopy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1b</ref>).</s><s>Eight days after induction, differentiation efficiency was &gt;90%.</s></p><p><s>BMP2 and BMP6 induce P-Smad, P-p38 signaling and upregulate PPARγ.</s><s>To characterize BMP signaling in adult adipocytes, we performed time-resolved stimulation experiments assessing protein phosphorylation via immunoblotting.</s><s>BMP2 as well as BMP6 treatment led to Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation after one hour, which persisted at least 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Of note, Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation by BMP6 was stronger after 2 h and 4 h of stimulation compared to BMP2.</s><s>Moreover, BMP2 and BMP6 induced phosphorylation of the MAP kinase p38 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>As shown previously for BMP2-mediated white adipocyte differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells, both Smad1 and p38 signaling are responsible for the upregulation of the master regulator PPARγ and its transcriptional activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Beside its crucial role in adipogenesis, PPARγ is also thought to play an important role in the maintenance of mature adipocyte function controlling the expression of metabolic key enzymes and glucose transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Remarkably, PPARγ protein was most upregulated after 8 h of BMP stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1f</ref>.</s><s>Pparγ mRNA expression was significantly induced in mature adipocytes after 4 and 10 h by both BMP2 and BMP6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, BMP2 or BMP6 signaling leads to upregulation of the transcription factor and nuclear receptor PPARγ in terminally differentiated adipocytes.</s></p><p><s>Effects of BMP2 and BMP6 on mature adipocytes are not redundant.</s><s>To further investigate the transcriptional response of mature adipocytes to BMP2 and BMP6 treatment, we performed gene expression profiling.</s><s>Upon 10 h of BMP2 or BMP6 treatment 800 genes and 965 genes respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1c  and d</ref>) were significantly differentially expressed (p &lt; 0.01) with an overlap of 648 genes.</s><s>Model-based gene set analysis revealed GO terms such as 'fat cell differentiation', 'response to cytokine' , and 'intracellular signal transduction' (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Hierarchical clustering resulted in five major clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Cluster A comprises genes that display slightly higher upregulation after BMP2 treatment.</s><s>Here, 54 of 164 genes are annotated to 'regulation of signaling' and 31 genes to 'biological adhesion' .</s><s>Cluster B refers to genes, which are similarly upregulated by BMP2 and BMP6.</s><s>GO analyses revealed that 13 of 204 genes are annotated to 'fat cell differentiation' and 37 genes to 'response to endogenous stimulus' .</s><s>This cluster includes Pparg, Rxrα, and Smad9 (also known as Smad8) and well-known BMP targets like Id1-4.</s><s>Genes in cluster C are slightly more responsive to BMP6.</s><s>Nine out of 82 genes in this cluster are annotated to 'ossification' .</s><s>Cluster D contains almost half of all differentially expressed genes (541 genes).</s><s>These genes are downregulated by BMP2 and BMP6 and annotated to 'extracellular matrix', 'growth factor binding' , and 'muscle system process' .</s><s>Genes in cluster E are slightly more downregulated upon BMP6 treatment (93 genes).</s><s>Downregulated genes include receptors like Acvr2a, Acvr2b, Tgfbr2, Tgfbr3, and 'transcriptional repressors' such as Hdac4 and Zbtb16.</s><s>Both BMP ligands have similar effects on a great number of genes, but subsets of genes are regulated exclusively by BMP2 (152 genes) or BMP6 (317 genes).</s></p><p><s>PPARγ-target identification and validation.</s><s>Motivated by these results, we compared our data to the putative PPARγ target genes identified by Nakachi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, we found 20 from 61 validated PPARγ targets  Mature adipocytes (d8) were stimulated with PBS, 10 nM BMP2 or BMP6 for 10 h.</s><s>Isolated total RNA was subjected to library preparation and deep sequencing (Illumina) to assess total gene expression profiles, n = 2 per condition.</s><s>The union of 1084 differentially expressed genes (DEseq.</s><s>2) were analyzed as the study set in comparison to 24,211 mapped murine genes.</s><s>The column 'marginal' indicates the marginal probability of a term being in the 'active' state, and the column 'count' shows the counts of genes in the study (x) and population (y) sets as x/y.</s><s>Analysis was performed 5 times and most frequent terms were ranked according to their marginal value.</s></p><p><s>and confirmed BMP-mediated differential expression for further 24 targets that contain a PPARγ response element (PPRE) in or in close proximity to their promoter region (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we validated our findings in independent experiments.</s><s>The PPARγ regulated genes Plin1 (Cluster B) and Lpl (Cluster A) were upregulated at 2 h, while Fasn (Cluster A) expression increased at 10 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>).</s><s>Gene expression of Glut1 (also known as Slc2a1), coding for glucose transporter 1 that is considered to reside constitutively at the plasma membrane of numerous cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , was not significantly regulated in our RNA-Seq data, but moderately upregulated by BMP2 and BMP6 as assessed by qPCR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>In line with the RNA-seq data, the classical BMP-Smad-target Id1 and the PPARγ coreceptor Rxrα (Cluster B) were upregulated in BMP-stimulated samples at all time points analyzed (Figs 3e and f, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1e</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, Nampt, coding for the adipokine Visfatin was strongly upregulated after 24 h of BMP treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3g</ref>).</s><s>Contrary, long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) transporter  <ref type="figure">A-E</ref>) on which GO analyses with MGSA were executed using Ontologizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60</ref> .</s><s>More unspecific GO terms with a population size &gt;2500 were excluded.</s><s>Prominent GO terms are highlighted and corresponding genes are shown on the right-hand side.</s></p><p><s>Fatp1 (Scl27a1) and Leptin (Lep or Ob) found in Cluster D of the RNA-Seq results were downregulated by both BMP ligands after 10 h and 24 h of stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h and i</ref>).</s><s>Downregulation of the receptors Acvr2a, Acvr2b as well as Igf1r and Igf2r after 10 h of BMP stimulation was validated by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1g</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, expression of the histone deacetylase 4 (Hdac4), a known negative regulator of GLUT4 (cluster E) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> was validated to be diminished after BMP-stimulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3f</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, we confirmed the BMP-specific modulation of genes from several Clusters of our RNA-Seq approach.</s><s>In general, BMP stimulation of mature adipocytes not only upregulates PPARγ, but also modulates the expression of several genes involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism/transportation and the adipokines Leptin and Visfatin.</s></p><p><s>BMP2 and BMP6 augment total GLUT4 levels.</s><s>Both during adipocyte differentiation and after thiazolidinedione treatment in adult tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , GLUT4 expression is enhanced via PPARγ.</s><s>Thus, we investigated changes of Glut4 expression on the transcriptional level.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, Glut4 mRNA expression was significantly induced 10 and 24 h upon BMP2 or BMP6 treatment.</s><s>This effect was more pronounced for BMP6 and strongest upregulation was observed after 24 h.</s><s>To assess the upregulation of GLUT4 protein, we performed intracellular immunostainings.</s><s>Mature adipocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry with appropriate gating for size and granularity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b and c</ref>).</s><s>Thereby, it was shown that BMP2 treatment led to a similar increase of GLUT4 protein as Rosiglitazone, while GLUT4 upregulation by BMP6 was slightly lower (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b and c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>BMP2 and BMP6 exhibit no direct effect on insulin signaling.</s><s>Recently, BMP7 was found to enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in insulin sensitive tissues by increasing PI3K/Akt signaling and subsequently GLUT4 translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we investigated the effect of BMP2 and BMP6 on the cell surface exposure of GLUT4 derived from GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs).</s><s>3T3-L1 cells stably expressing GLUT4myc7-GFP (G7-adipocytes) allow a discrimination between total and surface located GLUT4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>This is achieved via a C-terminal GFP-tag, which remains intracellular and 7 myc-tags in the first extracellular loop of GLUT4, which are available for antibody staining upon GLUT4 translocation to the surface.</s><s>Differentiated G7-adipocytes were stimulated with BMP2, BMP6, insulin or combinations thereof for various periods and the abundance of surface GLUT4 was analyzed via flow cytometry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>Insulin stimulation led to a clear shift in the GLUT4-myc7-PE signal, but no BMP effect on control (basal) or insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation was measured.</s><s>Quantification of Mean Fluorescence Intensities (MFI) from multiple experiments confirmed that insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation is not altered by treatment with either BMP2 or BMP6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>).</s><s>These findings suggest that there is no direct effect of BMP-signaling on GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane of differentiated adipocytes.</s><s>Taken together, BMP2 and BMP6 did not directly affect the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane.</s></p><p><s>The BMP and insulin pathways share multiple signaling components and were proposed to cross talk during brown adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we investigated putative BMP effects on the phosphorylation status of Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160, also known as TBC1D4), which is the most proximal signaling step before GSV fusion to the plasma membrane.</s><s>We stimulated differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with BMP2, BMP6, insulin or Rosiglitazone for different periods and analyzed the phosphorylation status of insulin signaling components.</s><s>Both AS160 and Akt (Ser473) were phosphorylated by insulin but not by BMP stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, we observed an insulin-sensitizing effect 4 hours after BMP2 or BMP6 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2b and c</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, BMP2 and BMP6 did not affect the

effect on insulin-sensitive, as well as insulin-resistant adipocytes, is specific to BMPs since TGF-β1 stimulation had no influence on basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.</s><s>BMP2 predominantly binds BMPR1A whereas BMP6 shows the highest affinity towards ACVR1A <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , but both BMPs use BMPR2, ActR2a or ActR2b as their type II receptors.</s><s>All these receptors are expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as in mature adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3c</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, BMP6 treatment resulted in neither upregulation of brightening markers such as UCP-1 in 3T3-L1 cells nor increased OCR (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2f</ref>).</s><s>Although both

branch of the insulin signaling pathway.</s><s>Akt signaling, which is activated by BMP signaling in many cell types represents a pro-survival signal.</s><s>Moreover, the presence of high glucose was

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2b</ref>) of BMP2/6 together with insulin did not increase glucose uptake rates, clearly points towards changes on the transcriptional level.</s><s>Indeed, we observed an upregulation of Glut4 mRNA upon BMP stimulation especially after 24 h.</s><s>Earlier studies have shown that PPARγ ligands such as Rosiglitazone induce Glut4 transcription during adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>In line with this, Hdac4 a negative regulator of Glut4 expression was found to be downregulated, thus enabling upregulation of the glucose

physical training is the strongest stimulus to enhance GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>As the BMP/Smad pathway was shown in several cell types to be activated upon mechanical/physical stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , this link might indicate GLUT4 as a potential downstream effector of both biochemical and biomechanical signaling in muscle but also other tissues such as AT.</s><s>Moreover, Glut1 seems to be moderately upregulated by BMP treatment, which explains the slight increase in basal glucose uptake (1.3 fold compared to control) observed in BMP-stimulated mature adipocytes.</s></p><p><s>We propose that GLUT4 is upregulated by BMP/Smad activation, subsequent to PPARγ induction.</s><s>The master regulator of adipogenesis and adipocyte function, PPARγ, is significantly upregulated as early as 4 h after BMP stimulation on mRNA level and peaks at 8 h on protein level in 3T3-L1 cells.</s><s>The promoter region of Pparg contains six conserved Smad1/5/8 binding sites, further indicating Pparg as a direct BMP-Smad target, also in terminally differentiated cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>We clearly show that the BMP-stimulated upregulation of PPARγ is causative for the insulin-sensitizing effect since it is attenuated in PPARγ-depleted cells.</s><s>This confirms previous

central mediator.</s><s>From this we conclude that the PPARγ-mediated upregulation of GLUT4 is crucial for the insulin-sensitizing effect of BMP.</s></p><p><s>Besides the Smad pathway, BMPs also induce the MAPK pathway.</s><s>The activation of p38 MAPK by BMP2/6 seen here might explain previous results by others on MAPK modulating the transcriptional activity of PPARγ <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref> .</s><s>In future studies it might be interesting to examine whether BMP2/6 heterodimers, which were shown to more potently activate

transcriptional changes in mature adipocytes stimulated with BMPs, we performed RNA-seq.</s><s>Besides the classical BMP-target genes as Smad6, Smad7, Smad9, and Id1-4 also PPARγ target genes such as Lpl, Plin and Fasn, involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and the PPARγ co-receptor Rxra Rxra XRa were upregulated.</s><s>Conversely, Fatp1 was considerably downregulated after 10 h BMP treatment, while time-resolved analyses revealed that it is upregulated in control conditions.</s><s>This suggests a compensatory mechanism to overcome the prolonged experimental starvation by upregulating the LCFA transporter and to import more fatty acids.</s><s>BMP stimulation seems to prevent this effect, indicating that de novo lipogenesis might be enhanced, which is reflected by the upregulation of Fasn.</s><s>The adipokine Leptin was reported to not only regulate appetite, energy balance, and adiposity but also to function as a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in tumorigenesis and hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53</ref> .</s><s>Since in obesity, chronic low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue and high blood pressure accompany insulin-resistance, the BMP-mediated

renal fibrosis in diabetes, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Based on our findings, we propose BMP2 and BMP6 as new potent insulin-sensitizers in adipocytes.</s><s>Interestingly, these BMPs upregulate a very specific set of target genes refining the metabolic capacity of mature adipocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Their effect is mediated by the transcriptional upregulation of PPARγ and subsequent modulation of PPRE-containing target genes.</s><s>This mechanism clearly differs from the action of known insulin-sensitizers like thiazolidinediones acting as nuclear receptor agonists.</s><s>It is tempting to speculate, that upregulation of these specific BMPs in adipose tissue is a compensatory mechanism of the body to cope with high glucose concentrations and emerging insulin resistance.</s><s>This is in line with the finding that BMP2 mRNA is most upregulated in adipose tissue of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>We propose a dual mechanism: (1) promoting differentiation of residual preadipocytes in the tissue in combination with (2) PPARγ induction, targeting GLUT4 and genes related to lipid metabolism in mature adipocytes, to exert maximal glucose metabolism.</s><s>Thus, the modulation of BMP signal
