<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plain English summary</head><p><s>Intimate partner violence (IPV) can increase maternal health concerns.</s><s>This study assessed the prevalence of intimate physical and/or sexual IPV among mothers who gave birth in the past 2 years in Bihar, India.</s><s>In addition, it examined the association of IPV with increased risk of poor birth outcomes (e.g., miscarriage and stillbirth) ever or of pregnancy and delivery complications in the most recent birth.</s><s>Almost half of these mothers (43%) were physically and/or sexually abused by their husbands in the past year, that is, in the perinatal period for this sample.</s><s>Further, a history of such violence increased health risks, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and maternal complications.</s></p><p><s>The study also explored the intersectionality of IPV and poverty with pregnancy and birth outcomes.</s><s>The association of IPV with miscarriage and stillbirth was less likely to hold true for the richest and poorest women, possibly due to the extremes of high resources (for the richest) and deprivation (for the poorest) being more important contributors to fetal health and survival.</s><s>However, IPV was associated with labor and delivery complications regardless of women's income level.</s><s>Notably, mobile phone ownership was protective for stillbirth.</s></p><p><s>Overall, these findings highlight the importance of maternal health interventions to address potential health concerns related to the physical and sexual intimate partner violence women face, as a means of improving maternal and infant health outcomes.</s><s>However, they also suggest the potential utility of asset ownership in conjunction with health approaches, to produce better health outcomes from an empowerment perspective.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of follow-up data from the Ananya evaluation, collected via household surveys from March to June 2014 with women who had given birth in the past 23 months in Bihar, India.</s><s>Ananya was a public health program that supported a combination of supply-side and demand generation efforts to increase maternal and child health care utilization via the public health system in Bihar; the program and corresponding evaluation were initiated in 2012 to address persistent challenges in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health in the state <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Details on the program and evaluation findings are published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Ananya was not designed to identify or intervene on issues of IPV, but IPV was included in the 2014 follow-up survey.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling and procedure</head><p><s>A sample of mothers representative at the state-level who delivered in the past 23 months was included in the current study; this included the eight districts in Bihar in which the Ananya program was implemented as well as the remaining 30 districts assigned to the standard of care control condition for the evaluation.</s><s>Details on the study's multi-stage sampling and recruitment procedures are available elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>The 2014 follow-up survey had a response rate of 87%, and yielded 11,408 interviews with mothers who had children aged 0-11 months, and 2455 interviews with mothers who had children aged 12-23 months.</s></p><p><s>Given the sensitive nature of the information, all data were collected by trained female study staff, after obtaining written informed consent.</s><s>The staff were trained in sensitive assessment according to WHO guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, ensuring complete privacy during questions and a debriefing in cases where trauma or retraumatization were indicated.</s><s>Referrals were provided to local domestic violence service.</s><s>If indications of immediate lethal risk was indicated, the survey was to be stopped and immediate connection to protections was to be provided.</s><s>However, no such incidents occurred.</s><s>Ethical approval for the original evaluation study was provided by the Screening Committee of Government of India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.</s><s>Ethical approval for this analysis was provided by the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).</s><s>The current analysis was restricted to women with singleton births and without missing values for any variables of interest (n = 13,803, a loss of only n = 63 participants in the dataset).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p><s>The independent variable for this analysis was self-reported lifetime experiences of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in their current marriage.</s><s>Physical violence was comprised of items on whether the participants had experienced any of the following from her husband: being slapped, having an arm twisted or hair pulled, being pushed with a fist, being shaken or having something thrown at them, being kicked, dragged or beaten up, or choking or burning.</s><s>Sexual violence was measured using a single item asking "Did your husband ever physically force you to have sexual intercourse with him even when you did not want to?" Responses were yes/no for the timeframes of ever and past 12 months.</s><s>Both any IPV ever and IPV recent measures were created from these items, but only the IPV ever measure was included as the independent variable given that multiple outcomes of focus were also in this timeframe.</s><s>These IPV items were validated in the multi-country study on Violence Against Women by the World Health Organization and are routinely included in the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS), including in India's DHS, known as the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Dependent variables included the following reproductive health outcomes: miscarriages, stillbirths, abortions; these were assessed via single survey items on whether these ever occurred.</s><s>Maternal health complications were specific to the index childbirth that allowed them to meet eligibility criteria, which was the most recent childbirth occurring in the past 23 months, and these were divided into labor complications and symptoms of other pregnancy or delivery complications.</s><s>Items on labor complications assessed prolonged labor over 12 h and pre-term labor, defined as labor pain in the seventh or eighth month of pregnancy.</s><s>Items on other pregnancy or delivery complications included excessive bleeding, convulsions, swelling of the hands, body, or face, fever, vaginal discharge, or "any other such symptom".</s></p><p><s>Covariates considered in the analyses related to sociodemographics, parity, and study design.</s><s>Sociodemographics assessed included maternal age (15 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 or older), wealth (in quartiles), education (none, primary, secondary or higher), religion and caste identity (Scheduled Tribe/Scheduled Caste [SC/ST], Other Backward Caste [OBC], Muslim, or General Caste], and paternal education (none, primary, secondary or higher).</s><s>The wealth index was constructed via principle component analysis of household characteristics and assets following the technique used in the NFHS <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Parity at survey was categorized as 1, 2, or 3 or more.</s><s>The study design covariate simply accounted for Ananya treatment group (i.e., whether or not the respondent lived in an Ananya program district).</s></p><p><s>Given the study focus on IPV, we additionally considered gender equity variables as covariates.</s><s>These included maternal age at marriage (under 18 vs.</s><s>18 or older), workforce participation in the past 12 months, personal bank account ownership, and ownership of a mobile phone, as they are factors related to autonomy that are significantly different for women and men in India <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>For maternal complication outcomes, we also included covariates specific to the index child: sex of child, age of child (0 to 5 months, 6 to 11 months, 12 to 23 months), having four or more antenatal care visits, and having a skilled birth attendant at delivery.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>Descriptive frequencies were calculated for all outcomes and covariates, cross-tabulated by lifetime IPV with Rao-Scott chi-square tests of independence.</s><s>Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between IPV on each health outcome.</s><s>Although Ananya district, age of mother, and parity were forced into all adjusted models, backwards stepwise model building was conducted for each outcome using an inclusion cut point of p &lt; 0.2.</s><s>Institutional versus home delivery was also considered for inclusion, but 97% of those with a skilled birth attendant delivered in an institution and the variance inflation factors exceeded 6.5 in a collinearity check, so these variables were deemed overlapping.</s><s>This approach was used to allow for a more parsimonious model, given the small cell sizes for some outcomes such as abortion.</s><s>An additional model was conducted to test for an interaction between IPV and wealth.</s><s>Final parsimonious models for all outcomes were then stratified by wealth index to provide insight into the intersectionality of IPV and poverty.</s><s>All analyses adjusted for survey design and individual sampling weights and were conducted using Stata 14.2 SE; and statistical significance was evaluated at p &lt; .05</s><s>unless otherwise indicated.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Findings from this representative sample of mothers who recently gave birth in Bihar India document that almost half (43%) have experienced IPV in the past year, suggesting that such violence in the perinatal period is pervasive.</s><s>Further, findings indicate that a history of IPV in their marital relationship is associated with increased maternal health risks, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and maternal complications.</s><s>While observed associations were less likely to hold true for the richest and poorest women in terms of miscarriage and stillbirth, possibly due to the extremes of high resources (for the richest) and deprivation (for the poorest) being a more important contributors to fetal health risk than was IPV, IPV was associated with labor and delivery complications regardless of women's income level.</s><s>Notably, indicators of asset ownership were also related to lower risk for IPV and perinatal health concerns.</s><s>These findings overall highlight the importance of maternal health interventions that can support women's marital safety and address potential health concerns related to the violence may face, as a means of improving maternal and infant health outcomes.</s><s>However, they also suggest the promise of economic interventions in conjunction with health approaches to produce better health outcomes from an empowerment perspective.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table
