of enrollment (at least 2 joints with active arthritis and 2 joints with limited range of motion), and a history of at least 5 joints with active arthritis (swollen joints or joints with a limited range of motion and pain or tenderness).</s></p><p><s>The study design was previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, the study consisted of a 4-month open-label lead-in phase, during which all patients received open-label abatacept, followed by a 6month double-blind withdrawal phase, during which patients who had achieved an ACR Pedi 30 response at the end of the 4month lead-in period were assigned randomly to receive either abatacept or placebo.</s><s>These patients could then enter the openlabel LTE phase.</s><s>Patients were also eligible to enter the LTE directly if they completed the open-label lead-in phase without achieving an ACR Pedi 30 response or if they had experienced a flare during the double-blind withdrawal period while receiving abatacept or placebo.</s><s>The study ended after the last patient completed 5 years of followup during the LTE phase.</s></p><p><s>During the open-label LTE phase, all patients received abatacept by intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 1,000 mg.</s><s>The dosages of oral corticosteroids (maximum 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent or 0.2 mg/kg/day, whichever was less) and methotrexate (#30 mg/m 2 body surface area/week up to a maximum allowed dosage of 40 mg/m 2 body surface area/week if required) could be adjusted during the LTE phase.</s><s>The use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or analgesics and the addition of hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or azathioprine were permitted during the LTE phase.</s><s>Up to 2 intraarticular injections of corticosteroids per year were permitted, and any injected joint was considered "active" at all subsequent visits.</s></p><p><s>This study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and with the ethics principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>The protocol, amendments, and patient informed consent form received approval by the relevant institutional review board or ethics committee at each participating site.</s></p><p><s>Assessments performed.</s><s>The primary objective of the LTE period was to assess the safety of continued long-term abatacept treatment.</s><s>Safety data were recorded at each study visit up to a maximum of 7 years of treatment, representing the maximum exposure time in the study.</s><s>Acute infusion-related events were defined as those reported within 1 hour of the start of infusion.</s><s>The definitions of a serious adverse event (SAE) included a fatal or life-threatening AE, an AE requiring hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, an AE resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, cancer, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, overdose, development of drug dependency or drug abuse, or an important medical event.</s></p><p><s>The secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of abatacept treatment.</s><s>Clinical efficacy and QOL evaluations were performed quarterly during the LTE phase and collected until day 1,765 (;5.5 years).</s><s>Improvements in the signs and symptoms of JIA were evaluated in terms of the proportions of patients achieving ACR Pedi 30, Pedi 50, Pedi 70, and Pedi 90 responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref> or clinically inactive disease status (as determined using the study-specific definition of no joints with active disease, a physician's

differences between the last visit and the baseline visit at the start of the phase III study, prior to the first abatacept infusion.</s></p><p><s>In this study, ACR Pedi responses were evaluated using the ESR as the laboratory measure of acute inflammation in the core set of measures of improvement and response in JIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(21)</ref>.</s><s>The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) was used to evaluate physical, emotional, and social aspects of HRQOL in the patients; raw scores were transformed to a scale of 0-100, with higher scores indicating better QOL.</s><s>Physical summary and psychosocial summary scores of the CHQ were normalized using data from healthy children in the US; mean 6 SD scores of 50 6 10 were considered within the normal range for healthy children <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Disability was assessed using the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ) disability index, which is a component of the criteria for an ACR Pedi response <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Pain was assessed using the parent's global assessment score.</s><s>Parents were asked how much pain due to illness their child had experienced in the past week; responses were measured using an anchored 100-mm visual analog scale, where 0 indicates no pain and 100 indicates very severe pain.</s><s>The impact of JIA on sleep quality was evaluated using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25)</ref>; total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more sleep problems.</s><s>The CSHQ consists of 33 items, assessing the following 8 domains of sleep behavior: bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night awakenings, parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness.</s><s>The questionnaire has been validated in children ages 4-10 years, with a total score of $41 identifying children with sleep disorders.</s></p><p><s>Participation in daily activities for both patients and parents was assessed using a questionnaire in which parents were asked the following 3 questions (with responses scored as the number of days during the past 30 days): On how many days did your child's JIA keep him/her from attending school (excluding vacation/holidays)?</s><s>On how many days did your child's JIA keep you from doing your usual activities?</s><s>On how many days did you pay for child care for your son/daughter with JIA in order for you to engage in your usual activities?</s></p><p><s>To evaluate immunogenicity, serum samples were obtained from the patients prior to dosing (day 1) and on the scheduled assessment days and assayed for the induction of abatacept-specific antibodies, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect antibodies to the whole abatacept molecule (CTLA-4 and immunoglobulin portion) or the CTLA-4 region alone (CTLA-4 "tip").</s></p><p><s>Statistical analysis.</s><s>The analyses were based on data derived from the 153 patients who entered the LTE phase and received at least 1 infusion of abatacept; the data for these patients were pooled and represent the open-label lead-in, double-blind randomized, and open-label LTE periods.</s><s>Safety data are presented as incidence rates (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), which were calculated as the number of events per 100 patient-years of exposure (number of patients with event/exposure [person-years] 3 100).</s><s>Patientyears of exposure were censored at the time of the first occurrence of an AE.</s><s>Safety analyses were based on data obtained up to 56 days after administration of the last abatacept dose.</s></p><p><s>Clinical efficacy and QOL analyses were based on data derived from patients for whom data were available at each time point (as-observed) and are presented for 3 subgroups: patients who received abatacept during the 6-month doubleblind withdrawal period (double-blind abatacept group), patients who received placebo during the 6-month doubleblind withdrawal period (double-blind placebo group), and patients who did not achieve an ACR Pedi 30 response during the initial 4-month open-label lead-in period and who entered the LTE phase directly (initial nonresponder group).</s><s>ACR Pedi responses over time during the LTE phase were combined from day 1 of the LTE for the double-blind abatacept and double-blind placebo groups, because all patients were receiving abatacept at this stage.</s><s>No formal statistical testing was performed during the LTE phase.</s></p></div>
