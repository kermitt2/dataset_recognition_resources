<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Insight has been an important subject of investigation in the field of Cognitive Psychology for around a 100 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mayer, 1995)</ref>.</s><s>By insight, we refer to the phenomenon that sometimes the solution to a previously unsolvable problem is comprehended suddenly as opposed to gradually, usually accompanied by a positive feeling, while being convinced of the correctness of the solution.</s><s>Several studies suggest that insight can enhance long-term memory (LTM) encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Auble et al., 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dominowski and Buyer, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ash et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Danek et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kizilirmak et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, the neural mechanisms that mediate this link between insight and successful encoding are largely unknown.</s><s>Previous studies suggest that the positive emotional response to insight may play an important role, because successful encoding of an insight solution is associated with higher activation of the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ludmer et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The hippocampus is critically important for the neural manifestation of explicit memory, and its role in memory includes the detection and encoding of novel stimuli, contexts, and associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Ranganath and Rainer, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, the hippocampus has also been shown to be involved in the processing of insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Luo and Niki, 2003)</ref>, which may provide a further explanation for the facilitated LTM encoding of insight-related information.</s><s>The aim of the current study is to identify neural correlates of successful encoding of insight solutions, that is, suddenly comprehended presented solutions, via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and to stimulate further research by proposing a theory of a neural network involved in learning from induced insight.</s></p><p><s>When investigating insight, it is important to be aware of the fact that the operationalization of "insight" varies considerably between studies.</s><s>These variations can be boiled down to two main operationalizations: a relatively objective one, in which the experimenter classifies given problems as either insight or no-insight problems in advance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Auble et al., 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Metcalfe, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bowden and Jung-Beeman, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wills et al., 2000)</ref>, and a subjective one, in which participants classify their solution either as being conceived via insight or not after they solved the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bowden and Jung-Beeman, 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Danek et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Danek et al., , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kizilirmak et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In the experimenter-based approach, insight problems are designed to make it very difficult to solve them gradually by incorporating problem features that usually lead to initial solution attempts, which in turn lead to a dead end, necessitating "thinking outside of the box" to break the fixation on the dead end solution attempt <ref type="bibr">(Öllinger et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>For example, when one needs to find a common association for words that are only remotely associated, such as "tennis, manners, and cloth" <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bowden and Jung-Beeman, 2003b)</ref>, one may become fixated on the close associations of the single words such as tennis-ball, racket, player, match, and manners-to say thankyou, holding the door open, gentlemen.</s><s>Solving this task is very difficult to problem solvers, because it is difficult to think of more remote associations.</s><s>However, this is necessary to solve the problem (the solution is "table": table tennis, table manners, and table cloth).</s><s>In the participant-based approach, insight is assessed by asking participants whether they had an "aha!" experience during the solution of the problem.</s><s>The subjective "aha!" experience is usually defined as the feeling that the solution was comprehended suddenly, while feeling surprised and convinced of the correctness of the solution.</s><s>Moreover, once comprehended, the solution appears to be very easy to understand.</s><s>A few studies suggest that the subjective "aha!" experience does not depend on solving the problem, but that it can also be perceived when confronted with the solution after having unsuccessfully attempted to solve the problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowden and Jung-Beeman, 2003a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kizilirmak et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kizilirmak et al., , 2016))</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that both approaches to investigate insight, the experimenter-based classification of insight and no-insight problems, as well as the participant-based classification of solutions accompanied by a feeling of "aha!" (insight) and no "aha!"</s><s>(no insight), are equally important to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind insight.</s><s>Evidence exists that both cognitive and neural processing differ considerably, when comparing insight and no insight with either approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Auble et al., 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jung-Beeman et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ludmer et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Danek et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Both approaches have their own merits: While the number of "insight" and "no-insight" items as well as in which trial and time point "insight" occurs can be controlled in the experimenterbased approach, only the participant-based approach provides information as to whether the participant actually consciously perceives a qualitative difference between insight ("aha!") and no insight (no "aha!").</s><s>We therefore intended to combine both approaches for the current study.</s></p><p><s>Traditionally, the problems used to study insight are tasks with only one trial, such as the 9-dot problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Maier, 1930)</ref> or the widely known problem with the candle, book of matches, and box of thumbtacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Duncker, 1945)</ref>.</s><s>Although such tasks are wellsuited for studying behavioral manifestations or the subjective phenomenology of the insight experience, different tasks are necessary to study the neural underpinnings of insight.</s><s>Measures of underlying neural activity require multiple measurements of the same kind, that is, many insight problems with minimal differences that all engage comparable cognitive processing strategies.</s><s>One such task is the CRAT, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bowden and Jung-Beeman (2003b)</ref>, which is based on the Remote Associates Task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mednick (1962)</ref>, originally developed to study creativity.</s><s>For each trial of this task, a triad of three words is presented which seem completely unrelated at a first glance (e.g., "death, drain, and stem").</s><s>Participants are required to find a fourth word that allows (by using this word as a pre-or suffix) to create a compound word with each of the three initially presented words (here: brain, i.e., brain death, brain drain, and brain stem).</s><s>The CRAT is especially suited for fMRI studies, as a large number of such triads and solutions can be generated, and the solution can be presented to induce insight (i.e., sudden comprehension) at a defined moment in time, after participants had the opportunity to think about the solution for a short time.</s><s>This also facilitates fMRI data analysis as the variation between participants and trials is relatively small.</s></p><p><s>For the current study, we used a modified German version of the CRAT where not only solvable (true CRA), but also unsolvable (control) items were presented.</s><s>Solutions were presented after a short while [4 s presentation of the riddle + 2-8 s fMRI jitter (fixation cross)] to induce insight (sudden comprehension) or not (continued incomprehension) at a welldefined time point.</s><s>Unsolvable items were created by shuffling the triad and solution words of a subset of originally solvable items that was equal in solution rate (when given 30 s to solve an item), probability of experiencing a subjective "aha!" as defined above, and probability to be rated as plausible, based on a prior normative study which assessed these features.</s><s>Which of four subsets of items was used to create unsolvable items was counterbalanced across participants.</s><s>This procedure ensured that all differences between the solvable insight condition and the unsolvable control condition could be attributed to sudden comprehension vs. continued incomprehension and not to item-related differences (e.g., word length, frequency, or any other perceptual differences between items).</s><s>To avoid any misconceptions, we would like to point out that in the current study, we investigated induced insight, that is sudden comprehension following a state of incomprehension induced by presenting the solution, as did <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ludmer et al. (2011)</ref>.</s><s>This is important to note, because many recent studies operationalized insight as "generating the correct solution to a problem accompanied by a feeling of 'aha!"' (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bowden and Jung-Beeman, 2003b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jung-Beeman et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Danek et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the neural correlates of successful encoding into LTM, learning trials are usually compared based on whether the encoded items were later successfully remembered or not.</s><s>Such contrasts are often referred to as "difference due to memory" or DM contrasts, for short <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Paller et al., 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, neural correlates of LTM formation are not only determined by the encoding task, but also by the memory retrieval task used to test for encoding success.</s><s>Depending on how memory is tested, the DM contrast can reflect the encoding of different aspects of the encoded information.</s><s>In the current study, we used the modified CRAT described above as an encoding task.</s><s>Participants were not informed that their memory would later be tested, thus, successful encoding was incidental (as opposed to intentional; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Richardson-Klavehn, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The information in the focus of the encoding process during this task may be subdivided into several aspects, namely the triad, the problem, the association between the triad and the problem, as well as episode-specific aspects such as how participants felt when they suddenly comprehended a solution.</s><s>Memory was tested 24 h later by presenting solution words without their triads, which were either old (i.e., presented during the learning phase) or were new.</s><s>The task was to decide whether a given solution word had been presented during the encoding task ("old" or "new").</s><s>Although recollecting the associated triad or any other contextual information about the encoding episode would almost certainly be helpful during the decision whether a solution was old or new, it was not a necessary requirement for the task.</s><s>Thus, contrasting learning trials of later recognized and later forgotten solutions should primarily reflect successful encoding of the solution.</s><s>If successful encoding of the solution were mainly independent of whether the presented solution was comprehended suddenly or not, one would expect no difference between the successful encoding of a CRA or control item's solution.</s><s>However, if induced insight, that is, sudden comprehension, facilitated encoding, as we hypothesized, CRA solutions would be expected to be associated with higher recognition memory, higher recollection rates, and differences in neural correlates of successful encoding.</s></p><p><s>While a number of previous studies investigated the neural correlates of insight, only very few studies have addressed the relationship between the occurrence of an insight and episodic memory at a neural level.</s><s>Insight as compared with no insight (with differing operationalizations) has been associated with increased activations of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system (right hippocampus, and bilateral amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus) as well as prefrontal brain structures (bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, IFG, middle frontal gyrus, MFG), of the salience network [right insula, right anterior to dorsal cingulate cortex (ACC)], and a temporo-parietal network including the precuneus, the bilateral angular gyrus (ANG), the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), and the right temporal pole <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jung-Beeman et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2009</ref>-also using the CRAT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Luo and Niki, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Qiu et al., 2010)</ref> 1 .</s><s>Brain areas implicated in the processing of insight solutions were the right anterior STG, which may reflect the integration of information across distant semantic relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jung-Beeman et al., 2004)</ref>, the hippocampus, which has been linked to the formation of novel associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Luo and Niki, 2003)</ref>, and IFG and ACC, which have been associated with more meta-cognitive processes controlling the search and evaluation of (potential) solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aziz-Zadeh et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sandkühler and Bhattacharya (2008)</ref>, who also used a version of the CRAT, further suggest that the right temporal activation may reflect retrieval of the novel solution.</s></p><p><s>Regarding episodic memory for presented insight solutions, analyzed by comparing later recognized old solutions with later forgotten old solutions, the amygdala has been proposed to play an important role due to the positive emotional response in response to sudden comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ludmer et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>These researchers further reported the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ACC, and precuneus from the same contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ludmer et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The precuneus is a region which previously has been associated with successful episodic memory retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Shallice et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Miller and D'Esposito, 2012)</ref> as well as effortful semantic integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hagoort et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Shimamura, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Seghier, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This may reflect the phenomenon that a solution that could better be semantically integrated was more likely to be remembered later on.</s><s>The mPFC has recently been suggested to play an important role in the detection and encoding of schema-consistent information, that is, information which can be easily integrated into pre-existing knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tse et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van Kesteren et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>In this context, insight could also be understood as the rapid formation of a novel schema <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mayer, 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the sudden formation of a novel schema may further support learning from insight.</s></p><p><s>In short, here, we investigated induced insight and the successful episodic encoding of insight solutions by using a version of the CRAT.</s><s>To this end, we compared behavioral and 1 Studies contrasting an insight condition with a null-event baseline were not included in this summary as such a contrast may include unspecific effects and therefore not accurately reflect the differential activation of insight solutions compared to no-insight solutions.</s><s>fMRI responses to solvable (CRA = induced insight condition) vs. unsolvable items (control condition) and further contrasted later recognized with later forgotten solution words.</s><s>We hypothesized that induced insight would facilitate encoding via (a) The positive feeling, which may function as an intrinsic reward and thereby enhance encoding by activating the mesolimbic reward system and (b) Better semantic integration due to the formation of novel schemata, facilitating the integration of the new information into existing knowledge.</s></p><p><s>Accordingly, we further hypothesized that, at a neural level, insight-based encoding would engage brain regions previously associated with reward-based learning such as the ventral and dorsal striatum (nucleus accumbens/caudate) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ikemoto and Panksepp, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Haruno et al., 2004)</ref> as well as brain structures previously implicated in schema-based memory formation, most prominently the mPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Tse et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van Kesteren et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>We used an episodic recognition memory test, because such tests have often been used to study the influence of rewardrelated areas on hippocampus-dependent encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Wittmann et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Krebs et al., 2009a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chowdhury et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>With respect to the hippocampus we predicted that activations would primarily relate to the detection of novel relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Davachi, 2006)</ref>, rather than successful schema-consistent encoding, which has previously been demonstrate to bypass the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Tse et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Encoding Phase</head><p><s>The encoding of the stimuli was performed while participants underwent fMRI scanning at 3 Tesla.</s><s>Before entering the scanner, participants first ran through a training session with four items from the control and CRA conditions each.</s><s>This was done to ensure that they understood their task correctly.</s><s>During scanning, they saw 56 CRA items and 56 control items equally split into two runs.</s><s>An exemplary trial is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.</s><s>Each trial began with a fixation cross which was presented for a duration between 2 and 8 s (pseudo-exponential distribution) which was followed by the triad, presented for 4 s.</s><s>Participants were instructed to try to think of a solution during that time.</s><s>From the normative study we knew that only 7% of the CRA items are usually (median solution rate) solved under 6 s.</s><s>After the triad, another fixation cross was displayed for a variable delay of 2 to 8 s.</s><s>Thus, with the median duration of the fixation cross jitter following the triad being 4 s and the triad not being displayed during that time, we approximated that probably less than 10% of all items could be solved during that time.</s><s>The fixation cross was followed by the target word, which was presented for 6 s.</s><s>Participants were instructed to provide one of three responses during the presentation of the solution: plausible with "aha!, " plausible without "aha!, " and implausible.</s><s>Plausible with "aha!" and plausible without "aha!" were assigned to either the left or right index finger on a response box (counterbalanced across participants), while implausible required a bimanual response.</s><s>The definition of the "aha!" experience was an adaptation of the definition provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Topolinski and Reber (2010)</ref> and highlighted that comprehension of the solution should be sudden and unexpected, and that the solution appears to be crystal clear, once it is understood.</s><s>The description was adapted to be applicable to all solutions, whether they were presented or found by the participant.</s><s>The "aha!" definition (rough English translation of the German original, cf.</s><s>Supplementary) read as follows: "You have most likely already had an 'aha!' experience yourself.</s><s>These are moments in which you surprisingly find the solution for a previously incomprehensible problem.</s><s>You are often unsure how you came up with this solution, but you are convinced of its truth.</s><s>However, you cannot only experience such an 'aha!' when coming up with a solution on your own, but also when you are provided with the solution after you have unsuccessfully thought about the problem on your own.</s><s>For example, a friend tells a joke which you do not get.</s><s>He then explains the missing piece of information, and suddenly it all makes sense and you may even ask yourself why you did not comprehend it immediately.</s><s>In our experiment, the 'aha!' experiences may qualitatively diverge from your real-life experiences.</s><s>It is therefore important to know the following characteristics of an 'aha!' experience to make a decision during the task: (1) The solution to the verbal riddle is comprehended suddenly and with surprise.</s><s>(2) The solution, once understood, is comprehended with ease and seems very clear.</s><s>(3) You are convinced of the correctness of the solution and do not need to question it.</s><s>(4) The sudden comprehension is often associated with a positive feeling.</s><s>Importantly, we are not referring to pride, but to the positive feeling which is based on the dissolved tension upon comprehension.</s></p></div>

( <ref type="formula">2004</ref>), who also investigated neural correlates of insight with the CRAT, we modeled the presentation of the solution, meaning the moment of deciding the response, as response-locked starting 2 s before the response and ending 2 s after it (4 s interval).</s><s>In modeling this regressor, it was irrelevant whether the 2 s after button press were already part of the presentation of the fixation cross that followed the presentation of the solution.</s><s>The rationale behind this approach was to capture the moment of comprehension vs. deciding that the solution is not meaningful, especially as the BOLD response is slow.</s><s>In both GLMs, all regressors were convolved with a gamma model of the hemodynamic response function, and temporal derivations were added to the model.</s><s>Functional analysis was done with z-statistics, which had been corrected at cluster level according to random field theory.</s><s>Unless otherwise stated, z-threshold was 2.8 and cluster significance threshold was 0.05 <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Worsley, 2001)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Due to a programming error, the CRA and control trials of the second run were not presented in a randomized but block-wise manner (first, all solvable CRA items were presented and then all unsolvable control items).</s><s>Hence, all data were analyzed for both runs separately and not collapsed (28 trials per condition per run).</s><s>The data from the second run are reported in the Supplementary, as a block-wise presentation of first the CRA and then the control items may have led to different effects.</s><s>All data reported below are from the first run in which conditions were presented in a randomized order, that is, in an eventrelated design.</s><s>Although the results from the first and second runs were overall comparable with respect to the behavioral data and also for the fMRI contrast between CRA and control (seeNeural Correlates of Induced Insight vs.</s><s>Control here and Test Phase 24 h Later of the Supplementary Materials), the results did differ for the DM contrast (see Neural Correlates of Learning from Induced Insight here and Test Phase 24 h Later of the Supplementary Materials).</s><s>This suggests that the blocked presentation had an influence on LTM encoding, at least on the neural level.</s></p></div>
