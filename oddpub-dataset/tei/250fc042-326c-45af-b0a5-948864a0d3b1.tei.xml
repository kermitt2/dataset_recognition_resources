<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: A common challenge in medicine, exemplified in the analysis of biomarker data, is that large studies are needed for sufficient statistical power.</s><s>Often, this may only be achievable by aggregating multiple cohorts.</s><s>However, different studies may use disparate platforms for laboratory analysis, which can hinder merging.</s><s>Methods: Using circulating placental growth factor (PlGF), a potential biomarker for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) such as preeclampsia, as an example, we investigated how such issues can be overcome by inter-platform standardization and merging algorithms.</s><s>We studied 16,462 pregnancies from 22 study cohorts.</s><s>PlGF measurements (gestational age P20 weeks) analyzed on one of four platforms: R&amp;D Ã’ Systems, Alere Ã’ Triage, Roche Ã’ Elecsys or Abbott Ã’ Architect, were available for 13,429 women.</s><s>Two merging algorithms, using Z-Score and Multiple of Median transformations, were applied.</s><s>Results: Best reference curves (BRC), based on merged, transformed PlGF measurements in uncomplicated pregnancy across six gestational age groups, were estimated.</s><s>Identification of HDP by these PlGF-BRCs was compared to that of platform-specific curves.</s><s>Conclusions: We demonstrate the feasibility of merging PlGF concentrations from different analytical platforms.</s><s>Overall BRC identification of HDP performed at least as well as platform-specific curves.</s><s>Our method can be extended to any set of biomarkers obtained from different laboratory platforms in any field.</s><s>Merged biomarker data from multiple studies will improve statistical power and enlarge our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of medical syndromes.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Large datasets are essential for sufficient statistical power to characterize subsets of disease.</s><s>The usefulness of single cohorts can be enhanced by combining several studies to facilitate analyses of pooled individual patient data (IPD).</s><s>However, to date such studies have only collected primary outcomes measured on comparable scales or, in the case of biomarkers, using the same assay platforms.</s><s>Different assay platforms may vary in their sensitivity, precision, and concentration ranges.</s><s>In such cases, valid methods of standardization of laboratory data are required in order to aggregate individual patient data.</s></p><p><s>The Global Pregnancy Collaboration (CoLAB) was established in 2011 (http://pre-empt.cfri.ca/colaboratory/global-pregnancy-collaboration) to facilitate data and sample sharing between research groups studying preeclampsia and other pregnancy disorders.</s><s>Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy which complicates 3-4% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal/neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide.</s><s>Because preeclampsia is clinically and biologically heterogeneous, (e.g.</s><s>early and late disease have different prognoses and perhaps etiologies) improvements in management, prediction, diagnosis, prevention and treatment have been difficult to achieve <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Circulating maternal biomarkers of placental origin have been proposed as novel tools for identifying hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP).</s><s>However, to date, precise estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity have yet to be achieved because individual studies have been too small.</s><s>Clinical data can be easily standardized for aggregation of cohorts, but laboratory biomarker data present the unique problem that they often use different analytical platforms with different ranges and results.</s></p><p><s>This paper focuses on clinical and laboratory data for placenta protein, placental growth factor (PlGF) to predict and/or diagnose hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP).</s><s>These disorders are associated with severe reductions in circulating PlGF concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>In the cohorts included in this study, PlGF was quantified on one of four laboratory platforms, each with different analytic performance.</s><s>We developed a method of standardizing PlGF data to allow pooling.</s><s>Additionally, concentrations of PlGF are known to change with gestational age (GA) and to show the power of the pooled data, we developed a best reference curve (BRC) over six gestational age groups.</s><s>The rate of accurate identifi-cation of women with HDP using the merged BRC was compared to unmerged (platform-specific) rates.</s></p><p><s>This paper demonstrates a principle that can be generalized to the study of other biomarkers for any complex, heterogeneous medical conditions requiring large cohorts to draw useful conclusions, which also use different assay platforms to measure the same biomarker.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>We have developed and validated a generalizable method for pooling and merging laboratory data from four different analytical platforms.</s><s>We illustrate our pooled data analysis strategy with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and the circulating maternal biomarker PlGF, which is increasingly used in clinical practice.</s></p><p><s>Merging of PlGF measurements quantified on different assay platforms allowed for the development of a best reference curve (BRC) for uncomplicated pregnancy that can be applied, in future, to the identification of complicated pregnancies.</s><s>We would like to highlight three main components of the above analyses.</s><s>Firstly, using clustering analysis and the Adjusted Rand Indices, we compared the ability of each transformation (Z-Score and MoM) to produce measurements that are easily merged.</s><s>Both transformations performed well.</s><s>The rates of case identification using reference thresholds derived from the merged data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>) indicated that the MoM transformation performed slightly better than the Z-Score transformation in later age groups.</s><s>The choice between using the MoM BRC-PlGF or the Z-score BRC-PlGF may rely on the investigator's preferences.</s><s>The differences between the overall diagnostic rates of both merged thresholds and the average diagnostic rates of the platform-specific thresholds were not statistically significant at the 5% level for any GA category.</s><s>We conclude that the merged BRC performs just as well as those estimated specifically for each platform, with the added practical advantages of being based on a much larger and broader sample.</s><s>The merged BRC is particularly useful for collaborative investigations across cohorts.</s></p><p><s>Our method has been developed to study pregnancy-related screening or diagnosis data but is applicable to any medical condition where there is intrinsic variability in the tests that measure the same biomarker(s).</s><s>The choice of BRC for any given study and any biomarker will in general depend on the distribution of the data being used.</s><s>It is clear from our results in this PlGF merging study of pregnancy blood samples that the diagnostic information itself has not been degraded by merging the data from these heterogeneous platforms and cohorts.</s></p><p><s>Of the possible biases in our study, some are intrinsic to constructing reference ranges whether from single or multiple datasets.</s><s>They are considered no further than to say that the validity of our approach depends on our definition of non-cases and the requirement that no non-case contributed more than one value to the BRC.</s><s>Unstandardized use of the same analytical platform in different laboratories may lead to small systematic biases in the results.</s><s>We found no evidence for this kind of bias of a magnitude that could constitute an important problem in our application here, as removal of any single cohort in our LOO-CV methodology (and the respective PlGF measurements) did not significantly alter the merged BRC-PlGF across all GA ranges.</s><s>Distributions of both serum and plasma measurements were shown to be similar and therefore these data were combined for the analysis, however the combination of matrices may be a potential source of variability.</s><s>It is assumed that there is statistical independence between platforms and case-mix.</s><s>In an ideal situation, each blood sample from the pregnant woman would be measured on all four platforms and in the same laboratory to allow direct comparison.</s><s>However in this application, to our knowledge, PlGF measurements of this form are currently not available for any pregnancy cohorts.</s></p><p><s>Biases that could be generated during the merging of the PlGF data are highly relevant because we wanted to establish a generalizable method applicable to merged data of many tests in multiple contexts.</s><s>After merging the non-case values, there was no residual cluster that could be attributed to one analytical platform.</s><s>By LOO-CV we also excluded the possibility of a dominant contribution from any single cohort.</s><s>In relation to this specific study, since we did not systematically seek every known pregnancy cohort globally and also since relevant pregnancy cohorts with angiogenic factor analyses from low and middle income countries are lacking, there is a possibility of potential inclusion bias.</s><s>We believe any such bias to be minimal but this will be addressed more specifically in our future clinical analyses of this database.</s></p><p><s>The accuracy of medical diagnostic tests is usually considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in relation to a clear, verifiable, single diagnosis using laboratory methods that are already standardized for the purpose of introduction into routine clinical practice.</s><s>Examples include tests in prenatal screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The present paper describes a methodology which may be more applicable to research and discovery.</s><s>Preeclampsia, like other syndromes such as many inflammatory and cardiovascular conditions, lacks sharp diagnostic definitions.</s><s>In preeclampsia and related placentally-mediated disorders of pregnancy, there are many clinical presentations in a gray zone between normality and abnormality.</s><s>Furthermore the disease can be extremely variable, indicating underlying heterogeneity.</s><s>Clinical diagnosis could be improved in relation to better definitions of disease subtypes using biomarkers (3), but further discovery relating to diagnostic challenges is impeded by the low power of single studies, and the fact that researchers have used several laboratory assays with differing analytical performances for measuring single biomarkers.</s><s>It is at this level that our method is likely to be most useful.</s></p><p><s>We have constructed a ''PlGF converter" that enables any researcher or clinician to calculate a general PlGF percentile based on a PlGF concentration measured during pregnancy after week 20, on any of the four platforms included in our study (It also includes options for comparison against merged thresholds (both Z-Score and MoM) and platform-specific thresholds).</s><s>A link to the PlGF converter is on the CoLAB home page (http://pre-empt.cfri.ca/colaboratory/global-pregnancy-collaboration).</s></p><p><s>We hope that the awareness of our merging method will encourage researchers to plan their studies, in any biomarker field, to allow their data to be merged with other future datasets in order to gain more statistical power and research value for rare study outcomes.</s><s>Harmonization of data collection is being addressed now in various clinical arenas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, also for preeclampsia <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, where application of the new ''PlGF converter" could be useful when merging pregnancy PlGF biomarker studies.</s></p><p><s>The clinical value of our PlGF reference curve has yet to be validated.</s><s>Future work will use the merged BRC-PlGF across gestational age to better characterize clinical subgroups of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other important complications such as fetal growth restriction.</s><s>We will use the BRC-PlGF to explore how different clinical groups of HDP and fetal growth restriction are sub-classified on the basis of PlGF <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>We will extend our studies, using similar merging algorithms, to other angiogenic markers (sFlt-1 and sEng), and to other pregnancy conditions such as gestational diabetes mellitus and more rare pregnancy outcomes, including intrauterine fetal death.</s><s>Pregnancy disorders are not the only relevant conditions where this strategy could be useful: other complex syndromes such as the metabolic syndrome or polycystic ovarian syndrome present the same problems.</s></p><p><s>Overall, we show here that heterogeneity of laboratory assays in biomarker studies need not be a barrier for inclusion in pooled analysis of individual patient datasets.</s><s>The method shows how to transform and validate merging for any set of biomarkers obtained from different laboratory platforms in any field.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.
