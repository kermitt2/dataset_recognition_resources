<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>With an incidence rate of 5-6/100.000,</s><s>multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for 13 % of hematologic cancers and 1 % of all neoplastic diseases in Western countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In first-line treatment of MM, high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with subsequent autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) has become the standard of care in eligible patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In recent years patient outcomes have been further improved by the introduction of novel agents, namely immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) into first-line therapy.</s><s>Nevertheless, MM remains largely incurable and almost all patients eventually relapse.</s><s>Therapeutic options in the setting of relapsed MM (RMM) include salvage HDCT/ASCT, novel agents (IMiDs, PIs, agents under clinical investigation), chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In the absence of an established standard of care the selection of a suitable treatment regimen for RMM patients is usually based on disease-and patient-specific factors such as regimens employed in and response to prior lines of therapy.</s><s>Again, the introduction of IMIDs and proteasome inhibitors into the treatment of RMM has led to a major increase in survival rates of this patient population <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Lenalidomide is an orally administered IMiD and a derivative of the structurally related thalidomide <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The mechanism of action of lenalidomide is multifaceted <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> including apoptosis induction, alteration of the interaction of myeloma cells with bone marrow stroma <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, antiangiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, and immunomodulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, anti-myeloma activity of lenalidomide has been shown to depend on interaction with cereblon, a protein involved in the teratogenicity of thalidomide <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Two pivotal phase III trials (MM-009 and MM-010) have demonstrated highly significant improvement of response rates with lenalidomide/ dexamethasone compared with placebo/dexamethasone in a total of 704 RMM patients and subsequently led to regulatory approval of lenalidomide in the USA and the EU.</s><s>All patients in these pivotal trials received 40 mg dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12 and 17-20 and either 25 mg lenalidomide or placebo on days 1-21 of 28-day cycles.</s><s>After completion of the 4 th cycle, dexamethasone was limited to days 1-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Pooled analysis of both registration studies revealed superior overall response rate (ORR; 60.6 % vs. 21.9</s><s>%), time to progression (TTP; 13.4 vs. 4.6 months) and median OS (38.0 vs. 31.6</s><s>months) of the lenalidomide-containing regimen, but also significantly more adverse events (AEs), especially grade 3-4 neutropenia (35.4 % vs. 3.4 %) and thromboembolic events (15.9 % vs. 5.4 %) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Dexamethasone dosing was subject of investigation in a phase III trial in NDMM patients.</s><s>In combination with lenalidomide, high-dose dexamethasone (480 mg/cycle; 40 mg on days 1-4, 9-12 and 17-20) led to significantly increased ORR (79 % vs. 68 %), but low dose-dexamethasone (160 mg/cycle; 40 mg on days 1, 8, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref> showed significantly increased OS after 1 and 2 years (96 % vs. 87 % and 87 % vs. 75 %, respectively).</s><s>This was related to a significantly lower incidence of AEs including infectious and thromboembolic events and deaths in the low-dose dexamethasone arm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>A subgroup analysis of RMM patients from MM-009 and MM-010 with dexamethasone dose reduction confirmed these results <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, lenalidomide maintenance treatment has been evaluated in four phase III trials in NDMM patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>While PFS after lenalidomide maintenance was markedly prolonged in all four trials, OS was significantly superior in only one trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Despite the finding of an increased incidence of second primary malignancies in the maintenance arm, the odds for lower mortality are in favor of lenalidomide maintenance treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Available data on HDCT/ASCT in RMM patients largely comes from retrospective, non-randomized, single-center or

type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s><s>These studies suggest that salvage HDCT/ASCT is feasible in RMM patients considered eligible based on sufficient general condition and absence of prohibitive comorbidities.</s><s>However, reported outcomes vary due to small and/or heterogeneous patient populations and differing salvage regimens.</s><s>A recently published review of 19 retrospective studies of salvage HDCT/ASCT in patients treated with first-line HDCT/ASCT reported median ORR of 64.3 % (range 27.3 to 97.4 %), median PFS of 12.3 months (range 6 to 36 months), median OS of 32.4 months (range 8 to 79.1 months) and median transplantation associated mortality (TRM) of 4.1 % (range 0 to 22 %).</s><s>TTP after first-line HDCT/ASCT of ≥ 19.8 months (range 6 to 36 months) was identified as the major predictive factor for a beneficial outcome after salvage HDCT/ASCT.</s><s>Furthermore, the quality of response after first-line HDCT/ASCT and the number of prior lines of therapy were suggested as predictive factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>A similar, retrospective study from our center involving 200 patients treated between 1995 and 2010 with salvage HDCT/ASCT at relapse after first-line HDCT/ASCT yielded comparable results with median ORR of 80.4 %, median PFS of 15.4 months, median OS of 42.3 months and TRM of 3 %.</s><s>An overall survival advantage for patients treated with bortezomib or lenalidomide during reinduction suggested that salvage HDCT/ASCT and novel agents are complementary treatment approaches.</s><s>Moreover, a favorable cytogenetic status (i.e.</s><s>absence of +1q21, del(17p13) and t(4;14)) was associated with significantly prolonged PFS (25.6 vs. 13.2 months) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, results from the first prospective, randomized trial on salvage HDCT/ASCT in patients with a previous HDCT/ASCT have been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>At first relapse at least 18 months (later reduced to 12 months) after previous HDCT/ASCT, 293 patients were treated with bortezomib/doxorubicin/dexamethasone (PAD) reinduction therapy and underwent stem cell mobilization and harvesting if applicable.</s><s>Subsequently, 174 eligible patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either HDCT (melphalan 200 mg/m 2 ) and ASCT or cyclophosphamide (400 mg/m 2 per week for 12 weeks) consolidation therapy.</s><s>ORR in the HDCT/ASCT arm was 83 % compared with 75 % in the cyclophosphamide arm with significantly more very good partial remissions or better after HDCT/ASCT (60 % vs. 47 %).</s><s>The primary endpoint of median TTP was significantly prolonged <ref type="bibr">(19 vs. 11 months)</ref>.</s><s>OS did not differ significantly with median OS not having been reached at the cut off date for the final analysis and 3-year OS of 80.3 % vs. 62.9 %.</s><s>TRM was 1 % in the HDCT/ASCT arm.</s><s>A subgroup with an unfavorable cytogenetic status (i.e.</s><s>t(4;14), t(14;16) and/or del(17p13)) did not benefit from HDCT/ASCT (hazard ratio (HR) 2.41).</s><s>However, the low proportion of patients with available cytogenetic data (51 % of patients undergoing randomization) and the low number of patients with an unfavorable cytogenetic status (n = 13; 15 %) limit the interpretation of this finding.</s></p><p><s>Existing evidence suggests both feasibility and benefit of salvage HDCT/ASCT in eligible RMM patients.</s><s>Moreover, novel agent based regimens and HDCT/ ASCT seem to be complementary salvage treatment approaches.</s><s>The ReLApsE trial is designed to analyze the benefit of salvage HDCT/ASCT incorporated into the widely used and novel agent based salvage treatment lenalidomide/dexamethasone (Rd) in a prospective, randomized setting.</s></p></div>
