induced by unfavorable growth conditions, when the producer has turned into the stationary or sporulation phase and its own metabolic activity is sharply reduced.</s><s>Under these conditions, antibiotics will block the growth of better adapted competitors and thus prevent a further impairment of life conditions (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Antibiotics therefore improve the survival chance of the producer, which represents the selective force for the natural development of antibiotics.</s><s>Under these restricted conditions, synthesis of nucleic acids and protein synthesis is strongly reduced in the producer cell, which explains that, in many cases, the producer is not resistant against its own product.</s></p><p><s>Antibiotics are chemically extremely diverse.</s><s>The synthesis by microorganisms and a molecular weight less than 1000 Da are the only common features <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Nowadays, the term antimicrobials (short for antimicrobial substances) is used, which includes both natural products (antibiotics) and semi-synthetic or full-synthetic substances (chemotherapeutics).</s><s>In addition to the wide chemical spectrum, the target spectrum is also enormous: More than 160 cellular targets have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Examples are replication (e.g., nalidixic acid), transcription (e.g., rifamycin), translation (e.g., chloramphenicol) and the synthesis of the cell wall (e.g., penicillin).</s><s>Most of the antibiotics inhibit the translating ribosome because, due to its complicated structure, it offers many interference points.</s><s>The Escherichia coli ribosome contains 57 different components, 54 proteins and three ribosomal RNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and all of them are present in one copy per ribosome except the protein bL12, which is present in four copies.</s><s>Nevertheless, the binding sites of the antibiotics are concentrated at and around functional hot spots of the small 30S and the large 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,b</ref>).</s><s>These sites are often dominated or exclusively built by elements of the rRNA (ribosomal RNA), and, importantly, the multiplicity of rrn operons present in most bacterial species aggravates development of resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Mutations in only one gene have low impact and multiple mutations are of low probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Antibiotics 2016, 5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> 2 of 13 copies.</s><s>Nevertheless, the binding sites of the antibiotics

molecules with high affinity; (ii) the fact that the PTC needs a high amount of structural flexibility and any interference by drug binding or mutations causing resistance might hamper the speed and/or accuracy of translation, which leads to the final outcome that any rescuing mutations within the PTC are associated with high fitness costs <ref type="bibr"
