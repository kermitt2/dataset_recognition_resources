<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target landscape of clinical kinase drugs</head><p><s>To determine the protein targets of the 243 KIs, a quantitative, mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomic assay termed Kinobeads was employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, Kinobeads feature immobilized broad spectrum kinase inhibitors that enable the purification of endogenous kinases from cells or tissues.</s><s>When performed as a competition binding assay and measured by quantitative mass spectrometry, Kinobeads allow the label-free measurement of the physical interaction of a compound of interest with thousands of proteins in parallel.</s><s>Here, KIs were dosed at eight concentrations (plus vehicle and target depletion control) to derive dose response characteristics and apparent dissociation constants (K d app ) for every drug-protein interaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1A</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1A</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>-3; Supplementary Materials).</s><s>Quantification of protein binding by mass spectrometry essentially yielded the same data as western blot analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1B</ref>) but does not require antibodies and affords much higher throughput for target proteins.</s><s>Kinobeads assay data also agreed well with the KiNativ technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> which is an alternative binding assay using covalent ATP probes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1C</ref>).</s><s>The correlation of Kinobeads binding and enzymatic activity data was good but not quite as strong (exemplified in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1D</ref>) and reasons for the sometimes observed discrepancies have been discussed before <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>For example, the activation status of an endogenous kinase in cells may not be the same as that of a recombinant protein in a test tube.</s><s>In addition, the high protein concentration of lysates can lead to various degrees of unspecific binding of the generally hydrophobic KIs akin to the extensive binding of most drugs to plasma proteins.</s><s>Despite the above, in our experience, whenever a compound scored in the Kinobeads assay, it also inhibited the activity of the kinase in a recombinant kinase assay (but not vice versa) showing that the Kinobeads interaction data obtained in complex cell lysates can be functionally interpreted.</s></p><p><s>To define the target space that can be addressed by the Kinobeads assay, RNA-Seq, full proteome profiling and Kinobeads measurements were performed for the four cell lines used in the interaction screen (K-562, MV-4-11, SK-N-BE(2), COLO 205) and a total of 494 transcribed kinases (including mutations), 363 translated kinases and 253 kinases on Kinobeads were identified (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1E</ref>-F; Tables <ref type="table">S4, S5</ref>).</s><s>Some kinases (e.g., MET) were too weakly expressed in the cell lines used to be robustly detected but were observed when using an alternative cell line (12 MET inhibitors were also profiled in CAKI cells; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1G</ref>).</s><s>Some kinases escaped detection entirely as the immobilized probes were unable to capture these.</s><s>A few kinases were not competed even by excess compound because the proteins bound to beads by an (unclear) binding mode.</s><s>This was pronounced for members of the PI3K/mTOR family.</s><s>When an immobilized derivative of the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor Omipalisib was used, these proteins also became amenable to the assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1H</ref>).</s><s>Some kinase inhibitors are known to bind G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> but these cannot be assayed by Kinobeads because we have not detected binding of any GPCRs to the five immobilized kinase inhibitors that constitute Kinobeads.</s></p><p><s>Unsupervised clustering of pK d app values for all inhibitors and the targeted kinases obtained from ~3,000 affinity purifications and 6,000 hours of LC-MS/MS time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1B</ref>) offered a view of the kinome that can be drugged by current clinical kinase inhibitors.</s><s>The systematic collection of these quantitative drug-target interaction profiles revealed e. g. groups of drugs for intended or phylogenetically-related targets (e.g., CDKs and PKCs).</s><s>Historically, drug discovery focused on tyrosine kinases and, not surprisingly, these form a large cluster, as do multi-kinase inhibitors with very promiscuous target profiles.</s><s>In contrast, the map also indicates that some inhibitors are quite selective, e.g., drugs targeting MAP2K1 (MEK), MAPK11/14 (p38) or EGFR.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, the present work constitutes the most comprehensive drug-target interaction analysis for kinase inhibitors to date.</s><s>Broad binding or activity profiles for KIs may exist within drug discovery programs in the pharmaceutical or biotech industry but are generally not available to academic laboratories working with these molecules.</s><s>Therefore, every drug-target profile provides valuable information as to how these compounds may exert their effects, how they may be used in the laboratory and if any particular effect can be attributed to the targeting of a particular protein.</s></p><p><s>To facilitate the use of the present work, all 281 drug-target profiles generated in this study are provided as pdf files (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2</ref> for an example) on proteomeXchange (http:// www.proteomexchange.org/),</s><s>and can be interactively explored in ProteomicsDB (https:// www.proteomicsdb.org) as well as in a purpose built selectivity calculator (http:// 129.187.44.58:5243/selectivityCalculator).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selective chemical probes and polypharmacology</head><p><s>Many clinical KIs are claimed to be potent and selective.</s><s>As noted before, this is often not the case leading to multiple clinical implications as well as issues when using such compounds for research.</s><s>Assessing selectivity of a compound for a target or target class is in fact not trivial as the full range of targets (and their cellular expression levels or concentrations) is often unknown and the full range of compound doses is rarely measured.</s><s>All KIs in our study were profiled in a dose-dependent fashion and at near thermodynamic equilibrium in cellular lysates.</s><s>Thus, this large body of binding data enabled the development of a new selectivity metric termed CATDS (Concentration And Target Dependent Selectivity) that goes beyond previously published selectivity scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> in that it also captures aspects of target engagement and drug MoA.</s><s>CATDS measures the reduction of binding of a particular protein to Kinobeads at a particular compound concentration relative to the summed reduction of binding of all proteins at that concentration.</s><s>Therefore, a CATDS value close to one or close to zero is indicative of selective and unselective compounds, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>; Supplementary Materials).</s></p><p><s>CATDS analysis of drugs in this study confirmed many prior observations but also revealed some surprises.</s><s>Some molecules appeared to be very selective (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2A</ref>; e.g., Capmatinib for MET; Lapatinib for EGFR; Rabusertib for CHEK1; in general scores &gt; 0.5) and may thus qualify as chemical probes for these targets.</s><s>Compounds in blue were previously classified as selective probes in chemicalprobes.org(</s><s><ref type="formula">22</ref>) but many of these showed rather poor selectivity in our assay.</s><s>Perhaps more surprisingly, clinically more advanced compounds did not show higher selectivity than those from earlier trial phases.</s><s>This reinforces the notion that selectivity is not a strict requirement for progressing compounds in the clinic (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S4A,  B</ref>).</s><s>This is illustrated by the recent approval of Midostaurin, a drug with a very broad kinase inhibitory profile.</s><s>However, we argue that it is nonetheless important to determine the target spectrum of any drug that is administered to humans or used as a tool compound as carefully as possible in order to be able to make informed decisions in the clinic and in the research laboratory.</s><s>Analysis of 137 compounds with available binding mode information <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S4C</ref>) confirmed that type 2 inhibitors are not necessarily more selective than type 1 inhibitors (median CATDS of 0.4 vs. 0.3)(5).</s><s>Type 3 inhibitors showed a higher selectivity (median CATDS of 0.7) but these are special cases as most of them are designated MEK1/2 inhibitors that bind to a unique cavity adjacent to the ATP binding site <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Type 4 inhibitors bind to allosteric sites and usually do not score in the Kinobeads assay unless binding leads to a conformational change involving the ATP binding site (as observed for MK-2206).</s></p><p><s>Irreversible kinase inhibitors that target a cysteine residue in the ATP binding site of EGFR (C797) or BTK (C481) have received considerable attention (recent approvals of Afatinib, Ibrutinib and Osimertinib).</s><s>The nine irreversible EGFR and two BTK inhibitors in our panel showed a higher selectivity than reversible compounds (median CATDS of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively) but this was not universally the case.</s><s>Most of the irreversible inhibitors bound both EGFR and BTK, albeit often with higher potency for the intended target.</s><s>Some inhibitors can also reversibly bind kinases lacking the supposedly required cysteine residue (e.g., Pelitinib and WEE1).</s><s>This may not be surprising as a kinase scaffold is still required to position the molecule at the intended target to allow irreversible binding to occur.</s><s>Additional experiments for 24 EGFR inhibitors (9 irreversible; 15 reversible) in the ERBB2-dependent breast cancer cell line BT-474 confirmed the results from the main Kinobeads screen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S4D</ref>).</s><s>Even if selectivity cannot be universally claimed for these molecules, irreversible target binding increases the residence time of the drug which can be useful for targeting long-lived proteins.</s><s>Protein turnover measurements performed in HeLa cells confirmed that EGFR is indeed a long-lived protein (t 1/2 = 271 h; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S4E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The drug-target data matrix can also be used in a target-centric fashion.</s><s>For example, 19 drugs inhibited CHEK1 binding, many of which are not designated CHEK1 inhibitors.</s></p><p><s>Although the designated CHEK1 inhibitor AZD-7762 was very potent (K d app of 5 nM), a low CATDS score at all concentrations showed that there are many other potent targets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2B</ref>).</s><s>Attributing cellular effects to the inhibition of CHEK1 would therefore often be difficult.</s><s>Two other designated CHEK1 inhibitors, PF-477736 and SCH-900776, were similarly potent (K d app of 0.2 nM and11 nM, respectively) but showed improved selectivity at concentrations of approximately 10 nM.</s><s>Rabusertib was also similarly potent (K d app of 43 nM), but had no off-targets in our assay.</s><s>This drug is by far the most selective CHEK1 inhibitor in the panel and may therefore be the best current chemical probe for this protein.</s></p><p><s>Another interesting and unexpected finding was that the target spectrum and potency of prodrugs and their active metabolites varied considerably (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S4F</ref>).</s><s>Fasudil had many more targets than the active metabolite Hydroxyfasudil <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, the VEGFR/SRC prodrug TG-100801 had far fewer and less potent targets than the active drug TG-100572.</s><s>The active metabolites of the SYK inhibitor Fostamatinib and the Aurora drug Barasertib had very different kinase binding profiles compared to the precursor molecules.</s><s>All of the above shows that in order to understand the mechanisms by which a clinical drug exerts an effect in vivo, careful target deconvolution of the inhibitor, the formulation and the metabolites should generally be performed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional targets for established drugs</head><p><s>As expected, the vast majority of compounds interacted with protein/lipid kinases but the study also revealed binding to seven metabolic kinases, 19 other nucleotide binders, five FAD binders, and the heme binding enzyme FECH (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3A</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>These unanticipated interactions may lead to desired consequences, but can also represent mechanisms of drug toxicity.</s><s>A survey of the scientific and patent literature (Pubmed, Scifinder, ChEMBL) revealed that many of the 243 drugs investigated in this study are surprisingly poorly characterized with regard to their target space or bioactivities.</s><s>At the time of writing, &gt;110,000 publications were listed in PubMed, &gt;90,000 publications and &gt;47,000 patents in SciFinder and &gt;2,400 bioactivities in ChEMBL (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>More than 50% of all publications in PubMed or SciFinder were covered by just five drugs (Rapamycin, Imatinib, Sorafenib, Gefitinib and Erlotinib).</s><s>While structure based searches identified patents for all compounds in Scifinder, 17 drugs had no PubMed entry at all (4 for SciFinder publications), 35 drugs had no listed bioactivity in ChEMBL and 70 drugs had fewer than 10 publications in PubMed (50 such cases for SciFinder).</s><s>This is very noteworthy as all of these molecules have been tested in humans.</s><s>As a result, this study reports on a large number of novel molecular interactions and off-targets not previously covered by the scientific literature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3B</ref>;
