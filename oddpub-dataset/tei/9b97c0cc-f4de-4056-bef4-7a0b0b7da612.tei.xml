immunoblot, and additionally a pan-hGBP antibody that recognized hGBPs 1, 2, 3 and 5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>While we could not overexpress hGBP4, this family member is least identical to hGBP1 so we are confident the antibody will not cross react.</s><s>We show that A549 cells express GBPs including hGBP1 at steady state level and further upregulate the protein in response to IFNγ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further characterize this newly generated anti-hGBP1 antibody, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a

background immunofluorescence intensity.</s><s>In contrast, parental A549 cells showed a robust increase in the anti-hGBP1 immunofluorescence signal when primed with IFNγ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>), demonstrating that anti-hGBP1 specifically detects endogenous hGBP1 in situ.</s></p><p><s>Having confirmed the specificity of the anti-hGBP1 antibody we asked whether hGBP1 associated with PVs.</s><s>To do so, we infected IFNγ-primed A549 cells with three representative vacuolar pathogens.</s><s>Immunofluorescent microscopy showed that hGBP1 does not recruit around the PVs formed by C. trachomatis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), S. typhimurium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) or Toxoplasma (Fig. <ref type="figure"

target="#fig_1">S2A to C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In order to associate with membranes hGBPs first transition into an active GTP-bound state and following hydrolysis hGBPs in the GDP-bound state form tetramers that can attach to membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Syguda et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore considered that the anti-hGBP1 antibody failed to detect hGBP1 in the active, membrane-associated state.</s><s>To test for this, we ectopically expressed hGBP1 N-terminally fused to mCherry.</s><s>We observed that mCherry-hGBP1 heterologously expressed in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) localized to Toxoplasma PVs (Fig <ref type="figure">S3A</ref>).</s><s>Staining with anti-hGBP1 overlapped with the mCherry-hGBP1 signal showing that anti-hGBP1 can detect hGBP1 in its active, membrane-associated state and indicating that hGBP1 fails to associate with PVs in human A549 cells.</s><s>We stained IFNγ induced MEFs with anti-hGBP1 to ensure our antibody did not overlap with mGBPs at the PV (Fig <ref type="figure">S3B</ref>).</s><s>Last, we expressed mCherry-hGBP1 in A549 cells and failed to observe any association of mCherry-hGBP1 Toxoplasma PVs (data not shown), further corroborating our finding that in striking contrast to mGBP1 and 2, hGBP1 is not recruited to intact vacuolar membranes of intracellular pathogens in infected human cells.</s><s>hGBP1 restricts Toxoplasma, but not the intravacuolar bacterial pathogens C. trachomatis and S. typhimurium As the subcellular location of hGBP1 was not consistent with observations made with mGBPs and the roles they play during intracellular pathogen infection, we were interested to determine whether hGBP1 could still play a role in controlling these particular infections.</s><s>We assessed the ability of the pathogens to replicate in the absence of hGBP1 in comparison to their wild-type cells.</s><s>For C. trachomatis and S. typhimurium infections, inclusion forming unit (IFU) or colony forming unit (CFU) assays were employed, respectively, in the presence or absence of IFNγ.</s><s>Priming cells with IFNγ restricted the replication and growth of both C. trachomatis and S. typhimurium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A and B</ref>).</s><s>However, the ability of bacteria to sustain themselves via replication in the presence or absence of immune pressure was the same regardless of the presence of hGBP1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A and B</ref>).</s><s>We then determined whether Toxoplasma replication was influenced by the absence of hGBP1.</s><s>We compared the capacity of the parasite to replicate and form plaques in fibroblasts after an initial infection in A549 cells primed or not with IFNγ.</s><s>Type I or type II Toxoplasma were incubated in A549 cells for 6 h, a time period too short for replication to occur, meaning potential differences in plaque number would be a result of parasite killing or early restriction.</s><s>Twice as many type II Toxoplasma were able to survive when the infection took place in ΔhGBP1 cells, while type I parasites remained unaffected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>Intriguingly, this was still true in cells that were not primed with IFNγ.</s><s>An immunoblot confirmed the presence of hGBP1 even at basal steady state level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>In accordance, the number of viable Toxoplasma parasites was largely reduced to levels seen in parental A549 cells when ΔhGBP1 A549 cells were complemented with hGBP1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>Thus hGBP1 does not restrict replication of the bacterial pathogens C. trachomatis and S. typhimurium, but does promote restriction of type II Toxoplasma.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>hGBP1 mediates early replication of Toxoplasma infection</head><p><s>As we determined that Toxoplasma underwent early restriction by hGBP1, our next move was to identify the stage at which parasites were limited.</s><s>We excluded differential invasion as a reason for the enhanced recovery of parasites from ΔhGBP1 cells.</s><s>FACS analysis of A549 cells infected with fluorescent parasites showed that regardless of genotype of the cell, type II parasites invaded around 50% of A549 cells when an MOI of 4 was used (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>).</s><s>Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to ensure that individual cells of each genotype were infected with low and equivalent numbers of parasites (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).</s><s>We used immunofluorescence microscopy to assess the early replication status of Toxoplasma in A549 cells.</s><s>At 24 h post infection (hpi) it was evident that ΔhGBP1 cells contained more vacuoles filled with 2 or more parasites than coisogenic wildtype cells did (Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref>).</s><s>By counting the number of parasites per vacuole over an infection time course, we quantified the replication efficiency of Toxoplasma (Fig. <ref type="figure">3D</ref>).</s><s>At 12hpi significantly more vacuoles contained parasites that had replicated once in the ΔhGBP1 cells as compared to the wild-type counterpart, regardless of IFNγ priming.</s><s>By 18hpi, numbers of vacuoles containing 2 or 4 parasites, indicating 1 or 2 replication cycles, respectively, were significantly increased in the IFNγ primed ΔhGBP1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3D</ref>).</s><s>Finally, counts taken at 24 h show a significantly increased number of vacuoles that hold parasites that have undertaken 3 or more replication cycles in the IFNγ primed ΔhGBP1 A549 cells.</s></p><p><s>Our observations suggest that hGBP1 can delay the onset of parasite replication.</s><s>We concluded that type II Toxoplasma is restricted early after invasion in A549 cells by a yet unknown mechanism driven by hGBP1 without the protein targeting to the vacuole.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We find that hGBP1 mediates an initial attenuation of type II Toxoplasma early post-infection, without impacting subsequent replication of Toxoplasma, C. trachomatis or S. typhimurium in human epithelial cells.</s><s>The observed early Toxoplasma attenuation is not because of a defect in parasite invasion in the presence versus absence of hGBP1.</s><s>Rather, we hypothesize that hGBP1 either mediates early killing or slows down early replication of the parasite, as at 12, 18 and 24hpi the ΔhGBP1 cells contain significantly more parasites that have undergone replication.</s><s>To our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating that an IFN-inducible GTPase can restrict growth of an intracellular PV-resident pathogen independently of any detectable association of the GTPase with the PV itself.</s></p><p><s>Cell-autonomous restriction pathways for intracellular pathogens driven by host resistance proteins often see the protein localize to PVs.</s><s>For example, ubiquitin-driven autophagy and galectin-mediated control of Salmonella relies on a pathogen-localization step of ubiquitin and galectin <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Perrin et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Thurston et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally in mouse, Immunity Related GTPases (IRGs) and

2006)</ref>.</s><s>We clearly define that endogenous hGBP1 is not targeted to C. trachomatis, S. typhimurium or Toxoplasma.</s><s>We do, however, show that hGBP1 possesses the ability to recruit to Toxoplasma PVs when heterologously expressed in mouse fibroblasts (Fig. <ref type="figure">S3A</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that human cells lack a cellular for the delivery of GBPs to PVs that is present in mouse cells.</s><s>In support of this model, we recently demonstrated that the translocation of mGBP1 and mGBP2 to PVs in mouse cells requires GKS proteins, a subset of IRG protein found in mouse but not in human cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Haldar et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it appears likely that the deficiency of hGBP1 recruitment to PVs in human cells is due in part to the absence of GKS encoding genes from the human genome.</s></p><p><s>Conflicting reports attributed hGBPs to have a function in intracellular C. trachomatis, but not Toxoplasma control in non-hematopoietic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Tietzel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ohshima et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Both reports find hGBPs localized to PVs 24hpi.</s><s>Reduction of bacterial inclusions upon ectopic expression of hGBP1 and 2 was observed in HeLa cells.</s><s>Curiously the demonstrated localization of hGBP1 is observed for wild type, GTPase-deficient and helicaldomain-only protein.</s><s>We, and others, have previously shown that GTPase-activity deficient mouse GBP1 does not recruit to PVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Virreira Winter et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>It is conceivable that detecting overexpressed hGBP1 with antibody staining presents with different results than detection of endogenous hGBP1.</s><s>Equally, overexpressed hGBP1 might exert a different effect than endogenous hGBP1 and HeLa cells may present with a different restriction pathway than other epithelial cells.</s></p><p><s>Ohshima et al. successfully knocked out the entire GBP locus in haploid fibroblast-like human cancer cells, with the resulting cells showing no defect in IFNγ-induced cellautonomous control of Toxoplasma at 24hpi.</s><s>The early restriction of the parasite by hGBP1 we observe may have been missed or may not exist in fibroblasts.</s><s>They also demonstrate that a low percentage of Toxoplasma PVs were decorated with hGBPs at 6hpi.</s><s>The staining was carried out using an antibody against hGBP1-5, so it is conceivable that the protein present at that location comprises another family member(s).</s><s>In contrast to our findings, hGBP1 has been shown to localize to the bacterial inclusion in THP1 macrophages and restrict C. trachomatis as demonstrated by shRNA knockdown <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Zeer et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>It remains to be investigated if human GBPs can localize to PVs of other pathogens in macrophages.</s><s>Combined with our results, this leads us to speculate that hGBP1 may restrict select pathogens in a cell type-and localization-dependent manner.</s></p><p><s>hGBPs are highly upregulated in all stages of infection with intracellular pathogens and are often found in transcriptional analysis of patient samples.</s><s>Combined with knowledge acquired from murine studies, it is almost certain that hGBPs have an impact on the control of these infections.</s><s>We find that hGBP1 plays a role in mediating early restriction of Toxoplasma soon after infection without directly localizing to the pathogen.</s><s>Previous definitions of how this host restriction factor family is acting against vacuolar intracellular pathogens were reliant on the protein being present at the vacuole.</s><s>Clearly, we have to rethink this rather simplistic assessment as a proxy for potential functions especially for the human GBPs.</s><s>Early restriction of pathogens directly after invasion is the first step a cell takes to combat the invading foreign agent.</s><s>These early restriction mechanisms have to act in a rapid and precise manner in order to start the cascade of intracellular defense mechanisms.</s><s>Because hGBP1 is expressed at steady state level and we observe its defense activity even in absense of interferon priming, it most likely interacts with and directs specific cellular machineries that do not require induction.</s><s>Future work will elucidate the mechanism by which hGBP1 can mediate early restriction of Toxoplasma.</s></p></div>
