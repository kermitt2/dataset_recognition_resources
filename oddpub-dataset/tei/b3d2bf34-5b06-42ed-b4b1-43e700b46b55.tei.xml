<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient characteristics</head><p><s>Between July 2011 and December 2012, 160 patients were randomized.</s><s>The two treatment arms were well balanced with regard to baseline demographics and disease characteristics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>More patients in the combination arm had received chemotherapy as their last treatment (27.8% versus 17.3%).</s><s>Approximately onethird of patients in both the arms had received prior SSA therapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment exposure</head><p><s>All but one patient in the combination arm and all patients in the everolimus arm received study treatment (the one patient was randomized but had an abnormal postrandomization electrocardiogram, and was not treated).</s><s>At the time of data cutoff (2 April 2014), treatment was ongoing in 19 patients (24%) in the combination arm versus 18 patients (22%) in the everolimus arm.</s><s>The main reasons for discontinuation of treatment were disease progression, adverse events (AEs), or withdrawal of consent (CONSORT diagram, supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online).</s><s>The median duration of exposure to everolimus was 49.4 weeks in the combination arm and 48.3 weeks in the everolimus arm.</s><s>The median duration of pasireotide LAR exposure was 52.1 weeks.</s><s>Dose interruption or reduction was more frequent in the combination arm (see supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online).</s><s>The median (range) relative dose intensity of everolimus in the combination arm was 0.78 (0.26-1.00) and in the monotherapy arm was 0.98 (0.19-1.00).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p><s>The median PFS [95% confidence interval (CI)] was similar between the two arms: 16.8 (12.1-19.6)</s><s>months versus <ref type="bibr">16.6 (11.1-19.5</ref>)</s><s>months in the combination arm versus everolimus arm, respectively (HR, 0.991; 95% CI, 0.636-1.543)</s><s>(Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>No differences in OS were observed, with a median follow-up of 22.6 months (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</s><s>While sixteen patients (20%) in the combination arm and five patients (6%) in the everolimus arm experienced PR, the total number of patients who experienced tumor shrinkage was similar in both the arms (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) as was the overall DCR (CR þ PR þ SD; 77% in the combination arm versus 83% in the monotherapy arm).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Soluble biomarkers</head><p><s>Patients on combination therapy had a rapid and sustained decrease from baseline in IGF-1, IGF-2, and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) levels by 72%, 21%, and 37%, respectively, after 12 weeks.</s><s>No consistent decrease in these markers was observed in patients treated with everolimus monotherapy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>).</s><s>IGFBP2 levels increased in patients on everolimus and pasireotide combination therapy (by 85% at the beginning of cycle 4), but remained unchanged in the everolimus monotherapy arm.</s><s>Among the biomarkers evaluated at day 1 of cycle 4, the decrease from baseline for CgA, NSE, IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-3 was larger in the combination arm compared with the everolimus arm (supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>, available at Annals of Oncology online).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p><s>AEs observed in the study were consistent with the known safety profiles of both the drugs (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>AEs of any grade were reported in 78% versus 81% of patients, and grade 3 or 4 AEs were reported in 77% versus 69% of patients in the combination and monotherapy arms, respectively.</s><s>Grade 4 drug-related AEs were infrequent and were reported in one patient, in each arm.</s></p><p><s>A higher incidence of hyperglycemia, diabetes, and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was observed in the combination arm.</s><s>Postbaseline shift in HbA1c to !9% (from &lt;7% of HbA1c at baseline) was observed in 23% of patients receiving combination therapy versus 5% of patients on monotherapy.</s><s>Rates of diarrhea, stomatitis, abdominal discomfort, and pneumonitis were similar.</s><s>Cardiac events, including syncope, QT-prolongation, loss of consciousness, ventricular fibrillation, were observed in four patients (5%) in combination arm and five patients (6%) in monotherapy arm.</s><s>The proportion of patients requiring !1 dose reduction or dose interruption was higher in combination arm versus monotherapy arm (53% versus 36% and 65% versus 56%, respectively).</s></p><p><s>Four of the six deaths in the combination arm and five of the nine deaths in the everolimus arm were attributable to underlying cancer or disease progression.</s><s>Overall, three deaths were suspected to be treatment related (ketoacidosis and sepsis in the combination arm; pulmonary embolism in the everolimus arm).</s></p></div>
