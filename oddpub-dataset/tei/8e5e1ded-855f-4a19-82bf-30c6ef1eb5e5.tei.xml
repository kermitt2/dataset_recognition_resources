may offer more insight to the development of PTOA.</s><s>Since ACLR is a known risk factor for PTOA, ACL reconstructed knees may develop similar kinematics as idiopathic OA but at a faster rate.</s><s>Shin et al.  showed that subjects with idiopathic OA had medial CA's that were 75-90 mm 2 larger compared to healthy subjects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Also, Subburaj et al. observed similar CA differences as well as a more posterior positioning of CP in idiopathic OA subjects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>Interestingly, in ACL deficient knees and

pathophysiology of PTOA development.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of cartilage-tocartilage contact area is comparable to the established

after injury.</s></p><p><s>Since healthy bilateral knees should have almost identical alignments, we reason that a reliable method is one with margins of error that is below what was detected as the difference between left and right healthy knees.</s><s>A similar study method performed previously found that the CP difference between healthy knees had a standard deviation of 1.1 mm at extension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>Thus, we believe that any deviation more than that can be due to pathology in the knee.</s><s>We were unable to find reported reproducibility information

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study aimed to establish a method to reliably measure and track changes in tibiofemoral cartilage CA and CP in ACL injured and subsequently reconstructed patients over a period of 2 years using T 2 weighted FSE MRI.</s><s>The intra-and inter-user ICC's met standard thresholds of data analysis studies, which consider &gt;0.9 to be excellent reliability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref></s><s>Thus, CA and CP can be measured by outlining cartilage contact region on sagittal MRI images with reproducible results.</s><s>Moreover, our CP intra-and inter-user average absolute differences were below 1.1 mm, which was the detected standard deviation between opposite healthy knees reported by other studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>reover, we believe that our method measures the tibiofemoral cartilage contact more precisely compared to 3D models using fluoroscopic methods as it directly extrapolated from MR images of in vivo knee joints under weight.</s><s>A number of 3D cartilage models defined cartilage-to-cartilage contact points based on surface intersections, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> but, these models did not consider the cartilage morphology changes under strain and weight bearing, which can alter the amount of cartilage contact. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s>Our current method derived the contact region from direct visualization under dynamic loading, which may describe a more accurate area of the tibiofemoral cartilage contact.</s><s>This direct visualization also enabled us to consider the irregularities of the contact area to discern a centroid position that may better describe the region where the knee bears the most weight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>r findings partially supported our second hypothesis that the CA and CP in the injured knee will change after ACLR compared to pre-surgical (baseline) measurements.</s><s>The lack of significant longitudinal changes in medial or lateral CA and CP between baseline and 6 month after surgery suggests that ACLR did not correct tibiofemoral contact region abnormalities developed after injury.</s><s>Thus, altered load bearing on tibial cartilage may continue to be present even after ACLR.</s><s>Given that the medial CA was significantly smaller in the injured knee compared to the contralateral knee at both baseline and 6 months, it is possible that load was more concentrated on particular sections of the cartilage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref></s><s>This increased pressure on cartilage that may not be adapted to sustain increased load could damage the integrity of the articular cartilage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref></s><s>ough not statistically significant, we also found that the medial CA of the injured knee had an increasing trend at one year compared to 6 months.</s><s>A possible reason for the increase may be an increased compressibility of the articular cartilage.</s><s>Studies have shown that idiopathic OA knees with cartilage degeneration lose cartilage stiffness and increase compression compliance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref></s><s>It is possible that ACLR knees are exhibiting increased cartilage compressibility at 1 year after surgery to result in an enlarge CA under loading.</s></p><p><s>Since normal knee loading is mostly concentrated on the medial side, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> it was not surprising that the lateral CA of the injured knee did not differ significantly from the non-injured knee at the time of injury and 6 months after ACLR.</s><s>Beyond the initial 6 months, quadriceps weakness after ACLR had been seen to be related to joint space narrowing, which may increase the cartilage contact on the lateral side. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref></s><s>Tourville et al. also found significant joint space narrowing in patients who had deficient knee extension strength after ACL injury and reconstruction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref></s><s>This may explain why risk of lateral cartilage loss doubles 1 year after ACL injury regardless of surgical intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref></s><s>However, increases in lateral CA can also be partly attributed to the fact that a subset of subjects also underwent partial lateral meniscectomy.</s><s>Since partial meniscectomies are known to also change the articular cartilage and knee biomechanics, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> we cannot definitively discern the primary cause for the CA increase.</s></p><p><s>We also found that injured knees had more posteriorly positioned medial CP on the tibial surface compared to corresponding non-injured knees.</s><s>This is consistent with previous studies that investigated tibiofemoral contact area after ACLR. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref></s><s>Coupled with longitudinally increasing medial CA, the posterior medial tibia may have abnormal stress, possibly resulting in the wearing of the cartilage surface.</s><s>It is known that cartilage topography varies on the tibial surface. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref></s><s>Moreover, Li et al. showed that healthy cartilage contact points are often in regions with thicker cartilage, which can decrease the contact stress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref></s><s>Thus, changes to the position and size of the tibiofemoral cartilage contact can place stress on vulnerable cartilage regions that are not meant for bearing load and cause degeneration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref></s><s> unexpected finding was that the medial CP of the non-injured knee was more posterior 2 years after ACLR compared to baseline.</s><s>It appeared that the injured knee's abnormal kinematics is influencing the non-injured knee.</s><s>Subjects were perhaps favoring the noninjured knee more after ACLR, and using it in a different manner than before.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> Our last hypothesis that early changes in CA and CP are related to cartilage degeneration later on was only partially confirmed and in an unexpected manner.</s><s>Since a more posterior medial CP provides a direct explanation for cartilage wearing in the posterior tibial plateau, we were surprised to find that subjects with more anterior medial CP at 6 months had worse cartilage health in the posterior medial tibial plateau at 1 year as seen in T 1ρ and T 2 measures.</s><s>Our data showed a large range of CP at 6 months, suggesting some subjects may have large, clinically relevant changes, while others do not; and its significant correlation with T 1ρ (and T 2 reaching significance) at 1 year could suggest that anterior CP at 6 months was a possible predictor for worse cartilage health at 1 year.</s><s>This study has some limitations.</s><s>First, we had limited power (ranged 0.41-0.68)</s><s>due to our small sample size.</s><s>Thus, the statistically significant findings may not be clinically significant.</s><s>Also, the non-injured contralateral knee may not be the most ideal control, since it would not account for inherent knee characteristics that could increase the chance of ACL injury and PTOA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Thus, similarities between injured and non-injured knees cannot be truly defined as being "normal."</s><s>However, using non-injured knees can account for between subject variations to provide more robust longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons.</s><s>Moreover, this study used static loaded MRI, which is not a complete true representation of walking or other more complex motions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref></s><s>However, it is very difficult to take accurate motion MRI measurements due to decreased resolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref></s><s>Instead, we scanned the knees at extension to capture them at midstance with loading in attempt to simulate the natural weight bearing aspect of walking.</s><s>Our CA measurements were also derived from segmentations from the sagittal plane alone, where the medial and lateral borders of the CA could be affect by volume averaging.</s><s>Also, the CP analyzed in this study is limited to the anterior-posterior axis, which neglects the medial-lateral changes that influence cartilage degeneration.</s><s>The cartilage contact area changes can be additionally examined by scanning the knee at various knee flexion angles, which were not characterized in this study.</s><s>Additionally, the current algorithm allowed only the evaluation of tibiofemoral contact biomechanics and we did not investigate concurrent changes in other areas such as femoral patella contact, which could also inform contact changes and will be explored in the future.</s><s>Lastly, we could only achieve an accuracy of up to 10 mm 2 due to our slice thickness of 1.5 mm.</s><s>Thus, measurements may be improved by the use of coronal images and decreasing our slice thickness.</s></p><p><s>Overall, altered CA and CP after ACL injury and reconstruction may be readily measured and assessed using quantitative MR techniques.</s><s>Our study suggests that changes in CP may represent some of the possible mechanical factors that lead to PTOA.</s><s>However, it is difficult to conclude exactly how these alterations are affecting the articular cartilage.</s><s>It appears that factors additional to the CA and CP are contributing to the cartilage wear.</s><s>Nonetheless, our ability to reliably measure contact area provides the opportunity to advance the investigation into the influence of cartilage contact area and centroid position on PTOA development.</s><s>As subjects return for their 3 year follow up, we will continue to monitor the effects of acute ACL injury despite reconstruction and see how our current CA and CP results will correlate with the cohort's future cartilage health.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</s><s>Table <ref
