<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chronic infection limits a secondary antiviral immune response</head><p><s>To determine the effect of a chronic infection on the suppression of the adaptive immune system, we infected C57BL/6 mice with LCMV strain Docile 30 days before superinfection with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).</s><s>We infected another group of C57BL/6 mice with VSV alone to serve as controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>).</s><s>We measured the production of VSV-neutralizing antibodies in the serum at various time points.</s><s>We found that chronic infection with LCMV Docile blunted the induction of total neutralizing antibodies (IgM and IgG) and of neutralizing IgG against VSV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>).</s><s>This shows that chronic infection can lead to suppression of the activity of the adaptive immune system against a secondary viral infection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enforced viral replication is blunted in chronically infected mice</head><p><s>In a previous study we found that enforced viral replication is essential for activating adaptive immunity and producing neutralizing antibodies against VSV <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>We questioned whether chronic infection may influence the mechanism of enforced viral replication.</s><s>To study this hypothesis, we infected mice with LCMV-Docile for 30 days.</s><s>Mice were then superinfected with VSV for 7 h, and the viral titer in spleen and inguinal lymph nodes was determined.</s><s>Control mice were infected with VSV alone.</s><s>VSV replication was lower in mice infected with LCMV-Docile than in control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The reduction of VSV replication by chronic LCMV infection was additionally assessed by immunohistological staining of spleen sections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether this immunosuppression was due to the inhibition of enforced viral replication, we used VSV that had been inactivated with UV light to immunized naive mice and mice with chronic LCMV infection.</s><s>Both groups of mice exhibited similar titers of total neutralizing and IgGneutralizing antibodies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>), a finding suggesting that B cells can still produce antibodies during chronic infection.</s><s>These findings suggest that the persistence of LCMV infection could inhibit enforced viral replication of the superinfected virus.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CD8 + T cells do not prevent immunosuppression during chronic infection</head><p><s>Next, we questioned whether this suppression of the B-cell response was due to CD8 + T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity during  chronic LCMV infection.</s><s>To answer this question, we infected perforin-deficient mice (Prf −/− ) with LCMV-Docile, and 30 days later we superinfected them with VSV.</s><s>A control group of Prf −/− mice was infected with VSV alone.</s><s>Perforin is the primary cytotoxic effector protein in CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>We found that Prf −/− mice infected with chronic LCMV and then superinfected with VSV exhibit a much more impaired B-cell response than do Prf −/− mice infected with VSV alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3A</ref>).</s><s>Superinfected Prf −/− mice also exhibited an inhibition in VSV replication similar to that of coinfected WT mice (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2B and 3B</ref>).</s><s>These findings exclude a cytotoxic role of CD8 + T cells in immunosuppression and suggest that another perforin-independent mechanism leads to immunosuppression during chronic LCMV infection.</s><s>In order to completely exclude the role of CD8 + T cells and not only perforin-mediated cytotoxic effect, we infected MHC-I-deficient mice with LCMV-Docile, and after 30 days we superinfected them with VSV.</s><s>As control, we infected MHC-I-deficient mice only with VSV.</s><s>Similar to Prf −/− mice, deletion of MHC-I did not prevent the immunosuppression induced by chronic LCMV-Docile infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3C</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, superinfected MHC-I −/− mice showed an inhibition in VSV replication similar to superinfected WT mice (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2B  and 3D</ref>).</s><s>We conclude that CD8 + T cells are not involved in the immunosuppression.</s></p><p><s>Persistent viral infection can also occur if newborn mice are infected with virus.</s><s>In this case, central tolerance is induced against the virus, and virus-specific T cells are deleted <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we questioned whether even with the deletion of LCMVspecific T cells, the immunosuppression and blunting of viral replication during neonatal infection is taking place.</s><s>We therefore infected neonatal mice with LCMV-Docile and then superinfected them with VSV.</s><s>As controls, another group of C57BL/6 mice was infected with VSV alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3E</ref>).</s><s>After superinfection with VSV, VSV replication was blunted in mice infected with LCMV as neonates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3F</ref>).</s><s>In addition, mice infected as neonates exhibited a slight reduction in the titers of total neutralizing antibody (IgM and IgG) and a massive reduction in the titers of neutralizing IgG against VSV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3G</ref>).</s><s>These findings led us to conclude that enforced viral replication is also blunted in mice infected as neonates, a conclusion that can explain the reduction in the adaptive immune response after secondary viral infection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prolonged activity of type I IFN inhibits enforced viral replication during chronic infection</head><p><s>Chronic LCMV infection leads to prolonged type I IFN responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>.</s><s>We hypothesized that enhanced type I IFN responses would then induce an antiviral status via Oas1 and Mx1, which render APCs resistant to viral replication.</s><s>We measured gene expression in spleens stimulated with type I IFN during chronic LCMV infection and compared it with gene expression under naïve conditions.</s><s>Indeed, we found that the expression of Stat1, Irf7, Oas1, and Mx1 was higher during chronic infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, chronically infected mice exhibited stronger expression of Ifnα4 and Ifnβ1 than did uninfected mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether mice infected with LCMV as neonates also exhibit stronger type I IFN signaling and higher type I IFN expression, we measured the expression of these genes.</s><s>As expected, mice infected as neonates exhibit sustained type I IFN activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether this prolonged type I IFN activity can inhibit the enforced viral replication of VSV, we infected WT mice with LCMV-Docile and after 30 days we treated them with anti-IFN-αR1 or isotype control antibody.</s><s>Afterward, we superinfected them with VSV.</s><s>Immunohistological staining of spleen sections showed higher replication of VSV in superinfected WT  mice that were treated with anti-IFN-αR1 antibody in comparison to control WT mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4C</ref>).</s><s>This replication was comparable to WT mice that were infected only with VSV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>).</s><s>To demonstrate that VSV replication in the absence of the type I IFN effect is sufficient to stimulate the adaptive immune system during chronic infection, we treated LCMV-Docile-infected mice with anti-IFN-αR1 antibody before superinfection with VSV and measured the production of VSV-neutralizing antibodies.</s><s>Indeed, blocking of IFN-αR1 prevented immunosuppression and mice showed normal production of neutralizing antibodies comparing to control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4D</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, we used mice doubledeficient in Irf3 and Irf7 (Irf3 −/− × Irf7 −/− ), which exhibit a defect in the production of type I IFN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Irf3 −/− × Irf7 −/− mice are less susceptible to death after infection with VSV than  Ifnar −/− mice.</s><s>We infected Irf3 −/− × Irf7 −/− mice with LCMV-Docile and superinfected 30 days later with VSV.</s><s>The production of neutralizing antibodies against VSV was comparable to that in WT mice that had been infected with VSV alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4E</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we concluded that chronic viral infection inhibits enforced viral replication by inducing antiviral effector genes.</s><s>The absence of enforced viral replication limits the adaptive immune response.</s></p><p><s>In our previous work we found that naive CD169 + macrophages exhibit higher expression of Usp18 than do F4/80 + macrophages, and this increase in expression guarantees enforced viral replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>We then questioned why Usp18 expression in CD169 + macrophages could not guarantee VSV replication during chronic LCMV infection.</s><s>We sorted CD169 + macrophages from naive mice and from mice chronically infected with LCMV (Supporting Information Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and compared the expression of type I IFN-induced genes by these macrophages with their expression by naive CD169 + macrophages.</s><s>We found a slight increase in Usp18 expression after chronic LCMV infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4F</ref>) but a substantial increase in the expression type I IFN-induced genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4F</ref>).</s><s>This finding explains the blunting of enforced viral replication in these cells during chronic infection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we found that constant antiviral action of type I IFN during chronic infection inhibits the enforced viral replication of a secondary viral infection in specific APCs, such as CD169 + macrophages.</s><s>The resulting reduction in the level of the antigen limits the activation of the adaptive immune responses against the secondary viral pathogen and consequently leads to immune failure independent of CD8 + T cells.</s><s>Earlier studies showed that immunosuppression is due to cytotoxic CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26]</ref>.</s><s>The conclusion was that immunopathological LCMVspecific CD8 + T cells mediate the elimination of LCMV-specific and LCMV-nonspecific infected B cells, and that this elimination prevents the reaction of the immune system against a secondary infection.</s><s>In the present study we found that early enforced viral replication, which is essential for the activation of the adaptive immune system, is absent in chronically infected mice.</s></p><p><s>As we showed in a previous study, CD169 + macrophages are essential for enforced viral replication of VSV, and this replica-tion guarantees the activation of the adaptive immune system and the control of the virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Protecting CD169 + macrophages from the cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells in Pfr −/− mice or MHC-I −/− mice did not abrogate either immunosuppression or the reduction in viral replication.</s><s>Moreover, central deletion of LCMVspecific CD8 + T cells in mice infected as neonates did not prevent immunosuppression, and enforced viral replication was blunted in these mice.</s><s>Taken together, these findings exclude the hypothesis that CD8 + T cells cause a general immunosuppression in chronically infected mice.</s><s>However, the prolonged activity of type I IFN during chronic viral infection inhibits the enforced viral replication of a secondary virus and, consequently, inhibits an important mechanism of efficient antigen presentation and activation of the adaptive immune system.</s><s>In the end, chronic infection leads not to immunosuppression but rather to chronic activation of the immune system.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the results presented here may change our understanding of the reaction of the immune system during chronic infection.</s><s>Indeed, the failure to generate adaptive immune responses is not due to immunosuppression.</s><s>Rather, the adaptive immune response is overwhelmed by the ongoing activation of the innate immune system.</s><s>This condition prevents the secondary virus from replicating efficiently and, in the end, eliminates the virus before it can achieve specific activation of the adaptive immune system.</s><s>This mechanism may explain why some chronically infected patients do not respond to vaccination.</s><s>However, additional studies examining the importance of enforced viral replication in achieving successful vaccination are needed.</s></p></div>
