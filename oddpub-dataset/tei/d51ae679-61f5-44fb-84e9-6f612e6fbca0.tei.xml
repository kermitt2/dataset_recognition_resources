of the glutamate and the water protons and the measurement is at least 100 times more sensitive than the traditional 1H MRS method <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr"

in rats with NMDAinduced spasms can be screened with GluCEST imaging with high spatial resolution during acute periods.</s><s>GluCEST mapping showed significantly increased glutamate in cortex and hippocampus at P15 after multiple rounds of spasms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), which suggests that the cortex is one of the major brain area of hyperexcitation by the NMDAinduced spasms.</s></p><p><s>Our in vivo serial neurochemical/microstructural analysis focused on the cingulate cortex in the rat after multiple bouts of spasms.</s><s>The cingulate cortex is a region of the limbic system reciprocally linked to the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and with extensive connections to the critical regions for spasm generation, includ ing the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>In the cingulate cortex, consistent with the findings of GluCEST imag ing, acute elevations in GABA, Glx, tNAA, tCho, and tCr were noted in rats after multiple bouts of NMDAinduced spasms compared with controls (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The glutamate

neuronal metabolism together with the excitatory neurotransmitters in the cingulate cortex may also reflect activation of the cingulate cortex during NMDAinduced spasms in this model.</s></p><p><s>With diffusion tensor imaging, we also identified an acute decrease in MD in the cingulate cortex after three bouts of spasms, which represent the early brain damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>MD is an inverse measure of the membrane density, is sensitive to cellularity, edema, and necrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>MD decrease quickly after injury (first day) in most models studied, which is consistent with our find ing at P16.</s><s>The decrease was explained by the decrease in water diffusion associated with injury such as cellular edema, despite there is still debate on the precise mechanism for the decrease in MD associated with injury.</s><s>Previously postictal decrease of MD was reported in human <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, which is consistent with our finding and probably reflects neuronal swelling by excitotoxic injury in the brain areas involved in seizure.</s></p><p><s>In addition to these acute changes associated with spasms, in vivo MR imaging enables us to perform a longitudinal follow up of neurometabolic and microstructural alterations in rats with NMDAtriggered spasms.</s><s>NMDA is an excitatory amino acid that can cause neuronal death and glial activation is well observed in kainic acid animal model and tissues of patients with chronic epilepsy <ref

NMDAinduced seizures in young animals also reported no gross morphological changes on pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>Consistently with this finding, FA, a gross measure of microstructural integ rity marker that is less specific to the type of injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, is not affected in every time point of this study.</s></p><p><s>In the cingulate cortices of the juvenile rats with NMDA induced spasms (P30), tNAA, Tau, and MM + lipids were sig nificantly decreased with a significant reduction in MD.</s><s>We also found decreased expression of neuronal, astrocyte, and myelina tion markers after NMDAinduced spasms in these rats.</s><s>These findings suggest the different mechanism of injury during infancy compared to that of the adulthood.</s><s>Instead of cell death or gliosis after excitatory injury, the developmental process of their brain, active protein synthesis and cell proliferation, may be involved.</s><s>These pathologic changes are also in line with a significant reduc tion in neuronal markers, NAA, and Tau and markers of myelin production and substructural components such as MMs and lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>, as well as the reduced MD reflecting decreased membrane density and cellularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous research into epilepsy has already shown the typi cal developmental pattern of neurometabolites in both a rodent model <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> and in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>NMDAtriggered spasms signifi cantly impaired this timedependent neurometabolic develop mental pattern of Glx, Tau, tNAA, MM + lipids, and total choline (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>These combined alterations in neurometabolites and structural maturation markers in this animal model indicate the compromised development of the cingulate cortex follow ing NMDAtriggered spasms.</s><s>Also, the decrease of all proteins examined can be explained by a decrease in protein synthesis during the critical brain development after NMDAtriggered spasms.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, decreased exploratory behaviors in the periph eral areas and increased freezing activities to conditioned sound and light stimuli were also observed in our study group that suffered from NMDAinduced spasms.</s><s>Other behavioral disrup tions were found in previous studies with similar models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s><s>Considering the widespread reduction in neuronal metabolites in neurodevelopmental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> and a positive correlation between motor skill learning and myelination <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, the pathologi cal changes in the brain might explain these behavioral changes.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, NMDAinduced spasms during infancy lead to timedependent neurochemical and microstructural changes in the cingulate cortex and subsequent pathologic changes during the juvenile period.</s><s>These agedependent alterations in neuro metabolites after NMDAtriggered spasms should be further explored as potential biomarkers of outcomes in human infantile spasms or other epileptic encephalopathies.</s></p></div>
