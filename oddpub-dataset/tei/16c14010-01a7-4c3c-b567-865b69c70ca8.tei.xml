underestimate or overestimate tobacco use prevalence (TP) and tobacco use quantities (TQ) in tobacco consumption.</s><s>For instance, the low prevalence among the oldest age group may be due to higher death rates of smokers among the elderly, leading to the underestimation of tobacco consumption among the oldest age group.</s><s>Secondly, self-reported consumption expenditure may also be underestimated in this study.</s><s>Ideally it might be better to use a per-capita consumption variable using adult equivalent scales rather than number of household members.</s><s>However, numbers of children in household cannot be identified because of the survey design <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51]</ref>.</s><s>Thirdly, owing to data availability, not all factors were included in this study, such as occupation of the respondents and some potential unobservable respondents' characteristics.</s><s>Omission of these factors could lead to biased estimation of the inequality in tobacco consumption.</s><s>Finally, our results also supported the idea that there are multiple, and sometimes even opposite forces that cause social inequalities in tobacco consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Income or consumption often serve as a proxy for socio-economic position, while the concentration index of tobacco consumption based on income or consumption is limited for measuring all socio-economic inequalities in tobacco consumption.</s></p></div>

implying that richer people consumed more tobacco than poorer.</s><s>Furthermore, gender, education attainment, age, area, and economic quantiles were strong predictors of tobacco consumption.</s><s>Both the pattern and magnitude of inequality in tobacco consumption between men and women varied significantly.</s><s>Hence, it is quite necessary to develop gender-specific policies to efficiently reduce tobacco consumption.</s><s>Public health policies need to be targeted towards men of higher economic status with lower educational attainment, as well as divorced or widowed women, especially in urban areas of China.</s><s>The different geographic concentration pattern of tobacco consumption among men and women implied that the control of tobacco consumption among men should be strengthened in south-central and northern regions, while control policies for females' consumption should be strengthened in eastern and northeastern regions.</s></p></div><figure
