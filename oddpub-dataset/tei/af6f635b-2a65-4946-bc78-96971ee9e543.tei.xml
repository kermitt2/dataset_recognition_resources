note the difference in appearance and behavior of such particles compared to broadly used Degussa P25 or colloidal titania of US Research Nanomaterials (Product No US 7070) that are often utilized as standard in biological experiments (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> ).</s><s>The latter particles are relatively large, 30-50 nm, polyhedron-shaped single crystals.</s><s>Sol-gel TNs are approximately 10 times smaller and possess much larger surface area and much higher related chemical reactivity.</s><s>In solution in mother liquor or MilliQ water they remain de-aggregated as can be visualized by DLS, but in biological media easily form aggregates with the size of about 50 nm and bigger (see Supplementary, FS1) that, however can easily be split by sonication to almost the primary size.</s><s>The structure of such aggregate revealed by high-resolution TEM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>) features individual particles randomly set together.</s><s>The analysis of distances between the adjacent fringes (0.35 nm) indicated the anatase phase.</s><s>The EDS analysis features high purity titania (Fig. <ref type="figure"

min.</s><s>The washed and ultrasound treated colloid was pH-neutral (7.0-7.5).</s><s>When the TNs were supplied to the PGPR growth medium, dense and coarse bacterial clumps were formed which were more developed than the clumps formed in a self-produced biofilm (Supplementary FS2).</s><s>The aggregates of TNs were clearly visible on the surface of bacteria in both SEM and AFM images (where the characteristic sizes of 50-60 nm could clearly be traced, (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>The area EDS analysis of the biofilms was showing 7.5% of Ti in average among the

tolerance enhancement, we show that harsh environment strains P. polymyxa A26 and A. faecalis AF induce plant drought stress tolerance.</s><s>All three bacterial isolates (AZP2, A26 and AF) are capable of enhancing salt stress tolerance, and antagonizing the F. culmorum pathogen in the two model systems (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4 and 5</ref>).</s><s>TN formulation did not improve the PGPR performance in the case of single inoculations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>Fascinatingly, major differences in seedlings biomass were observed when double inoculations with TNs were performed in peat soil.</s><s>AZP2TN and A26TN as well as AZP2TN and AFTN combinations resulted in significantly enhanced colonization about a 25% plant biomass increase (Figs 4B, 6, 7, 8 Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1 and S2</ref>).</s><s>Regression analysis indicates that there is a positive interaction between TN-formulated second PGPRs and seedling biomass and plant biomass increases with increased colonization of the second inoculant in all stress situations (Figs 7, 8, 9 and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that there are interactions with seedling biomass accumulation and it is crucial that both PGPR populations are associated with the roots.</s><s>The results reveal the importance of PGPR root attachment, which are facilitated by TN formulation (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2 and 8</ref>).</s><s>Root colonization creates the base of the PGPR activity.</s><s>Growth-promoting compounds produced by the bacteria need to be released in the vicinity of the plant roots in the zone of rapid uptake.</s><s>We speculate that the TN formulated PGPR form micro-niches around the roots which are

<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>The dynamics of the interactions are yet to be elucidated and modelled in the system established

plants can facilitate the production of natural nanomaterials that enhance aggregation, functioning as a glue between bacteria and roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Multiple factors influence the PGPR effect under natural conditions.</s><s>Firstly, soil as an environmental matrix is rich in various nanoparticles that have a substantial impact on the soil characteristics.</s><s>Soil is also an omnipresent habitat where microbes network with their biotic components and among themselves.</s><s>Hence the effectiveness of the PGPR is related to the effectiveness of the technology used for PGPR formulation.</s><s>Are the cells protected from the unfavorable environment and secondary effects that hinder their performance?</s><s>We show that TN formulation establishes significantly larger and thicker bacterial clumps than those observed in the case of the self-produced biofilm matrix without TNs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>This is in agreement with earlier observations when B. amyloliquefaciens was applied to canola roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Based on the results, we conclude that the method of inoculum delivery using TNs is applicable in soil systems and is especially efficient when several inoculants are used.</s><s>Since most soils are regarded as being oligotrophic, natural nanosilica-based stimulation may trigger beneficial effects of PGPRs and can improve crop yield <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>However, with sand as a growth substrate, the problem with nutritional deprivation will occur, as sands are poor in nutritional elements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, it is hard to predict the efficiency of heterogeneous particles of varying nature, size and amount in sand soils.</s><s>Still, the presence of naturally existing nanoparticles must be considered when applying TNs.</s></p><p><s>Here we studied the harsh environment PGPR strains separately and in combination with one another for the ability and potential to enhance drought and salt tolerance and to suppress the pathogen F. culmorum.</s><s>The kind of investigations are challenging due to their complexity and effect collinearity.</s><s>Hence to reduce the number of variables we established a model system

that AZP2 and A26∆sfp perform best under drought, AF under salt and A26 under F. culmorum pathogen stress (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4 and 5</ref>).</s><s>Earlier, we have shown that the

vary and remains to be elucidated separately for every condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Mutation of A26 by inactivating (i.e., knocking out) the sfp gene dramatically improved drought stress adaptation of wheat primed by A26Δsfp as compared to wheat primed by the A26 wild type <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>This sfp gene inactivation resulted in about the same dry weight improving characteristics as AZP2.</s><s>A26∆sfp improved plant dry weight by 27% under no stress conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s><s>Under drought stress A26∆sfp, similarly to AZP2, improved plant dry weight more than five times.</s><s>The results here support our previous results on A26∆sfp drought stress tolerance enhancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>In addition to enhancing drought tolerance, the mutant enhanced wheat seedlings' antagonism to the pathogen F. culmorum and salt tolerance in a rate comparable to the best performers, A26 and AF, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s><s>Hence the P. polymyxa mutant with the sfp gene deletion has a great potential for agricultural application where transgenic cultivars are allowed.</s><s>Owing to the general restraints with mutant field application in Europe, the A26∆sfp analysis in peat soil was not performed in the context of this study.</s><s>Salt and drought are osmotic stresses similar to other osmotic stresses, e.g.</s><s>those caused by heavy environmental pollution.</s><s>Hence, the harsh environment isolates in combination with TNs have potential application in phytoremediation to restore marginal lands.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>The obtained results demonstrate that the Sol-Gel synthesized TNs stably attach PGPRs to plant roots and can be efficiently used for PGPR formulation in the case of double inoculation.</s><s>We suggest that TNs aid PGPR root attachment and bacterial performance under the conditions in which diverse factors affect the plant simultaneously.</s><s>The bacterial layers can be used as a tool for rational design of holobionts in food security programs.</s><s>Our studies illustrate the importance of considering natural soil nanoparticles for PGPR application and may explain the generally observed inconsistent behavior of PGPRs in the field.</s></p><p><s>The TN effects are thought to be related to the particles' ability to modulate the surface formation of complexes with important types of bio-molecules such as phospholipids and proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Understanding the pathways would improve the effectiveness of TNs and optimize the mutually complex interactions, as it would allow their regulated delivery and release, focusing on specific tissues and cells at specific times.</s><s>This would ensure that the great potential of PGPR science would find its way to facilitate reproducible field application and sustainable food production in a changing climate.</s><s>The systems developed in this study serve for quantitative modelling of these interactions.</s></p></div>
