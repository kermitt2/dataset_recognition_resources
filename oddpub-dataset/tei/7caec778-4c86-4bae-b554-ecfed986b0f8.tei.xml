<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Improving the accuracy of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations has been a long-standing aim in order to optimize clinical decision making with regard to diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD), medication dose-adjustment, contrast media application, initiating renal replacement therapy, evaluation of potential organ donors as well as prognostication of CKD-associated CV risk -all scenarios very relevant in the elderly.</s><s>In the present study we investigated ß-trace protein (BTP), a relatively novel filtration marker for estimating kidney function, for the first time exclusively in older adults.</s><s>This was motivated by the fact that introduction of cystatin C into current GFR estimating equations a couple of years ago has been shown to increase accuracy and precision especially in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> most probably due to its independence of height, age, gender and muscle mass. Wh</s><s>le the appropriate renal biomarker in old age has yet to be established, this raised the question whether the addition of BTP could further optimize GFR assessment in elder patients to improve patient management in geriatric nephrology.</s></p><p><s>Our analysis was performed in 566 individuals aged 70 years and above with iohexol plasma clearance measurements.</s><s>We demonstrated for the first time that when BTP was included into measured GFR (mGFR) predicting regression models, neither the single biomarker with or without age and gender was superior to creatinine or cystatin C, nor did BTP in combination with creatinine and/or cystatin C increase the regression model's fit significantly.</s></p><p><s>When comparing all BTP-containing GFR equations to mGFR the Inker (BTP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> equation showed the best performance.</s><s>No additional benefit was found when evaluating the performance of BTP-based GFR estimating   equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> in our population of older adults compared to BIS2 and FAS (Crea/Cys) equations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, using the two "established" standardized biomarkers creatinine and cystatin C for estimating GFR in individuals above the age of 70 is still superior to the currently available BTP-based equations.</s><s>When comparing the Inker (BTP) to the creatinine/cystatin C-based CKD-EPI (Crea/Cys) 2 equation we found that the Inker (BTP) equation showed a substantially smaller bias and better precision.</s><s>This was very surprising to us since in our mGFR predicting regression models we found that the combination of creatinine and cystatin C was clearly superior to BTP as a single biomarker in older adults.</s><s>Therefore, we would have expected the established CKD-EPI (Crea/Cys) equation to outperform the Inker (BTP) equation.</s><s>One possible explanation why this was not the case might be that the development population of both equations were not the same: amongst others, the Inker (BTP) study population included individuals with a higher mean age and reported a diabetes prevalence of 21%, both of which corresponds more closely to the characteristics of our BIS population compared to the CKD-EPI study population.</s><s>Also, one prominent non-GFR determinant in old age certainly is inflammation by which BTP is known to be less influenced compared to cystatin C 11 .</s><s>This could be another possible explanation why the Inker (BTP) equation performed better than the combined creatinine/cystatin C-based equation.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in contrast to former analyses that found no independent association between age and BTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , our data showed that mean BTP concentration increases by 14% between the age of 70 and the age of 90 years and above, leading to a higher prevalence of GFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 in the higher age strata.</s><s>The same phenomenon has been shown for creatinine and cystatin C <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , and has been interpreted as a sign of physiological kidney senesence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Cystatin C is said to be more sensitive to earlier GFR decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> in contrast to creatinine, which detects changes in kidney function not before a decrease of at least 50%.</s><s>Priem et al. as well as Filler et al. have found the same advantage for BTP with regard to the "creatinine-blind" range <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> ; in our population of elderly we did not find such a correlation (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>We further investigated BTP for assessing kidney function in hypertensive, diabetic, lean or obese elderly patients and found a slight additional benefit of including BTP into the prediction model for patients with arterial hypertension and diabetes as well as lean individuals compared to the combination of creatinine and cystatin C alone.</s><s>All in all our data did not show that BTP, in addition to creatinine and cystatin C, contains significant additional information on kidney function enabling a better distinction between disease-related and age-related "physiological" change of kidney function.</s><s>Besides, the accuracy of BTP measurement is lower compared to creatinine and cystatin C <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> since a certified assay standardization has not yet been successfully established <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , a fact that may also contribute to the rather disappointing results.</s></p><p><s>In 2016, Foster and colleagues have shown that BTP may contribute valuable risk prediction information beyond the current biomarkers creatinine and cystatin C <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>As a purely cross-sectional analysis our focus exclusively lay on GFR prediction.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations of our study deserve mentioning.</s><s>First, BTP has been shown to perform superior in combination with beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Since in our population we did not measure B2M our observations are limited to BTP only or in combination with creatinine and/or cystatin C. Secondly, our study explicitly focused on older adults and BTP's potential benefit in estimating GFR in this selected population.</s><s>Even if we cannot simply expand our results to other populations they support former findings where BTP performed neither superior in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> nor in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> when compared to creatinine and cystatin C. Also we cannot comment on the impact of race, since we investigated a purely Caucasian population.</s><s>Thirdly, the BTP-based equation by Pöge <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and White <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> were derived in and developed for adult kidney transplant recipients; these equations were expected to perform inferior in our elderly non-transplanted study population.</s></p><p><s>In summary, BTP alone or the addition of BTP does not outperform current biomarkers such as creatinine and cystatin C for GFR estimation in older adults.</s><s>Especially the use of cystatin C renders the addition of BTP unnecessary.</s><s>A slight improvement might be present in diabetic, hypertensive and lean individuals, whether this is clinically relevant remains to be proven.</s><s>Further research is necessary to evaluate whether BTP is a useful renal marker in risk prediction for older adults and whether it outperforms creatinine and/or cystatin C in this respect.</s></p></div>
