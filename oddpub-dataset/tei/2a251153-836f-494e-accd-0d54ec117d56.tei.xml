<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study evaluated handgrip strength in a sample of Swiss individuals aged 75 years and over to  Compared to grip strength data of a previously published Swiss sample (up to 85 years of age) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the older people in our study presented with comparable strength values (mean of three trials) in all age groups, except from women aged 75-79 years who were significantly weaker in the present study.</s><s>Where Werle et al. included community-living older adults and elderly living in senior residences, our sample included nursing home dwellers as well.</s><s>It is possible, therefore, that our sample had a lower level of physical condition than participants in the Werle et al. study.</s><s>Therefore, handgrip strength could be expected to be lower in our sample as seen in women aged 75-79 years.</s><s>The age group 85+ reported in the study of Werle et al. could not be compared to our sample since information on average age of their 85+ cohort was not provided.</s></p><p><s>In comparison to handgrip strength values published by other authors who included a random sample of the general nonagenarian population <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, mean handgrip strength of the 90-99-year-old participants were significantly higher than in Southern France and Italy.</s><s>These findings are consistent with previous comparisons among different European countries showing a North-South slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Contrasting our results of the oldest women with studies of two cohorts from Denmark (women mean age 100 years, 92-92 years respectively) who included volunteers of oldest old people registered in the national civil registration system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, women of our Swiss sample were significantly stronger.</s><s>The difference could be due to variances in mean age, with women of one Danish cohort being 7 years older on average, as well as due to higher percentage of the participants living in assisted living facilities/nursing homes in both Danish samples (30.6% <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and 47.6% <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> versus 8.4% in our sample).</s></p><p><s>The differences in age-and gender-specific grip strength among different countries likely vary due to e.g.</s><s>birth weight, lifestyle and health care in the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In the Swiss population, these factors are above average on international comparison, which might contribute to the higher grip strength observed in the elderly Swiss.</s><s>More specifically, the average birth weight (3.3 kg) of Swiss newborns in 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> corresponds with the average value of international standards for newborns <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</s><s>However, at 83.3 years, the Swiss population had the second highest life expectancy at birth in 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, 56% of the population aged 75 years and over met the WHO-recommendations for physical activity in 2016, and therefore were within the highest quartile of the prevalence range (20-60%) of physical activity in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Remarkably, Switzerland has the highest social and economic wellbeing of older people worldwide, considering income and health status, education and employment, and enabling environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, which may be important preconditions for remaining active in old age.</s></p><p><s>Another finding of our study, consistent with previous research in the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, was that handgrip strength in men and women was independently associated with age, height and ADL dependence.</s><s>Handgrip strength did not correlate with Body Mass Index (BMI), probably owing to homogenous BMI values across sexes and age groups.</s><s>Since percentage of muscle and fat mass was not specified in the study participants, no conclusion about association between Handgrip strength is presented as maximum value of three trials and mean value of three trials ± SD  Handgrip strength is presented as maximum value of three trials and mean value of three trials ± SD (SEMstandard error of mean)  grip strength and body composition could be drawn.</s><s>Therefore, age-specific grip strength values were demonstrated only with and without adjustment to height and not BMI.</s><s>Handgrip strength decreased significantly with age in men and women.</s><s>Between 75 and 99 years, men demonstrated a greater decrease in strength than women but had still higher overall values even in the oldest age group.</s><s>When considering the entire age range (75-99 years), the largest reduction in grip strength occurred in men in their early 80's while the biggest difference in women's strength appeared in their early 90's.</s><s>The finding is consistent with a longitudinal study of Danish older adults, in which males lost handgrip strength more rapidly than females but were still stronger in absolute values <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref> and less dependent in daily living <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>As more women of the oldest age group in the current study were dependent in daily activities than men (51% of women, 10% men), it would appear that absolute strength rather than relative grip strength reduction may be more important for remaining independent in daily living in the elderly.</s></p><p><s>To identify people with a clinically meaningful reduction in handgrip strength in our sample of Swiss older adults, we applied cut-off values for detection of people at risk for mobility limitations, associated with sarcopenia/ dynapenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>According to cut off values published by Alley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> classifying people as weak (grip strength less than 26 kg for men and 16 kg for women), 22.7% male and 18% female participants in our sample were in this category.</s><s>These individuals have a 7.6 (men) and 4.4 (women) times increased risk for mobility limitations, compared to older people with normal strength.</s><s>In addition, 35.3% of the women and 21.6% of the men had "intermediate strength" (cut-off thresholds of 32 kg in men and 20 kg in women), with concomitant 3.6 (men) and 2.4 (women) times higher risk of impairment compared to older adults with normal strength values.</s></p><p><s>In total, the percentage of participants with reduced strength according the proposed thresholds is 44% in men and 53% in women.</s><s>Comparing the men and women with normal strength to the at risk of mobility limitation groups regarding dependency in daily living, those with normal strength were more than 2-5 times less likely living in a care home facility.</s></p><p><s>Even though cut-off values are not confirmed to be valid in detecting mobility limitations in the Swiss population yet, these results might give insight into current physical health and might indicate future need for help and care in the Swiss population.</s></p><p><s>In this study, handgrip strength was evaluated in two urban regions of German-speaking Switzerland with comparable handgrip strength observed at both sites.</s><s>The age-and gender-distribution, as well as the percentage of people dependent in daily activities, were comparable with the Swiss population of the same geographic region <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, grip strength values reported in this study are likely representative of the urban, German-Swiss population.</s><s>We cannot rule out, however, that handgrip

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>This study recruited people from urban rather than rural areas of Switzerland.</s><s>As people from rural backgrounds have been shown to have greater grip strength than those from urban environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>, reference values in this study may be viewed as lower estimates of grip strength in the Swiss population.</s><s>It is noteworthy, however, that our data are comparable with previously published grip strength in Swiss adults (aged 75-85) which included urban, suburban and rural populations.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, our study included people of various health status.</s><s>Grip strength differences between men and women might therefore be different to results of other authors that included only healthy people <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>, since</s></p></div>
