<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Our analysis demonstrated that MDR-TB patients tended to spend significantly more time than matched controls in community settings, particularly in healthcare venues, schools, and transportation venues (i.e., bus stops/lines, train stations, and airports).</s><s>Healthcare venues, markets, and cinemas were the most common epidemiologic links between cases, and may be potential sites of transmission.</s><s>Markets were frequently shared by both cases and controls and are potential sites for infectious-to-susceptible exposure.</s><s>These findings highlight opportunities for health ministries to implement environmental improvements, such as enhanced ventilation and UV irradiation, to reduce the risk of community exposure and transmission at these venues.</s><s>Reducing transmissibility within MDR-TB hotspots by targeting environmental interventions in venues where exposure risk is high may have considerable community-wide benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Our study demonstrates the utility of combining venue-tracing questionnaires with whole-genome sequencing to identify new areas of potential transmission.</s><s>Network density based on all venues was greater in the LSN of cases compared to that of controls, indicating that cases are more inter-connected through community venues than controls.</s><s>The stratified analysis showed that healthcare venues were the primary venue connecting cases, and are undoubtedly important venues for infection control.</s><s>In addition to healthcare venues, LSNs based on markets, cinemas, bars, and transportation venues also had high case-network densities and may be candidate venues for MDR-TB infection control or case finding.</s><s>Greater network density has been correlated with increased infection risk in simulation studies, and may explain how outbreaks of TB tend to circulate within defined sub-populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A network analysis showed that case and control communities are highly segregated <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, with the strong separation of cases and controls into distinct network communities.</s><s>This finding suggests that environmental interventions should be applied across the distinct network of venues frequented by cases, rather than in 1 site alone.</s><s>Furthermore, resources should not be focused on venues frequented only by controls, where the risk of exposure to MDR-TB may be very low.</s><s>Social segregation may be a key driver of MDR-TB in this community, as reflected in the observed difference in income and education levels between cases and controls.</s><s>Segregation may have direct effects on the transmission of TB by concentrating impoverished populations into small geographic areas with poor housing and limited access to healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Spatial analyses of MDR-TB cases have found hotspots of localized transmission in areas of Lima, suggesting that the transmission of MDR-TB occurs in small geographic areas that may have formed by socially-segregated enclaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results are supported by previous studies that have found healthcare venues to be high-risk environments for MDR-TB transmission in Lima <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Venue-tracing studies in Uganda have found that nearly all identified clusters of unrelated TB patients were only epidemiologically linked through shared healthcare venues <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>We are unable to confirm whether cases were exposed to MDR-TB and infected during healthcare visits or were infected elsewhere and visited clinics more frequently to address reactivated diseases.</s><s>However, the healthcare venues reported by cases were visited prior to their diagnoses, so the association between cases and healthcare utilization is unlikely to be confounded by TB treatment uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Schools and transportation venues have been reported as sites of significant community contact, where prolonged and close exposure to infectious cases may be likely <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>While our results are similar to previous studies of drug-sensitive TB cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, we cannot definitively conclude the venues identified are generalizable to drug-sensitive TB populations, given the use of a healthy, TB-free control group; however, the advantage of using TB-free controls is the identification of venues where susceptible-to-infectious cross-exposure is possible.</s><s>MDR-TB is associated with greater catastrophic costs due to treatment than drug-sensitive TB, and MDR-TB patients are more likely to have adverse outcomes, likely influencing mobility and community venue types frequented; however, none of the cases were hospitalized and all were sufficiently ambulant to visit clinics and other community venues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>There were several limitations to this study.</s><s>Proxy interviews were required for 18 (31%) of the cases because they were either too ill or had died by the time of our interview; however, there were no demographic differences between proxy and primary cases, indicating any potential bias may be minimal.</s><s>Field data on participation refusals were unfortunately not digitized, precluding a comparison analysis of case participants and non-participants.</s><s>The timeframes of interviews were also different for cases and controls; cases were interviewed about venues frequented during the month prior to diagnosis, while controls were interviewed about venues frequented in the month prior to their interview.</s><s>Focusing on the month prior to diagnosis may have biased the frequency of healthcare utilization upwards, as cases sought care for pre-diagnosis illnesses.</s><s>Future studies might focus on case recall periods before symptoms occurred, to ascertain venue exposure prior to any illness-mediated changes in venue utilization habits.</s><s>Nevertheless, since cases are highly infectious prior to treatment, focusing on venue visits prior to diagnosis is important for identifying places of concentrated infectious case activity where MDR-TB exposure may occur.</s><s>Fixing recall periods for controls to the month prior to our interviews may also have introduced differential recall bias by fixing temporality and seasonality as compared to cases; differentials in the frequency of national holidays or vacation seasons could have biased reported venue utilization.</s><s>Statistical adjustment was used to account for the significant difference in income and education among cases and controls; however, given the use of broad binary indicators to control for socioeconomic status, residual confounding may still be a concern.</s><s>Future studies should focus on the detailed collection of socioeconomic data or control for socioeconomic status in the study design.</s></p><p><s>Several cases had prior episodes of TB, suggesting resistance could have been acquired rather than transmitted and limiting our ability to conclude cases were infected in reported venues.</s><s>However, over half the cases with previous TB were genetically clustered, providing support for recent transmission, and past studies have documented the high frequency of community-based MDR-TB transmission in Lima <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The accuracy of SNP thresholds to determine genetic clustering is dependent upon a number of factors, including strain diversity, mutation rates, complete case detection, and the identification of epidemiologic links between cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Strain diversity in Lima has been well documented, suggesting small SNP differences are likely instances of transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>The use of a 5 SNP threshold in our study was informed by Walker et al., who found epidemiologic links between cases with up to 5 SNP differences, as was the case in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Increasing the threshold to ≤10 SNPs did not have an appreciable effect on the number of clustered cases or epidemiologic links found (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we did not complete an environmental assessment of each venue and are unable to comment on the transmission risk in specific venues.</s></p><p><s>In summary, MDR-TB patients spent significantly more time in distinct and segregated healthcare venues, schools, and transportation venues, which were associated with increased odds of MDR-TB.</s><s>The LSN analysis revealed that genetically-clustered MDR-TB patients were distinct and significantly segregated from matched controls.</s><s>This finding suggests the need to concentrate interventions at those venues utilized and shared by high-risk communities and not utilized by low-risk communities, in order to have the maximum impact on controlling disease spread.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 2.
