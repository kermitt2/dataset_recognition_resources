effects were seen for interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNF- <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, Vermeij et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> showed that treatment of an acute joint inflammation with local IL-10 overexpression under the control of disease-regulated promoters inhibited arthritis progression.</s><s>Consistently, Roybal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> showed that the early gestational gene transfer of IL-10 by systemic administration of lentiviral vector can prevent arthritis in a murine model.</s><s>Taken together, these findings are consistent with the notion that the upregulated proinflammatory mediators support the inflammatory process in JT and RA synovium in contrast to the upregulated anti-inflammatory mediators probably responsible for a counterbalance and, therefore, lower inflammatory process in OA synovium.</s></p><p><s>A potential limitation of this study, however, is that the Mediators of Inflammation observed differences, at least in part, may be also due to apparent differences in age and disease duration of patients influencing the disease-specific pro-and anti-inflammatory balance (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In summary, we found that the upregulation of proinflammatory mediators mediates the predominantly catabolic inflammatory process in JT and RA synovium, whereas the upregulation of anabolic anti-inflammatory mediators may counteract inflammation and be responsible for the inferior inflammatory process in OA synovium.</s><s>These findings provide a morphological evidence of imbalance within the so-called inflammatory factor network between catabolic proinflammatory and anabolic anti-inflammatory cytokines within each disease and among JT, OA, and RA patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1: Detection of 5-LOX mRNA (a) and number of 5-LOX-IR cells (b and c) in patients with joint trauma (JT), osteoarthritis (OA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</s><s>(a) Quantification of 5-LOX mRNA using TaqMan qRT-PCR shows that 5-LOX mRNA was significantly higher in RA compared to JT, OA, and control synovium ( &lt;
