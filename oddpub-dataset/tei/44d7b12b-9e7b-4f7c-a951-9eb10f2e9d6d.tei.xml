<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This was an open-label, multicentre trial of treosulfan in elderly women with ROC.</s><s>Patients were enrolled into the study after failure of platinum-containing treatment, irrespective of their treatment-free interval, following an innovative registration design: they were free to choose between oral and i.v.</s><s>treosulfan treatment.</s><s>Only indecisive participants were randomized.</s></p><p><s>Patients were enrolled at 27 German institutions (18 hospitals, nine outpatient facilities).</s><s>Women ≥ 65 years with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer were eligible.</s><s>Key inclusion criteria were as follows (selection): ECOG ≤ 2, serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 × upper normal limit (UNL), bilirubin ≤ 1.25 × UNL (in the presence of liver metastases ≤ 5 × UNL), and adequate bone marrow function (leucocytes ≥ 2.0 • × 10 9 /l, and platelet count ≥ 100 × 10 9 /l).</s><s>Initially, only patients in the second line situation (first recurrence) were allowed to participate, but due to emerging trial results and improvement of national guidelines for the treatment of ovarian cancer, the subsequent change of inclusion criteria to patients with at least two previous therapies (≥3 rd line situation) was amended.</s></p><p><s>The primary aim was to explore the preference and compliance of elderly participants for the palliative treatment with oral or i.v.</s><s>medication.</s><s>Secondary objectives included compliance, toxicity, progression-free and overall survival.</s><s>Additional quality of life, functional and comorbidity measures and geriatric assessments were performed according to the preference of the participants.</s></p><p><s>This trial was planned by the North-Eastern German Society of Gynaecological Oncology (NOGGO) Ovarian Cancer Study Group.</s><s>The study was performed according to ICH-GCP (International Conference on Harmonization -Good Clinical Practice) guidelines after obtaining central ethical committee's approval and trial registration (EudraCT Nr.: 2004-000719-25; NCT 00170690).</s><s>Written informed consent was provided by each participant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment plan and toxicity evaluation</head><p><s>Patients received a standard dose of 7000 mg/m 2 treosulfan i.v. on day 1 of a 28-day cycle or 600 mg/m 2 p.o. on days 1-28 of a 56-day cycle for a maximum of 12 months or until disease-progression or development of unacceptable toxicity.</s></p><p><s>The screening started within 14 days prior to start of therapy included an evaluation of the medical history, a physical examination, and a tumour evaluation, staged by CA 125 and radiological imaging (chest x-ray, ultrasound, CT or MRI scan).</s><s>Laboratory analyses comprised haematology (biweekly), serum chemistry, and urine analysis.</s><s>Evaluation of response was performed every 12 weeks or in case of symptoms or signs of tumour progression.</s></p><p><s>Toxicity was classified according to the NCI-CTCAE version 2.0.</s><s>Safety analyses were performed on all patients who received at least one therapy cycle.</s><s>In order to account for the limited haematopoietic resources of elderly patients, chemotherapy was applied only if leukocyte was ≥ 3.5 × 10 9 /l and platelets ≥ 100× 10 9 /l.</s></p><p><s>In cases of dose reduction due to severe haematological toxicity, no re-escalation was allowed.</s><s>Tumour progression, intolerable toxicity (grade 3/4), and/or a treatment delay &gt; 2 weeks led to discontinuation of treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The preference for oral or i.v.</s><s>treosulfan was expected to result in a variable compliance.</s><s>Description of compliance differences between the two treatment arms by 15% was defined as clinically significant.</s><s>We used Fleiss statistical measurement to optimize the sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Setting the test criteria to alpha = 5%, beta = 20% and a drop-out rate of 5%, 160 patients were initially intended to be recruited for this trial.</s><s>Due to a slow recruitment we performed a prior evaluation with 123 patients identifying highly representative differences in preference and compliance, which were statistically significant to close early trial recruitment.</s></p><p><s>Results are presented as proportions, means, medians, and rates, and their adequate measures of distribution.</s><s>We used a one-sample test of proportions to address the primary hypothesis.</s><s>All other endpoints were evaluated in an exploratory fashion, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed where appropriate.</s></p><p><s>Evaluation of response was performed by CA 125 monthly and by radiological assessment every 3 months.</s><s>Response was measured according to UICC-criteria and CA-125 assessment criteria, established by Rustin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Progression-free survival and overall survival were defined as the interval between the first day of the study drug application and disease progression or death due to any cause.</s><s>Both were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient characteristics</head><p><s>Out of 123 registered patients, 119 received at least one cycle of chemotherapy and were eligible for the final analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Generally, there were no significant differences in the global patient characteristics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The median age at recruitment was 71 years (range of 65-87 years).</s><s>Most women were diagnosed with advanced stage III/IV high-grade carcinomas of serouspapillary histology and were in good condition (ECOG 0-1).</s><s>The majority had received three previous cytotoxic treatments (three in the i.v. and two in the oral preference arm).</s><s>Most patients were treated in this study due to second or third recurrence (56.3%), but 32% had four or more recurrences in their medical history.</s><s>Because the protocol allowed to register patients independently of their platinum-free interval, the rate of late recurrences with a treatment-free interval &gt;12 months was between 35 and 52% (oral vs. i.v.</s><s>group).</s><s>Distant metastases were rare and typically localized to the liver or lung.</s><s>The median number of concomitant diseases was 5 (range 1-9), mostly of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal character (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preference for chemotherapy</head><p><s>During the registration process patients were asked to realize their preference or to be randomized to treatment.</s><s>Most them (n = 116, 97.5%) preferred to choose the application form of chemotherapy, thus only 3 indecisive women were randomized.</s><s>A total of 85.7% or 102 patients realized their free choice to receive chemotherapy as i.v.</s><s>application, where three were randomized to this arm.</s><s>Seventeen patients (14.3%) preferred the oral therapy (no randomization to oral therapy).</s><s>The main reasons for individual preference to i.v. or p.o. treosulfan are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Toxicity profile</head><p><s>In both treatment arms, most non-haematological and haematological toxicities were of grade 1 or 2.
