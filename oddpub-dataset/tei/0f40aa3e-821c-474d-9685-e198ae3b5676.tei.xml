there were minor differences between the fat-rich and carbohydrate-rich diet in the morning versus evening, and we cannot completely exclude that this may influence the results of our study.</s><s>Thirdly, we cannot completely exclude a contribution of the second-meal phenomenon to the regulation of meal-induced insulin and incretin response in the afternoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>However, the time between MTT1 and MTT2 was long enough (~7 h) to minimize this effect.</s><s>Finally, our study was conducted in overweight healthy individuals and we
