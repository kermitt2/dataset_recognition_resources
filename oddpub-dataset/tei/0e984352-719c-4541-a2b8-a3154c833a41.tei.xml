performed labelling of the cells by consecutive incubation with two thymidine analogues-IdU and CldU (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and took advantage of the DNA

peak of mouse splenocytes and G1 peak of the cell line were approximated with Gaussian distributions and the relative position of the G1 peak was calculated (for details see methods and Table <ref

measured by hand and used to calculate mean IOD and RFS.</s><s>For details see methods; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3 and 4</ref>.   super-resolution imaging with RFi labelled by nucleotide incorporation were prepared by growing proliferating cultures of mouse and human cells in the presence of different cell permeable thymidine analogues (EdU or BrdU).</s><s>In addition, RFi labelled by fluorescent PCNA to highlight replisomes were imaged in the same cells.</s><s>The moderate expression levels of fluorescent PCNA

type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Hence, an additional staining with anti-PCNA antibodies was performed to enhance the PCNA signal.</s><s>To cover all optical resolution levels, we also acquired laser scanning confocal microscopy images and generated conventional wide-field epifluorescence images from the raw data sets obtained at the 3D-SIM system as well as the respective deconvolved images.</s><s>In most cases, not only fixed and stained cell images but also live-cell images were acquired, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</s></p><p><s>All characteristic S-phase patterns described in conventional wide-field and confocal microscopy could be identified in super-resolution images.</s></p><p><s>Pan S-phase quantification of replication foci numbers.</s><s>Using newly developed computational approaches for RFi quantification (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and ref. 42), we next counted the numbers of RFi (nucleotide and protein labelling) for every major S-phase stage at the different optical resolution levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Application of the counting protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> to Z-stacks of confocal images led to the identification of on average 1,096 and 811 RFi per human and mouse cell in early S-phase comparable to previous reports.</s><s>Mid S-phase cells yielded moderately higher RFi numbers, whereas this number decreased in late S-phase when the characteristic pattern of bigger and brighter RFi appeared (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Similarly to confocal data, the number of RFi in deconvolved wide-field image stacks of early S-phase cells was 848 and 1,011 for human and mouse cells, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Some S-phase stage fluctuation in RFi numbers (from 4,000 to 6,003 and 3,687 to 5,462 for human and mouse cells, respectively) could be found in 3D-SIM image stacks with mid S-phase numbers higher in human cells and early S-phase numbers higher in mouse cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>This suggests cell type or species-specific differences in S-phase dynamics and stresses the importance of complementing the in situ RFi measurements with a thorough characterization of genome size, IOD and RFS in the same cells.</s><s>In both, human and mouse cells, RFi numbers declined toward late S-phase, due to prominent clustering of a substantial portion of RFi compromising proper separation and identification of individual RFi

temporal S-phase dynamics in these cells.</s><s>We further measured genome size for each cell line used in our experiments and analysed the molecular characteristics of replicons in the same cells.</s><s>To quantify RFi numbers in super-resolution images, we developed and verified user-independent protocols for 3D RFi segmentation and counting.</s><s>We compared RFi quantifications results with respect with the other parameters measured for identical cells.</s></p><p><s>In both cell lines we detected on average five thousands RFi at any S-phase sub-stage using super-resolution imaging (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Combining all the experimental data together, we concluded that the majority of RFi represent single replicons at 3D-SIM  <ref

replicons at any given S-phase time-point is determined by the pool of available limiting factors.</s><s>If for these replicons it is assumed that the corresponding origins of replication are activated during a short-time window of S-phase, the time of synthesis of the whole subset will roughly correspond to the lifetime of an average replicon, which we estimated as 57 min for human and 33 min for mouse cells.</s><s>S-phase progression can be modelled as sequential activation of subsets of origins and DNA synthesis in the corresponding pluralities of replicons.</s><s>It is unlikely, however, that there are distinct classes of origins, which are initiated strictly one after the other.</s><s>A more realistic scenario is that origin firing of adjacent replicons in the next subset starts before replicons from the previous subset complete DNA synthesis, leading to replicons from multiple subsets being active in parallel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>Both sequential synchronous and asynchronous modes of origin firing would nonetheless lead to identical average numbers of simultaneously active replicons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, the subdivision of S-phase into three major discrete sub-stages (Se, Sm and Sl) is an oversimplification of real RFi dynamics, which very likely represents a continuous spreading of replication onto non-replicated chromosome segments and corresponding gradual changes in RFi patterns.</s><s>DNA flow cytometry histograms (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> as well as accompanying study <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> ) demonstrate the absence of substantial differences in cumulative DNA synthesis intensity throughout S-phase.</s><s>Therefore, the average estimates of RFi numbers used in our calculations represented a reasonable simplification.</s></p><p><s>The empirical differences between Se, Sm and Sl RFi numbers may illustrate variations in degree of clustering of replication forks during individual S-phase stages.</s><s>For example, the portion of RFi containing single-replication forks may be higher than average during early S-phase in mouse C2C12 and during middle S-phase in HeLa Kyoto cells.</s><s>In the latter cases, 3D-SIM may still not completely resolve all RFi leading to their underestimation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>We also observed cell-to-cell variability in RFi numbers and S-phase duration, as well as average spacing of origins and RFS <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Differences in RFi numbers in Se, Sm and Sl may also be associated with corresponding changes in RFS and IOD.</s><s>Nonetheless, the mouse myoblasts having a larger genome size but the same S-phase duration (time to duplicate the whole genome) did not compensate by increasing the average number of simultaneously active replicons but rather mainly by tweaking up the DNA synthesis speed.</s><s>The latter has interesting metabolic implications regarding nucleotide pool availability.</s></p><p><s>While the intra-S-phase variations of all these parameters are worthy of a separate study, such a detailed analysis will not affect our main conclusions since, despite the reported variability of the above parameters, genome duplication is completed by the end of S-phase.</s></p><p><s>The observation of spatially separated replication machineries corresponding to individual replicons and replication forks in (live) 3D-preserved cells contradicts the model of S-phase progression based on replication factories as common synthetic centres that process multiple tandem replicons.</s><s>The term 'replication factories' was initially coined based on the combined consideration of: (i) small number of RFi, which were nuclease resistant and contained nascent DNA and replication proteins; and (ii) DNA fibre data on organization of replicons in clusters; which taken together suggested that each replication focus 'was a 'factory' containing many polymerizing

scenario, further elaborated in the accompanying study <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , the sites of assembly, the pattern and dynamics of nuclear RFi will be dictated by the intranuclear folding of the chromatin fibre itself.</s><s>Accordingly, in physiological conditions (that is, in the absence of replicative stress) replication-related reorganization of chromatin will be limited to local changes of chromatin condensation state, which will be more prominent in compacted heterochromatin.</s><s>The above model of S-phase progression is also compatible with the reported influence of DNA replication fork movement on the chromatin loop size organization and origin choice in the following cell cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Resolving conventional nuclear RFi down to sites containing single replicons or replication forks implies a modified interpretation of the RFi characteristics that are traditionally analysed in studies of spatio-temporal organization of DNA replication.</s><s>In this respect, the original meaning of the term 'replication factory' as a macromolecular complex performing simultaneous synthesis of multiple replicons, needs to be reduced to smaller replisome complexes or even single replisomes, which are assembled on DNA spatially organized within the nucleus.</s></p><p><s>An inherent component of the replication factory model
