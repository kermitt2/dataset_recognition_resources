however, the antimicrobial activity seems to depend on the direct contact of Ca(OH) 2 with the bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Because of its low solubility and diffusibility, Ca(OH) 2 reveals a reduced effect against bacteria located in pulpal remnants, crevices, and isthmi in the canal system and the dentinal tubules especially against E. faecalis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, complete removal of Ca(OH) 2 from the root canal system irrespective of the irrigation solution or system is difficult to achieve because of the complexity of its anatomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Remnants of Ca(OH) 2 may impair the sealing ability of the root canal filling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and therefore alternative options concerning further intracanal medicaments or disinfection methods are of interest.</s></p><p><s>Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a synthetic cationic bisguanide that is positively charged.</s><s>The hydrophobic and lipophilic molecule interacts with phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides on the cell membrane of bacteria and is able to enter the bacterial cells through active or passive transport mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>A randomized clinical trial analyzed the antibacterial effectiveness of the intracanal medicaments Ca(OH) 2 and 2% CHX-Gel in teeth with chronic apical periodontitis and revealed a comparable effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Data of ex vivo studies demonstrated that 2% CHX-Gel as an intracanal medicament was more effective against E. faecalis compared to Ca(OH) 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, the antimicrobial activity of CHX gel is affected by the time it remains inside the root canal because it is not able to act as a physical barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Both intracanal medicaments require a second appointment to remove the medicament; consequently, a single-visit approach is not possible and complete removal of the medicament from the root canal system remains questionable.</s><s>Moreover, reinfection of the root canal system is possible to occur during appointments.</s><s>In addition, recent clinical data and metaanalyses demonstrated no significant differences of success rate and postoperative pain of single-visit or multiple-visit endodontic treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, during one-visit root canal treatment, adequate disinfection of the whole root canal system has to be ensured within one session.</s></p><p><s>Further disinfection methods besides the application of intracanal medicaments and irrigation solutions have been suggested to enhance the removal of residual bacteria from the root canal system.</s><s>Ozone (O 3 ) is a naturally occurring gas and is an energized, unstable form of oxygen that readily dissociates back into oxygen (O 2 ) and singlet oxygen (O 1 ), which is a reactive form of oxygen and is capable of oxidizing cells.</s><s>It is able to destroy biomolecules and cell walls of bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Ozone gas (HealOzone; KaVo, Biberach, Germany) as an adjunctive disinfection method has been suggested to be used clinically in endodontic treatment but the results of studies on its efficacy against endodontic pathogens have been inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Questions remain about the optimum duration and concentration of ozone gas that should be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Ozone demonstrated an antibacterial effect on planktonic E. faecalis cells but revealed a little effect on cells embedded in a biofilm structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and was not comparable with the antibacterial effect of sodium hypochlorite <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to that, another study demonstrated that gaseous and aqueous ozone were as effective as NaOCl and CHX being able to completely remove the bacterial biofilm inside the root canal ex vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The physical effect of laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is based on producing a light beam with high energy density through induced emission of atoms in the laser medium.</s><s>The physical interaction between laser and tissue is determined by the adsorption spectrum of the tissue.</s><s>Provided that the wavelength of the laser corresponds to the adsorption spectrum of the tissue, a linear biological effect characterized by hyperthermia (37-60 ∘ C), coagulation (60-100 ∘ C), carbonization (100-400 ∘ C), and evaporation (&gt;400 ∘ C) on tissue cells is induced <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>The application of diode laser irradiation has been suggested as an effective adjunctive antibacterial disinfectant in the root canal <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>The antibacterial effect of diode laser irradiation has been attributed to its greater depth of penetration up to 1000 m into the dentinal tubules when compared to the penetration depth of chemical disinfectants, which were limited to 100 m in a recent in vitro study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, Gutknecht et al. demonstrated that diode laser with 980 nm wavelength can eliminate E. faecalis up to a penetration depth of 500 m effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Little is known about the combination of irrigation protocols and adjunctive disinfection methods possibly enabling a one-visit endodontic treatment in comparison to the conventional method of using intracanal medicaments in a multiple-visit endodontic treatment.</s><s>Consequently, the aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial efficacy of gaseous ozone and diode laser in combination with various irrigation protocols in comparison to the application of intracanal medicaments (Ca(OH) 2 and CHX-Gel) against E. faecalis biofilms in root canals of extracted human front teeth ex vivo.</s></p><p><s>The null hypothesis of the present study was that no difference in bacterial reduction between the disinfection methods and the intracanal medicaments in combination with the irrigation protocols would exist inside the root canal lumen (planktonic bacteria) and in the root canal dentin (adherent bacteria).</s></p></div>

disinfection methods could be detected.</s><s>In combination with antibacterial irrigation using 1% NaOCl, no significant differences between the various disinfection methods could be observed.</s></p><p><s>The present ex vivo study employed a monospecies biofilm model inside the root canal of upper canines using E. faecalis.</s><s>Upper canines exhibiting only one straight root canal with a standardized length of 19.5 mm were selected for the present study.</s><s>After initial apical preparation up to ISO size 40, it can be assumed that uniform colonization of these root canals could be achieved.</s><s>E. faecalis has been shown to be resistant against disinfecting agents and antibiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and can be effectively colonized; it forms a biofilm on root canal walls and invades dentinal tubules <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, this monospecies biofilm model was used to reproduce the same biofilm-like structure in each of the investigated root canal samples with a species that is difficult to eliminate by chemomechanical debridement <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>Successful biofilm formation could be validated by fluorescence microscopic imaging where colonization of the root canal walls as well as penetration into the dentinal tubules (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) could be clearly visualized.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, one requirement for laboratory studies that aim to investigate the antimicrobial effects of various disinfection methods is to use models that closely resemble in vivo conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, multispecies biofilm models for root canal disinfection ex vivo have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>However, for in vitro testing reproducible infection of the root canals is important.</s><s>For that reason, a monospecies biofilm model using E. faecalis was applied; moreover, front teeth with straight root canals for achieving comparable bacterial loads and standardized sampling were used.</s><s>Additionally, sampling of planktonic and adherent bacteria was conducted and further incubation of exemplary samples that demonstrated no bacterial growth immediately after treatment was performed with the aim of detecting remnant bacteria that could only be detected after further growing.</s><s>The present study design confirmed the effect of chemomechanical debridement using 1% NaOCl compared to instrumentation of the root canal alone, as demonstrated previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>NaOCl in concentrations of 1.0% and 5.0% has shown high antibacterial activity in a contact test <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and residual NaOCl inside dentinal tubules has been regarded as crucial for effective disinfection <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, no blocking of NaOCl using sodium thiosulphate was performed, and consequently a continued effect of the applied disinfection protocol or a so-called carry-over effect inside the canal or the agar plate cannot be excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, data on the carry-over effect of NaOCl are controversial and the effect seems to be negligible up to a NaOCl concentration of 3% <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The present study design allows conclusions about the antimicrobial effects of the various disinfection methods with respect to instrumentation and irrigation protocol.</s><s>Without further instrumentation of the root canal, the antibacterial effects of the investigated medical dressings were significantly higher compared to laser or ozone treatment alone.</s></p><p><s>For ozone treatment alone, these results have been corroborated in a recent ex vivo study where gaseous ozone treatment for 120 s resulted in 100% of samples with E. faecalis regrowth <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, it has been demonstrated previously that ozone had little antibacterial effects on E. faecalis cells embedded in a biofilm structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, Huth et al. achieved complete elimination of E. faecalis biofilms after application of gaseous ozone in a high concentration of 53 g/m 3 for 1 min or lower concentrations with increased application time and concluded that the antibacterial effects of gaseous ozone were dose-and timedependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The optimum duration of application and concentration of gaseous ozone are still a matter of debate and may lead to inconsistent results of its antibacterial efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Application time of gaseous ozone was 60 s twice using the specific program of the device for root canal treatment.</s><s>The applied ozone concentration was 2100 ppm which resulted in 4.49 g/m 3 .</s><s>However, the device has been replaced on the market in the meantime by HealOzone X4 providing an ozone concentration of 32 g/m 3 , which should be taken into consideration when interpreting the present results.</s></p><p><s>No significant differences in bacterial reduction could be demonstrated in the present study for the various investigated disinfection methods in combination of instrumentation and irrigation using 1% NaOCl highlighting the fact that a one-visit root canal treatment including instrumentation and antibacterial irrigation in combination with adjunctive disinfection methods like ozone or diode laser application is equally effective compared to a simulated two-visit endodontic treatment with application of medical dressings.</s></p><p><s>The enhanced antimicrobial effect of gaseous ozone in combination with antibacterial irrigation using NaOCl has been also demonstrated in a recent in vitro study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The cited authors speculated that disintegration of the bacterial biofilm using NaOCl might result in better penetration of ozone into the bacterial biofilm and the dentinal tubules.</s><s>This supports the application of gaseous ozone as an adjunctive disinfection method in combination with an antibacterial irrigation protocol and instrumentation of the root canal.</s><s>However, previous studies also demonstrated complete removal of E. faecalis after using solely NaOCl <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> questioning an additional antimicrobial effect of ozone.</s><s>The present study also analyzed the long-term antimicrobial effect of the various disinfection methods with further incubation of exemplary samples of each group that demonstrated no bacterial growth immediately after treatment.</s><s>Nearly 80% of ozone and laser treated samples revealed further bacterial growth whereas less than 50% of the samples with medical dressings showed further bacterial growth.</s><s>These results also indicate little additional effects of the application of ozone of diode laser treatment in the present study.</s><s>In this aspect, the abovementioned carry-over effect should be taken into consideration especially with the use of medical dressings.</s><s>Parts of the active form of the medical dressings might have followed along with the sample into dilution series and possibly on the culture plate.</s><s>A high enough concentration of the disinfectant might result in false negative results: the bacteria are not killed but might be hampered in growing because of the bacteriostatic effect.</s><s>This might result in a too positive evaluation of the antibacterial methods tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, no blocking solutions for CHX like Tween 80 and alpha-lecithin or Ca(OH) 2 like citric acid after the removal of the medical dressings have been applied and consequently the above described effects of overestimation of the antibacterial effects of the medical dressings cannot be excluded.</s><s>Nevertheless, further effects of the mentioned blocking solutions can also not be excluded.</s><s>Furthermore, the antibacterial effectiveness of calcium hydroxide is decreasing after application because of the reduced availability of hydroxyl ions in solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and this also should minimize the carry-over effect.</s><s>In addition, bacterial reduction was comparable between the application of medical dressings and irrigation using NaOCl and laser or ozone.</s><s>Moreover, further bacterial growth in vivo might also be limited by complete three-dimensional root canal filling and further effects of medical dressings after incomplete removal might also occur.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, laser assisted disinfection revealed effective bacterial reduction in combination with antibacterial irrigation using 1% NaOCl and was equally effective compared to the investigated medical dressings Ca(OH) 2 and CHX-Gel or application of gaseous ozone for planktonic and adherent cells of E. faecalis.</s></p><p><s>These results were corroborated by a previous study that investigated the antibacterial effect of a 908 nm diode laser (2.5 W) on E. faecalis.</s><s>E. faecalis was completely eliminated using antibacterial irrigation protocols with NaOCl <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>Another study analyzed the antibacterial efficacy of diode laser irradiation (940 nm, 3.5 W) compared to three other root canal disinfection methods: conventional irrigation, EndoActivator, and PIPS (photon-initiated photoacoustic streaming).</s><s>Samples that were treated with diode laser irradiation revealed the highest antibacterial efficacy against E. faecalis compared to all other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, the combination of gaseous ozone or diode laser with chemomechanical canal enlargement and NaOCl irrigation may offer an approach to single-visit root canal treatments in endodontic therapy.</s><s>Nevertheless, activation of antibacterial irrigation solutions, namely, NaOCl, has not been analyzed in the present experimental approach and could also contribute to sufficient bacterial reduction in a single-visit endodontic treatment approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date, a multiple-visit approach in endodontic therapy is still commonly performed.</s><s>In a systematic review on nonsurgical single-visit versus multiple-visit endodontic treatment, Wong et al. described that up to 90% of clinical practitioners prefer a multiple-visit approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, medical dressings still play an important role in endodontic therapy.</s><s>Ca(OH) 2 is the most frequently used intracanal medical dressing besides its questioned antimicrobial effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s>The results of our investigation demonstrated significantly better antibacterial action of Ca(OH) 2 and CHX-Gel (1%) against planktonic and adherent cells of E. faecalis after using it for 7 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> compared to disinfection solely using diode laser or ozone without an antibacterial irrigation protocol.</s><s>For planktonic bacteria, Ca(OH) 2 demonstrated a significantly higher bacterial reduction compared to CHX-Gel.</s><s>No significant differences were found comparing the antibacterial effectiveness of Ca(OH) 2 and CHX-Gel (1%) for adherent bacteria.</s><s>These results were confirmed by a previous study where Ca(OH) 2 was found to be as effective as 1% CHX in reducing E. faecalis at 3 and 8 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, intracanal remnants of Ca(OH) 2 hinder the sealing quality of root canal filling materials, putting a risk to reinfection of the root canal system after obturation.</s><s>CHX-Gel is considered to be an alternative medical dressing to Ca(OH) 2 .</s><s>This topic needs to be addressed in future studies.</s></p></div>
