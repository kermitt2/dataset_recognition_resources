<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative Studies</head><p><s>Results from two independent qualitative studies of stiffness in people with RA conducted independently were presented to both groups in a common 10-minute session.</s><s>A US study was comprised of 4 focus groups with 20 patients; a UK study included one-on-one interviews with 16 patients.</s></p><p><s>In both studies, patients described stiffness as a common RA feature, which varied within and among individuals, and with levels of RA disease activity, results consistent with our earlier foundational qualitative studies and Delphi exercises on RA flares <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s><s>Changes in stiffness were often associated with changes in other symptoms, especially pain.</s><s>Many people reported stiffness that was not limited to the morning, but occurred at various times or throughout the entire day.</s><s>Furthermore, stiffness was not always limited to specific joints, but could vary in location.</s><s>Exacerbating factors included weather and immobility, and alleviating factors and self-management strategies were described, also consistent with earlier work for multiple RA flare symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</s><s>Of note, in both studies participants described stiffness most often in terms of its impact on day-to-day life activities including getting dressed, driving, cooking, attending (or not) a social event.</s><s>This is in line with prior OMERACT work that emphasizes the importance of evaluating symptom impact, rather than just symptom amount or severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Breakout Group Discussions</head><p><s>The two parallel groups (N=20 and N=16) discussed quantitative and qualitative results.</s><s>Although in the plenary, data from RCTs and LOSs showed that stiffness intensity was clinically and statistically higher in flaring patients vs. those not in flare, there was uncertainty in both groups whether only measuring intensity adequately characterizes stiffness across individuals, and with varying levels of disease activity.</s><s>Similarly the usefulness of querying only duration of morning stiffness in RCTs was also questioned but no consensus was achieved.</s></p><p><s>There was general agreement that further research is needed to identify an optimal approach to measuring relevant aspects of stiffness in RA (e.g., duration, intensity, impact) that includes incorporation of terms that patients use (e.g.</s><s>restricted movement, joint tightness) to describe stiffness.</s><s>There was also recognition that stiffness is a feature of several rheumatic conditions (PMR, AS, PsA, OA), and of the value of exploring common aspects of stiffness across diseases.</s><s>Finally, there was endorsement of interest in creating an OMERACT Stiffness special interest group to coordinate further research across conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Qualitative and quantitative studies have confirmed that stiffness is an important symptom experienced by most patients with RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, and was included in the RA Flare Core Domain Set ratified at OMERACT11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>Two qualitative studies were conducted by members of our group to further explore the experience of stiffness in RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>.</s><s>Similar themes were identified in both studies and incorporated into conceptual frameworks encompassing the heterogeneous experience of stiffness impact, intensity, timing, location and duration in people with RA.</s><s>Moreover, stiffness could independently affect physical, emotional, and social health, distinct from other RA symptoms.</s><s>The measurement of stiffness is challenging due to the complexity of the experience and narrow focus of existing measures.</s><s>The extent to which there is overlap among the different stiffness dimensions (duration, intensity, impact, location, timing) requires additional study.</s><s>Key areas that remain unclear include: Is morning stiffness duration a proxy for intensity?</s><s>Does a measure of stiffness impact provide additional explanatory information beyond intensity and/or duration?</s><s>Other aspects of stiffness that require additional examination are: Does the relative importance of stiffness vary according to overall levels of disease activity?</s><s>Is there a difference in terms of importance or magnitude for stiffness in disease worsening vs improvement?</s><s>Answering these questions is necessary to determine how many aspects must be measured to adequately reflect the construct in RA in different contexts (e.g.</s><s>RCT vs LOS, different RCT study designs).</s></p><p><s>In summary, a growing body of evidence suggests that additional work may be needed to better characterize and measure stiffness in RA and other rheumatic diseases.</s><s>While people who are experiencing an RA flare report significantly higher levels of stiffness, other factors such as impact on quality of life, timing, location, and duration may also be important.</s><s>A new OMERACT SIG would be well positioned to develop this research agenda and identify optimal ways to measure stiffness in RA and other rheumatic diseases.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Stiffness Intensity Numerical Rating Scale</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,107.40,62.00,457.20,79.64" type="bitmap" /></figure>
