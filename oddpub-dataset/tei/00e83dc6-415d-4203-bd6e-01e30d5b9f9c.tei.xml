<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>IMPORTANCE Abnormal reward processing is suggested to underlie the formation of psychotic symptoms, likely driven by elevated ventral striatal (VS) dopamine levels.</s><s>Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies reveal alterations of VS activity during reward processing in patients with chronic psychosis and first episode of psychosis, as well as individuals at high risk for psychosis, but findings are inconclusive, conflicting, and difficult to subject to meta-analysis without introducing bias because several studies reported that findings were not statistically significant but did not report statistics.</s></p><p><s>OBJECTIVE To assess the differences between patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and healthy controls in VS activation during reward processing.</s></p><p><s>DATA SOURCES Web of Knowledge database (incorporating Web of Science and MEDLINE) until July 2015, including references of eligible articles and reviews.</s></p><p><s>STUDY SELECTION Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing VS activity during monetary reward processing between patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders or clinical or genetic high-risk state for psychosis and healthy controls.</s></p><p><s>DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Statistics and thresholds related to the main outcome measures and potential moderators were independently retrieved by 2 investigators.</s><s>Effect sizes were analyzed using MetaNSUE, a random-effects method that enables the unbiased inclusion of nonstatistically significant unreported effects.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>To address these inconsistencies, we present here, to our knowledge, the first systematic review and neurofunctional meta-analysis of VS activation during reward processing in patients at HR, those experiencing their first episode of psychosis, and those with chronic psychosis.</s><s>In particular, we focused on reward anticipation and feedback, as well as reward prediction error.</s><s>We investigated the robustness of the metaanalytic findings and the effects of potential clinical and methodological moderators.</s><s>In addition, we present an innovative methodological approach to include all studies even if they only report that they did not find any statistically significant effect (but not the specific effect size or related statistics).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Search Strategies</head><p><s>Two investigators (A.S., P.F.-P.) conducted an independent systematic 2-step literature search to identify relevant articles.</s><s>First, the Web of Knowledge database (incorporating Web of Science and MEDLINE) was searched to detect abstracts in English published through July 2015 (keywords: "psychosis," "schizophrenia," "high-risk psychosis," "salience," "fMRI," "ventral striatum," "reward," "prediction error").</s><s>Second, Scopus was used to detect citations of previous systematic reviews and to perform manual searches of the reference lists of the retrieved articles.</s><s>Identified articles were then screened according to the selection criteria.</s><s>The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist 46 was adopted (eTable 1 in the Supplement).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection Criteria</head><p><s>Studies were eligible for inclusion if they (1) were original articles written in English; (2) compared patients with ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders 47 and/or DSM-5 <ref type="bibr">48</ref> diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders or clinical <ref type="bibr">49</ref> or genetic <ref type="bibr">50</ref> HR state for psychosis with healthy controls; and (3) investigated fMRI VS responses explicitly during monetary reward processing, in particular contrasts addressing reward anticipation, feedback of reward, or reward prediction error (Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s><s>If available, multiple contrasts from the same study were included.</s><s>Studies were excluded if they (1) only included anticipation of monetary loss, aversive feedback, and aversive predictive error or other salience-related contrasts (eTables 2 and 3 in the Supplement) or (2) used overlapping data sets <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">21</ref> (we included the original and larger data sets <ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">18</ref> instead of pooled results <ref type="bibr">21</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>As detailed in the Statistical Analysis section, we did not exclude studies that did not report effect sizes; note that exclusion of studies with statistically nonsignificant differences would bias the meta-analysis toward those studies with large differences.</s><s>Literature search was summarized according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses (PRISMA) guidelines (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). <ref type="bibr">51</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recorded Variables</head><p><s>Data extraction and quality assessment were independently performed by 2 investigators (A.S., P.F.-P.).</s><s>The following variables Notably, whole-brain studies did not report the mean VS effect but the peak VS effect.</s><s>This latter effect is larger than the mean VS effect, and its use would thus bias the meta-analysis.</s><s>To address this issue, whole-brain coordinates and t values of the maxima were introduced into anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping <ref type="bibr">52,</ref><ref type="bibr">53</ref> in order to recreate the image of effect size based on the correlations between adjacent voxels, and the mean effect of all voxels with any probability of being located in the nucleus accumbens according to the Harvard-Oxford atlas 54 was then extracted.</s><s>To overcome the potential downward bias associated to this estimation, 53 maps were scaled to make differences with ROI studies minimal.</s><s>Also, analyses were repeated after only including the latter.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>As noted, some studies with nonsignificant group differences did not report any statistics (eg, t, F, or P values) that could be converted into effect sizes.</s><s>Exclusion of these findings ("nonstatistically significant unreported effects" [NSUEs]) would bias the meta-analysis-taken to the extreme, including only the 3 studies reporting differences but excluding the 1000 studies not detecting any difference (as detailed in the eMethods section in the Supplement, we also empirically test this bias with simulations).</s><s>Inclusion of studies with NSUEs by assuming them to have a null effect size would be a more conservative option but still not free from bias. <ref type="bibr">53</ref></s><s>o correctly include studies with NSUEs into meta-analyses, we developed a new method, called MetaNSUE, based on multiple imputations algorithms. <ref type="bibr">55</ref></s><s>First, the MetaNSUE calculates the bounds of nonstatistical significance of each study with NSUEs (ie, the unreported t value or r coefficient must be within these bounds) and converts them to unbiased effect sizes (Cohen d or z) using a standard formula. <ref type="bibr">53</ref></s><s>Second, an estimation of the parameters for subsequent imputations is conducted by maximizing the likelihood that the reported effect sizes have those values, as well as the likelihood that the unreported effect sizes are within those bounds.</s><s>Relevantly, these parameters include the between-study heterogeneity (ie, random differences between studies beyond those due to sampling) and potential covariates used to individually predict the expected effect size of each study (with or without NSUEs).</s><s>Third, multiple imputations The clinical HR state was defined according to international and well-validated criteria detailed elsewhere, <ref type="bibr">50</ref> which include (1) attenuated psychotic symptoms, (2) brief and limited intermittent psychotic symptoms, (3) genetic risk and deterioration syndrome, and (4) BS. b These studies (may have) included patients with diagnoses other than SZ, SA, or schizophreniform disorders.</s></p><p><s>of the unreported effect sizes are randomly created according to the expected value (within-and between-study), variance, and statistical significance bounds of each study with NSUEs.</s><s>This step is needed to create realistic "noisy" imputations because imputing the unreported effect sizes using their expected value would mean assuming that within-study variability and betweenstudy heterogeneity are null.</s><s>Finally, a standard meta-analysis is separately conducted for each set of imputed effect sizes using restricted maximum-likelihood random-effect models, 56 and results from these meta-analyses are pooled using a standard formula for multiple imputations. <ref type="bibr">57</ref></s><s>mpirical validation using simulations showed that estimations were strongly biased when conducting a standard metaanalysis without NSUEs (d bias = 0.22), moderately negatively biased when converting NSUEs to zeros (d bias = −0.07),</s><s>and nearly unbiased when using MetaNSUE (d bias &lt; 0.001, even when statistics were seldom reported).</s><s>See eMethods in the Supplement details of the procedure and the validation.</s></p><p><s>A separate meta-analysis was conducted for group differences in left and right VS activation.</s><s>Robustness of these differences was assessed by studying the between-study heterogeneity, estimating the potential reporting bias (metaregression by standard error to detect whether results from small imprecise studies might have been reported only if they were significant <ref type="bibr">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr">[60]</ref> ), and conducting jackknife analyses (ie, iteratively repeating the meta-analysis with all studies but 1 in or-der to detect whether results may be driven by a single study).</s><s>Differences between left and right group differences in activation were also investigated, along with subgroups (medication-free, patients, HR individuals, ROI studies) and metaregressions by mean age, percentage of males, percentage of medicated patients, publication year, and quality score.</s><s>Metaanalysis of the correlations between psychotic symptoms and VS activation was also conducted.</s><s>Finally, we performed an exploratory analysis treating all 3 domains (anticipation/ feedback and prediction error) together.</s></p><p><s>On the basis of the results of the empirical validation, moderator variables were included in the maximum-likelihood step.</s><s>All findings with P &lt; .05</s><s>are reported as trends, but given the multiple tests conducted (3 different reward processing domains and 2 brain sides), only those at P ≤ .05/6</s><s>= .008</s><s>were considered statistically significant.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reward Anticipation</head><p><s>This meta-analysis included 23 studies (n = 917) (see Table <ref type="table">)</ref>, with reported group differences in  residual heterogeneity or potential reporting bias was observed (P = .12-.92).</s><s>Jackknife analyses showed similar hypoactivation when any single study was discarded (left d range, −0.45 to −0.58; right d range, −0.66 to −0.77; P &lt; .001 in all cases) or when the meta-analysis was restricted to studies in medication-free patients or to studies using ROIs (left/right d = −0.45/−0.72 and −0.59/−0.65,</s><s>respectively; P &lt; .001 in all cases).</s><s>No differences were detected between left and right VS (P = .18).</s><s>No effects of age, sex, antipsychotic medication use, publication year, or quality score were observed (P = .14</s><s>to &gt;.99).</s><s>Similar hypoactivation was found in patients and HR individuals (left/right d = −0.55/−0.67</s><s>vs −0.44/−0.78;</s><s>P = .53/.57).</s></p><p><s>Eleven studies analyzed the correlation between VS activation and negative symptoms, 15,17,23,24,27-30,32,33 and we were able to retrieve the correlation coefficient in 5 (left) and 2 (right) studies, with the remaining studies reporting NSUEs.</s><s>Left hypoactivation was more pronounced in patients with higher negative symptoms (r = −0.41;</s><s>P &lt; .001),</s><s>an effect that was not evident at the right VS (P = .86).</s><s>No residual heterogeneity or potential reporting bias was observed (P = .35-.96).</s><s>Jackknife analyses (only conducted for left VS) showed similar correlations when any single study was discarded (r range, −0.36 to −0.45; P &lt; .003 in all cases).</s></p><p><s>Six studies had investigated the relationship with positive symptoms 20,23,24,27,32,33 and we were able to retrieve the correlation coefficient in 2 (left) and 3 (right) studies, with the remaining studies reporting NSUEs.</s><s>No relationship between VS activation and positive symptoms could be detected (P = .47-.79), although this result should be taken with caution because only 6 studies could be included and there was residual heterogeneity among them (left/right: I 2 = 72%; P = .03/.003, probably due to studies reporting opposite findings).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reward Feedback</head><p><s>This meta-analysis included 9 studies (n = 358) (Table <ref type="table">)</ref>, with reported group differences in 1 study, and NSUEs in the remaining studies.</s><s>Patients showed significant hypoactivation in both left and right VS ( left/right d= −0.57/−0.56;</s><s>P &lt; .001)</s><s>(eFigure 2 in the Supplement), and no residual heterogeneity or potential reporting bias was observed (P = .89-.93).</s><s>One may wonder that a single study makes the meta-analysis statistically significant.</s><s>However, it must be noted that the empirical validation showed that MetaNSUE's false-positive rate is not increased when only 1 study reports significant differences.</s><s>That said, jackknife analyses showed similar hypoactivation when any study with NSUEs was discarded (left d range, −0.59 to−0.64;</s><s>right d range, −0.57 to −0.62; P &lt; .001 in all cases) but no differences if the only study detecting group differences <ref type="bibr">23</ref> was discarded (P = .95-.96), indicating a lower replicability of this finding, which should thus be taken with caution.</s><s>No differences were detected between left and right VS (P = .72).</s><s>No meta-regression analyses were conducted because of the high probability that the study detecting differences behaved as a leverage point.</s><s>No relationship with negative or positive symptoms could be observed (eResults in the Supplement).</s></p></div>

also showed VS hypoactivation but should be carefully considered, because findings were driven by a single study in the first (although validation showed an excellent control of the false-positive rate) and were not statistically significant in the second (probably due to betweenstudy heterogeneity).</s><s>No differences were observed between left and right VS in any of the reward processes.</s><s>Our metaanalysis further showed that left VS activation during reward anticipation was negatively correlated with negative symptoms in patients.</s></p><p><s>The robust finding of VS hypoactivation during reward anticipation may support that psychosis is characterized by impaired learning of stimulus-reinforcement associations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref

has been proposed to be mediated by phasic dopamine increase in the striatum and contributes to the wanting of reward. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>A recent meta-analysis has shown that

stress-associated striatal dopamine release <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> may also impede a phasic dopamine release in response to contextually relevant (eg, reward indicating) cues, leading to decreased differentiation between the responses to relevant and irrelevant stimuli. <ref type="bibr">65</ref></s><s>In this framework, the VS hypoactivation during reward anticipation can be taken as a measure of altered salience processing because it reflects a blunted response toward reward-indicating compared with neutral cues.</s><s>However, general caution is recommended in relating dopamine release to neural activation because they are often not measured in the same region (elevated dopamine levels have been found in the associative striatum <ref type="bibr">63,</ref><ref type="bibr">64</ref> and different VS definitions are used across studies) and also because fMRI signals have limited statistical relationships to neurochemical markers. <ref type="bibr">66</ref></s><s>For example, sophisticated attempts to relate VS fMRI signals during reward anticipation with measures of dopamine release induced by monetary incentive delay task have revealed mixed results. <ref type="bibr">67,</ref><ref type="bibr">68</ref></s><s>The Discussion section should be read with this caveat in mind.</s></p><p><s>We found that patients also showed a trend for right VS hypoactivation during reward prediction error processing.</s><s>However, the robustness of this meta-analysis was limited by a relevant between-study heterogeneity, which is probably due to the different reinforcement learning algorithm, <ref type="bibr">38,</ref><ref type="bibr">40,</ref><ref type="bibr">42</ref> and the diverse psychological task designs and contrasts used across studies. <ref type="bibr">26,</ref><ref type="bibr">39,</ref><ref type="bibr">41,</ref><ref type="bibr">43</ref></s><s>Previous studies in healthy participants combining fMRI and positron-emission tomography measures showed that the right VS prediction error signal is negatively associated with VS presynaptic dopamine level. <ref type="bibr">69,</ref><ref type="bibr">70</ref></s><s>We could thus speculate that the elevated striatal dopamine level in psychosis 14 might be associated with the right VS hypoactivation during prediction error processing that we found.</s><s>In line with this argumentation, a behavioral measure of aberrant salience attribution (derived from the salience attribution task), which is heightened in patients with schizophrenia, 71 was found to be positively correlated with striatal dopamine synthesis capacity and negatively correlated with fMRI striatal prediction errors signal in health controls. <ref type="bibr">72</ref></s><s>urrent antipsychotic drug use was not found to moderate the reduced VS activation during reward anticipation.</s><s>However, most studies included patients treated with both typical and atypical antipsychotics, and it has been proposed that the effect of several atypical drugs may result from a dopaminemediated attenuation of aberrant salience processing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">65</ref> whereas typical but not atypical drugs have been shown to reduce the VS response to reward-indicating stimuli. <ref type="bibr">15</ref></s><s>In line with this finding, a recent meta-analysis in psychosis did not find a significant modulation of antipsychotics on striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">62</ref></s><s>e found that left VS hypoactivation during reward anticipation was more pronounced in patients with higher negative psychotic symptoms in accordance with evidence from a previous meta-analysis. <ref type="bibr">73</ref></s><s>Our correlation findings thus suggest that VS hypoactivation may impair the positive and motivational effect of rewarding events and in turn promote negative symptoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>This corresponds with a first pilot study, which suggested that decreased left VS activation is inversely correlated with the severity of negative symptoms in antipsychotic-free patients. <ref type="bibr">16</ref></s><s>The authors suggested that high striatal dopamine turnover may increase the "noise" in the reward system, thus interfering with the neuronal processing of reward-predicting cues by phasic dopamine release. <ref type="bibr">16</ref></s><s>This, in turn, may lead to negative symptoms, which group in 2 factors, one involving diminished expression of affect and alogia and the second involving avolition including anhedonia and asociality. <ref type="bibr">74</ref></s><s>Our findings may also have some translational effects, given that negative psychotic symptoms are refractory to all available treatments. <ref type="bibr">75</ref></s><s>However, this conclusion requires further research given that there is also evidence showing that dopamine function in the VS was inversely correlated with negative symptom severity. <ref type="bibr">63</ref></s><s>Furthermore, the relation between VS activation during reward anticipation and positive symptoms requires further investigation because only 6 studies were available and there was residual heterogeneity among them.</s></p><p><s>This study has some limitations.</s><s>Findings of VS hypoactivation during reward feedback and prediction error, as well as the correlation with positive symptoms, are less robust than the hypoactivation during reward anticipation or the correlation with negative symptoms and should be taken with caution until more studies are available; the first finding might also reflect that VS activation is not crucially involved during the feedback phase in the monetary incentive delay task. <ref type="bibr">76</ref></s><s>We could not explore whether group differences may be due to negative symptoms.</s><s>Region of interest delimitation was slightly heterogeneous across studies, resulting in different VS definitions.</s><s>Similarly, recreation of images from peak t values may not be free from downward bias, 53 although maps were scaled and analyses were repeated after only including the latter.</s><s>To contain consistency in fMRI contrasts, we focused on rewarding stimuli without considering anticipation of monetary loss, aversive feedback, and aversive predictive error or other saliencerelated contrasts due to the high heterogeneity of these contrasts; however, a preliminary meta-analysis during loss anticipation revealed bilateral VS hypoactivation in psychotic patients, suggesting that VS hypoactivation in psychosis may be associated with a general deficit in salience processing (eTable 2 in the Supplement).</s><s>More studies are needed to support this finding.</s><s>The present analysis was restricted to the VS given its relevance during reward processing and psychosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>However, the VS does not function in isolation during reward processing and future studies should consider this process from a network perspective. <ref type="bibr">77</ref></s><s> whole-brain analysis will be of interest when more wholebrain studies are available.</s><s>Finally, the lack of a significant effect in the moderator variable for disease stage does not necessarily mean that no differences exist between the groups.</s><s>More studies for each group, particularly for the HR group, are needed to draw robust inferences.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>7 (left) and 9 (right) studies, and NSUEs in the remaining
