(2016b)</ref> presented the model of Within and Between Score for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (WBSMDA) to predict potential miRNAs associated with diseases.</s><s>In this method, Within-Score and Between-Score about miRNAs and diseases were calculated by integrating miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, known miRNA-disease associations and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and then these two scores were combined to acquire the relation probability of miRNA-disease pair.</s><s>Unfortunately, how to more reasonably integrate Within-scores and Between-score to calculate relevant probabilities remained unresolved.</s><s>What's more, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chen and Yan, 2014</ref>) also proposed Regularized Least Squares for MiRNA-Disease Association (RLSMDA) to reveal the unknown relations between miRNAs and diseases.</s><s>RLSMDA was a semi-supervised method, so it didn't need negative samples.</s><s>However, the optimal values of parameters in RLSMDA had not yet been obtained, which might affect the prediction performance.</s><s>By implementing random walk on the miRNA-miRNA functional similarity network, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al. (2012)</ref> developed another model named Random Walk with Restart for MiRNA-Disease Association (RWRMDA) to identify miRNAs related with diseases.</s><s>The outstanding prediction performance of RWRMDA had been confirmed by a number of experiments, but there was still a main limitation in this model.</s><s>RWRMDA couldn't be applied to predict the relations between miRNAs and new diseases without any known associated miRNAs.</s><s>Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al. (2017a)</ref> introduced a novel model called Ranking-based KNN for miRNA-Disease Association prediction (RKNNMDA) to uncover the potential associations between miRNAs and diseases by applying K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to obtain k-nearest-neighbors both for miRNAs and diseases.</s><s>After resorting the k-nearest-neighbors based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) ranking model, they got the ranking of association probability of disease-miRNA pairs by implementing weighted voting.</s><s>RKNNMDA was capable of being implemented on new diseases, which overcame the biggest limitation of RWRMDA.</s><s>It was a pity that there were also some limitations in this method.</s><s>RKNNMDA could not be used to score all miRNAs based on the same criteria, especially for miRNAs with more known related diseases.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mørk et al. (2014)</ref> proposed a reliable calculation model of miRNA-Protein-Disease (miRPD) which didn't directly predict the miRNAs related with diseases but through proteins.</s><s>The relations between miRNAs and diseases were uncovered by integrating the predicted and known miRNA-protein associations with the associations of proteindisease text mined from the literature.</s><s>And the prediction performance of miRPD would be further improved if more involved datasets were taken into account.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Xuan et al. (2015)</ref> developed a novel method of MIRNAs associated with Diseases Prediction (MIDP) to reveal the associations between miRNAs and diseases by implementing random walk on a miRNA functional similarity network where the similarity scores of miRNAs pairs were obtained through their related diseases.</s><s>What's more, Xuan et al. also presented its extension method MIDPE to predict the miRNAs related with new diseases.</s><s>In addition, by constructing a high-dimensional vector space to store the distribution information on miRNAs and diseases, Pasquier et al. <ref type="bibr">(Pasquier and Gardes, 2016)</ref> proposed MiRAI to identify the miRNAs associated with diseases based on the similarity of the high-dimensional vectors composed of the distribution information on miRNAs and diseases.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Xuan et al. (2013)</ref> presented an effective model named Human Diseaserelated MiRNA Prediction (HDMP) where the calculation method of miRNA functional similarity was improved by taking more related information into account.</s><s>miRNAs in the same family or cluster were assigned higher weights since they were more likely to be associated with diseases with phenotype similarity.</s><s>In this method, the sub-scores of the miRNA's k neighbors were equal to the product of the neighbor's weight and the miRNA functional similarity, and then by adding the subscores of k neighbors, the relevance score of a miRNA-disease pair was obtained.</s><s>In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2018a)</ref> proposed Network Distance Analysis for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (NDAMDA) to detect the miRNAs associated with diseases.</s><s>Compared to other methods, the improvement of NDAMDA lied in that in addition to the direct network distance between two studied diseases (miRNAs), the respective mean distances for each of them and all the rest of diseases (miRNAs) were taken into consideration.</s><s>By implementing the matrix completion algorithm to update the adjacency matrix which recorded the known associations of disease-miRNA pairs in HMDD and then uncovering the unknown relations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Li et al. (2017)</ref> developed a method of Matrix Completion for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction model (MCMDA) without the need of negative samples.</s><s>Compared with other computational models, the biggest advantage of MCMDA was that it only required known miRNA-disease associations, which also led to that MCMDA couldn't be introduced to predict potential associated miRNAs for new diseases or potential associated diseases for new miRNAs.</s><s>Furthermore, the optimal parameters of this method were still unknown.</s><s>In addition, by integrating miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and miRNA-disease associations confirmed by experiments into a heterogeneous graph, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chen et al. (2016c)</ref> presented a model of Heterogeneous Graph Inference for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (HGIMDA) to reveal the unknown relations of miRNA-disease pairs by incorporating related data into a heterogeneous graph and summarizing all paths with the length equal to three to calculate the association probability of disease-miRNA pair.</s><s>Unfortunately, limitations also existed in this method that for those miRNAs with more known related diseases, scores made by HGIMDA were generally higher than those miRNAs with less.</s><s>Later, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chen et al. (2018b)</ref> proposed another method called Graph Regression for MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (GRMDA).</s><s>In this method, by using two matrix decomposition methods to extract important correlation properties and filter noise, graph regression was performed synchronously in three potential spaces including the associated space, miRNA similarity space, and disease similarity space to reveal the potential disease-miRNAs associations.</s><s>However, there were still some problems of GRMDA to be settled.</s><s>For example, according to the size of the matrix, how to choose the optimal parameters in SVD and PLS remained unsolved.</s><s>By optimizing the existing method for maximizing the flow of information, which was mainly used to prioritize diseaseassociated protein-coding genes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yu et al.
