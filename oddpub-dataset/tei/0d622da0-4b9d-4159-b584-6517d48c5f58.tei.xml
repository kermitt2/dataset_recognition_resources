<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>To date, no clear consensus exists on whether a full hiatal dissection and suture hiatal closure should be performed as a standardized step of magnetic sphincter augmentation.</s><s>This decision is at the surgeon's discretion and usually depends on the intraoperative presence and size of a hiatal hernia <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> .</s><s>One advantage of focused over full hiatal dissection is that the hiatal/gastric anatomy remains intact and therefore makes a reoperation, if necessary, uncomplicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</s><s>On the contrary, crural closure as a routine step of laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is associated with lower postoperative rates of hiatal herniation and possibly better reflux control but may result in a higher incidence of dysphagia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Former studies presenting outcomes of magnetic sphincter augmentation mostly included both, patients after exclusive MSA and those with additional hiatal repair, thus, making it difficult to evaluate the impact of cruroplasty.</s><s>In the current study, a consecutive series of 37 initial patients, treated with exclusive MSA, was followed by 31 patients that had undergone hiatal repair.</s><s>Patients were classified into 3 groups according to the presence of a hiatal hernia and performed procedure (HR vs NHR).</s><s>Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Postoperative outcomes and Quality of Life results based on surgical procedure.</s><s>Error analysis: standard deviation.</s><s>Numbers provided in tables are medians (IQR).</s><s>*GERD-HRQL total score ranges from 0-50; † PPI(s) = Proton pump inhibitors; ‡ BMI: Body Mass Index.</s></p><p><s>The major finding of this study was a trend toward better reflux control and GERD symptom relief after crural closure compared to exclusive MSA in patients with a hiatal hernia.</s><s>Furthermore, crural closure did not lead to increased dysphagia rates.</s><s>Due to the relatively small sample sizes differences between groups did not reach statistical significance.</s><s>While both surgical techniques led to satisfying outcomes, crural closure resulted in a higher rate of negative postoperative pH-results than exclusive MSA.</s><s>This is comparable to the findings of Bonavina et al. who reported a negative pH rate of 75% five years after magnetic sphincter augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Comparing MSA to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF), previous studies found a more efficient reduction of the baseline percentage time pH &lt; 4 following LNF than after MSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>Further, LNF was reportedly leading to significant lower acid exposure of the distal esophagus and PPI intake than MSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>This might be due to the impact of hiatal closure in LNF patients that was not performed in the majority of MSA patients.</s></p><p><s>Louie et al. described in 2013 that the hiatal repair may not only be as important as the LES reinforcement in reflux control, as was shown in 1971 by Woodward et al., but also contributes more to the LES pressure, than a Nissen fundoplication does <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The 100% rate of heartburn elimination after crural closure in this series exceeds both, the one following exclusive MSA and the previously reported 94% of heartburn relief after LINX implantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, this high   percentage of heartburn relief matches the rate of 96.5% found after LNF <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>Satisfaction rates regarding overall outcome and heartburn relief were comparable between groups in the recent study.</s><s>This is consistent with the fact that other studies did not find significant differences in overall satisfaction rates comparing MSA with LNF <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> .</s><s>The rate of elimination of regurgitations varied between groups and ranged from 91%-100%.</s><s>These numbers are acceptable considering that LNF usually leads to elimination in 94% <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>However, other studies described elimination of regurgitations in 100% (n = 28) after MSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The percentage of patients that could eliminate their PPI use was comparable between procedures.</s><s>Intake of acid suppression medication ranges between 8%-20% after MSA and 8-14% after LNF <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> .</s><s>With 13% of HR patients using PPIs in this series, crural closure in MSA patients appears to be leading to results as those after laparoscopic fundoplication.</s></p><p><s>The significantly decreased GERD-HRQL total score after surgery in all 3 groups indicates a significant increase of GERD-specific quality of life after MSA.</s><s>This matches the observations of Bonavina et al. who reported a significant reduction of the mean GERD-HRQL total score from 25.7 to 3.3 four years after MSA.</s></p><p><s>The current study showed excellent alimentary satisfaction ranging from 8-10 out of possible 10, indicating that patients are comfortable after LINX implantation.</s></p><p><s>No perioperative complications occurred in this series while rates of postoperative interventions and device removal were low and comparable with those published previously.</s><s>In the evaluation phase of LINX, reflected by the pivotal trial published in 2013, 19 out of 100 patients underwent dilatation due to dysphagia after MSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s><s>Bonavina et al. described a dilation rate of only 2% <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref>

series of different surgical techniques poses the problem of varying follow-up times.</s><s>Further, postoperative objective testing was not performed uniformly at a specific follow-up time resulting in different long "surgery to EFT"-times in NHR and HR groups.</s><s>Hence, the comparison of outcomes and postoperative EFT results between groups might be biased.</s><s>Acknowledging these concerns, we have initiated to schedule all LINX patients for objective testing at the 1-year follow-up visit.</s><s>We intend to continue reporting outcomes and to evaluate if results change with longer follow-up.</s><s>The relatively small sample sizes of groups prevented differences from reaching statistical significance.</s><s>However, our findings add important information on the impact of crural closure during magnetic sphincter augmentation on reflux control.</s><s>Comparing the two surgical procedures (MSA vs. MSA with crural closure), there was a clear trend of crural closure resulting in superior reflux control and gastrointestinal symptom relief without increasing dysphagia rates.</s><s>Further prospective trials with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the advantages of hiatal repair over exclusive magnetic sphincter augmentation in GERD patients with hiatal hernia.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Magnetic LES augmentation leads to significant gastrointestinal symptom relief, increased GERD-specific quality of life and good alimentary satisfaction with low perioperative morbidity rates.</s><s>In patients with hiatal hernia, crural closure tends to result in better reflux control and GERD symptom relief compared to exclusive MSA without increasing postoperative dysphagia rates.</s><s>Further studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm these findings.</s><s>Hiatal repair should be considered as routine step of magnetic sphincter augmentation in GERD patients with hiatal hernia.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Comparison of pre-and postoperative GERD-HRQL total scores (median with IQR) between groups (NHH left, NHR group mid, HR group right); the maximum total score reachable is 50, with a lower score indicating a better QOL.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,155.64,405.16,240.00,125.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
