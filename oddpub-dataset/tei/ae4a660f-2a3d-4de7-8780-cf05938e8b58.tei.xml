<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Vaccination remains one of the most efficient tools for reducing the burden of infectious diseases and safeguarding health.</s><s>However, there have been concerns about vaccine safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which may have an impact on vaccine acceptance.</s><s>Vaccines are obligatory in many countries and recommended in others; hence, they are managed in a paternalistic manner.</s><s>But patients and vaccine recipients have the right to make informed decisions.</s><s>We are also living in a 'post-trust' environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, which means that the public no longer puts faith in the regulators or industry without questioning.</s><s>It is not only the voice of the expert that is heard.</s><s>Information can be disseminated through social media quickly and globally, with no checks on accuracy or on how this information may be used or interpreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The public perceives risk differently from experts, and these differences may contribute to increasing vaccine hesitancy.</s><s>Healthcare professionals (HCPs) can play a key role in vaccination and to do so, need to develop risk communication strategies that build trust.</s></p><p><s>This includes active listening techniques, to understand how others are assessing and perceiving risk, and to use this information to encourage better informed decisions.</s></p><p><s>This paper attempts to reflect the paradigm shift towards increasing attention to the patient voice in vaccination and vaccine safety and looks at how listening to the patient voice is key in any risk communication strategy.</s></p><p><s>There is a need to develop proactive risk communication strategies that work both ways, that is to say build up trust between medical experts and patients, and vice versa.</s><s>Patients are not experts in the field of vaccines or risk assessments.</s><s>Communication needs to be clear and concise, without complicated jargon and allowing questions and seeking feedback regularly.</s><s>HCPs need to hear the patients.</s></p><p><s>The patient may voice subjective concerns and perceptions.</s><s>Experts who understand and address these concepts will be able to ensure that important messages are not lost or 'lingering in the air' causing confusion.</s></p><p><s>Regulatory agencies are encouraging patient empowerment; for example, the European Medicines Agency is providing direct access to information for those who request it <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>This approach provides additional transparency, which can help to build trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Recent work by Scherer et al. assessing the effect of safety information, showed that a concise summary can be useful, but too much detail (i.e. the detailed version of the Vaccine Adverse Reporting System) may have an adverse effect on vaccine acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Vaccine information is often technical, complex and difficult for a layperson to interpret, but if HCPs accessed this information to update their own knowledge, it could subsequently be used in two-way discussions with patients.</s></p><p><s>Meeting the objective of proactive communication requires going beyond information disclosure and forging a true alliance between vaccine recipients and/or their parents, patient organizations and HCPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Stronger individual and institutional relationships may be the right avenue to maintaining or restoring trust in public health and regulatory agencies, through which evidence-based vaccine safety information is delivered <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is recognized that the 'patient voice' is a complex and far-reaching subject that can only be covered as an overview in its entirety.</s><s>It may help to remember that both HCPs and patients share a common goal: to prevent illness while maintaining health.</s><s>Avoiding unnecessary conflicts due to misunderstandings and establishing what Fischhoff and Scheufele call 'fewer but better conflicts' <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> will help to mitigate the polarizing effects of 'vaccine controversies' while maintaining a stable line of communication between patients and HCPs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Who are the patients and what influences the patient voice?</head><p><s>The term 'patients' in this article extends to vaccine recipients and/or parents of vaccine recipients when the recipients are children.</s><s>They are identifiable partners in the vaccine debate because they are recipients of a medical intervention, even though most vaccine recipients are healthy.</s><s>In practice, patients may be exposed to many different vaccines, as either adults or children, and may speak on their own behalf or on behalf of patient organizations.</s><s>As a consequence of different patient guises, a wide range of voices may be heard.</s></p><p><s>The patient voice will be influenced by various individual filters and perceptions.</s><s>Psychometric risk studies of risk perception identified a set of variables to help explain how people perceive risks, demonstrating that people worry up to a thousand times more about involuntary risks (for example being forced to live next to a cell phone tower) compared with a voluntary risk (e.g. using a cell phone), and accept more easily risks that they feel in control of (e.g.</s><s>driving a car) compared with those they feel not in control of (e.g.</s><s>being flown in an airplane).</s><s>They also showed that people worry more about unfamiliar risks (e.g.</s><s>bird flu) compared with familiar ones (e.g.</s><s>seasonal flu) and are more concerned about highkill-size risks (e.g.</s><s>airplane accidents) versus low-kill-size ones (e.g. car accidents) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Specific to vaccine-risk perception, early accounts suggested that vaccines were perceived as only moderately unknown or dreaded.</s><s>People's perceptions of vaccines were comparable to those for aspirin as opposed to antibiotics or DNA technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>With the rapid advancement of vaccine research and development, as well as manufacturing technologies, this may have changed.</s></p><p><s>Specific to health and illness, key perception drivers include, for example, the high/low prevalence of a disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, perceived risk frequencies, availability and comprehensiveness of information, perceived dilemmas and ambiguities regarding how to interpret information, and the consequences for decisions to vaccinate or not, in addition to freeloading versus altruistic feelings [15e18].</s><s>Personal views and choices may be further influenced by levels of confidence and trust in institutions, complacency and, sometimes, personal convenience <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Attitudes, beliefs and behaviours that indicate concerns about vaccine safety have been shown to contribute substantially to under-immunization in the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Studies by Flynn and Ogden <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and by Downs et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> on vaccination showed how parents are trying to take into account complex and contradictory concerns as they have mixed feelings about the medical profession and the media e for example when taking into consideration the risk of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination versus the risk of related illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>These studies also highlight the concerns that parents may have in deliberating about vaccination, and it was noted that if health workers understand the parents' concerns, it is easier for them to address these concerns directly and help patients to make better informed decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The studies in MMR vaccination also showed how past vaccination histories play a role in the decision-making process.</s><s>If healthcare practitioners can address the concerns at the early vaccination time slots, this will benefit the uptake rate for later vaccination schedules <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Finally, these studies illustrated the gap between concerns identified among parentsdi.e. for adverse and longer-term effectsdand the confidence among experts in the safety of vaccines <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fostering two-way communication partnerships: the central role of the HCP</head><p><s>The physicianepatient relationship has been much discussed in modern medical literature and according to Goold and Lipkin it is the subject of some 8000 articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The essence of the relationship has a direct correlation with quality of care as a central feature of modern health care, which enables direct risk communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>A large European survey (n ¼ 5648) confirmed that people expect individualized safety information to be communicated to them and that HCPs are seen as the main trustworthy source of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The role of HCPs is essential in a patient/healthcare relationship.</s><s>Downs et al. pointed out that many parents lack basic knowledge on how vaccines work and find the standard information provided unhelpful <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>He also noted that those with the highest need seem to be the most vulnerable when it comes to confusing information <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Again, the ability to listen to patients and to understand their specific needs will help the HCP bridge the knowledge gap for these parents, who will then be better equipped to make informed decisions.</s></p><p><s>Another survey among parents of healthy children has shown that an intact patientedoctor relationship is a key factor contributing to vaccine acceptance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>These research outcomes indicate how HCPs could develop ways to communicate with patients on an individual level.</s><s>Developing personalized communication strategies, which may involve narratives and metaphors, requires that physicians have sufficient time to listen, paired with the knowledge and communication skills to adequately address the concerns raised during the conversation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Physicians who are able to identify with the patient's own perspective of their condition may be better equipped to offer the opportunity for open discussion and bilateral communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Talking and listening to patients seems like common sense but perhaps the fact that it remains the subject of research highlights that the communication gap between the doctor and patient still exists despite all that has been written.</s><s>Patients want their voice to be hearddon the subject of vaccination as well as on their medical conditionsdand therefore one needs to explore what the barriers are to effective communication.</s><s>In the followings section we will identify several such barriers and potential solutions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The internetd'friend or foe'?</head><p><s>The Internet could be either a friend or foe with regards to patient education and empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>HCP are using electronic resources and digital tools to keep in touch with patients, to send appointment reminders, and to provide online support and educational materials [29e34].</s><s>Digital two-way communication systems have also been used to allow patients and physicians to report toxicities and suspected adverse events <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Consensus protocols have been developed to study the use of mobile health tools for improving health and health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The impact of vaccine-related websites and social media on public perceptions of immunization is well-documented [39e42].</s><s>It is evident that internet sites are among the most commonly used information sources on vaccines and vaccine safety today [43e45].</s></p><p><s>This could be viewed as a sign of interest and active participation in vaccine prevention.</s><s>Concern arises however from the fact that the initial choice of search terms when researching a topic online, will profoundly influence and potentially bias the results <ref type="bibr">[44,46e48]</ref>.</s><s>A number of studies have also investigated the role of different languages when searching the web, which, depending on the topic, may be substantial [49e53].</s><s>To this end, the Global Vaccine Safety Initiative and WHO have recently released a list of websites with reliable vaccine-related information in 12 languages <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although the content and quality of vaccine-related online resources has been better understood and categorized in recent years, the commentary sections in social media have given the stage to extreme positions and rumours <ref type="bibr">[41,55e57]</ref>.</s><s>On a positive note, online platforms may also provide a unique opportunity for healthcare professionals to gain a better understanding of concerns and fears that may remain unspoken during personal interactions with patients [58e60].</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Criteria for effective listening and communication skills</head><p><s>First, the communicator needs to be well-informed and risk communication should be based on accurate scientific data.</s><s>A promising benefit of the digital revolution with regards to improvements in healthcare is the emergence of big data, i.e. the possibility to capture, store and analyse numerous data items per patient, facilitating precision medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</s><s>However, the information needs to be presented in an easily understandable format not to overwhelm the patient.</s><s>The HCP should be aware of and counteract any concern that, in this increasingly technological healthcare environment, the patient voice may matter less.</s></p><p><s>What will be important is how patients perceive that the HCP is listening, and that behind every piece of data there is a person.</s><s>If this can be accomplished, HCPs may be able to deliver a risk communication style that enables a patient to feel comfortable around any informed decisions that they may take for themselves and their children.</s></p><p><s>Second, HCPs need be effective communicators.</s><s>Modern communication tools offer new avenues to help effective communicators to achieve their goals.</s><s>Text or chat messages for example, can provide a quick method of communication, which can reach adolescents and/or large numbers of individuals.</s><s>However, these messages may not be automatically accepted or trusted and may compete with other sources of information.</s><s>It may require building trust first by encouraging direct interaction with HCPs, who also need to acquire the knowledge and communication skills to adequately address the concerns that may arise <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Listening to the concerns is an important part of the process before additional questions are asked to understand the problem.</s><s>A two-way communication will enable feedback to be received and demonstrate that the patient's feedback is welcome and actively encouraged by the provider.</s><s>An interactive chat or text message campaign could be effective in providing vaccine education and prompting patients to converse directly with their doctors and peers about vaccines and vaccination.</s><s>As a service to the user, text prompts and chat-rooms could increase the likelihood of timely vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</s><s>In a recent study, SMS queries were used to ask vaccine recipients whether they had experienced any adverse event following immunization.</s><s>More than 70% of patients responded by SMS with the data received in near real-time <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Finally, effective communication needs to account for the central role that patient organizations should be playing in the HCPepatient dialogue.</s><s>Certain health messages may be enforced through peer-to-peer communication among parents and patients.</s><s>In the past, patient organizations have raised concerns that the patient voice is not always heard.</s><s>For instance, it often seems to be excluded from biomedical research and the drug development process, as well as from the scientific literature.</s><s>Patient diary cards, as they are used in some clinical trials, are one step in the right direction.</s><s>The patient is encouraged to convey their subjective well-being, unfiltered and encouraged by the HCP.</s></p><p><s>More fundamentally, patient representative networks offer the unique opportunity to provide feedback regarding symptoms, treatments and the effectiveness of public communication strategies.</s><s>This may take the form of patient research partnerships <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> and other initiatives where advocacy groups and others non-governmental organizations sit together with industry and research agencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Maintaining trust in vaccines and vaccination is vital to the continuing success of this highly important public health measure.</s><s>The patient voice will take an increasingly important role in vaccine communication both in the social media sphere and the consulting room.</s><s>There is a general paradigm shift towards patient empowerment and self-governance.</s><s>This will continue the gradual departure from paternalistic views such as 'the doctor knows best' and 'the HCP is only seen when things need to get fixed' towards a mutual and sustainable partnership in health.</s><s>Bringing the HCP and the patient together in mutual partnership is the way forward.</s><s>Any such initiatives should draw on pertinent communication and risk research using modern methods of data collection and collation.</s><s>Individualistic attitudes and personal decision making in health are now ingrained in the public consciousness.</s><s>It will be crucial to recognize and embrace the concept of personalized medicine, also in the context of vaccine prevention.</s><s>Patient empowerment should not be considered a threat but rather as an opportunity to listen and understand each other's attitudes.</s><s>An increased awareness of the patient viewpoint should inspire collaborative research and, above all, help to advocate for a positive attitude to vaccines and vaccination.</s><s>This process will place additional responsibility on well-informed vaccine recipients and parents, who take on responsibilities regarding their own health and safety of their children.</s><s>Evening courses will be offered at major health centres to prepare future parents for immunization decisions.</s><s>The topic of vaccines and vaccinationdincluding vaccine benefiterisk communicationdwill be embedded in a general training regarding the health and safety of infants and children.</s><s>To achieve these goals, HCP reimbursement schedules will need to be reformed to allow greater emphasis on preventive measures and health consultation.</s></p><p><s>Rather than talking at the patient and giving orders, the physician will talk with the patient, taking the role of a preventive health consultant.</s><s>Medical school and residency training curricula should be adjusted to train HCPs in key competencies in this area.</s><s>Such courses will teach students the practical skills of vaccination techniques along with the communication skills necessary to address this complex subject while recognizing the value of being vaccinated themselves.</s><s>The training should be led by competent, certified vaccinologists, who have completed structured interdisciplinary training programmes involving infectious diseases, communication and social science, epidemiology and vaccine safety.</s><s>Critical input from other scientific disciplines, for example cognitive and decision sciences, should also be mobilized.</s></p><p><s>Technology will continue to have a major impact on the dissemination of vaccines and vaccine safety information.</s><s>In the future, vaccines may be tracked and geo-mapped, then monitored and verified before administration based on international bar codes.</s><s>Patients should always be encouraged to report any adverse eventsdas well as the absence of adverse eventsdin real-time using smart phones and tablet devices.</s><s>Direct safety reporting would provide immediate user-feedback to healthcare providers and regulatory agencies, including both uneventful vaccination events and subjective reports of adverse events.</s><s>This would give patients the reassurance that they are actively invited to report and to be listened to, while providing information on the patient's subjective experience to HCPs and immunisation programmes.</s><s>In the age of big data, this will add granularity to the vaccine safety data that are already gathered in large linked database systems (as supported by Kaiser Permanente and other health maintenance organizations, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and European Pharmacovigilance databases).</s><s>Health authorities and HCPs will follow up with questions.</s><s>Ideally, public health and regulatory authorities should also be providing online consultation services and 'open to public' days for school classes and interested patient groups to visit and be informed about the important work that is done in the monitoring of vaccine safety and effectiveness.</s><s>Information provided by the HCP could then be verified online and discussed in blogs moderated by specific pro-vaccine patient and parent organizations.</s><s>Such parent organizations may be directed at specific diseases or risk groups, such as pregnant mothers, age-or chronic disease-related risk groups.</s><s>The increased visibility of such partnerships would encourage the formation of other proactive relationships and shift the emphasis away from negative messaging.</s><s>The increasing rapport between non-governmental organizations and the public, bridging cultural and religious boundaries, will be critical in helping to establish vaccination campaigns, informed by localized knowledge on patient behaviour and attitudes.</s></p><p><s>Future research to explore the differences in benefit risk perception of different patient populations will be essential, and the building of comprehensive frameworks for assessing different age groups, as well as cultural and religious minorities will become important tools for effective implementation of vaccination programmes.</s><s>Alongside this, harmonized evidenced-based guidelines and vaccination schedules for children and adults will be formulated, providing consistency to support HCPs in their messaging.</s><s>These actions will not happen unless there is a concerted advocacy effort by patient groups in collaboration with healthcare professionals.</s></p><p><s>It is hoped that the political and public health climate will continue to move the important topic of vaccination up the agenda.</s><s>Collaborative research networks will continue to pursue opportunities on a global scale, although it must be recognized that different strategies and tactics will be required.</s><s>Large international organizations and publiceprivate partnerships with their knowledge, experience and infrastructure are in a unique position to encourage mutual dialogue, but small local organizations focused on communities and their leaders will become increasingly important.</s><s>These opportunities must not be wasted and in the near future we will see patient groups, healthcare professionals and researchers joining together in coalition with policy makers to seize these opportunities and bring about change.</s></p></div>
