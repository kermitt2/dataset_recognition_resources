type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>The modes of actions of the corresponding probiotic formulations have been examined for decades.</s><s>For instance, administration of heat killed bacteria of the closely related L. acidophilus reduced translocation of C. jejuni in infected isolator-raised germfree mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Given that L. johnsonii and

competition experiments shown here, whether pathogenic loads could be lowered upon L. johnsonii application before and/or after C. jejuni infection of secondary abiotic mice.</s><s>Both probiotic and pathogenic strains could stably colonize the gastrointestinal tract at high loads upon peroral challenge.</s><s>Unfortunately, neither therapeutic nor prophylactic L. johnsonii application could decrease intestinal C. jejuni burdens in a biologically relevant fashion.</s><s>In a previous in vivo study applying isolator-raised germfree mice that had been reconstituted with a complex human microbiota, a complete eradication of C. jejuni from the small and large intestines could be observed upon pretreatment of human microbiota-associated mice with a probiotic mix of L. acidophilus, L. reuteri and Bifidobacterium infantis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>One needs to take into consideration, however, that the observed contrasting pathogen-eradicative outcomes could most likely not only be explained by the quantitative and qualitative differences in the used probiotic strains, but also by substantially different immunological features of the applied mouse models.</s><s>Due to the lacking contact to any bacterial ligands and subsequent absence of immunological differentiation and stimulation, isolator-raised germfree mice exhibit only poorly-developed intestinal lymphatic tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , and need thus to be regarded as highly immunocompromized and inappropriate for dissecting commensal intestinal-pathogen-host interactions.</s><s>The secondary abiotic mice used in our study, however, were born, reared and maintained under conventional conditions and exhibited a fully developed innate and adaptive immune system.</s><s>Notably, recolonization of secondary abiotic mice with a single probiotic strains might not be sufficient to reconstitute the complex physiological prerequisites (i.e.</s><s>colonization resistance) for effective competition with C. jejuni for nutrients and niches.</s><s>Thus, rather a combination of several beneficial microbes instead of one single probiotic strain would be a more promising strategy to protect from or combat established enteropathogenic infections.</s></p><p><s>Whereas in our study re-colonized mice were not clinically/macroscopically compromized, C. jejuni infection induced colonic apoptosis and inflammation.</s><s>Notably, L. johnsonii colonization alone did not induce apoptotic, but promoted proliferative/regenerative colonic epithelial responses that might counteract potential inflammation-attributed cell damage.</s><s>Most importantly, the C. jejuni induced disease state could be ameliorated by treatment with L. johnsonii, which impacted apoptosis and adaptive immune responses upon C. jejuni infection.</s><s>Again, L. johnsonii alone did not lead to an influx of innate or adaptive immune cells into the colonic mucosa and lamina propria.</s><s>Furthermore, increases in intestinal pro-inflammatory mediators (including IL-6, NO and TNF) induced by C. jejuni infection could be alleviated by peroral L. johnsonii co-administration.</s><s>Notably, respective beneficial immunomodulatory effects were not restricted to the large intestinal tract, but could also be observed in the ileum.</s><s>As compared to uninfected control mice, L. johnsonii application alone further resulted in enhanced IL-10 secretion in intestinal as well as systemic compartments as shown from ex vivo biopsies taken from MLN and spleen, respectively.</s><s>Our in vivo data are further supported by results from in vitro studies.</s><s>Tsuda and colleagues reported, for instance, that stimulation of intestinal lymphocytes (derived from MLN of isolator-raised germfree mice) with a mix of three defined and inactivated L. johnsonii strains induced IL-10 production and regulated excessive antigen-specific cytokine responses via antigen presenting cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>In line with this, stimulation of peritoneal macrophages with L. johnsonii also resulted in enhanced IL-10 secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>In weanling as well as malnourished aged mice, L. johnsonii challenge further enhanced intestinal IgA secretion, thus constituting recovery and/or modulation of accelerated immune responses within the intestinal tract <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In our study L. johnsonii administration did not only ameliorate intestinal, but also extra-intestinal such as hepatic, and most strikingly, systemic C. jejuni induced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.</s><s>In support, a study applying a murine leukemia model revealed that peroral restoration of commensal Lactobacillus spp.</s><s>(that were reduced upon disease-mediated dysbiosis) resulted in decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and MCP-1 in muscular as well as serum samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>Given that the efficacy of L. johnsonii as therapeutic and/or preventive measure directed against enteric diseases including infections is supported by solid data from experimental in vitro and in vivo investigations as well as clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , it has been included in probiotic products distributed worldwide (Nestlé LC1).</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, even though neither susceptibility to C. jejuni infection nor pathogenic burdens upon intestinal establishment were influenced by L. johnsonii co-administration, the anti-inflammatory properties of this single probiotic species that became overt in intestinal, extra-intestinal and, remarkably, systemic compartments of C. jejuni infected mice qualifies L. johnsonii at least as adjunct immunomodulatory application.</s><s>It is rather a well-orchestrated interplay of mucosal immunity and the intestinal intraluminal milieu determined by the concert of the complex microbiota plus beneficial probiotic strains that is required to successfully combat and/or   prevent from enteropathogenic infections.</s><s>Future studies are needed, however, to better understand the underlying mechanisms.</s></p></div>
