absolute number of evaluable patients dropped during year 3 (47/109 patients (43%)) and year 4 (23/68 patients alive (34%)).</s><s>The mixed model analysis showed that with no early WBRT the MMSE score slightly improved by 0.27/year on a 30 point scale while in the early WBRT group, the mean change per year was -0.06 (p=0.13).</s><s>9 Discussion G-PCNSL-SG-1 trial is the first PCNSL trial documenting a negative influence of early WBRT on QoL parameters in a prospective, randomized setting.</s><s>Importantly, the QoL domains related to neuropsychological deficits are most affected in year 2 after randomization (irrespective of progression), cognitive functioning was apparently reduced and fatigue was obviously increased in the early WBRT arm.</s><s>This finding is also supported by a linear mixed model analysis.</s><s>The changes in these and many other QoL domains may be highly relevant for the daily life of these patients since in year 2 after randomization, global health/overall quality of life was also reduced in the early WBRT arm.</s></p><p><s>Subjective impairments in cognitive functioning documented in QoL analyses were mirrored by lower scores in the MMSE.</s><s>The negative influence of WBRT on MMSE test scores may be underestimated since MMSE is relatively insensitive to the cluster of symptoms associated with late neurotoxicity, i.e. attention and concentration deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Meyers and Wefel 2003)</ref>.</s><s>This may contribute to the fact that median MMSE values found in G-PCNSL-SG-1 are relatively high between 26 and 29/30 achievable points (Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>Nevertheless, clear differences between the treatment groups were evident in year 2 after randomization.</s><s>The higher rates of cognitive dysfunction observed with early WBRT is consistent with previous non-randomized observational studies showing a high rate of cognitive deficits and/or impaired QoL after HD-MTX followed by WBRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Correa et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harder et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Herrlinger et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Correa et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ekenel et al. 2008</ref>) while neither QoL impairment nor neuropsychological deficits were found in 21 long-term survivors treated with chemotherapy alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Juergens et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Also, a non-randomized analysis of cognitive functioning and QoL in PCNSL long-term survivors treated with our without WBRT suggests that the addition of WBRT increases the risk of neurotoxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Doolittle et al. 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We are aware of the suboptimal data structure of our analysis, in particular caused by the low return rates of questionnaires.</s><s>Nevertheless, to our knowledge, prospectively collected Qol data in a phase III trial evaluating the role of consolidating WBRT in primary therapy of PCNSL patients is not available elsewhere.</s><s>Thus, the results presented here might still be helpful for determining whether WBRT has a place in primary treatment of PCNSL.</s><s>The prolongation of progression-free survival induced by WBRT in the G-PCNSL-SG-1 trial may be an argument in favour of WBRT in primary therapy.</s><s>However, the G-PCNSL-SG-1 trial also showed no 10 differences in overall survival between the groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Thiel et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Korfel et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Now the present data show that some dimensions of quality of life and in particular the cognitive performance in the lifetime remaining are reduced in patients receiving consolidating WBRT.</s><s>Thus, a beneficial effect of WBRT beyond PFS prolongation cannot be detected.</s><s>One could argue that HD-MTX with or without ifosfamide applied here is not sufficient to induce an in-depth remission which only would allow additional WBRT to be truly consolidating and survival-prolonging.</s><s>Only with a more complex chemotherapy e.g.</s><s>including rituximab, highdose cytarabine, thiotepa, and/or high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue a remission could be achieved that allows WBRT to exert its full survival-prolonging potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ferreri et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Illerhaus et al. 2006</ref>).</s><s>So far, there is no data supporting such a theoretical concept in PCNSL and therefore it appears to be reasonable to omit neurotoxic WBRT in the form it was given in the G-PCNSL SG1 trial (45 Gy in 1.5 Gy fractions) from primary HD-MTX-based therapy on the basis of the G-PCNSL-SG-1 data.</s><s>This is even more prudent since the combination of WBRT with a more intense chemotherapy than HD-MTX alone has the potential to be even more neurotoxic.</s></p><p><s>In the G-PCNSL-SG-1 trial as well as in published case series, WBRT was applied with a comparably high total dose of 45 Gy, but with decreased single fractions of 1.5 Gy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Thiel et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Correa et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>One way to reduce the risk of neurotoxicity could be to use lower total doses.</s><s>In a study on patients with brain metastases cognitive decline was found already 4 months after WBRT with 30 Gy in 2.5 Gy single fractions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Chang et al. 2009</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, another trial on brain metastases using WBRT with 30 Gy yielded no cognitive decline and loss of QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sun et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Further reduced total doses of 23.4 Gy do not appear to have a strong detrimental effect on neurocognition in PCNSL patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Correa et al. 2009</ref>).</s><s>However, there is also no proof for a positive effect on overall survival conferred by dose-decreased WBRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ekenel et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Shah et al. 2007</ref>).</s><s>Another way of reducing neurotoxicity might be the technique of hippocampal sparing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gondi et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The true benefit of this technique for PCNSL patients has still to be shown.</s><s>In the light of a lack of OS prolongation by WBRT, the best way to reduce the rate of late neurotoxicity is, however, to delay WBRT until progression/relapse as done in the no early WBRT arm of the G-PCNSL-SG-1 trial.</s><s>This concept is also supported by observations of <ref type="bibr">Hottinger and colleagues (2007)</ref> showing that the rate of neurotoxicity is reduced if the time interval between HD-MTX and WBRT is longer than 6 months.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the data from the G-PCNSL-SG-1 trial do not encourage to use consolidating WBRT as a part of first-line therapy of PCNSL: The omission of WBRT did not significantly shorten overall survival, and in addition, early WBRT was associated with a reduction of patients' self-perceived quality of life and general cognitive function.</s><s>Therefore, new concepts for consolidation therapy after HD-MTX based chemotherapy in PCNSL patients have to be explored.</s><s>(B) Selected symptom scores: communication deficit, fatigue, appetite loss and hair loss: Higher values mean a higher symptom burden with higher negative impact on quality of life.</s><s>Further symptom scores are shown in Supplementary figure
