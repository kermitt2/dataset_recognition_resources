<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this report, we described a familial case of LDS with a novel splice donor site variant of exon 5 in TGFBR1 gene (c.973</s><s>+ 1 G &gt; A).</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first case of LDS with a splice site variant in the TGFBR1 gene.</s><s>The variant produced two types of in-frame but functionally inactivated proteins as a result of exon 5 skipping and the activation of a cryptic donor splice at a site 9 bp upstream of the 5′ natural splice donor site.</s><s>Previously, a splice acceptor site variant of exon 5 (c.806-2</s><s>A &gt; C) has been reported in a British familial case of the inherited skin cancer syndrome MSSE, without LDS-like phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>This variant also has been predicted to result in exon 5 skipping.</s><s>Our ex vivo splice analysis strongly suggested that c.806-2</s><s>A &gt; C variant activated a cryptic acceptor site at 76 bp downstream of the 3′ natural splice acceptor site, consequently producing an out-of-frame transcript (r.807_882del, p. Asn270Thrfs*8).</s><s>Our results are consistent with previous observations that truncating variants in STK domain induce MSSE phenotypes and that missense variants within or near STK domain lead to LDS phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Genetic variants in intronic splice sites account for approximately 10%-15% of human genetic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Most cases result in exon skipping because of a variant in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> The ex vivo splicing assay.</s><s>(a) Natural and putative splice sites in the region around TGFBR1 exon 5 with S&amp;S splice site scores.</s><s>The putative splicing donor site 9 bp upstream of the 5′ natural splice site and splice acceptor site 76 bp downstream from the 3′ natural splice site were predicted to contribute to the pathogenesis of LDS and MSSE, respectively.</s><s>(b) The pTBNde(min) minigene system used to analyze the effect of TGFBR1 variants on ex vivo pre-mRNA splicing.</s><s>(c) Splicing products amplified by RT-PCR using 2-3α and B2 primers shown in (b) were separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis.</s><s>The identity of the spliced products was established by direct sequencing (d-f) and is schematically represented on the right.</s><s>(d-f) Direct sequencing of cDNA from wild-type (top) and variant (bottom) alleles.</s><s>In the small and large products of LDS variant alleles, the entire exon 5 (168 bp) (d) and last 9 bases of exon 5 (e) were missing, respectively.</s><s>(f) For the MSSE variant allele, the first 76 bp bases of exon 5 was missing.</s><s>FN-EDB, fibronectin-extra domain B; aa, amino acid position of TGFBR1 the original splice site.</s><s>However, some variants can activate a cryptic splice site, causing aberrant pre-mRNA splicing processes resulting in the subsequent generation of functionally modified proteins.</s><s>However, to the best of our knowledge, two distinct system and/or organ diseases induced by the differential splicing of the same exon have not been reported to date.</s><s>In contrast, variant types and locations within a single gene are known to affect the severity, age of onset, and rate of progression of the same organ diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and these are often referred to as different syndromes.</s><s>Truncating and missense variants in the dystrophin gene DMD induce severe Duchenne and mild Becker muscular dystrophy, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Further, variants in NFIX gene induce two different types of disorders affecting skeletal and neural developments; most NFIX variants induce Malan syndrome cluster in the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain (exons 2 and 3), and some NFIX variants are associated with the Marshall-Smith syndrome cluster at the C-terminal end (exons 6-10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The detailed mechanism by which variants in TGFBR1 induce two completely distinct diseases, namely LDS and MSSE, needs to be further investigated.</s></p><p><s>Most variants in the TGFBR1/2 genes inducing LDS have been verified in vitro and/or have been predicted to be loss-of-function variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, whereas a paradoxical increase in TGF-β activity has been observed in the aortic wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Although this paradox holds true in the present case (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1b, 4b-c</ref>), the underlying mechanism remains unknown.</s><s>We and other researchers have speculated that TGF-β signaling via the remaining wild-type receptors might play active roles in the development of TGF-β vasculopathies because TGFBR1/2 functions as a homodimer receptor which maintains vascular homeostasis and activates many cellular processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we described a Japanese familial case of LDS with a novel splice donor site variant of the TGFBR1 gene (c.973</s><s>+ 1 G &gt;
