<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Everyday human life contains a wealth of complex, multimodal socio-emotional cues that we need to make meaning of in order to function.</s><s>One particular challenge is processing conflicting or contradictory cues of divergent implicit valence.</s><s>For instance, a person may portray a positive emotion via their facial expression, but verbally supply negative content alongside it.</s><s>We perceive both the positive and the negative cue at the same time, and quickly need to figure out which one should be prioritized.</s><s>Failure to adequately process such conflicting cues can fundamentally impair individual well-being and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Campos et al., 2011]</ref>.</s><s>Individuals suffering from depression and anxiety, for instance, display strong tendencies to interpret ambiguous cues negatively, causing them unnecessary worry and distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[Dearing and Gotlib, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Enkel et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lawson et al., 2002]</ref>.</s><s>In recent years, research on emotional conflict has been accumulating <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Egner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Etkin et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Etkin et al., , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hoyer et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Jarcho et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rey et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Waring et al., 2014]</ref>. 1 To date, the neural networks of how to ignore a predefined distracting stimulus that conflicts with the target stimulus are thought to revolve around the amygdala, anterior cingulate (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Egner et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Etkin et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Etkin et al., , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kanske and Kotz, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Waring et al., 2014]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is currently little evidence on the neural mechanisms underlying subjective, individual evaluation of a conflict that occurs in the absence of an a priori defined target stimulus.</s><s>This question is particularly relevant if we consider the example above: it is not always obvious in everyday life which of the conflicting cues is the distracter and which is the target.</s><s>We first need to figure out which of the cues to deem "relevant" and which "irrelevant" before we can proceed to ignore the task-irrelevant information.</s><s>Such subjective evaluations do not necessarily require volitional control in real life, whereas volitional control is an essential component in task-based paradigms.</s><s>This is readily apparent in recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[Seehausen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Watanabe et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zaki et al., 2010]</ref>, which have let participants subjectively evaluate conflicts, but have instructed them to do so in a certain manner.</s><s>These studies implicate superior temporal sulcus (STS), fusiform gyrus (FuG), posterior cingulate (PCC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in socio-emotional conflict processing-regions which have also been implicated in the cognitive control of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[Ochsner et al., 2012]</ref>. 2 Moreover, unlike in the case of ignoring a predefined distracter, subjectively evaluating conflicting cues can lead to individually different interpretations.</s><s>There have also been efforts to parse out the neural mechanisms underlying the individual prioritization of some conflicting cues over others: <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Zaki et al. [2010]</ref> have investigated the prioritization of either a facial expression or its accompanying verbal description; <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Wittfoth et al. [2010]</ref> have investigated the prioritization of either positive or negative intonations that are accompanied by incongruent semantic content.</s><s>However, it is not yet clear how neural underpinnings differ when positive or negative cues are prioritized regardless of the modality in which they are presented.</s><s>In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that emotion and executive functions are inherently linked <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[Ochsner et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Okon-Singer et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Rohr et al., 2015]</ref>, highlighting the possibility that conflict evaluation, an executive process, and valence prioritization, an emotion process, may rely on shared neural processes.</s></p><p><s>The current work is therefore designed to assess the neural mechanisms underlying prioritization of positive over negative cues and vice versa, in the course of subjective, individual evaluations of conflict within a naturalistic paradigm.</s><s>Healthy participants freely watched short film scenes that evoked emotional conflicts in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment.</s><s>These previously validated scenes were taken from Hollywood movies such as "Reservoir Dogs" <ref type="bibr">[1992]</ref> and presented positive and negative affective inputs simultaneously, thus sharing main characteristics with other conflict elicitors such as Stroop tasks.</s><s>In contrast to previous studies, participants were allowed to freely attend to whichever aspect of the presented films they wanted, and no task instruction, which could interfere with natural processing mechanisms by itself, was given.</s><s>To assess arousal and ensure immersion in the film scenes, heart rate and skin conductance were simultaneously recorded.</s><s>Based on a pilot study (see Supporting Information), participants rated their experience during the scenes post-hoc for valence and conflict.</s><s>We expected that (a) the subjectively evaluated emotional conflict would engage a network of regions previously implicated in socio-emotional conflict processing, such as amygdala, ACC, PFC, STS and IPL and (b) prioritization of positive or negative cues would be reflected in differential activity and connectivity within this network.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Twenty-seven healthy volunteers without any history of neurological, psychiatric or cardiovascular illnesses volunteered to participate in the study in return for payment.</s><s>The study was approved by the local ethics board of the University of Leipzig and all participants provided written informed consent.</s><s>All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had never received any formal film training or worked in the film industry.</s><s>Participants were characterized with regard to familiarity with the scenes (3.76 6 1.98; out of a maximum of 10 scenes), affinity for films (7.23 6 1.27; maximum affinity 5 10) and educational status (14.71 6 1.49 years).</s><s>They were further screened with the Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[Watson et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr">German version: Krohne et al., 1996]</ref>, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[Gross and John, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">German version: Abler and Kessler, 2009]</ref>, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Davis, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">German version: Paulus, 2009</ref>] and the Sensation Seeking Scale V (SSS-V) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[Zuckerman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">German version: Beauducel et al., 2003]</ref>; no outliers were detected.</s><s>Two fMRI scans were excluded due to excessive head motion (&gt;1.5 mm); one of the participants in addition showed nonresponsiveness in skin conductance (lack of identified changes &gt;0.02 lS).</s><s>Further, three heart rate recordings were excluded due to a combination of poor data quality and insufficient correction of the artifact induced by the MR. 25 skin conductance and 22 heart rate recordings, as well as 25 fMRI data sets (12 female, 13 male, age 5 26.29 63.23 years) were analyzed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p><s>Ten previously validated film scenes between 1.5 and 3 min long were used as stimuli (see Supporting Information).</s><s>As virtually all fiction stories start by setting up a conflict within or between characters and end when the conflict is resolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[Field, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Seger, 1992]</ref>, fiction films are good stimuli to induce an emotional conflict.</s><s>All scenes presented positive and negative affective inputs simultaneously, either through only the visual or both the visual and the auditory domain, and could thus be expected to elicit an emotional conflict within the viewer.</s><s>For example, one scene-taken from the film "Reservoir Dogs" (see complete list below)-features a man being tortured by another man who is speaking to him in a rather friendly fashion.</s><s>Importantly, we chose scenes that present incongruent affective inputs simultaneously, as these share main characteristics with other conflict elicitors, such as Stroop tasks.</s><s>The conflict presented in the scenes was not based on different emotions conveyed via different sensory modalities (e.g., auditory and visual), but inherent in the content (e.g., depictions of a situation which is negative for one person and positive for another, or a person's behavior that is incongruent with their facial expressions or gestures).</s><s>In order to ensure maximum ecological validity and facilitate immersion, the selected films' fictional worlds were evaluated according to the typology of accessibility relations developed by Marie-Laure Ryan <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[Ryan, 1991]</ref>.</s><s>In fiction theory, accessibility relations establish the extent to which fictional worlds are similar or different to the actual world we live in.</s><s>The fictional world that most resembles the actual world is based on the "principle of minimal departure" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Dolezel, 1998]</ref>.</s><s>All chosen films resembled the actual world by &gt;90%.</s><s>Further, as critical and commercial success is indicative of a universal, emotionally engaging experience, all films were critically acclaimed box-office successes: Black Swan  <ref type="bibr">: 1994)</ref>.</s><s>Scenes from Hollywood films have previously successfully been used as fMRI stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Eryilmaz et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Hasson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Nummenmaa et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Pehrs et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Pehrs et al., , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Quirin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Raz et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Raz et al., , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Straube et al., 2010]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fMRI Experiment</head><p><s>FMRI data were collected on a 3T Siemens Magnetom Tim Trio (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) scanner using a standard echo-planar imaging protocol (885 volumes, TR 5 2,000 ms, TE 5 25 ms, flip angle 5 908, 64 3 64 matrix, voxel dimensions 3 3 3 3 4 mm 3 ).</s><s>Film scenes were presented in six pseudo-randomized orders via a mirror using Presentation 14.9 (Neurobehavioral Systems, San Francisco, CA, USA), a projector and MR-compatible headphones.</s><s>Participants were familiarized with the kind of material they would see using a test scene (Death Proof; D: Q.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1">Also see<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Algom et al., 2004</ref> on why emotional conflict tasks do not always measure conflict-for instance because stimuli in the paradigm do not actually conflict with each other.2 Although differentiations between the "terms emotion control," "cognitive control of emotion" and "emotion regulation" are sometimes made [see e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Grandey et al., 2005]</ref>, they are commonly used interchangeably [see e.g.Ochsner and Gross, 2005 or Ochsner et al.,  2012]  as "control" can refer to both volitional or spontaneous regulation of one's own behavior, as well as to external demands that guide or require regulation of behavior. The regulation of emotional conflict when completing a Stroop task would be an example of the latter [see e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Etkin et al., 2010]</ref>.r Evaluative Neural Responses to Conflict r r 2235 r</note>
