<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the present study, we examined the contribution of KIBRA polymorphism in the reconstruction of past episodes as measured by the DRM paradigm.</s><s>In the free recall condition, we found that female participants outperformed males in terms of total number of items correctly retrieved.</s><s>This effect is consistent with previous findings on gender differences in episodic memory performance by showing that women show superior performance relative to men, especially on verbal memory tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Herlitz &amp; Rehnman, 2008</ref>).</s><s>The explanation for the observed sex differences in episodic memory is still a matter of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Herlitz &amp; Rehnman, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, accuracy in the correct recognition condition of listed items was not significantly different between males and females or CC and CT/TT carriers of the KIBRA rs17070145 polymorphism.</s><s>In contrast, we found a significant gender x genotype interaction for false recognition rates of critical lures.</s><s>In particular, female CT/TT carriers exhibited a lower proportion of false recognition rates as compared to male CT/TT carriers and a tendency to be less prone to false recognition of critical lures than female CC carriers.</s><s>This effect however, did not remain significant after correcting for repeated testing.</s><s>Thus, our preliminary results tentatively support previous findings on the association between KIBRA polymorphism, gender and cognitive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wersching et al., 2011)</ref>, but (perhaps due to relatively small sample sizes) failed to reach statistical significance.</s></p><p><s>Results regarding the principal role of KIBRA polymorphism on memory functions are rather inconclusive (summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Schwab et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In healthy subjects, the T-allele of the KIBRA rs17070145 seem to be associated with significantly better <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Schaper et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Vassos et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kauppi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Almeida et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Preuschhof et al., 2010)</ref>, slightly better <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Witte et al., 2016)</ref> or unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Need et al., 2008)</ref> declarative memory performance relative to non-carriers of the Tallele.</s><s>These inconsistencies might be due to methodological differences, i.e. the use of different tasks for the measurement of episodic memory functions.</s><s>Similar to our results, Wersching et al., 2011 used a neuropsychological test battery and failed to find main effects of the KIBRA rs17070145 genotype on immediate and delayed memory performance.</s><s>Instead, a significant interaction between gender and rs17070145 genotype was observed for working memory performance (for example in the Digit span test).</s><s>Furthermore, the same study also reports that gender determines the effect of rs17070145 on executive functioning.</s><s>Thus, it is possible that our findings regarding false recognition performance are related to an interaction between gender and rs17070145 genotype that modulates working memory and executive functions.</s><s>Interestingly, working memory capacity seems to be closely related to the susceptibility to false memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Leding, 2012</ref>) and false recognition rates can be significantly reduced by improving executive control functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McCabe &amp; Smith, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zhang et al., 2009</ref> proposed that the KIBRA rs17070145 T-allele could differentially modulate hippocampal functions such as long-term memory and those functions related to the prefrontal cortex (i.e, working memory capacity).</s><s>Thus, the putative explanation behind the interactive effects of KIBRA genotype and gender on false recognition performance might be the differential effect of KIBRA in processes related to working memory, executive functions and long-term memory, all of which contribute to differences in the susceptibility to produce false memories.</s></p><p><s>From the methodological perspective, our results thus argue for considerations of gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wersching et al., 2011)</ref> and task specific demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Zhang et al., 2009)</ref> as important variables in the interpretation of results related to the association of KIBRA and complex cognitive functions such as reconstructive episodic memory.</s></p><p><s>Another important finding of this study was the association of KIBRA and confidence ratings during recognition memory.</s><s>While there were no genotype differences in overall recognition performance, the T-allele of the KIBRA rs17070145 polymorphism was associated with differences in qualitative aspects of recognition memory.</s><s>In particular, in trials with correct recognition of listed items, participants showed significantly more "remember" responses as compared to "know" and "guess" responses.</s><s>Likewise, "know" responses were significantly higher than "guess" responses during the correct recognition of listed items.</s><s>Most importantly however, a significant response-type x genotype interaction was evident, indicating that, CT/TT carriers showed more "remember", but fewer "know" responses as compared to CC carriers during the correct recognition of listed items.</s><s>One explanation for these findings might be that the T-allele of the KIBRA rs17070145 polymorphism supports recollection-based episodic memory retrieval.</s><s>According to dual process models of recognition memory, recollection refers to the conscious retrieval of items plus the contextual details encountered during the encoding phase.</s><s>In contrast, the mere knowing that the item was on the list without remembering the contextual details refers to familiarity-based retrieval processes.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tulving, 1985</ref> proposed that the semantic and episodic memory systems are operating on these two retrieval processes to a different degree.</s><s>Furthermore, the identified brain structures subserving these different recognition memory processes do not necessarily overlap <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Eldridge et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aggleton et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Yonelinas et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Studies using the remember/know procedure have shown that an intact hippocampus is most probably required for recollection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aggleton et al., 2005)</ref> whereas hippocampal recruitment during familiaritybased retrieval is not obligatory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ranganath et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Suchan et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>KIBRA is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus.</s><s>Female T-allele carriers show larger hippocampal volumes relative to non-T-allele carriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Palombo et al., 2013)</ref>, an effect which was recently replicated in older healthy adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Witte et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Such structural differences observed in T-carriers and noncarriers of KIBRA rs17070145 might represent an underlying mechanism for the herein observed differences in retrieval characteristics.</s><s>Indeed, recollection memory can be predicted on the basis of hippocampal longitudinal volume ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Poppenk &amp; Moscovitch, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Of course, this conclusion is rather speculative, considering the limited data at hand, especially since we did not perform structural functional magnetic resonance imaging to support this conclusion.</s></p><p><s>Another compelling but speculative explanation of the behavioral effects observed in the present study could be a genotype-related difference in brain activation patterns.</s></p><p><s>Using a face-profession paired associative learning task (which is intended to measure episodic memory), <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006</ref> found a significantly higher brain activation in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus of CC homozygotes relative to T-carriers during the retrieval but not encoding phase.</s><s>In a similar task applied to a sample of elderly non-demented subjects, Kauppi et al., 2011 also found differences in hippocampal activation between CC homozygotes and T-allele carriers during retrieval.</s><s>However, in contrast to the findings obtained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006</ref>, both a lower activation of medial temporal lobe regions as well as a slower response time was reported in CC homozygous <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kauppi et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, it can be concluded that KIBRA rs17070145 genotype-related differences in brain activation patterns exist which do not necessarily lead to equivalent genotyperelated differences in episodic memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kauppi et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Diminished hippocampal functioning in CC homozygous carriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kauppi et al., 2011)</ref> corroborate our results, implicating a beneficial effect of KIBRA T-allele in episodic memory mainly due to a qualitatively different retrieval process (i.e.</s><s>recollection based retrieval) and thus more efficient hippocampal recruitment during recognition performance.</s><s>Thus, it would be valuable to implement remember/know judgements in future imaging studies to get more insight into the functional link between KIBRA, hippocampal structure and functionality and episodic memory processing.</s></p><p><s>The following limitations of this study need to be considered.</s><s>First, the sample size was relatively small for genetic association studies and the herewith associated limited statistical power might explain why we only found a trend towards a gender x genotype interaction for false recognition rates.</s><s>Interestingly, studies with much smaller sample sizes report similar trends towards an effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Witte et al., 2016)</ref> or even significant effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Nacmias et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Schaper et al., 2008)</ref> of KIBRA polymorphism on cognitive functions.</s><s>In contrast to previous studies, our DRM task is relatively difficult to implement, laborious and more time-consuming.</s><s>When taking the latter into account, our sample size is substantially larger relative to other genetic association studies employing the DRM procedure (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Montag et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, future studies with larger samples would be beneficial to derive definite conclusions regarding the role of gender and KIBRA genotype on reconstructive memory in the DRM task.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, it is conceivable that other genetic factors might play a role in the relationship between KIBRA polymorphism, gender and reconstructive memory.</s><s>For example, it was repeatedly shown that another gene, CLSTN2 (calsyntenin 2) interacts with KIBRA to modulate episodic memory performance in healthy individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Preuschhof et al., 2010)</ref> and depressed elderly subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Pantzar et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Similar to KIBRA, CLSTN2 is expressed in memoryrelated brain regions such as the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Papassotiropoulos et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hintsch et al., 2002)</ref>, suggesting a possible involvement in processes related to episodic memory storage and retrieval.</s><s>Also, we did not employ any structural and/or functional neuroimaging measures, thus any conclusion about underlying neuronal mechanisms mediating the herein observed behavioral effect remain speculative.</s><s>Such additional measures, however, would be helpful, especially with regard to possible changes in medial temporal lobe/hippocampal activations which go along with our finding of genotyperelated differences in familiarity and recollection-based retrieval.</s><s>Given that the participants in our study were healthy young students the clinical implication of our findings and any extrapolation of the findings are not possible.</s><s>Nevertheless, there are some important clinical implications that can be derived from this study.</s><s>It has been shown that non-carriers of the KIBRA rs17070145 T-allele exhibit an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Corneveaux et al., 2010)</ref> which might be related to lower glucose metabolism in brain regions involved in the processing of episodic memories.</s><s>Similarly, a possible association between KIBRA and the risk of developing strong traumatic memories in survivors of mass conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wilker et al., 2013)</ref> has been demonstrated by arraybased SNP genotyping.</s><s>Individuals suffering from PTSD and Alzheimer's disease show distinct neuropsychological profiles with specific alterations in different aspects of episodic memory functioning.</s><s>Thus, it could be predicted that the KIBRA (rs17070145) T-allele might have a protective role in both Alzheimer's disease and PTSD.</s></p></div>
