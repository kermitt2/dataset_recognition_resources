<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This investigator-initiated study of canakinumab in 20 patients with active Schnitzler syndrome was conducted in 4 German study centers and consisted of 3 parts, 2 of which have been completed.</s><s>The first part was an initial 7-day double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a single subcutaneous dose of canakinumab 150 mg.</s><s>The second part was a 16-week open-label follow-up to establish the optimal dose of canakinumab, 150 or 300 mg, and to assess adverse responses.</s><s>The third part, a 4-year open-label extension to monitor long-term efficacy, quality of life, and unwanted effects, is ongoing.</s></p><p><s>For part 1 of the study, after screening for 7 to 28 days, patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive a single subcutaneous injection of canakinumab 150 mg or placebo at day 0. No stratification was applied.</s><s>Central block randomization was used to form the allocation list for the 2 treatment groups.</s><s>Patients, investigators, and site personnel were blinded to the treatment assignment.</s><s>To preserve blinding, canakinumab and placebo were visually indistinguishable and packaged identically.</s><s>Changes in clinical symptoms, inflammation markers, quality of life, and adverse events were assessed for the next 7 days.</s><s>Following treatment response evaluation at day 7, patients were unblinded and moved to the open-label phase.</s></p><p><s>In the 16-week open-label follow-up phase of the study, all patients were treated with canakinumab injections depending on relapse or worsening of symptoms.</s><s>Patients with complete clinical response (as defined below) to canakinumab 150 mg and normalized C-reactive protein (CRP) levels continued with canakinumab 150-mg injections when needed.</s><s>Partial responders to canakinumab 150 mg with or without CRP above the upper limit of normal (&gt; _0.5 mg/dL) were given canakinumab 300 mg on relapse/worsening of the disease.</s><s>At all decision steps, nonresponders left the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>For inclusion, patients had to fulfil the diagnostic criteria established by Lipsker et al 5 in 2001.</s><s>These consist of monoclonal gammopathy and chronic urticarial rash combined with at least 2 of the following symptoms: fatigue, recurrent fever, myalgia, arthralgia or arthritis, lymphadenopathy, hepato-/splenomegaly, leukocytosis and/or elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and abnormal bone morphology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref></s><s>Only adult patients (&gt; _18 years) with a physician global assessment (PGA) score of 8 or more (range, 0-20) and CRP level above the upper limit of normal at visit 2 (day 0) were eligible to participate in the study.</s><s>Further inclusion criteria were the willingness to complete all study visits and study-related procedures, a negative pregnancy test result, and effective contraceptive methods for women of childbearing potential.</s><s>Exclusion criteria included active tuberculosis and other chronic infections, ongoing treatment with IL-1 blockers, other biologics or immunosuppressives, and the presence of malignancies within the last 5 years.</s></p><p><s>The study was approved by a central institutional review board and the ethics committee of each study center (EudraCT no.</s><s>2010-024156-28) and followed Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>The ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>identifier is NCT01390350.</s><s>All patients gave written informed consent before any study-related procedures.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p><s>The PGA was the primary instrument used to assess the efficacy of canakinumab treatment.</s><s>For the PGA, the 5 key symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome (urticarial rash, fatigue, fever/chills, myalgia, and arthralgia/bone pain) were each graded on a 5-point Likert scale, with 0 5 no, 1 5 minimal, 2 5 mild, 3 5 moderate, and 4 5 severe disease activity.</s><s>The total PGA scores ranged between 0 and 20.</s><s>Patient-reported disease activity was assessed using a modified Schnitzler activity score <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> in which patients were asked to grade the severity of their total symptoms daily on a scale ranging from 0 (very good) to 10 (very bad).</s></p><p><s>At every clinic visit, serum samples were collected to determine acute-phase reactants CRP and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels and patients completed 2 questionnaires-the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), a skin disease-specific quality-of-life questionnaire, and the 36-item short form health survey (SF-36), a generic health-related quality-of-life instrumentboth of which have a recall period of 1 week.</s><s>Post hoc assessments included blood levels of the inflammatory marker S100A12 protein and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), evaluated at days 0, 7, and 120.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study end points</head><p><s>The primary end point was the rate of complete clinical responders in the canakinumab-treated group as compared with the placebo group on day 7 of the double-blind phase of the study.</s><s>Secondary end points included the overall clinical response rate, changes in physician (PGA) and patient-reported (Schnitzler activity score) assessments of disease activity, changes in acute-phase reactants (CRP and SAA), and changes in quality-of-life assessments (DLQI and SF-36).</s><s>Further secondary end points were safety of canakinumab treatment assessed by physical examination, routine laboratory markers, vital signs, and adverse event reporting.</s><s>Post hoc analyses included changes in S100A12 levels and cytokine (IL-1Ra) levels during the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study definitions</head><p><s>A complete clinical response was defined as no or minimal disease activity, that is, a PGA score of 5 or less and no greater than 1 in any of the 5 constituent signs/symptoms.</s><s>A partial clinical response was defined as mild to moderate disease activity with a PGA score of more than 5 and PGA reduction of 30% or more as compared with baseline.</s><s>No clinical response was defined as high disease activity with PGA scores that were increased, stable, or showed less than 30% reduction.</s><s>Relapse or worsening of clinical symptoms was identified by a 50% or more increase in the PGA score as compared with the PGA score 7 to 14 days after canakinumab initiation.</s></p></div>

known to be associated with an increased risk of permanent tissue damage such as amyloidosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">18</ref></s><s>The significant reduction in CRP and SAA levels in all canakinumab-treated patients within 7 days and normalization of median CRP levels at day 120 indicate effective control of inflammation and support previous reports in patients with CAPS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19</ref></s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[22]</ref> In our patient cohort, S100A12 baseline values ranged between those reported for CAPS (ca 150-700 ng/mL) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (ca 7000 ng/mL). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">23</ref></s><s>The changes in S100A12 levels significantly correlated with changes in PGA urticarial rash scores but not with PGA total scores or CRP and SAA levels.</s><s>Because urticarial rash is among the first symptoms in disease exacerbations of Schnitzler syndrome and S100A12 is a known danger molecule and chemoattractant to mast cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">24</ref> our results suggest that S100A12 proteins may play a crucial role in the early flare reaction by activating skin mast cells that are known to induce the IL-1b-mediated urticarial rash in Schnitzler syndrome and CAPS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">26</ref></s><s>s of now, no biomarkers are established to assess patients with Schnitzler syndrome for changes in disease activity in response to treatment.</s><s>IL-1b is the key inflammatory mediator in Schnitzler syndrome.</s><s>Its secretion from PBMCs is increased in patients with Schnitzler syndrome and is inhibited ex vivo and in vivo by IL-1 blockade. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">27</ref></s><s>Because IL-1b in the serum is virtually undetectable, we measured serum levels of IL-1Ra, which is produced at steady-state levels with the IL-1 receptor and inhibits the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1a and IL-1b by nonproductively binding to the IL-1 receptor.</s><s>Following IL-1b neutralization in patients with CAPS, IL-1Ra serum levels were shown to be downregulated within a few days. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">28</ref></s><s>In our study, changes in IL-1Ra levels and disease activity in response to canakinumab correlated well, suggesting that IL-1Ra may be a good biomarker for monitoring disease activity in patients with Schnitzler syndrome.</s><s>Possibly, the high clinical disease activity in single patients with only modest elevations in CRP and SAA levels may be explained by excessive IL-1Ra levels.</s></p><p><s>Patients with autoinflammatory conditions including Schnitzler syndrome often suffer from considerable quality-of-life impairment.</s><s>In our patients, baseline DLQI scores were comparable to those reported for other chronic skin disorders including chronic urticaria (9.9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">29</ref> and urticarial vasculitis (9.2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">30</ref> Interestingly and in line with previous results from patients with Schnitzler syndrome, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> the assessment of SF-36 baseline scores revealed physical health to be clearly compromised but mental health to be less affected.</s><s>Analysis of SF-36 subdomains shows pain to be a major inducer of quality-of-life impairment, which is mirrored by high PGA scores for the key symptoms myalgia and arthralgia/bone pain.</s><s>Also, the great improvement in physical health-related quality-of-life scores and the almost complete restoration of skin-related quality of life at day 120 underscores the efficacy of canakinumab treatment.</s><s>Some intraindividual differences in time to relapse after canakinumab administration may be explained by seasonal variations with more pronounced symptoms during winter or infections triggering disease activity.</s><s>In accordance with earlier findings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> we observed considerable interindividual variability in the duration of clinical improvement that was not closely linked to disease activity scores or inflammation markers.</s></p><p><s>Respiratory tract infections were the most frequent adverse events in our study, which is in line with the results of earlier canakinumab studies in patients with CAPS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19</ref></s><s>Although respiratory tract infections are very common in the general population, it cannot be excluded that these infections may have been facilitated by the anti-IL-1 treatment.</s><s>Thus, patients on IL-1 blockade should be closely monitored for potential infections and adequately treated to prevent complications.</s><s>This also includes common vaccinations such as influenza and pneumococcal infections, which are recommended before start of long-term anti-IL-1 treatment.</s><s>The 3 serious adverse events, 2 hypertensive episodes in one patient with Schnitzler syndrome with concomitant oral corticosteroid use and known hypertensive disease as well as severe lumbago with subsequent hospitalization in another patient, were not considered to be drug related.</s><s>Still, because hypertension is very common in the elderly population, it will be important to closely monitor the effect of canakinumab on blood pressure and possible drug interactions in future clinical trials.</s><s>This study has several strengths and limitations.</s><s>The latter include the number of patients enrolled in this trial.</s><s>However, this is by far the biggest clinical trial in patients with Schnitzler syndrome, an ultrarare disease.</s><s>In addition, the placebo-controlled phase of 7 days was short, but to withhold effective treatment for longer than this would have been unethical, and patients in the canakinumab-treated group showed marked and significant improvement during this first week of treatment.</s><s>The imbalance in randomization with 7 canakinumab-treated and 13 placebotreated patients is another limitation, but is unlikely to affect the study results because all patients responded well to canakinumab open-label treatment.</s><s>Also, our results are preliminary in the sense of treatment duration and have to be interpreted with care because the open-label treatment phase of this study is still ongoing.</s><s>Therefore, long-term efficacy and safety are further monitored, and detailed results will be reported on study completion.</s><s>The major strength of this study is its placebo-controlled design, making it the first and as of yet only randomized controlled trial in patients with Schnitzler syndrome.</s><s>This primary multicenter study confirms the marked efficacy of previous case reports and small open-label studies on IL-1 blockade in this condition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">31</ref> which facilitates the treatment of patients with Schnitzler syndrome and encourages the use of canakinumab or other IL-1-targeting treatments in this disease.</s><s>In comparison to anakinra (4-6 hours) and rilonacept (67 hours to 7 days), canakinumab has a longer half-life (21-28 days) and exclusively binds to IL-1b, the key inflammatory mediator in Schnitzler syndrome, but not to IL-1a or the IL-1 receptor.</s><s>Besides the advantage of less frequent dosing with canakinumab, injection-site reactions (which were absent in our study) are less often reported as compared with anakinra and rilonacept. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">32</ref></s><s>In conclusion, our study results show good efficacy of canakinumab treatment against placebo in reducing the clinical symptoms, inflammation markers, and enhancing quality of life in patients with symptomatic Schnitzler syndrome.</s><s>Over the limited 4-month duration of this study, canakinumab treatment appeared to be safe and well tolerated.</s><s>Treatment of greater patient numbers and long-term administration are necessary to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of canakinumab treatment in Schnitzler syndrome.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG 1
