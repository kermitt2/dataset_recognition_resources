<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Noninvasive monitoring of graft integrity after liver transplantation (LTx) is needed because of the imprecision and other limitations of traditional methods used to assess liver damage and detect rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>LTx patients must be continuously monitored for rejection episodes that-if detected-require immunosuppressant drug (ISD) adjustments.</s><s>A major limitation of standard of care management is that, currently, suspected rejection episodes can be confirmed only by invasive biopsy.</s><s>However, using serial biopsies to repeatedly assess graft integrity-to adjust ISD treatment and thereby individualize treatment-is often clinically impossible as well as impractical, cost-prohibitive, and a major burden for patients.</s><s>Biopsies also have limited sensitivity and specificity as well as turn-around times that limit their usefulness for making rapid ISD dosing decisions.</s><s>A number of conventional liver function tests (LFTs) are routinely used to assess graft function, but they are not diagnostic for assessing acute cellular or antibody-mediated rejection after LTx <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs is helpful for making some ISD dosing decisions, but it is more useful to prevent toxicity than to predict the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatment for an individual graft recipient <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, new, noninvasive biomarkers are needed that can be used to monitor graft integrity, to rapidly and reliably detect rejection, and to both minimize and individualize (i.e., "personalize") ISD therapy.</s><s>Biomarkers are needed that are practical, are cost-effective, can be used repeatedly, have rapid (same-day) turn-around time, and can be used to diagnose or predict graft damaging complications at their earliest stages.</s><s>Such biomarkers could be used in real time to assess individual minimum necessary ISD exposure after transplantation.</s><s>The early detection of silent graft injury (which can lead to acute rejection or chronic allograft dysfunction) would allow for earlier intervention, which is of particular importance for longterm graft survival.</s><s>The need for new biomarkers is best demonstrated by the fact that despite the use of traditional monitoring methods transplant patients still often suffer from both organ rejection and ISD toxicity.</s><s>Acute rejection of liver transplants within 1 y is 11.5% (agedependent range 9.4%-20.5%)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The final goal of any useful biomarker is the improvement of long-term patient and graft outcomes, by avoiding full-blown rejections as well as ISD overtreatment.</s></p><p><s>Graft-derived cell-free DNA (GcfDNA) has been shown to be a promising new biomarker for the detection of graft injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The fact that organ transplants are also genome transplants provides the possibility of repeated, noninvasive (i.e.,

target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>One of the earliest GcfDNA studies concluded that plasma donor DNA is a cell death marker, released from necrotic or apoptotic cells in the transplant organ, and may therefore be useful as a marker for rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>At the moment, GcfDNA can be measured either by shotgun sequencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref> or by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> and expressed either as GcfDNA percentage (graft cfDNA/total cfDNA) or by absolute quantification in copies/milliliter <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Other methods based on the principle of using preselected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>, but using high-throughput sequencing for readout, have also been recently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>As sequencing is expensive, more time-consuming, and not practical in the routine hospital setting, ddPCR is superior for the rapid and cost-effective quantification of donor DNA in the circulation of transplant recipients.</s><s>GcfDNA determination using ddPCR is cost-effective and, after the initial test, can provide results on the same day.</s></p><p><s>In a prospective, observational, multicenter trial, a ddPCR method for the determination of GcfDNA was evaluated as a

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental monitoring</head><p><s>Repeated GcfDNA determinations were scheduled to be performed in the study patients at specific per-protocol postoperative visits (V1: 0-10 d; V2: 11-30 d; V3: 1-2 mo; V4: 2-4 mo; V5: 4-8 mo; V6: 8-10 mo; and V7: 10-14 mo) as well as whenever rejection was suspected clinically (S3 Text).</s><s>Missing a per-protocol visit (V1-V7) was not an exclusion criterion.</s><s>An average of 4.9 of the seven per-protocol visits were recorded for the 115 evaluated patients (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>In order to assess early ischemia/reperfusion damage, additional GcfDNA testing was performed at closer intervals during the first 2 wk in a subset of 24 patients from UMG.</s></p><p><s>Blood (10 ml) was drawn into special tubes (Cell-Free DNA BCT, Streck) for GcfDNA determination.</s><s>The stability of GcfDNA in whole blood is at least 7 d in these tubes at 6-37˚C <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>After plasma separation, which was performed within this time frame, plasma samples were stored at −20˚C prior to DNA extraction.</s><s>EDTA blood was used to measure cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and everolimus levels, and EDTA plasma to measure mycophenolic acid trough levels, by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</s><s>LFTs and ISD concentrations were measured as per local laboratory routine analyses, and all biopsies were performed, analyzed, and reported as per standard of care at the three different transplant centers.</s><s>The indication for biopsy was based on elevated LFTs and further criteria such as prolonged prothrombin time, reduced concentration of coagulation factor V, and suspicious ultrasound.</s><s>Protocol biopsies are generally not performed in the participating centers because of risk/benefit considerations.</s></p><p><s>GcfDNA was measured by ddPCR as described previously, where all PCR conditions, primers, and probes are documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, cfDNA was isolated from plasma and subjected to allelespecific ddPCR of SNP loci with known high population minor allelic frequency, selected from a predefined set of over 40 different SNP loci.</s><s>For each patient, four to five informative SNP assays -for which the recipient showed homozygosity and the donor differed-were selected from an individual prescreen of the total set and used to quantify the GcfDNA fractional abundance.</s><s>Prescreening involved (i) genotyping the 40 SNPs using the recipient's white blood cell (WBC) DNA in real-time PCR format and (ii) testing all SNPs homozygous in the recipient for the presence of at least one heterologous allele in pre-amplified cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in ddPCR format, where homozygous graft SNPs can be distinguished from heterozygous by their double percentage.</s><s>The assay selection procedure was applied only once for each patient, and all subsequent samples were tested only with the patient's personal informative assay set.</s><s>Final GcfDNA percentages were obtained by summing the fractional abundances of the 4-5 informative assays, where heterozygote SNP values were multiplied by two and the result divided by the number of used assays.</s><s>Based on population statistics, only one in about 35 million random donor-recipient combinations would not reach the number of four informative loci for GcfDNA quantification when 40 loci, selected as above, are prescreened.</s><s>In living related transplantation, parent-offspring combinations would lead to one in about 1,000, and siblings to one in about 125,000, untestable combinations; use of this technique is not applicable for transplantation between identical twins.</s><s>All testing was done using a QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad).</s></p><p><s>Sample source was masked by assigning a unique study number to each patient, which was used for sample tracking throughout the study.</s></p></div>
