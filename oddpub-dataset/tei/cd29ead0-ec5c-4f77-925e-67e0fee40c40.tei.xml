<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Activation of TGFβ1 signaling induces TAGLN expression and enhances hMSC differentiation.</s><s>We have identified TAGLN as one out of 11 genes that were upregulated during osteogenic differentiation and adipogenic differentiation of hMSC as well as enriched in the hMSC clone 1 high osteogenic cell (CL1) cell line, which is an hMSC cell line that exhibits enhanced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>We chose TAGLN as its role in regulating hMSC differentiation has not been investigated.</s><s>Given the known role of TGFβ signaling in regulating TAGLN expression, we subsequently assessed the effect of TGFβ treatment on TAGLN expression and hMSC differentiation.</s><s>Adding TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml) to osteoblast induction medium enhanced osteoblast differentiation as evidenced by increased extracellular mineralized matrix formation (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b and c</ref>) and expression of osteoblast lineage gene markers: RUNX2 (runt related runt related transcription factor 2), ALPL (alkaline phosphatase, liver/bone/kidney) and osteocalcin (OC; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, TGFβ1 enhanced adipocytic differentiation as evidenced by increased formation of mature lipid-filled adipocytes (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e and f</ref>) and expression of adipocyte lineage gene markers: PPARG2 (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma), LPL (lipoprotein lipase), and adiponectin (ADIPOQ; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s><s>Adding TGFβ1 signaling inhibitor SB 431542 (SB; 10 μm) to the induction media abolished TGFβ1-stimulatory effect (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-g</ref>).</s><s>As seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>, the enhanced osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation by TGFβ1 treatment was associated with increased expression of TAGLN.</s><s>Doseresponse experiments revealed induction of TAGLN by TGFβ1 in a concentration range 0.1-20 ng/ml following 24 or 48 h treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>).</s><s>The specificity of TGFβ1 induction of TAGLN was confirmed by adding SB 431542 (10 μm) to the culture media for variable time (2 h-72 h) that resulted in inhibition of TAGLN expression already after 2 h treatment and with a maximal effect observed after 24 h and it continued for 72 h (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1j</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed the induction of TAGLN by TGFβ1 and inhibition by SB using western blot analysis (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>To investigate whether the TGFβ1-induced TAGLN expression is mediated by the SMAD2-/3 pathway, we tested phosphorylation levels of SMAD2 and found that TGFβ1 treatment increased phospho-SMAD2 levels (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>TAGLN-depleted cells exhibited impaired osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation.</s><s>As the enhanced osteoblastic and adipocytic differentiation by TGFβ1 was associated with increased TAGLN expression, we employed a loss-of-function approach to assess the role of TAGLN in the differentiation processes.</s><s>Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-targeting TAGLN downregulated TAGLN gene expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) even in the presence of TGFβ1 (10 ng/ml; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Western blot analysis confirmed suppression of TAGLN expression at the protein level (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, TAGLN-siRNA cells exhibited impaired osteoblast differentiation demonstrated by significant reduction in mineralized matrix formation in absence or presence of TGFβ1 treatment (10 ng/ml; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) that was confirmed by alizarin red quantification (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), and decreased expression of osteoblastic gene markers: RUNX2, ALPL, COL1A1 (collagen type I alpha), COL1A2, periostin (POSTN), and DICKKOPFrelated protein 2 (DKK2; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>).</s><s>The following markers RUNX2, POSTN, and DKK2 were upregulated in the presence of TGFβ1 and were significantly decreased in TAGLN-siRNA cells (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, TAGLN-siRNA cells exhibited impaired adipocytic differentiation shown by decreased number of lipidfilled mature adipocytes quantified by Nile Red staining (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>) and decreased expression of adipocytic gene markers: PPARΥ2, LPL, AP2, and ADIPOQ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>The effects of TAGLN deficiency on hMSC differentiation were further confirmed by establishing hMSC with a stable knockdown of TAGLN using shRNA (TAGLN-shRNA), where similar results were obtained (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>TAGLN overexpression exhibited enhanced osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation of hMSC.</s><s>We established a TAGLN stably overexpressing hMSC-TERT (TAGLN-hMSC) by lentiviral transduction.</s><s>The overexpression of TAGLN was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), western blot analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), and immunocytochemical staining (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>To examine the in vivo differentiation capacity, TAGLN-hMSC cells were mixed with hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) and implanted subcutaneously into non-obese diabetic/ severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice.</s><s>Histological analysis of the implants revealed significant increased formation of ectopic bone in TAGLN-hMSC, as assessed by twofold increase in quantification of newly formed bone of TAGLN-hMSC comparing with the control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>Following differentiation induction, TAGLN-hMSC exhibited enhanced differentiation to osteoblastic cells evidenced by increased Alizarin Red S staining for formed mineralized matrix and expression of osteogenic gene markers (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e-g</ref>).</s><s>In addition, adipocyte differentiation was enhanced as shown by increased number of Nile Redpositive mature adipocytes and significant upregulation of adipocytic gene expression (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3h-j</ref>).</s></p><p><s>TAGLN-overexpressing hFFs exhibited enhanced osteoblastic and adipocytic differentiation.</s><s>To confirm that TAGLN's osteogenic and adipogenic induction potential is not restricted to BM-derived hMSC, we sought to assess the role of TAGLN-hFFs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>The TAGLN-hFF cells showed upregulation of TAGLN messenger RNA (mRNA) compared with control hFFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>), and increased protein expression as shown by immunocytochemical staining (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) and western blot analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>TAGLN-hFFs exhibited decreased in proliferation rate, enhanced cell motility, and cell differentiation (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d-i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>TAGLN inhibited hMS cell proliferation.</s><s>To study the effects of TAGLN on hMSC on the overall changes in cell number, we employed one standard assay that measured cell viability, which is Alamar blue assay and a state-of-the-art real-time monitoring cell number using real-time cell analysis (RTCA, DP system).</s><s>In addition, we applied growth curves based on direct cell counting and expressed as cumulative population doublings (PDs) over 18 days of culture, in which TAGLN-shRNA exhibited higher PD rate compared with control cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>RTCA DP system and Alamar blue assays showed increased proliferation in TAGLN-shRNA (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b and c</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, TAGLN-hMSC exhibited decreased cell viability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>TAGLN enhanced hMSC migration.</s><s>TAGLN has previously been implicated in cell migration; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> however, the role of TAGLN expression in hMSC migration has not been studied.</s><s>Thus, we studied the effects of TAGLN deficiency and overexpression on hMSC cell migration in two independent assays.</s><s>In scratch assays, TAGLN-hMSC migrated faster and tended to close the scratch defect compared with control cells or TAGLN-shRNA (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a and b</ref>).</s><s>We have also conducted transwell migration assay using the RTCA DP system that revealed impaired migration of TAGLN-shRNA compared with control cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>).</s><s>TAGLN-shRNA cells exhibited cellular and nuclear morphological changes.</s><s>The observed effects of TAGLN on hMSC cell migration prompted us to study its effects on cell morphology and cytoskeleton.</s><s>For this, we employed high content imaging using Opretta of Phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining for F-actin.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, TAGLN-shRNA cells exhibited increased cell roundness, percentage of rounded cells, index of nuclei mean roundness, and nuclei width to length ratio, but reduced cell area and nuclear area (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6d</ref>).</s><s>F-Actin staining revealed decreased staining intensity in TAGLN-shRNA cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition, we employed transmission electron microscopic examination of TAGLN-shRNA cells and TAGLN-hMSC (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>,Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3-S6</ref>).</s><s>In control cells, we observed prominent actin filament organized as bundles/ aggregates and distributed in the whole cytoplasm and in perinuclear locations.</s><s>In addition, the cells contained surfacebranched microvilli.</s><s>In contrast, TAGLN-shRNA contained relatively fewer actin filaments, whereas TAGLN-hMSC showed high content of actin filaments.</s><s>Furthermore, rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) was dilated in TAGLN-hMSC, suggesting increased protein synthesis activity.</s><s>Interestingly, cellular processes were observed extending from TAGLN-hMSC that may enhance cellular motility.</s><s>The ultrastructural characteristics of the examined cells are summarized in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">C</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Gene expression profiling of TAGLN-depleted cells.</s><s>In order to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying TAGLN functions in hMSC biology, we performed global gene expression profiling in TAGLN-siRNA cells and control cells.</s><s>Hierarchical clustering revealed that control and TAGLN-siRNA samples clustered separately (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8a</ref>).</s><s>We found that 6351 genes were upregulated and 3159 genes were downregulated in TAGLN-siRNA cells compared with control cells (fold change (FC) ≥ 2.0, Po0.02, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">F</ref>).</s><s>Among the significantly downregulated genes were integrin family (ITGA4, ITGA10, and ITGB1BP1), TPM1, Fos, SRF, and CSRP3 as well as mesodermal genes such as twist family (TWIST1 and TWIST2), and MFH-1, FoxC2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>).</s><s>In addition, osteoblast-associated genes such as ALPL and BMP4 were downregulated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8b</ref>).</s><s>In addition, Venn diagram showed 60 common downregulated genes in TAGLN-deficient cells during osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation including NR1H3, CDF, IGF2, and IGFBP2, which could potentially have a role in commitment of hMSC to osteoblastic and adipocytic lineage (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8c</ref>).</s><s>As a confirmation of the microarray data, qRT-PCR showed good concordance between microarray and qRT-PCR for a selected gene panel and are known to be involved in cell differentiation and the TGFβ pathway (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8d</ref>).</s><s>Pathway analysis of significantly regulated genes in TAGLN-siRNA cells.</s><s>TAGLN-siRNA cells exhibited downregulation in several intracellular signaling pathways including pathways regulating actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions (FAs), endochondral ossification, adipogenesis, TGFβ signaling, and MAPK cascade (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8e</ref>,Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S10-S13</ref>).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8e</ref> shows a pie chart of the top significantly regulated signaling pathways in TAGLN-siRNA cells.</s><s>Interestingly, 21 FA genes and 18 actin cytoskeleton-regulating genes were downregulated in TAGLN-siRNA cells including AKT1, AKT2, PFN1, ARPC5, VIL2, and integrins (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Gene expression profiling in TAGLN-siRNA during osteoblast differentiation.</s><s>Transcriptomic profiling was conducted on CL1 control and TAGLN-depleted cells on day 3 of osteogenic differentiation.</s><s>As shown in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>, hierarchical clustering revealed clear separation of the control and TAGLN-siRNA samples.</s><s>A list of the 17 osteogenic genes that were downregulated in TAGLN-siRNA cells is shown in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S7B</ref> and includes BMP4, COL12A1, CL8A1, FZD1, IGF2, and SMAD6.</s><s>Comparing the list of the downregulated genes in TAGLN-siRNA cells and the upregulated genes in the CL1 control cells, in the presence of osteogenic induction medium, identified 256 overlapped genes that are predicted to be involved in osteogenic differentiation (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S7C</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, using significance analysis, 6004 up-and 2752 downregulated genes were identified in TAGLN-depleted cells during osteogenesis (2.0 FC, Po0.02, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">F</ref>).</s><s>Pathway analysis on the downregulated genes using GeneSpring GX revealed significant changes in several pathways related to osteogenesis including osteoblast signaling, osteopontin signaling, TGFβ1 signaling, adipogenesis, endochondral ossification, and regulation of microtubule cytoskeleton (Supplementary Figure <ref
