<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>RA, which affects $1% of the adult population worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, is characterized by painful joint inflammation and potential joint damage in the advanced stage of disease; extra-articular manifestations, drug-induced adverse events, and distinct co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, frequently complicate the disease.</s><s>Consequently, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as indicated by physical, mental and social functioning was shown to be significantly reduced in RA patients compared with the respective general populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Based on clinical signs and symptoms, standardized measures of RA disease activity and treatment response have been, for example, the composite DAS in 28 joints (DAS28) or the ACR response.</s><s>Additionally, HRQoL was recommended to be used as an important patientreported outcome measure of RA in clinical trials <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, and has been increasingly requested by regulating agencies, such as the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (UK) and Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) (Germany), for health technology assessments, which may have great impact on national health-care expenditure.</s><s>The preferred instrument has been the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF36), because it is validated for RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[7]</ref> and cross-culturally translated <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">9]</ref>.</s><s>It measures four subscales of physical and mental health, respectively; each subscale scores from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs), notable improvement of HRQoL was found in patients with active RA treated with biologic (b) DMARDs <ref type="bibr">[1123]</ref>.</s><s>RCTs comparing the different agents regarding their impact on HRQoL are lacking.</s><s>Moreover, a large portion of RA patients treated in daily care are not eligible for enrolment in RCTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Patients who are not eligible for traditional RCTs have more co-morbid conditions and poorer functional status, both of which have a significant impact on HRQoL.</s><s>Furthermore, considering the characteristics of patients with no, one or at least two bDMARD failures, we hypothesized that these patient/treatment groups also have different HRQoL outcomes.</s><s>We aimed to describe the impairment of patients with RA compared with the general population in eight dimensions of quality of life (SF36) and, furthermore, to compare four different treatment groups regarding HRQoL, with RA patients stratified by the number of bDMARD failures.</s><s>Maintaining this stratification into treatment groups, we examined the effects of individual biologic agents on HRQoL and the portions of patients who achieved a clinically relevant minimal detectable improvement (MDI).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and patients</head><p><s>The German biologics register RABBIT is an ongoing prospective, observational cohort study on long-term safety and effectiveness of bDMARDs and conventional synthetic (cs) DMARD treatment in RA patients in daily rheumatological care.</s><s>Details of the RABBIT study design are published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, patients of at least 18 years of age meeting the 1987 ACR criteria for RA are eligible for enrolment at the start of treatment with one of the licensed bDMARDs or a csDMARD (control group) after failure of at least one DMARD.</s><s>They are observed for up to 10 years.</s><s>Prior to enrolment, all patients have to give their informed consent.</s><s>The study protocol of RABBIT was approved by the ethics committee of the Charite ´-Universita ¨tsmedizin Berlin.</s></p><p><s>The SF36 health survey on patient-reported HRQoL was introduced in RABBIT in 2007 and also approved by the ethics committee of the Charite ´-Universita ¨tsmedizin Berlin.</s><s>Patients were eligible for the present analysis if they were enrolled from 1 January 2007 onwards and had a minimal observation time of 12 months by 30 July 2012.</s><s>Patients enrolled with a csDMARD who had been treated with a bDMARD prior to enrolment were excluded from this analysis.</s><s>All publications from the RABBIT register are approved by the ethics committee of the Charite</s></p><p><s>´-Universita ¨tsmedizin Berlin.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p><s>After baseline assessment, follow-up visits were at months 3 and 6, and then every 6 months; the first 24 months of observation were used for the present analysis.</s><s>Patients were extensively monitored, particularly covering all treatment changes; at each visit, physicians assessed the clinical status and reported treatment details, including start and stop dates of DMARDs.</s><s>The composite DAS28 was calculated using ESRs.</s><s>Co-morbid conditions were documented at baseline.</s></p><p><s>Limitations in activities of daily life were assessed by the Hannover Functional Status Questionnaire, which measures functional capacity as a percentage of full function and is comparable to the HAQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[26]</ref>.</s><s>At baseline and at months 12 and 24, HRQoL was captured by the SF36 health survey.</s><s>This survey measures physical and mental health on eight subscales, which are summed up in two scales, the physical and mental component scale (PCS and MCS).</s><s>Each scale comprises four dimensions scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>.</s><s>We calculated summary scores of the PCS and MCS, as well as single dimension scores following the manual instructions (SF-36v2 Health Survey, Version 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">27]</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present analysis provides novel data concerning the effectiveness of today's DMARD therapy on HRQoL in an unselected population of patients with long-standing RA.</s></p><p><s>We found for all of our therapy strata significant improvement of HRQoL at month 12, lasting throughout the second year of observation.</s><s>Despite this improvement, RA patients were still markedly impaired in their HRQoL in comparison with the general population.</s></p><p><s>Data from RCTs demonstrated better improvement of HRQoL in patients treated with one of the licensed bDMARDs compared with the respective placebo group <ref type="bibr">[1123]</ref>.</s><s>However, patients with more than one bDMARD failure have usually been excluded from these strictly designed studies even though they represent a key population in daily rheumatological care <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we showed that RA severity characterized by, for example, higher disease activity, lower functional status and more co-morbid conditions, was associated with single or multiple bDMARD treatment failures.</s><s>Both this tendency and the preference for particular bDMARDs at each step of sequential bDMARD therapy make head-to-head comparisons of bDMARD treatment difficult.</s><s>The attainable change for the better of HRQoL was most probably determined by the particular step on the ladder of sequential DMARD therapy, that is, the respective stratum of sequential bDMARD therapy, rather than by the particular biologic agent.</s></p><p><s>Up to now, direct comparisons of data on HRQoL between patients treated with biologic agents in daily rheumatological care and the respective general population are sparse.</s><s>Similar to data from a Norwegian survey among RA patients [5], we found that our patients with long-standing RA were markedly impaired in comparison with the German general population, not only in all dimensions of physical health scores, but also in those of the mental health scores; minimal scores were found for the dimensions role emotional and vitality at baseline.</s><s>At months 12 and 24, physical as well as mental health scores were significantly and clinically relevantly improved in our patients, including those patients with more than one bDMARD failure.</s><s>However, even in biologic-naive patients treated with at least a second csDMARD, HRQoL remained remarkably reduced in comparison with the general population.</s><s>In this context, concerns may emerge that the impaired status of HRQoL in csDMARD patients marks the upper bound of a maximal treatment effect in RA patients; this is even more understandable when co-morbid conditions of these patients are considered.</s><s>Compared with a representative subsample of the German population aged between 50 and 60 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>, we found that our RABBIT patients aged 5060 years suffered about twice as often from diabetes mellitus (4.7 vs 9.4%), eight times as often from hypertension (4.7 vs 39.5%) and almost four times as often from osteoporosis (4.0 vs 15.4%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Qualifying the impairment contributed by co-morbidities, compared with patients of our cohort without any co-morbid condition, RABBIT patients suffering from one of these co-morbidities had on average a 5.0 points (95% CI 3.7, 6.3) lower PCS during the first 12 months of observation, while patients suffering from hypertension, osteoporosis and diabetes had on average a 14.5 points (95% CI 8.8, 20.2) lower PCS (data not shown).</s><s>Furthermore, the number of patients not achieving MDI increases with the number of prevalent co-morbidities (0/1/52 co-morbidities: 61.9%/65.8%/</s><s>67.7%; trend test: P &lt; 0.01).</s><s>In particular, patients in the second and third bDMARD therapy stratum were affected by more than two co-morbid conditions.</s><s>This strengthens the idea of HRQoL as an integral measure of disease burden, its impairment in RA patients is most likely to result from the orchestration of a multi-morbid health state of patients in daily rheumatological care.</s><s>The treatment target of DMARDs is the disease activity of the RA, but they are not able to improve clinical signs and symptoms of diabetes, hypertension or other co-morbid conditions if already present.</s><s>In this view, patients with early RA who are obviously at high risk of developing cardiovascular and other co-morbid conditions associated with disease activity should become a particular target population for means of prevention.</s><s>Concerning limitations, our approach of stratifying patients according to the nth bDMARD used at enrolment did not differentiate between patients receiving a third TNF-a inhibitor and patients who started on B cell depletion after failures of one TNF-a inhibitor and an inhibitor of either IL-6 or T cell co-stimulation.</s></p><p><s>At the cohort level, improvement of absolute scores of HRQoL after 12 or 24 months of observation was better in patients of the RABBIT cohort enrolled with a first bDMARD than in RCT patients treated with a specific bDMARD <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">17]</ref>.</s><s>We attribute this difference partly to the method of last-observation-carried-forward used in these RCTs; dependent on the proportion of missing data, absolute levels of PCS scores may be reduced considerably.</s><s>In addition, patients enrolled in RCTs were affected by a notably higher disease activity, with baseline DAS28 values of at least six, and accordingly, lower baseline PCS scores of about 30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">17]</ref>.</s><s>It is conceivable that remarkably high disease activity scores as well as lowest PCS scores are more difficult to improve than those representing a somewhat moderate impairment, respectively.</s></p><p><s>In our cohort, the proportions of patients exceeding the MDI of the PCS and MCS, respectively, were lower than the proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant improvement in RCTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">17]</ref>.</s><s>This difference is most likely due to the definition of the threshold to identify patients with improvement of HRQoL; we used the MDI, which is statistically defined and based on the measurement precision of the instrument (here the SF36); therefore, the MDI is considerably higher than respective thresholds of clinically relevant improvement used by other authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">33]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, achieving MDI in PCS (MCS) is associated with clinical improvement; RABBIT patients obtaining good or moderate EULAR response at month 3 had 77% (34%) higher chance of exceeding MDI at month 12 (PCS: odds ratio: 1.77; 95% CI 1.53, 2.05]; and MCS: OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.11, 1.62).</s><s>However, the overall rate of patients achieving a good or moderate EULAR response is considerable lower than in RCTs; 77.6% of patients in the RAPID trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref> had good or moderate EULAR response at week 12 compared with 41.952.2% in RABBIT, depending on the therapy stratum.</s><s>This is in line with previously reported differences between response rates of patients in RCTs and those in observational studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To conclude, considering treatment history including more than one bDMARD failure, we showed an improvement of HRQoL in all patients with severe, long-standing RA in response to both non-biologic and biologic DMARDs.</s><s>Nevertheless, as of the middle of 2012, impairment of HRQoL in RA patients has remained enormous compared with the general population.</s><s>Dohme, Pfizer, Roche and UCB.The principal investigators and their team had full academic freedom in study design and conduct, data analysis and publication of results.</s><s>These stipulations were delineated in their contract with the sponsors.</s><s>For the purpose of information, all six funding companies received the manuscript 30 days prior to submission.</s><s>Publication of this article was not gent on their approval.</s><s>The data interpretation, drafting, critical revision and approval of the final manuscript were performed solely by the authors.</s><s>K.G., A.R., J.L., A.Z. and A.S. had full access to all data of this study and take responsibility for data integrity and accuracy of the analysis.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIG.3Average 24-month scores of the physical component scale of each stratum of sequential DMARD therapy</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,84.53,89.69,208.27,372.19" type="bitmap" /></figure>
