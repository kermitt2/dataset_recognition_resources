Well-being* related to myoma complaints in comparison to the period directly prior to the operation, 2. General health satisfaction* (for parameters 1* and 2* each with a scale from 0 = not at all good to 10 = maximally good), 3. Would you recommend the operation to a friend (possible answers: yes, no, donʼt know).</s><s>In addition, as in the questionnaire used preoperatively, the patients were also asked postoperatively to assess their current complaints on the basis of the same eight Likert symptom scales.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical evaluation</head><p><s>The most important parameter of the data analysis was the size of the myoma, this was followed accordingly by a comparison between two patient collectives; target group = patients having a dominant/largest myoma with a diameter of ≥ 10 cm; comparison group = patients with a myoma &lt; 10 cm.</s><s>The data were pro-cessed using SPSS 20.0.</s><s>The Spearman correlation coefficient, Fisherʼs exact test and the exact Mantel-Haenszel test were used to test for relationships between the different parameters.</s><s>For a comparison of the severity of complaints before and after the abdominal myoma enucleation, the exact Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used and the exact Mann-Whitney U test was used to check for differences in the independent variables.</s><s>For all statistical tests a significance level of p (2-sided) ≤ 0.05 was assumed.</s><s>The principles for good scientific practice and data protection set out in the charter of the Charité -University Medical School Berlin were strictly applied, the Institutional Board gave its approval for this study.</s></p></div>
