<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In addition to previous findings regarding the clinical outcomes and composite PROs from the RAPID-axial SpA trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, we show here that CZP treatment, with either dose regimen, is associated with improvements in individual PROs important to patient well-being, such as pain, fatigue, sleep, and QOL.</s><s>Improvements in pain, fatigue, sleep, and HRQOL were seen from their first assessment.</s><s>This rapid improvement is very important for patients, as it provides swift reassurance that their treatment is effective, aiding emotional well-being and helping set treatment expectations, which may lead to better adherence to the treatment regimen.</s></p><p><s>Fatigue has been demonstrated to be a key symptom in the majority of AS patients, and can occur independently of functional impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, sleep problems are an underreported issue for axial SpA patients, which are not taken into account in most commonly reported composite PRO measures.</s><s>Therefore, the results presented above demonstrate the potential of CZP to improve some of the most important aspects of axial SpA from the patients' perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to other reports of QOL in AS patients treated with anti-TNF agents, this work reports PRO improvements in the wider axial SpA population, including AS and nonradiographic axial SpA patients.</s><s>Similar improvements in all PROs were observed in both subpopulations, with the exception of sleep, where improvements were higher in nonradiographic axial SpA patients.</s><s>This difference may be due to the worse baseline MOS-SPI score in nonradiographic axial SpA, or due to differences in the demographics of the 2 subpopulations (in particular the higher proportion of females in the nonradiographic axial SpA population, since sex has previously been shown to be associated with sleep problems in AS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>These improvements across subpopulations were mirrored by similar improvements in the clinical ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and magnetic resonance imaging (18) outcomes of the RAPIDaxial SpA trial, suggesting that both subpopulations, despite a lack of structural damage in nonradiographic axial SpA patients, can be successfully treated with CZP, therefore alleviating highly burdensome symptoms in axial SpA patients with objective signs of inflammation.</s></p><p><s>Normalization of patients' HRQOL is a key treatment goal in axial SpA.</s><s>CZP was shown to improve patient HRQOL, with many patients reporting improvements beyond MCID levels, and some even "normalizing" their QOL.</s><s>Substantial improvements were seen across all domains of the SF-36, with mean gains in some domains (vitality and mental health) almost reaching the age-and sex-adjusted population norms.</s><s>However, it should be noted that the baseline impairment in these (mental) domains was less than for the SF-36 physical domains (as expected in a physically debilitating disease such as axial SpA).</s></p><p><s>The limitations of this study include its relatively short time span (24 weeks) and the short period of the trial in which a full placebo population was present (16 weeks).</s></p><p><s>In axial SpA patients, CZP treatment (administered as either 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks) was shown to reduce the burden of disease on pain, fatigue, sleep, and HRQOL.</s><s>Improvements were similar in both the AS and nonradiographic axial SpA subpopulations.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Changes in health-related quality of life (QoL) in A, change from baseline (CFB) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) QoL, and B, Short Form 36-item (SF-36) health survey domains, showing combined mean score at baseline (BL), certolizumab pegol (CZP), and placebo (PBO) mean score at week 24 and age-and sex-adjusted population norms.</s><s>Number of patients for PBO, CZP 200 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), and CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), respectively, are total axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA): 106, 111, and 107; AS: 57, 65, and 56; and nonradiographic (nr) axSpA: 49, 46, and 51.</s><s>* 5 P , 0.001; † 5 P , 0.05 CZP groups vs. PBO.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,146.72,83.96,336.57,300.93" type="bitmap" /></figure>
