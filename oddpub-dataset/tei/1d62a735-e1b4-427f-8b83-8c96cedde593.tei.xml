<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data sources</head><p><s>Three RA databases were used for analysis.</s><s>The 'Course And Prognosis of Early Arthritis' (CAPEA) inception cohort is a prospective multicentre, non-interventional, observational study investigating the prognostic value of early symptoms for the development of a chronic disease course in patients with early arthritis.</s><s>Patients with symptom duration of less than 6 months were included between 2010 and 2013 in 89 German rheumatologic institutions and were followed for 24 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Patients were included consecutively.</s><s>The data at inclusion were selected.</s><s>Only patients with a clinical RA diagnosis at the last documented visit were included in the analysis.</s></p><p><s>The National Database (NDB) of the German Collaborative Arthritis Centres is an on-going prospective study that was established in 1993 as a long-term monitoring system for German rheumatology patients.</s><s>The database contains annually updated clinical data and patient-reported outcomes for unselected outpatients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>For the present study, cross-sectional data from the year 2013 from 16 arthritis centres were used.</s></p><p><s>The German biologics register (RABBIT-Rheumatoide Arthritis Beobachtung der Biologika Therapie) is an ongoing prospective, observational cohort study on the long-term safety and effectiveness of biologic and synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in RA patients.</s><s>Patients are eligible for enrolment at the start of treatment with a biologic or synthetic DMARD after failure of at least one DMARD.</s><s>The register began in 2001 and contains patient data from approximately 350 rheumatologists nationwide.</s><s>The patients are observed for up to 10 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>All data sources provide information on demographics, details on rheumatologic visits, including laboratory tests, joint counts, and additional health information.</s><s>They represent patients under routine rheumatologic care in a population-based setting.</s><s>Prior to enrolment, all patients give their informed consent.</s><s>All databases received ethical approval by the Ethics Committee of the Charité University Medicine, Berlin.</s></p><p><s>Data from the German microcensus and the German Ageing Survey were available as reference data.</s><s>We found no differences between both data sources regarding the distribution of BMI, stratified by age (in years) and sex.</s><s>Due to access to anonymized data on the individual person level, we selected the German Ageing Survey (DEAS) which has been provided by the Research Data Centre (FDZ-DEAS) of the German Centre of Gerontology (DZA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The DEAS is a longitudinal survey for the analysis of life situations and biographies of people in the second half of their lives.</s><s>The data are based on nationally representative surveying (cross-sectional and longitudinal) of some more than 6000 participants from the age of 40 years onwards.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The analysis of three arthritis cohorts within the collaborative METARTHROS network enabled comparison of the BMI distribution in RA patients and the general population.</s><s>Compared to the reference data, a higher prevalence of obesity was observed in all RA cohorts.</s><s>Since the reference sample does not exclude persons with RA and other inflammatory diseases, the differences compared to healthy persons is rather underestimated.</s><s>The prevalence rate of approximately 24 % is higher than that reported from former RA cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, but similar to current data from the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to the general population, where obesity is equally frequent in females and males, in all RA cohorts it was more frequent in females.</s><s>The predominance of obesity in female RA patients has already been reported from the Rochester cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Reasons for this disparity remain unclear and cannot be explained with the current data.</s><s>Besides female sex, former smoking and a lower educational level were associated with higher BMI categories.</s><s>Current smoking was present in the majority of patients with a low BMI but in the minority of obese patients.</s><s>In addition, obese patients were less frequently seropositive in two of the present cohorts.</s><s>In other cohorts, seronegative RA has already been reported to be associated with a higher BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In accordance with the negative association with smoking, both factors can lead to the reported link of obesity and less structural damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, independent of the disease activity or functional status.</s><s>Increased joint pain and worse functional capacity in obese patients, both of which are observed in the present study, can also result from obesity and its referring comorbid conditions rather than from RA severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>RA manifested at a later age in overweight and obese patients.</s><s>This is supported by recent data from large population-based Swedish health survey where a higher BMI was associated with a reduced risk of future RA in men, but not in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The higher proportion of obese patients was already present in the early arthritis cohort CAPEA, where the mean symptom duration of arthritis was less than 4 months.</s><s>It is possible that being overweight or obese is an acquired risk factor that becomes apparent at an older age.</s><s>We observed increased joint pain and worse functional capacity in obese patients, which was debated by otherauthors to rather result from obesity itself and the referring comorbid conditions than from RA severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The heterogeneous association of various covariates with BMI categories shows that cause and impact of obesity on RA outcomes can hardly be judged.</s><s>Other aspects linked to obesity, such physical activity, failed attempts to lose weight, co-medication, and treatment adherence, probably affect clinical RA outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Regarding the relation between BMI and markers of disease activity, the composite score DAS28 is not an appropriate measure as it masks the different associations of the single components of the DAS28 as well as ageand sex-specific differences in the markers of disease activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, the effect of the BMI on inflammatory markers was not very pronounced.</s><s>However, joint counts do have a substantial influence on DAS28 values and the dissociation between TJCs and SJCs in obese patients may be responsible for underestimating joint activity in obese patients.</s><s>This distinct behaviour should be recognized when analysing the impact of BMI on treatment response.</s></p><p><s>Other interactions may be responsible for the effect observed on the ESR in females.</s><s>Hormones, cytokines, growth factors, and intracellular regulators can modify the course of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and may be differently distributed in females.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>were on average 4 years older compared to patients with normal weight.</s><s>The age at the onset of RA differed, being earlier in underweight patients in RABBIT and NDB (−6.1 years RABBIT, P &lt;
