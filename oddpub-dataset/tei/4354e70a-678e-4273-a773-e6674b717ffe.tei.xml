<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plain English summary</head><p><s>An online survey which aimed to find out levels of respectful maternity care in the Czech Republic was completed by 52 respondents, mostly midwives and doulas, working in one or more of 51 hospitals or with homebirths.</s><s>Practices not supported by research and described by between a third and a half of respondents as 'always' or 'frequently' used included: attaching an electronic monitor to women's abdomen (tummy) to monitor baby's heart in labour, shaving the area around the vagina (perineum), giving women enemas in early labour to empty the bowels and telling women to hold their breath to push when birthing.</s><s>Women birthing in hospital were described as having to lie almost flat or flat in bed, but at home, all said women would be upright.</s><s>Respondents said many procedures, such as vaginal examinations, breaking the waters around the baby and cutting the area around the vagina during birth were not explained to women, and over half said they were not asked for consent.</s><s>When women refused treatment, staff reactions were described as threatening and, sometimes, the pressure women then experienced from staff caused them to give in and accept the treatment.</s><s>One in ten respondents described treatments being done against women's wishes.</s></p><p><s>This study showed that many women experienced care that was not supported by research, that procedures were not explained to women and that some treatments were given without consent.</s><s>Many practices were not only disrespectful, but also harmful and abusive and may leave women with life-long suffering.</s></p></div>

non-consented care; non-confidential care; non-dignified care; discrimination; abandonment; and detention in facilities.</s><s>While data on the prevalence of disrespectful treatment of childbearing women are limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, findings from systematic reviews leave no doubt about its existence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and levels of the inappropriate use of interventions in middle-income countries have been described as 'worrying' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (p2185).</s></p><p><s>In 2007, Venezuela became the first country formally to define and include the term 'obstetric violence' in legislation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Respectful care in childbirth is also regarded as a human right <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and, in 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged that disrespect and abuse not only violate women's rights, but also deter women from seeking and using maternal health care services, and can have implications for their health and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In 2016, the second of the Lancet's six papers on maternal health linked respectful care with evidence-based care <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and described evidence-based maternal care as care that is 'humane and dignified, and delivered with respect for women's fundamental rights' (p2178).</s><s>Disrespectful intrapartum interventions, and/or interventions shown to be harmful when overused, include advising interventions to women whose labour is progressing normally and the baby is well, routine admission cardiotocography (CTG), continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM), decision-making in labour based on CTG findings alone, amniotomy, not encouraging women to birth in positions other than lying supine/ semi-supine, episiotomies, giving enemas in labour and performing fundal pressure (Kristeller manoeuvre).</s><s>Thus, evidence-based care is care based on best available evidence, and not on routines and interventions that are not clinically justified and can be harmful when used too soon or too often.</s><s>Also in 2014, the International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) issued a working paper on Mother and Baby Friendly Birthing Facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and, with the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), WHO and several other organisations, signed the White Ribbon Alliance's (WRA's) Charter on the Universal Rights of Childbearing Women <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> outlining the 10 criteria describing their essential attributes.</s></p><p><s>This paper presents findings from a survey of views of maternity care-givers (mainly midwives and doulas), on the level of respectful or non-respectful care given to women birth in the Czech Republic (CR).</s><s>The study was designed after a documentary was shown on television in the CR in 2015 that appeared to show some aspects of poor practice in maternity care (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-CZgwTC5bk).</s><s>In some instances this was at the level of providing care that was not evidence-based, but one scenario showed clinicians applying severe fundal pressure to expedite a birth, a practice that is not based on evidence and not recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>There is little published information on rates of interventions in the Czech Republic but the 2010 EuroPeristat figures give above average episiotomy rates of 51.2%, comparatively low rates of induction of labour (10%) and pre-labour caesarean section (CS) (12.7%) and a total CS rate of 23.1% <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In other European countries, rates of episiotomy were 75% in Cyprus (in 2007), 68.2% in Romania, 67.5% in Poland, 36.1% in Slovenia, 16.0% in Estonia, 6.6% in Sweden and 4.9% in Denmark; rates of induced labour ranged from 33.0% in Wallonia to 8.3% in Latvia and 6.8% in Lithuania; rates of pre-labour CS ranged from 38.5% in Cyprus to 6.9% in Iceland and 6.5% in Finland, and total CS rates ranged from 52.2% in Cyprus (in 2007) to 38.0% in Italy, 32.3% in Hungary to 17.1% in both Norway and Sweden and 16.8% in Finland <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Attendees (n = 46) at recent workshops for maternity care workers in Prague spoke of instances of fundal pressure being used, and gave other examples of non-evidenced based and non-respectful care, which they believed were frequently used.</s><s>This study was conducted in order to obtain maternity care-givers' views on levels of respectful care, and their perception of the prevalence of potentially disrespectful interventions and care in the Czech Republic, in an attempt to supplement the sparse existing data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maternity care in the Czech Republic</head><p><s>Forty years of socialist and communist regime in Czechoslovakia ended in 1989, with the Czech Republic emerging as a separate state in 1993.</s><s>The repression of rights and restrictions of freedom of the whole population have, since then, been reduced and women are now becoming more autonomous and independent within what had been a very patriarchal country.</s><s>However, in the maternity care environment, this progress is delayed and a hierarchical and paternalistic model of care still exists.</s><s>The ideology of such a system is demonstrated in a lack of concern towards women's needs, and autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, a lack of recognition of midwives as professionals and suppression of their expertise, including a lack of respect of autonomy.</s><s>The lack of concern towards women's needs is wide-ranging: it includes basic fundamental issues such as a lack of respect of their dignity, right to privacy during examinations and during labour to, in some instances, over-riding women's denial of consent.</s></p><p><s>Midwifery students are taught evidence-based care, and to practise holistically, but midwifery practice within national health facilities is described as impeded by the dominance of doctors in prenatal care.</s><s>Physicians also have a dominant role in antenatal care in community settings, there is no independent community midwifery care and legislation prevents midwives from providing home birth care <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The lack of availability of midwifery care leads to women choosing to birth alone at home, or with the support of a doula but there are no data on the number of women who choose to birth at home or birth alone.</s><s>In the Czech Republic, doulas support women during pregnancy, childbirth and early motherhood (https:// www.duly.cz/).</s><s>During childbirth in hospital they accompany women as partners.</s><s>For homebirths, if a woman is unable to find a midwife, a doula may be the only accompanying person.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Participants were, initially, a group of midwives and doulas working in CR who had attended at least one workshop on promoting normal birth and were willing to take part (n = 46).</s><s>Snowball sampling was then used, which resulted in a total initial sample size of 88.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment</head><p><s>A gate-keeper (PAK), a midwife who assists in running workshops to educate midwives and doulas in normal birth identified, from the database of interested participants, midwives and doulas who had shown interest in attending one of their workshops, and sent potential participants the study information packs.</s><s>The information pack included an introductory letter, an information sheet and the link to the on-line survey, and was prepared in English by CB and translated into Czech language by NS and VN.</s><s>Those willing to take part completed the anonymous survey forms online and had 14 days to respond, after which a reminder was resent to all potential participants by the gatekeeper.</s><s>The information pack included a request to circulate the link to the survey to any other healthcare professionals that might be interested.</s><s>Consent was assumed by completion and return of the online survey, and this was stated at the start of the survey.</s></p></div>
