Tregs were isolated from STAT3 −/− and wild type (WT) mice and cultured with or without NAD + .</s><s>CD4 + IL-17A + cells and IL-17A cytokine  production were quantified after 96 hrs by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively.</s><s>Our results indicated that Tregs from STAT3 −/− mice had a significantly decreased frequency of IL-17A + cells with a reduced IL-17A production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) suggesting that NAD + induces the conversion of Tregs into Th17 cells, at least in part, through the transcription factor STAT3.</s></p><p><s>Thus, our results indicate that CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs lose their cytokine and transcriptional profile in the presence of NAD + , while acquiring a Th17 cytokine and transcriptional signature.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>It is well known that Th17 cell differentiation requires the addition of exogenous cytokines including TGF-β , IL-6 or IL-21, while IL-23 is required for their maintenance.</s><s>In contrast, IL-2 has been shown to inhibit Th17 cell development.</s><s>We have shown that NAD + is able to induce a significant increase of IL-17 production in the absence of Th17 polarizing conditions and in the presence of high doses of IL-2.</s><s>Moreover, NAD + had the capacity to induce Th17 proliferation in the absence of IL-23.</s><s>Overall our study demonstrated the ability of NAD + to convert Tregs into IL-17A producing cells independently of the cytokine environment.</s></p><p><s>Of particular relevance, we have detected a novel mechanism by which NAD + regulates the fate of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T cells.</s><s>It has been shown that IL-2 is required for Treg maintenance and CD25 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>CD25 has been shown to be of critical importance for Treg survival and function.</s><s>Furthermore, levels of CD25 have been reported as decisive for the differentiation of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs into Th17 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>The capacity of NAD + to modify the binding of IL-2 to CD25 that impacts CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T cell survival has been demonstrated recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Our study demonstrated that NAD + induces the loss of CD25 expression, even in presence of IL-2 that has previously shown to up-regulate CD25 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, we were able to show that only CD4 + CD25 Low Foxp3 + Tregs were able to produce IL-17A.</s><s>These findings were consistent with a recent study showing that CD4 + CD25 Low Foxp3 + but not CD4 + CD25 High Foxp3 + Tregs were able to convert into Th17 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The conversion into IL-17A producing cells was associated with a dramatic change in the transcriptional signature profile documented by increased expression levels of STAT3 and RORγ t, two master regulators of Th17 development.</s><s>Of note, using Tregs that are deficient for the transcription factor STAT3 −/− , did not completely abolish the conversion of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs into IL-17A + producing cells, suggesting that additional mechanisms may be operative.</s><s>In addition, changes in the transcriptional signature profile were also associated with modifications in the cytokine expression profile: mRNA and protein levels of IL-10, as well as mRNA levels of TFG-β , two cytokines produced by Tregs were reduced while IL-17A increased in a dose dependent manner.</s><s>Of note, NAD + impacted Th2 and Th1 cytokines only modestly.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, our results demonstrated that NAD + promotes the conversion of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs into CD4 + IL-17A + T cells.</s><s>The capacity of NAD + to convert Tregs into IL-17A producing cells may explain increased numbers of CD4 + IL17A + T cells observed in mice treated with NAD + .</s><s>However, we cannot rule out that the increased Th17 response observed after NAD + treatment may result from conventional CD4 + T cells as well.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, it has been shown that both, ATP and NAD + activate P2RX7 at very low concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>In contrast to NAD + , ATP requires the presence of IL-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> to convert Tregs into IL-17A producing cells suggesting that the higher affinity of NAD + to purinergic receptors may induce a more robust response and/or activate additional signaling pathways.</s><s>In addition, blocking P2RX4 and P2RX7 reduced Treg conversion into IL-17 producing cells, suggesting that these receptors may play differential roles in NAD + signaling mechanisms and Treg conversion.</s></p><p><s>The in vivo and potentially clinical relevance of our findings has finally been demonstrated in a skin transplant mouse model.</s><s>Recipient animals treated daily with NAD + had a dramatically increased allograft survival when compared to controls.</s><s>It is well established that Tregs play a key role in immunoregulation and T cell homeostasis.</s><s>Moreover, it has been shown that Tregs promote allograft survival while IL-17A enhances allograft rejection.</s><s>Interestingly, despite reduced numbers of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + Tregs and despite the augmented Th17 response, NAD + was able to promote a robust prolongation of allograft survival.</s><s>On a mechanistic level, we found that NAD + prolonged allograft survival by promoting a robust systemic IL-10 production.</s><s>We have subsequently demonstrated the critical impact of IL-10 in communicating the immunoregulatory properties by NAD + in IL-10 −/− mice.</s><s>When IL-10 −/− mice were treated with NAD + , allograft survival was shorter than that observed in WT mice.</s><s>These results were consistent with our previous study exploring the immunregulatory properties of NAD + in the context of autoimmune disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and other reports indicating that IL-10 promotes allograft survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>More importantly, decreased frequencies and reduced IL-10 expression of Tregs in our transplant model suggest that the increased frequency of CD4 + IL-10 + producing cells may not originate from Tregs but rather from conventional CD4 + T cells.</s><s>Interestingly, we did not observe differences in transplant survival in CD4 −/− mice treated with PBS or NAD + indicating that CD4 + T cells play a central role in NAD + -mediated allograft survival.</s><s>Additional explorations on the impact of NAD + on other key immune cells such as CD8 + T, dendritic and B cells will require exploration.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our study demonstrates that NAD + modifies systemic immune responses in alloimmunity emphasizing on unique and novel immunoregulatory properties in addition to therapeutic applications of immunodeficient patients with Foxp3 gene mutations.</s></p></div>
