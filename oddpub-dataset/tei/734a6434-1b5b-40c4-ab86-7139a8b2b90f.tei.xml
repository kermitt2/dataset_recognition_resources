<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>introduction and illustrative example</head><p><s>Building prognostic models and supporting the search for new prognostic factors has become one of the main tasks for biostatisticians in the field of oncology.</s><s>One of the most interesting issues relates to the 'importance' of such prognostic factors to be defined below.</s><s>In studies of patient survival, this issue often is inappropriately addressed by hazard ratios (HRs) from a Cox proportional hazards model.</s></p><p><s>For illustration, we use an example dataset of 275 advancedstage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>We restrict our illustrative investigation to the 227 late-stage serous tumors and to the effect of four established clinical factors on overall survival: age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, grading and the presence of residual tumor.</s><s>Patient characteristics are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival functions for age and FIGO stage are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and suggest some influence of these factors on survival.</s></p><p><s>In a standard analysis, HRs from simple and multiple Cox regression models serve as unadjusted or adjusted effect estimates.</s><s>Results from SAS 9.4 proc phreg (SAS Institute, 2012) are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Except for grading all prognostic factors exhibit a statistically significant influence on survival which is maintained after adjustment for the respective other factors in the multiple regression model.</s><s>The adjusted HR for age indicates that an increase of age by 10 years results in an increase of the instantaneous risk (i.e. the hazard) of death by 35%.</s><s>Presence of FIGO stage IV and residual tumor increases the risk by 151% and 74%, respectively.</s><s>In contrast, the HR for grading is close to 1 after taking the other factors' influence into account.</s><s>The confidence intervals indicate moderate variability in our HR estimates.</s></p><p><s>In the oncologic literature, this is often the end of the story.</s><s>In our case, FIGO stage would be presented as a strong and statistically significant prognostic factor for overall survival.</s><s>Moreover, this factor would probably be interpreted as the strongest factor among those investigated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>intuitive overestimation of effect</head><p><s>In the following, we emphasize that even large and highly significant HRs of prognostic factors generally do not translate into close determination of individual survival of patients.</s><s>Statistical significance of a prognostic factor in an adequately specified model is only a necessary, not a sufficient condition for its usefulness in prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In the context of binary outcomes, Pepe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> stress that the 'disappointing performance' of many markers when used for prediction may be explained by the fact that traditionally reported measures like odds ratios (or HRs) do not determine a marker's prognostic importance.</s><s>These authors impressively demonstrate for binary outcomes that the required large areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (say, above 0.8) correspond to odds ratios hardly obtained in practice.</s><s>For survival outcomes the simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> confirm that only extremely separated Kaplan-Meier curves correspond to high predictive accuracy.</s></p><p><s>It was noted by <ref type="bibr">Henderson and Keiding [7]</ref> that 'poor predictive accuracy is inherent for realistic survival time patterns'.</s><s>Unlike the high R 2 values attainable in linear regression, Schemper and Stare <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> report an empirical upper limit to PEV values of below 50% in clinical studies of survival.</s><s>Nevertheless, the statistical framework of prognostic models is useful beyond actual prediction permitting a succinct quantitative description of the state of empirical knowledge and its increase by new prognostic factors.</s><s>The generally low degree of predictability of medical events such as death is shared with the breakdown of other complex systems, such as electronic devices, cars or stock prices.</s></p><p><s>Histograms are commonly used to investigate the separateness of group-specific distributions.</s><s>For survival outcomes censoring complicates the construction of histograms.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows density functions, which can be seen as smoothed histograms, derived from parametric Weibull survival models using SAS proc lifereg (after carefully checking the adequacy of the Weibull model).</s><s>These plots demonstrate two important general properties of survival distributions: first, survival outcomes typically exhibit large variability which often increases with median survival (i.e.</s><s>densities with higher medians are flatter); and, second, we see a large overlap of the densities for different categories of a prognostic factor, e.g. for FIGO stage wide ranges of survival time are indeed likely for both categories.</s></p><p><s>In addition to graphical representations survival distributions are often described by their median survival times.</s><s>The differences of median survival between categories (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) seem quite impressive, even that for grading amounts to more than half a year.</s><s>However, we see that the differences in medians are only in the order of magnitude of the respective interquartile ranges or below that-which is in accordance with the high overlap of densities mentioned above.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>importance</head><p><s>We now want to extend the standard analysis by a concept that addresses the above-mentioned issues.</s><s>While there are several extensions, we limit this communication to measuring importance of prognostic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Let us conceive importance of a prognostic factor as the amount of variation it exerts on an outcome.</s><s>While the outcome in medical studies often is dichotomous, dealt with by logistic models, or continuous, dealt with by general linear models, here we focus on survival-type outcomes, typically analyzed by Cox regression.</s><s>The HRs obtained for prognostic factors hardly measure their importance.</s><s>They relate to unit changes in values of prognostic factors which are usually measured on different scales and, thus, HRs are incomparable.</s><s>Even if measured on the same scale, changing the units leads to a different value of HR, e.g. the unadjusted HR for a 1-year step of age is 1.04 compared with 1.42 for 10 years.</s><s>Standardizing the different scales by the factors' standard deviations might make HRs comparable in magnitude.</s><s>Importance should be measured on a single scale independent of the scale of a particular factor.</s><s>It should reflect the degree of variation in survival induced by the factor, ranging from 0 to 1.</s><s>It should be a measure comparing observed survival and survival prediction by a statistical model or by other means, e.g. by an educated guess from clinicians.</s><s>It should not be confined to a particular statistical model, such as Cox's.</s></p><p><s>As Healy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> asked two and a half decades ago, 'why is the question of importance important'?</s><s>He concludes that the reason is 'basically economic', i.e. to invest limited resources into recording those factors which most prominently induce the variation in outcome.</s><s>Specifically, importance can play a role in judging new biomarkers, comparing the understanding of the development of different cancers based on established prognostic factors, and comparing systems of risk scoring or classification for a particular cancer type.</s></p><p><s>The distribution of a prognostic factor is of substantial relevance for the notion of importance.</s><s>For a continuous factor that varies little in a population, its importance is much smaller than in case of high variability even if the HRs in both situations are identical.</s><s>For a dichotomous factor, the rare occurrence of one level reduces its importance compared with fully balanced levels, again assuming identical HRs.</s><s>The concept of explained variation presented below exactly fulfills these requirements for a suitable measure of importance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>measuring explained variation</head><p><s>Several measures of explained variation or explained randomness have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>These are based on, e.g.</s><s>prediction accuracy, or likelihood or information gain.</s><s>In this presentation, we shall follow the approach by Schemper and Henderson <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> preferred by Hielscher <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and most recently by Kejžar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>It is implemented in SAS proc phreg and in R (http://cemsiis.</s><s>meduniwien.ac.at/kb/wf/software/statistische-software/surevsurev/).</s></p><p><s>Measures of explained variation appropriately address the issue of prognostic importance for any type of prognostic factor: what proportion of the variation of survival is explained by each factor and by all factors together?</s><s>As with regression coefficients and HRs, explained variation can be defined in a marginal (unadjusted) and in a partial (adjusted) sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Marginal 'proportion of explained variation' (PEV) is obtained from a simple regression model containing the single prognostic factor of interest, while partial PEV is obtained from a multiple (i.e.</s><s>multivariable) regression model where only that portion of a factor's which is not attributable to the other factors is quantified.</s><s>Whether adjusted or unadjusted, PEV is the relative reduction of 'predictive inaccuracy' (i.e. the difference of outcome values observed versus predicted by a model) if the prognostic factor(s) of interest is (are) additionally taken into account: PEV = (D 0 -D 1 )/D 0 , where D 0 and D 1 symbolize predictive inaccuracy without and with the factor of interest, respectively.</s><s>PEV is mathematically related to R 2 , the coefficient of determination for multiple linear regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The PEVs (marginal or partial) can be obtained for each of the factors considered, which permits a ranking of their explained variation and thus importance.</s><s>Using bootstrap techniques, the importance of these candidates can be statistically compared in terms of P values <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, explained variation by the full model captures the joint importance of all factors for prediction.</s><s>Note that, in particular, due to the frequent correlation of the factors and imbalances in their multivariate distribution, neither the unadjusted nor the adjusted PEVs add up to the PEV of the full model.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref> presents the unadjusted and adjusted PEVs for our example data.</s><s>We see that the full model including all four prognostic factors explains only 14.3% of the variability in overall survival that is observed in the data.</s><s>Age, if taken as a single prognostic factor, explains 6.9% of the variability and 4.3% in addition to the variability already explained by grading, FIGO stage and residual tumor.</s><s>The PEV for grading close to zero confirms its minor importance for prediction.</s><s>Similar calculations at an earlier stage of recruitment showed that a genetic subclassification reached an unadjusted PEV of 8.5% and a PEV of 6.7% when adjusted for our four factors and peritoneal carcinomatosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to HRs, a direct comparison of continuous and categorical prognostic factors is now possible: age and FIGO stage exhibit similar unadjusted PEVs (the bootstrap P value for their comparison does not indicate significance).</s></p><p><s>We have conceived importance of a single factor or of a group of factors as the degree to which the variability in outcome can be attributed to them.</s><s>This degree is on a well understood scale between 0% and 100%.</s><s>Though the upper limit in practice usually is unattainable, the bounded range of values permits an intuitive interpretation of the entries in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>.</s><s>Of course, the judgment of when values are considered as 'large' is relative and depends on the context of investigation.</s><s>This property, however, is not confined to standardized scales such as PEVs, correlation coefficients or general proportions, but is shared with any other descriptive measures, such as means, HRs, or differences in means or HRs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>further remarks</head><p><s>In this contribution, we emphasized the importance of evaluating importance of prognostic factors.</s><s>This does not mean that we discredit standard methods of statistical analysis resulting in HRs and corresponding P values.</s><s>In fact, the evaluation of importance mostly builds on properly specified (Cox) regression models.</s><s>HRs offer a different view by quantifying to which extent the instantaneous risk of death is affected by changing values of prognostic factors.</s><s>In this way, they help to identify subpopulations at elevated average risk and to stimulate further clinical trials in interesting subpopulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We need to acknowledge that results for the importance of prognostic factors may differ between populations if the range of continuous factors or the degree of balance of dichotomous factors differs.</s><s>The dependence of importance on the distribution of prognostic factors raises the issue of representativeness which, however, is critical for any type of statistical analysis.</s><s>Or, reversing the question as Sir R. A. Fisher did back in 1922 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, it is always important to ask: 'Of which population is this a random sample?'</s></p><p><s>The recommended measure of importance does not extrapolate cause-effect relationships beyond follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>This means that the follow-up pattern of a study of survival needs to cover the time-frame of medical interest.</s><s>Importance is evaluated for this time-frame.</s><s>Even for underlying time-independent effects on survival, this is different with standard analyses.</s><s>However, under justified extrapolation, usually phrased in terms of proportional hazards, importance or explained variation may be obtained for a different time-frame than covered by the follow-up of a sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="figure">2</ref>) explored the effect of sample size on the stability of estimates of explained variation according to Schemper-Henderson.</s><s>Investigations were based on a particular cancer data set, though with an overall censoring proportion similar to our example.</s><s>They show that a standard of the PEV estimates of roughly 3.5 percentage points can be achieved by 219 patients (142 events), and of about 2 by ∼250 events.</s><s>While for comparative purposes (between models or between prognostic factors within the same model) samples including at least 250 events have been recommended, also smaller data sets permit a useful judgment of the amount of variation explained by a model.</s></p><p><s>Besides explained variation or explained randomness, other concepts and measures of prognostic value have been proposed and used in practice which focus on the discriminatory power of prognostic factors.</s><s>In particular, a time-independent (overall) C-index is available in various R-packages <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>It can be interpreted as a global concordance index similar to the area under the ROC curve for binary outcomes.</s><s>Furthermore, the concepts of net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement have been proposed also for survival outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> to quantify the improvement in correctly predicting events and nonevents when adding new prognostic factors.</s></p><p><s>In a public health context, the notion of importance has yet another facet: those risk factors which can be eliminated or reduced by a particular health policy (creating public awareness, improving diagnostic techniques, reducing unfavorable exposures etc.) are more important than those which cannot be changed.</s></p><p><s>We have summarized a topic which has not received much attention so far in the medical literature although its core concepts date back to more than 20 years.</s><s>In particular, we recommend to evaluate importance when judging new biomarkers or when comparing systems of risk scoring or classification, or more generally, when comparing prognostic factors or groups of them.</s><s>Thus, we hope to have stimulated interest in studying importance, for the evaluation of which statistical software is readily available.</s><s>funding</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table"
