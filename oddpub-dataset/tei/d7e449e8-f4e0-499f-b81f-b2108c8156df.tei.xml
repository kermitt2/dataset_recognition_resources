generated periglomerular cells to the reduced demand for this cell-type in the OB.</s><s>Investigating the relation between the extent of periglomerular neurogenesis and NPC turnover in the distal RMS irrespective of an altered contribution of subventricular neurogenesis was only feasible in a non-invasive model and by a detailed inspection of the numbers of proliferating, migrating and dying cells in the SVZ, RMS and OB neurogenic axis.</s></p><p><s>Olfactory sensation is initiated by odorant receptors expressed by olfactory sensory neurons, which are part of the olfactory epithelium that is located in the posterior nasal cavity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>The olfactory sensory neurons traverse the cribriform plate and innervate mitral cells in the OB, which carry the olfactory information to higher brain centres.</s><s>Numerous olfactory sensory neurons and a small number of mitral cells form the glomeruli <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Each glomerulus is activated by a small range of odours and odour-dependent glomerular activity has been mapped in OB-areas.</s><s>However, processing of olfactory stimuli does not seem to be organized in a straight-forward topographical map of glomeruli in the OB.</s><s>In addition to the representation of odours by mitral neuronal-activity there seem to be other levels of information-processing required, which are contributed by a network of interneurons in the granule cell layer and in the glomerular layer.</s><s>A further level of plasticity to the olfactory neuronal system is added by newborn interneurons which insert either into the granule cell-or the glomerular-layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Several independent studies investigated the role of the SVZ and the RMS in controlling periglomerular cell numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> .</s><s>However, the use of intracerebral injections <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , cerebral lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> or acute chemical ablation of the olfactory epithelium 9 likely generate pathological stimuli for subventricular neurogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> which complicate the study of new RMS-derived neurons.</s><s>To interpret the contribution of the SVZ or the RMS to new periglomerular neurons we took advantage of a model (MT1-MMP deficient mice) producing reduced numbers of glomeruli and reduced OB-size by a developmental process outside the brain.</s><s>Mice lacking MT1-MMP expression (as compared to controls) exhibited a reduced complexity in the folding of the nasal turbinates, which necessarily decreases the overall surface of the olfactory epithelium and thereby diminishes the number of olfactory sensory neurons, which vitally contribute to the formation of olfactory glomeruli.</s><s>Importantly, this approach causes a reduction in glomerular number without generating a wave of cell-death that can represent a neurogenic stimulus for by the SVZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>We found, by BrdU-tracking, that reduced numbers of newborn cells associate with the glomeruli in MT1-MMP deficient mice in comparison to control animals.</s><s>Tracking of BrdU-label retaining cells indicated no differences in all other layers of the OB with all models.</s><s>If reduced numbers of new neurons arrive at their periglomerular destination this can be caused by decreased neurogenesis, slowed migration or increased cell-death.</s><s>By quantification of the proliferation marker Ki67 and by three different BrdU-labelling protocols we found no indication for altered proliferation-rates in the SVZ or the RMS including the OB.</s><s>Also, total cell numbers in these regions were not changed.</s><s>The inspection of dividing cells (as well as the subsequent quantification of cell-death levels) was performed in a sub-region specific manner taking into account that different subsets of olfactory interneurons origin from different parts of the SVZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Next, we investigated the RMS morphology and potential differences in migration of NPCs.</s><s>Given the continuous production of new NPCs in the SVZ in all experimental paradigms it can be concluded that arrested migration of NPCs should be visible as an enlargement in RMS size <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>However, the morphology of the RMS proximal to the SVZ and the intermediate part of the RMS remained similar in all models (BrdU-tracking of DCX-labelled cells in the distal RMS even revealed a reduction of neuroblast cell numbers in MT1-MMP deficient animals).</s><s>Also, a combined alteration in proliferative and migratory behaviour of NPCs can be excluded as this would have been detected by altered cell-division levels in short-term or long-term BrdU labelling or Ki67 immunohistochemistry.</s></p><p><s>After ruling out that any statistically significant effects in proliferation or migration of NPCs in the SVZ or large parts of the RMS can be detected by comparing our animal models we studied cell death-levels in the olfactory neurogenic axis.</s><s>Therefore we performed in situ TUNEL-labelling, which visualizes DNA strand-breaks and indicates necrotic and apoptotic cell-death <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>TUNEL-assays are highly reliable indicators of dying cells as they show the final stage of different cell-death programs.</s><s>We found that the number of TUNEL+ cells was specifically and statistically significantly increased in the distal RMS, but not in any other region (including any other sub-region) in the SVZ or the RMS.</s><s>In synopsis, our intervention-free model for reduced glomerular neurogenesis showed an adaptive response to the decreased demand for new periglomerular neurons only in one part of the SVZ -RMS -OB axis: We detected accelerated cell-death rates and reduced neuroblast cell numbers in the distal RMS.</s><s>Thereby, our study supports previous reports, which used interventional techniques to show that the distal RMS has a role in generating new neurons for the glomerular layer.</s><s>Furthermore, our study suggests a signalling mechanism between the glomerular layer of the OB and the distal RMS, which can relay information on a reduced demand for periglomerular neurons to the germinative centre in the RMS.</s><s>To uncover the mechanisms regulating neural stem and precursor cell plasticity is of central interest for brain stem cell biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> and we showed that a -yet unidentified -signalling cue between the OB and RMS can exist, which regulates cell-death levels in the putative RMS stem cell niche.</s><s>Previous studies showed that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus can be controlled by environmental factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> .</s><s>The signalling cues promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity include neuronal input to the dentate gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> .</s><s>In analogy to the work on hippocampal neurogenesis, studies have been performed to modify neurogenesis in the SVZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and it was shown that environmental factors (odorant enrichment) can transiently increase SVZ-proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>However, it was also proposed that the basal level of SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis is not affected by altered sensory stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Our data support the notion that neurogenesis in the RMS is regulated independently from NPC-turnover in the SVZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and we show an adaptive response of the neurogenic region within the RMS to the reduced need for new periglomerular neurons.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>MT1-MMP
