<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Close cellular interaction and a synergistic dialogue between fetal and maternal cells is a prerequisite for successful pregnancy.</s><s>This interaction is not restricted to very early processes of pregnancy, including implantation of the blastocyst or invasion of the extravillous trophoblast population into the maternal decidua, but also takes place later during ongoing gestation.</s><s>Indeed, dissolution of the endovascular trophoblast plugs within the lumen of invaded spiral arteries at the end of first trimester results in onset of maternal blood flow into the intervillous space, enabling direct contact of circulating maternal blood cells and trophoblastic surfaces, i.e. the syncytiotrophoblast.</s><s>However, under inflammatory conditions the interaction and dialogue between circulating maternal blood cells, in particular leukocytes, and the syncytiotrophoblast may get unbalanced and give rise to damage of the epithelial integrity.</s><s>Adhesive properties of the syncytiotrophoblast are mediated through expression of molecules such as E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and ICAM-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dye et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Labarrere et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xiao et al. 1997)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The present study suggests fractalkine as another candidate amongst the panel of adhesion molecules enabling stable interaction between leukocytes and the syncytiotrophoblast.</s><s>Our previous and current experiments with BeWo cells and primary term trophoblasts provide strong evidence that fractalkine expression is induced during differentiation and syncytialization from the mononucleated to the multinucleated state of villous trophoblast <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Siwetz et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>This assumption is in good agreement with previous immunohistological observations, showing placental fractalkine located at the apical microvillous plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast, but not in villous cytotrophoblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Siwetz et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Differentiation of BeWo cells does not seem to be accompanied with induction of CX3CR1 expression, which was neither detected in undifferentiated nor differentiated BeWo cells.</s><s>This observation is in contrast to a previous study by <ref type="bibr">Hannan et al.</ref>, who detected CX3CR1 expression in the trophoblast cell lines JEG-3, AC1M-32 and AC1M-88.</s><s>Moreover, immunohistochemistry localized weak CX3CR1 expression in extravillous trophoblasts, the syncytiotrophoblast and the cell column of first trimester tissue, suggesting a role of fractalkine and its receptor CX3CR1 in trophoblast differentiation and directed trophoblast invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hannan et al. 2006</ref>).</s><s>However, with ongoing pregnancy CX3CR1 expression may be down-regulated in the villous trophoblast, as CX3CR1 was only detected in the fetal endothelium but not the villous trophoblast compartment at term <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Joerink et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Szukiewicz et al. 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, two experimental strategies, including blocking as well as silencing of the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, proved involvement of the fractalkine/CX3CR1 system in monocyte to villous trophoblast adherence in vitro.</s><s>Our results also clearly demonstrate that stable monocyte to trophoblast interaction may be driven by more than fractalkine alone.</s><s>First, monocytes not only adhered to differentiated, but also to undifferentiated BeWo cells, where fractalkine is virtually not expressed.</s><s>Secondly, blocking and silencing of CX3CR1 in THP-1 monocytes did not completely abolish their adherence to differentiated BeWo and primary term trophoblasts, suggesting involvement of additional adherence mediators in our cell co-culture models.</s><s>One putative candidate molecule may be ICAM-1, which was previously demonstrated to mediate monocyte adhesion to BeWo cells and primary trophoblasts in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Pfaff et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xiao et al. 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (IFN)-gamma, are described to upregulate fractalkine expression in various epithelial cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bhavsar et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dudas et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Turner et al. 2010</ref>).</s><s>Thus, it is tempting to speculate about upregulation of placental fractalkine under proinflammatory conditions and its implications on adhesion of monocytes to the syncytiotrophoblast.</s><s>Tightly adherent monocytes are suggested to facilitate transmission of cell-associated infectious pathogens across the placental barrier by either mediating direct infection of the trophoblast or by transmigration of infected cells into the villous stroma <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Labarrere et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Xiao et al. 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Transmigration of maternal leukocytes could be enabled by local disruption of the syncytiotrophoblast by adhering monocytes, which release TNF-α and thereby contribute to the initiation of villitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Garcia-Lloret et al. 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, upregulation of placental fractalkine, in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, may also facilitate intervillous monocyte recruitment in cases of massive chronic intervillositis, which is characterized by the presence of a CD45 and CD68 reactive monocyte/macrophage infiltrate located almost exclusively between the villi <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Labarrere et al. 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, physiological implications of stable adhesion of maternal monocytes to the syncytiotrophoblast in healthy pregnancy are rather speculative.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Xiao et al.</ref> suggested that adhesion of monocytes to the syncytiotrophoblast may be a normal mechanism of trophoblast renewal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Xiao et al. 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, fractalkine expression as well as trophoblast apoptosis is induced by TNF-α and thus could be coordinated events <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bazan et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Yui et al. 1994)</ref>.</s><s>Whether placental fractalkine mediates detection and elimination of aged trophoblasts by monocytes remains open.</s><s>Another interesting hypothesis has recently been raised by Grasso et al., suggesting a bidirectional modulation of chemoattractant signals upon monocyte-trophoblast interaction.</s><s>Accordingly, trophoblasts may be able to attract and prime monocytes to release a particular set of cytokines supporting their growth and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grasso et al. 2014</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The fact that fractalkine is detected almost all over the microvillous plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast in healthy placenta raises, however, the question by which mechanisms excessive adherence of CX3CR1 expressing maternal monocytes to the syncytiotrophoblast is prevented.</s><s>One potential explanation may be sequestration of the CX3CR1 receptor on leukocytes by soluble fractalkine, which can be released from the maternal endothelium, but also from the syncytiotrophoblast itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Siwetz et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>Another explanation as to how CX3CR1 expressing maternal monocytes are prevented from stable adherence to the syncytiotrophoblast may be detachment of transiently adhering monocytes by metalloprotease dependent cleavage of transmembrane fractalkine.</s><s>Metalloprotease dependent shedding of transmembrane fractalkine has been suggested to generally decrease the adhesiveness of endothelial or epithelial cells for leukocytes, whereas absence of shedding activity mediates enhanced leukocyte adhesion to fractalkine expressing cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hundhausen et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Schwarz et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Shedding was also suggested to play an instrumental role after adherence of leukocytes to transmembrane fractalkine, resulting in detachment of adhered cells.</s><s>Shedding of placental fractalkine from the syncytiotrophoblast microvillous plasma membrane occurs constitutively and may even be enhanced by stimulation.</s><s>Interestingly, expression of both involved metalloproteases, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)10 and ADAM17, has been shown to be increased in placentas from pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Yang et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zhao et al. 2010)</ref>, suggesting a mechanism preventing fractalkine mediated leukocyte to syncytiotrophoblast adherence in this pregnancy pathology.</s><s>Concerning the fractalkine/CX3CR1 system in human pregnancy, a well controlled balance between CX3CR1 expressing maternal leukocytes, placental transmembrane fractalkine and maternal serum level of soluble fractalkine may thus influence the degree of leukocyte to syncytiotrophoblast adhesion.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Fractalkine and CX3CR1 expression in the

THP-1 monocyte adherence to BeWo cells increased 3.5 fold after Forskolin treatment, when compared to control (d).
