<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This cross-sectional study assessed acceptability of privacy shelters to self-collect genital samples among attendees at outdoor community events who were â‰¥14 years old and who approached an STI and birth control education booth.</s><s>It also tested the use of privacy shelters among community event attendees â‰¥14 years old who requested STI screening.</s><s>This study was approved by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Institutional Review Board.</s><s>Completion of the questionnaires served as consent.</s><s>Parental consent for minors was waived.</s></p><p><s>To assess the acceptability of self-collection of genital samples in privacy shelters, completion of a paper-pencil questionnaire was offered by study staff to eligible individuals.</s><s>The choice of items on the acceptability questionnaire was informed by expert opinion and literature review and were drawn from previous study items modified for use with privacy shelters. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref> </s><s>embers of the study and clinical teams reviewed questionnaires for face validity, readability, and understandability.</s><s>Measures included participant age, gender (option responses were based on terminology being used in the community and included male, female, genderqueer, transgender male-to-female, transgender female-to-male, other), race/ethnicity, type of insurance, and measures of access to and utilization of health care (e.g., having a regular health care provider, frequency of CT testing).</s><s>Acceptability of selfsampling in a privacy shelter and four other types of private spaces: portable restroom (e.g., Porta PottyÂ®), bathroom in a health van/RV, home, and doctor's office was assessed with the following item: "How acceptable or unacceptable is it for you to collect a vaginal or penile swab sample to test for sexually transmitted infections in the following places?",</s><s>"Privacy shelter (like the one in the picture)", "Porta PottyÂ®", "bathroom on an RV", "doctor's office", "at home (and send the sample in a package to get tested by a doctor)".</s><s>Acceptability was rated using a 5-point Likert-like scale ranging from very unacceptable (1) to very acceptable (5).</s></p><p><s>To test the use of privacy shelters, mobile STI screening with privacy shelters available for sample collection was offered at two community events in 2015: Gay Pride and Black Family Reunion.</s><s>The Black Family Reunion is a regional, family focused, outdoor event celebrating African American culture with music, arts, and booths representing community organizations.</s><s>Both events were held at the same venue on different dates.</s></p><p><s>CT/GC/TV screening was offered free to all attendees, regardless of their participation in this study.</s><s>STI and birth control information and CT/GC/TV screening were offered from a vendor booth staffed by physician volunteers and study personnel.</s><s>Privacy shelters were set up next to the vendor booth.</s><s>Self-sampling instructions were posted inside the shelters.</s><s>A small table with hand sanitizer was placed inside the privacy shelters.</s><s>Attendees who chose to receive CT/GC/TV testing were provided verbal and written instructions for selfcollection of vaginal or penile samples.</s><s>They were offered the privacy shelter, a nearby public restroom, or any other location in which to self-collect penile or vaginal swab samples.</s><s>Returned samples were stored in a cooler, then frozen and shipped to Johns Hopkins University for NAAT CT/GC/TV testing in a laboratory that has validated testing of self-collected sample obtained outside of the clinical setting.</s></p><p><s>Participants using the privacy shelter were offered to complete pre-and post-use questionnaires in order to assess acceptability of and solicit feedback about using the privacy shelter.</s><s>Items on the pre-use questionnaire were identical to items on the acceptability questionnaire.</s><s>The post-test questionnaire included the item to assess the acceptability of self-sampling within a privacy shelter as well as participants' perceived safety, privacy, and comfort using the privacy shelter; cleanliness, climate control and ventilation while collecting samples in the privacy shelter; whether directions were easy to follow; and perceived self-consciousness and ease of use while entering and leaving the privacy shelter.</s><s>Response options incorporated a 5-point Likert-like scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5).</s></p><p><s>Descriptive statistics were generated for responses to items on each questionnaire.</s><s>Responses were categorized.</s><s>The primary outcome measure was the acceptability of STI self-sampling in privacy shelters.</s><s>Associations between the acceptability of self-sampling in privacy shelters and participant characteristics were explored; differences were tested for significance using the Ï‡ 2 test.</s><s>Comparison between the use of privacy shelters and other locations was tested for significant differences using the nonparametric Friedman statistic.</s><s>Using responses from the pre-use and post-use questionnaires, differences in the reported acceptability of self-sampling in the privacy shelter before and after use were tested for significance with the McNemar test.</s><s>Data were analyzed with SPSS, version 19.0 (IBM Analytics).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Ninety-five participants completed the acceptability questionnaire.</s><s>The majority (61%) were female, 45% were â‰¤25 years old, almost one-third (30%) did not have or were not sure if they had medical insurance, and 58% had not received CT screening in the past year (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>A majority of women (n=39, 67%) and men (n=16, 62%) reported self-sampling in a privacy shelter to be somewhat or very acceptable.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the proportions of participants in each category reporting self-sampling in a privacy shelter as somewhat or very acceptable.</s><s>No participant characteristics were associated with the acceptability of STI self-sampling in a privacy shelter, including age, gender, race, insurance type, having a regular health care provider, or CT testing in the past year.</s></p><p><s>Among those completing the acceptability questionnaire, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the distribution of responses regarding the acceptability of obtaining vaginal or penile self-samples in 5 types of private spaces: privacy shelter, portable restroom (e.g., Porta PottyÂ®), bathroom on a health van/RV, home, and doctor's office.</s><s>Comparison of ratings of acceptability of other types of private spaces to privacy shelters is also shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>Among women, selfcollection of vaginal samples in a privacy shelter was rated more acceptable than in a portable restroom (pâ‰¤0.001) or health van/RV bathroom (p=0.06)</s><s>but less acceptable than in a doctor's office (p&lt;0.001)</s><s>or at home (p=0.001).</s><s>Among men, self-collecting penile samples in a privacy shelter was rated more acceptable than in a portable restroom (p=0.02)</s><s>but less acceptable than in a doctor's office (p=0.001)</s><s>or at home (p=0.01).</s><s>Men provided the same rating for self-sampling in a privacy shelter and a health van/RV bathroom (p=0.53).</s></p><p><s>When mobile STI screening was offered, a total of 13 people chose to get tested.</s><s>All chose the privacy shelter for self-sampling.</s><s>One man was positive for CT, and 1 man was positive for TV (15% positive for an STI).</s><s>Among those who completed the pre-use and post-use questionnaires (n=13), the acceptability of self-sampling in a privacy shelter was rated the same both before and after use of the shelter (p=&gt;0.99).</s><s>The majority of users reported no self-consciousness when entering or exiting the shelter; that it was easy to use, clean, safe, comfortable, and private; and that it was hot but well ventilated.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The results of this study demonstrate that cabana privacy shelters are an acceptable location to self-collect vaginal or penile samples for STI testing in a mobile screening program.</s><s>We demonstrated the successful use of privacy shelters as part of a mobile STI screening program.</s><s>Use of the privacy shelters allowed our program to provide CT/GC/TV screening without immediate access to running water, bathroom facilities, a vehicle, or a building.</s><s>Age, race, gender, type of insurance, and history of CT testing in the past year were not associated with the acceptability of privacy shelters for self-sampling.</s><s>Women reported using privacy shelters as more acceptable than portable restrooms and health van/RV bathrooms, and men reported use of privacy shelters as more acceptable than portable restrooms.</s></p><p><s>Privacy shelters were chosen for sample collection by each community event attendee who requested STI testing.</s><s>Participant rating of acceptability of privacy shelter did not change after experience using the privacy shelter.</s><s>Therefore, other mobile STI screening programs may successfully adopt privacy shelters as a location for sample collection.</s></p><p><s>For groups considering the use of privacy shelter, consideration of the design is important.</s><s>We attempted to use two privacy shelter designs.</s><s>The first design was a commercially available cabana privacy shelter (Stansport, Los Angeles, CA).</s><s>The second was a cabana with a frame constructed from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe that used curtains as siding. <ref type="bibr">11</ref></s><s>t was not stable in the windy conditions present when the mobile screening was being offered and, therefore, was not used.</s><s>The commercially available privacy shelter did withstand unexpected winds.</s><s>Design features of an optimal genital specimen collecting cabana include being portable, e.g., light-weight, easy to store, easy and quick to set up, tear down; comfortable for people to be partially undressed inside during summer, winter and rainy seasons; easy to enter and exit while holding specimen collection materials; spacious enough to put materials down; offering complete privacy, including having opaque walls; having enough light to see instructions; able to be cleaned.</s></p><p><s>Mobile STI screening programs considering the use of privacy shelters may continue to be limited by a lack of availability of accurate, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived, point-of-care CT/GC diagnostic tests using self-collected genital samples.</s><s>Without on-site testing, programs will continue to incur the costs of transporting samples to a laboratory and delays in obtaining results.</s><s>Additionally, currently available laboratory tests for CT/GC are cleared for self-collected vaginal samples obtained in clinical settings and for male urine samples. 12</s><s>However, performance and acceptability of self-collecting genital samples are high. 9, 13-20</s><s>5]<ref type="bibr">20</ref> Reports comparing self-collected penile swabs to first catch urine collected at home or in the clinic have shown self-collected penile swabs performance is equal to or better than first catch urine. <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17</ref> </s><s> recent comparison of self-collected glans/meatal dry swabs, clinician-collected urethral swabs, and first catch urine for CT/GC testing showed that self-collected glans/ meatal dry specimens had a high agreement with clinician collected specimens and sensitivity and specificity adequate for use in screening programs. <ref type="bibr">9</ref></s><s>Men who self-collected penile swabs at home or in clinic reported self-collected penile swabs were easy to collect.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>17-19</head><p><s>A potential limitation of our study includes the small number of privacy shelter users.</s><s>However, the total number of people tested was similar to previous screening events using a bathroom on an RV for sample collection, that had more staff and offered testing for a longer period of time. <ref type="bibr">5</ref></s><s>Additionally, although reporting the costs and participation rates associated with mobile screening is critical for program evaluation, 1, 4 costs and participation rates were not measured in this study due to lack of resources; our aims were to assess a tool, the privacy shelter, to use within a screening program and not the program itself.</s></p><p><s>Privacy shelter use offers a unique and acceptable method for sample collection that may increase the feasibility of mobile STI screening programs.</s><s>Their use may expand access to STI screening by increasing the variety of locations where such screening can be offered.</s><s>Privacy shelters are portable and less expensive to obtain and maintain than health vans, thus have the potential to decrease start-up and maintenance costs associated with mobile screening programs.</s><s>.001</s></p><p><s>.01 A Some participants did not respond to all items; N = number of participants providing a response to each item.</s><s>Only responses from male and female were included in analyses due to small sample sizes in transgender, genderqueer and other categories.</s></p></div>
