synergy with the classic risk factors (older age and male gender) in increasing fibrosis.</s><s>At the individual patient level, it suggests that early anti-viral treatment should be considered for those at highest genetic risk of rapid fibrosis, that is, those with rs12979860 responder genotypes.</s><s>These findings also have implications for drug trials of anti-fibrotic therapies, requiring proper stratification to avoid type 2 errors, or restricting enrolment only to those at highest risk, to demonstrate an effect.</s></p><p><s>We have confirmed that HCV genotype 3 is associated with more advanced fibrosis than non-genotype 3 (ref.</s><s>30).</s><s>A recent study also indicated an approximately twofold increase in allcause mortality and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with genotype 3 as compared with non-genotype 3 (ref.</s><s>31).</s><s>Interestingly, we observed that the effect of rs12979860 responder status on fibrosis stage was more profound in genotype 3.</s><s>In addition, those with rs12979860 CC were more likely to be infected with genotype 3 than with non-genotype 3, as previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>The latter is consistent with our observation that HCV genotype 1 is associated with greater spontaneous clearance compared with non-genotype 1 (ref.</s><s>33).</s><s>This leads us to speculate that rs12979860 genotype might play a causal role in linking reduced spontaneous clearance, accelerated fibrosis progression and increased overall mortality and HCC in genotype 3 CHC.</s></p><p><s>We observed that the effect of rs12979860 responder genotypes was more important in early (F0 to F1 and F1 to 2) rather than late (F2 to F3 and F3 to F4) fibrosis transitions.</s><s>This suggests additional complexity in genetic effects.</s><s>There is experimental evidence for this.</s><s>Natural killer (NK) cells promote a proinflammatory milieu in the early stages of fatty liver disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , and IFNL and HLA-C genotypes likewise interact to influence natural killer activity, in particular during early infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>However, the validity of our observation requires verification in independent cohorts.</s></p><p><s>We have demonstrated that rs12979860 genotype influences necroinflammation and fibrosis in both CHB and in NAFLD.</s><s>This observation is novel and emphasizes the fact that common susceptibility genes may play a role in fibrosis evolution, independent of disease aetiology.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first report showing that rs12979860 polymorphisms have an association with liver histology in CHB.</s><s>Only two studies to our knowledge have addressed the role of rs12979860 polymorphisms in NAFLD, both contradictory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>The cohort sizes in these reports ((n Â¼ 160, showing an association with inflammation and fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , and n Â¼ 196, showing no effect on histology <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ) probably accounts for the divergent results.</s><s>Our larger cohorts therefore help to clarify the role of rs12979860 in liver fibrosis in these conditions, in particular the context of our consistent overall story.</s></p><p><s>It could be questioned as to why several apparently relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) of HCV-and HBVrelated HCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , which occur in the context of cirrhosis, or others on HCV treatment outcomes in which liver histology was available <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> have failed to identify associations between IFN-l region genetic variants and liver fibrosis.</s><s>However, this may be methodological as highlighted by recent criticisms of the utility of GWAS that focus on susceptibility to inform on other aspects of a disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>For example, a recent paper in Cell, leveraging from a GWAS on susceptibility, identified a noncoding polymorphism in FOXO3A not identified by the GWAS (rs12212067: T4G) that associated with the course of, but not susceptibility to, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and with an increased risk of severe malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Hence, GWAS design (for example, of susceptibility versus progression) is critical to outcome.</s></p><p><s>Recently, several functional variants have been discovered in the IFN-l region, including IFNL4.</s><s>Production of the IFNL4 protein is dependent on the DG/TT (rs368234815) frameshift polymorphism <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> and predicts HCV clearance better than the rs12979860 SNP.</s><s>A second polymorphism in the 3 0 -untranslated region region of IFNL3 (rs4803217) affects the messenger RNA stability of IFNL3 (ref.</s><s>41).</s><s>We also identified a third polymorphism, rs4803221, which predicts Sustained virologic response (SVR) better than rs12979860 (ref.</s><s>42).</s><s>Although the role of these variants in predicting liver fibrosis is unknown, especially in non-HCV cohorts, they are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs12979860 and, therefore, we speculate will provide similar results.</s></p><p><s>Although the mechanisms for the fibrogenic effect of rs12979860 genotypes are beyond the scope of the current work, some hypotheses can be entertained.</s><s>For example, Sheahan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> recently demonstrated that in human hepatocytes (HCV infected and non-infected), cell death-and survival-related networks were the top upregulated pathway in responder rs12979860 genotype patients.</s><s>In that study, donors with responder genotypes were able to generate more effective anti-viral immune responses compared with those with the non-responder genotype.</s><s>Along the same vein, Raglowet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> demonstrated higher basal interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in non-infected livers of rs12979860 responder patients.</s><s>Thus, it is possible that IFNL genotype, by activation of immune, cell death and survival responses, could on the one hand render hepatocytes more efficient at responding to infection, but on the other, drive hepatic inflammation and liver fibrosis.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that the IFNL genotype modulates hepatic inflammation and fibrosis.</s><s>This effect is independent of disease aetiology and in the case of hepatitis C is independent of, but synergistic with, age and gender.</s><s>Understanding the biological basis for these observations will be the next important step, but in the meantime our data provide an evidence base for the development of individualized patient management algorithms.</s></p></div>
