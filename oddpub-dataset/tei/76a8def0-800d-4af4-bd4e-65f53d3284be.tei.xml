<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The tight spatial coupling of synaptic vesicles and voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (Ca V s) ensures efficient action potential-triggered neurotransmitter release from presynaptic active zones (AZs).</s><s>Rab-interacting molecule-binding proteins (RIM-BPs) interact with Ca 2+ channels and via RIM with other components of the release machinery.</s><s>Although human RIM-BPs have been implicated in autism spectrum disorders, little is known about the role of mammalian RIM-BPs in synaptic transmission.</s><s>We investigated RIM-BP2-deficient murine hippocampal neurons in cultures and slices.</s><s>Short-term facilitation is significantly enhanced in both model systems.</s><s>Detailed analysis in culture revealed a reduction in initial release probability, which presumably underlies the increased shortterm facilitation.</s><s>Superresolution microscopy revealed an impairment in Ca V 2.1 clustering at AZs, which likely alters Ca 2+ nanodomains at release sites and thereby affects release probability.</s><s>Additional deletion of RIM-BP1 does not exacerbate the phenotype, indicating that RIM-BP2 is the dominating RIM-BP isoform at these synapses.</s></p><p><s>RIM-BP2 | calcium channel coupling | release probability | short-term plasticity | active zone structure A t the presynapse, coupling between action potentials (APs)   and synaptic vesicle fusion is exquisitely precise, ensuring high temporal fidelity of neuron-to-neuron signaling in the nervous system.</s><s>Two properties are thought to be responsible for this remarkable precision: a highly efficient release apparatus that transduces Ca 2+ signals into vesicle fusion and a tightly organized active zone (AZ), where the release apparatus and voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels (Ca V s) are spatially coupled.</s><s>Rab-interacting molecules (RIM) are thought to contribute to both properties, because loss of RIM impairs vesicle priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> and Ca V localization at the AZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>RIM-binding proteins (RIM-BPs) directly interact with RIM (3), the pore-forming subunits of Ca V 1 and Ca V 2 channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>, and Bassoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, and have therefore been suggested to play a role in presynaptic Ca V localization.</s><s>The Drosophila homolog of RIM-binding proteins (DRBP) is indeed crucial for neurotransmitter release at the AZ of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) because loss of DRBP reduces Ca V abundance and impairs the integrity of the AZ scaffold <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>DRBP-deficient flies show severe impairment of neurotransmitter release along with increased short-term facilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recently, Acuna et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> published a report on the combined loss of RIM-BP1 and RIM-BP2 in mouse synapses.</s><s>The authors report that although RIM-BPs are not essential for synaptic transmission, AP-triggered neurotransmitter release is more variable and the sensitivity to the Ca 2+ chelator EGTA is increased at the Calyx of Held, suggesting a larger coupling distance of Ca V and the release machinery.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we further investigated the consequences of constitutive deletion of RIM-BP2 on the structure and function of mouse hippocampal synapses.</s><s>We show that loss of RIM-BP2 leads to a moderate reduction in initial release probability, which translates into profound changes in short-term plasticity (STP).</s><s>This deficit can be overcome by increasing extracellular Ca 2+ .</s><s>We established triple-channel time-gated stimulated emission depletion (gSTED) microscopy for RIM-BP2, Munc13-1, and Bassoon, as well as for Ca V 2.1, RIM, and the postsynaptic marker protein Homer1.</s><s>Using this technique, we demonstrate that although synapse number and molecular architecture appear essentially intact, RIM-BP2 is necessary for proper coclustering of the P/Q-type Ca V subunit Ca V 2.1 with the AZ protein Bassoon at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses.</s><s>We hypothesize that the observed change in Ca V localization causes a discrete alteration in the coupling of Ca 2+ influx and exocytosis, and thereby modifies release probability and, consequently, STP.</s><s>Additional deletion of RIM-BP1 did not strengthen</s></p></div>

the membrane near the AZ center of Drosophila NMJ synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, but comparable studies on RIM-BPs at mammalian AZs with nanometer scale resolution are lacking.</s><s>Quantitative real-time PCR suggested that RIM-BP2 is the predominant paralog in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>We analyzed the spatial relationship between RIM-BP2 and two AZ components, Bassoon and MUNC13-1, at CA3-CA1 hippocampal synapses of mouse brain cryosections.</s><s>On the confocal level, RIM-BP2 colocalized with both AZ proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>To dissect the AZ nanoscale architecture, we established triple-channel gSTED with a lateral resolution of ∼50 nm in all three channels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 B-D</ref>).</s><s>Analysis of the mean distance between nearest neighbors (k-nearest neighbor analysis) revealed that RIM-BP2 is localized at a short distance to Bassoon and MUNC13-1, whereas MUNC13-1 is equidistant to RIM-BP2 and Bassoon (k = 1).</s><s>In coimmunoprecipitations from
