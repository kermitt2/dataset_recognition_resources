<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The ability of saccades to recover following nerve palsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kommerell et al. 1976)</ref> or injury to the extraocular muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Optican and Robinson 1980)</ref> suggests that the saccadic system has access to adaptation mechanisms that gradually repair persistent motor errors.</s><s>To elicit saccade adaptation in the laboratory, the oculomotor system is deceived into thinking it is in error by jumping the visual target during a saccade to a target so the eye either overshoots or undershoots <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(McLaughlin 1967)</ref>.</s><s>After a delay, a backward or forward corrective saccade, respectively, eliminates the visual error created by the intrasaccadic target step (ISS).</s><s>After many such deceptions [~100 for human <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Albano 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Deubel et al. 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Frens and van Opstal 1994)</ref>  <ref type="table">and ~1</ref>,000 for monkey <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Straube et al. 1997)</ref>], the first saccade gradually becomes smaller or larger to reduce the visual error.</s></p><p><s>Most studies suggest that adaptation modifies the motor command of saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hopp and Fuchs 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, saccade adaptation has been used in both behavioral and neurophysiological studies as a tool to dissociate the visual and motor aspects of saccade programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Frens and Van Opstal 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Quaia et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Quessy et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Steenrod et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Takeichi et al. 2007</ref>).</s><s>However, recent evidence suggests that saccade adaptation also affects the perception of the location of targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Awater et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bahcall and Kowler 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Moidell and Bedell 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zimmermann and Lappe 2009)</ref>.</s><s>These studies suggest that adaptation may occur at the sensory level, at least partially.</s><s>The visually guided saccade task (VGT), which has been used to characterize saccade adaptation, cannot distinguish these two possibilities.</s><s>In the VGT, a fixated spot jumps to a new location, and after a reaction time, the subject makes a saccade to foveate the target spot at its new location.</s><s>Therefore, the retinotopic vector of the visual target step and the vector of the desired saccade motor command (DSMC) for the saccade are the same.</s><s>In this situation, it is unclear whether adaptation operates on a signal related to the retinotopic target vector or the DSMC.</s><s>To understand the mechanisms underlying saccade adaptation, we must disambiguate these two signals.</s></p><p><s>It is possible to dissociate a visual target signal from the saccadic motor command used to reach the target by employing a double-step saccade task (DST, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, B-E</ref>).</s><s>In a DST, two target spot locations (T1 and T2) are flashed sequentially before the subject makes a saccade to T1 <ref type="bibr">(Hallett and</ref><ref type="bibr">Lightstone 1976a, 1976b)</ref>.</s><s>When the presentations of T1 and T2 are timed appropriately <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Becker and JÃ¼rgens 1979)</ref>, the subject makes two sequential saccades to T1 and T2 in the dark.</s><s>Before any saccade has occurred, the command for the second saccade would be the distance to T2 (T2-F, where F is the fixation location).</s><s>After the first saccade, however, the motor command for the second saccade must be updated by subtracting the first saccade vector from T2 to take into account the eye position before the second saccade <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Quaia et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tanaka 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Now the vectors of the initial visual target T2 and the desired motor command for the second saccade have been dissociated.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we employed various DSTs to dissociate the retinotopic target location from the desired motor command for the saccade and manipulated these two signals independently to determine their relative influences on the adaptation of saccades.</s><s>We adapted VGT saccades and determined the transfer of adaptation to the second saccades of a DST where the visual target signal and saccade command signals were differ-ent.</s><s>Also, we adapted the second saccades of a DST and assessed the transfer to VGT saccades.</s></p><p><s>Our results suggest that the retinotopic target vector influences the transfer of saccade adaptation and that saccade motor command signals do not.</s><s>Moreover, when a DST fully dissociates the retinotopic target and the saccade motor command signals, adaptation does not transfer between VGT saccades and the second saccades of a DST.</s><s>These observations allow us to speculate where and how the brain might use these signals to process saccade adaptation and to produce the second saccades of a DST.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and exceeded the minimum requirements recommended by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.</s><s>All the procedures were evaluated and approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Washington.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Procedures</head><p><s>The techniques that we use to monitor eye movements, and to train monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to follow small jumping targets with their eyes have been described in detail previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Soetedjo et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, the eye position of a head-fixed monkey was measured using a scleral search coil technique that was approximately linear within Ï® 20Â°horizontally and vertically and had a sensitivity of 15 min arc <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fuchs and Robinson 1966)</ref>.</s><s>The target for a saccade was a red laser spot (~0.25Â°diameter) projected onto a tangent screen facing the monkey via an orthogonal set of computer controlled mirror galvanometers.</s><s>A homemade Spike2 program controlled a Power 1401 data-acquisition system (Cambridge Electronics Design, Cambridge, UK).</s><s>This system controlled the laser power and the galvanometers as well as the reward to produce the tracking tasks.</s><s>It also digitized the vertical and horizontal eye and target positions as well as the laser on-off state at a 1-kHz sampling rate.</s></p><p><s>Two monkeys (L and M) were trained to track jumping target spots with their eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fuchs 1967)</ref>.</s><s>They were required to saccade to a new target location within 400 ms of a target jump and then to keep their gaze within a Ï®2.5Â°window surrounding the target location for at least 500 ms.</s><s>The next trial started 700 -1,400 ms later.</s><s>The monkeys were rewarded with a dollop of apple sauce every 1,200 -1,400 ms as long as they maintained the accuracy and timing requirements.</s><s>If they did not, the reward was delayed for 2,000 -2,500 ms, and the reward schedule was resumed when they started working correctly again.</s><s>The timing requirements between trials were the same for the other tasks described below.</s></p><p><s>Once the monkeys were trained to track a jumping target spot reliably for at least 2 h, we switched to a visually guided saccade task with the target flashed for 40 ms (VGT saccades, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) when we gathered data before and after adaptation.</s><s>We flashed the VGT target to match the condition of the flashing target presentation of the DST tasks.</s></p><p><s>We also started training the monkeys on the DST tasks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1,  B-E</ref>).</s><s>Because saccade adaptation in monkeys appears to occur on the horizontal or vertical component of the eye movement independently, all tasks involved only horizontal saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kojima et al. 2005)</ref>.</s><s>We optimized the timing of T1 and T2 for each monkey to produce the fewest number of cancelled first saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Becker 1989)</ref> eccentricity of T1 by 1-2Â°to keep the amplitude of the first saccades constant.</s><s>This adjustment was usually needed for DSTs in which the first and second saccades were in opposite directions (see below).</s><s>The duration of T2 was constant at 40 ms.</s><s>During all DST data collections, we included ~33-50% VGT saccades to T1 as catch trials to help discourage the cancellation of the first saccades.</s></p><p><s>Adaptation of VGT saccades.</s><s>The focus of this study is to examine the transfer of adaptation of VGT saccades to the second saccades of DSTs when the retinotopic target location and the DSMC of the second saccades are gradually dissociated.</s><s>We used McLaughlin's adaptation paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(McLaughlin 1967)</ref> to decrease or increase the amplitude of 12Â°VGT saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hopp and Fuchs 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, a custom behavioral control program running in Spike2 detected the occurrence of a saccade to a 12Â°target step (not flashed) based on a 75Â°/s velocity criterion.</s><s>When a saccade was detected, the target jumped 4Â°either closer to or farther from the fixation location to gradually decrease or increase saccade amplitude, respectively.</s><s>In the middle of the adaptation, we increased this intrasaccadic target jump to 6Â°(50% of the size of the initial target step) in an attempt to obtain as much amplitude change as possible.</s><s>We performed this adaptation paradigm only in the same horizontal direction of the second saccades of DSTs.</s></p><p><s>DST with first and second saccades in opposite directions.</s><s>In the first transfer test, we kept the DSMC of the second saccades constant and varied the retinotopic position of the target.</s><s>If the transfer of adaptation from VGT saccades to the second saccades of a DST depends on the DSMC, we would expect a constant transfer of adaptation regardless of the retinotopic positions of the target.</s><s>In this task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, B-D), the monkey started by fixating a target for 500 -1,000 ms.</s><s>The fixation spot (F) then disappeared and the laser spot was flashed at different eccentric locations in one visual hemifield (e.g., T1 at 3, 6, 9 or 12Â°to the right).</s><s>After a 5-ms delay, the laser spot was flashed at a second location in the opposite hemifield (T2 at either 9, 6, 3 and 0Â°, respectively, to the left of F).</s><s>Because the distance from T1 to T2 was always leftward 12Â°, the second saccade was always ~12Â°leftward.</s><s>The 5-ms delay was added to prevent the monkey from seeing the movement of the laser spot when the extinguished target jumped from T1 to T2.</s><s>The monkey made sequential saccades to the location of the first and second target flashes in the dark.</s><s>We did not employ a delayed task, so the first saccades occurred within the normal VGT saccade reaction times of each monkey.</s><s>If the gaze landed and stayed for at least 500 ms within the extinguished target T2 window (Ï®2.5Â°), the monkey received a reward, and the target was turned on again.</s><s>If the monkey failed to execute these two saccades correctly, the trial was aborted and the target was turned off for 2,000 -2,500 ms before the next trial started.</s><s>We call DSTs with T1 and T2 in opposite visual hemifields "DST-crossovers."</s><s>The task in which the second saccade returned the gaze to the fixation location is called "DST-refixation" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>In one type of experiment, we also relit T2 during the intersaccadic interval of 12Â°DST-refixation saccades (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>DST with first and second saccades in the same direction.</s><s>In this DST-forward task (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>), both T1 and T2 appeared in the same visual hemifield, at 3Â°and 6Â°eccentricities, respectively.</s><s>The size of both the first and second saccades was ~3Â°.</s><s>Adaptation of 12Â°VGT saccades transferred very little, if at all, to 3Â°VGT saccades (Figs.</s><s>2A, 3A, and 8B), but significantly to 6Â°VGT saccades <ref type="bibr">(Figs. 2B,</ref><ref type="bibr">3A,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 8B)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, if the vector of the DSMC determines the transfer of VGT saccade, we would expect no or little transfer to the second saccades of a DST-forward task whose DSMC is ~3Â°.</s></p><p><s>Adaptation of the second saccades of DST-refixation.</s><s>We adapted the amplitude of the second saccades of a DST-refixation using the same behavioral paradigm.</s><s>The program waited for the occurrence of the second saccades and jumped the target closer to or farther from T1 to decrease or increase the amplitude of the second saccades, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>We also performed 3, 6, 9, 15, 18, and 21Â°DSTrefixations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) to test the transfer of this adaptation to other second saccades with different amplitudes.</s><s>We found that adaptation of VGT saccades did not transfer to the second saccades of a DST-refixation task.</s><s>Different adaptation sites may underlie this lack of transfer.</s><s>Therefore, in this task we performed the opposite adaptation transfer test from the second saccades of the DST to VGT saccades.</s><s>Moreover, we also compared the characteristics of the adaptation field of the second saccades and VGT saccades.</s></p><p><s>Conditions for all experiments.</s><s>Before adaptation, we collected data from both VGT and DST saccades.</s><s>We turned off the target for 500 ms at the end of the visually guided and second saccades to minimize the dissipation of adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Shafer et al. 2000)</ref>.</s><s>To eliminate the possible eye position effects in the transfer of adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Tian and Zee 2010)</ref> between VGT and the second saccades of DSTs, we matched the starting positions of the two types of saccades.</s><s>After adaptation, the same set of data was collected.</s></p><p><s>The day after each experiment, we dissipated any remaining adaptation by having the monkey make saccades in the same task without an ISS for at least 2 h with the same amplitude as the adapted saccades or until the saccade amplitude returned to preadaptation values.</s><s>Therefore, each experiment was not influenced by the previous one.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p><s>Initial offline analysis was performed using a homemade program that ran in Spike2.</s><s>The program measured and calculated the position, amplitude, velocity, and timing attributes of the target and eye position signals.</s><s>Saccade onset and end were marked when the eye velocity crossed a 15Â°/s velocity threshold.</s><s>When a blink occurred during a saccade, we measured the end position after the blink eye movement settled to a 15Â°/s velocity threshold.</s><s>We elected to retain data with blinks because monkey M blinked during most saccades (50 -60%), and blinks should not change the end position of the gaze at the end of the saccades <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goossens and Van Opstal 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, because we turned the target off before a pre-and postadaptation saccade was executed in both VGT and DST tasks and kept it off for 500 ms after the saccade, blinks should not induce changes of saccade metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Maus et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Further analyses, including statistics, were performed using programs running in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA).</s></p><p><s>We characterize the adaptation of saccades by measuring their gains.</s></p></div>

difficult to speculate on what happens in the SC during the second saccades.</s><s>The different shape of the adaptation fields of VGT saccades and the second saccades of a DST-refixation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>) suggests that during the execution of the second saccades, the active SC population might be much broader, possibly to compensate for the low saccadic burst activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sparks and Porter 1983)</ref>.</s><s>The increase in the active population might also explain the minimal transfer of adaptation between VGT and second saccades.</s><s>Further study on the SC is needed to understand the encoding of the command signal during the second saccades of a DST-refixation task.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we think that during saccade adaptation, the OMV modifies the interpretation of the visual target signal.</s><s>Based on this new interpretation of the visual target, the cFN sends a corrective signal to the brain stem burst generator to change the metrics of the ongoing saccade.</s><s>In addition, fastigio-thalamic-cortical projections could underlie the shift in target localization after a saccade adaptation <ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Before this report, it was thought that adaptation of VGT saccades transferred to any other saccades with a similar vector and, therefore, with a similar DSMC.</s><s>It did not matter which target configuration elicited them.</s><s>This leads to the idea that adaptation of saccades is a motor event.</s><s>In contrast, our data show that the adaptation of saccades depends on the visual goal of the movement.</s><s>When the goals of two different saccade tasks are dissociated from their motor commands, generalization of adaptation between the two tasks suffers even though the intended saccades of both tasks have the same motor command.</s><s>Neurophysiological studies are needed to understand the neural origin of the visual goal signal for saccade eye movements and how it could be used in the processing of double-step saccade tasks and their adaptation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.</s><s>Schematic illustration of the various saccade tasks.</s><s>A: visually guided task (VGT).</s><s>Thick horizontal bars indicate when the target is ON(bar)  or OFF (no bar).</s><s>Black and gray lines indicate the position of the target spot and eye, respectively.</s><s>F, fixation position; T, target position; M, desired saccade motor command (DSMC).</s><s>B: double-step saccade crossover task (DST-crossover).</s><s>T1, position of the first brief target; T2, position of the second brief target.</s><s>T1 and T2 appear in opposite visual hemifields.</s><s>C: double-step saccade refixation task (DST-refixation).</s><s>F and T2 appear at the same positions.</s><s>D: the same as C (DST-refixation) except T2 is turned ON again at the end of the first saccade and then turned OFF at the beginning of the second.</s><s>E: double-step saccade forward task (DSTforward).</s><s>T1 and T2 appear in the same hemifield.</s><s>F: task to elicit adaptation of the second saccades of a DST-refixation task.</s><s>When the second saccade occurs, the target jumps closer to T1 and is turned ON.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
