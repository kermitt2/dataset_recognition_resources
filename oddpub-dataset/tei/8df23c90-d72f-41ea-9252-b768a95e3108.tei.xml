target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>The reduced toxicity of SC bortezomib demonstrated in the current study enables prolonged pre-transplant treatment to achieve higher rates of ≥VGPR, which is an important

remains controversial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>The MM5 trial was the first phase III trial to show non-inferiority of two different

type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> are frequently used as combination partners in bortezomib-based induction therapies.</s><s>Data on SC bortezomib incorporated into both regimens are limited and so

n. 01971658) in newly diagnosed MM comparing VTD with VCD induction therapy will shed new light on this important issue.</s><s>In both trial arms patients will receive SC bortezomib.</s></p><p><s>There are limitations to the present analysis, since the MM5 trial was not designed to prospectively evaluate toxicity and efficacy of IV and SC bortezomib in PAd or VCD.</s><s>Furthermore, longer follow-up is needed to evaluate whether lower rates of ≥VGPR in SC-treated patients will lead to differences in progression-free and overall survival after autologous stem cell transplantation and lenalidomide consolidation / maintenance therapy.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, compared to IV bortezomib, SC bortezomib in PAd and VCD induction therapy reduced toxicity and achieved similar overall response rates, regardless of whether adverse prognostic factors such as ISS stage III disease, renal impairment or cytogenetic abnormalities were present at initial
