<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background and Objective Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue in development for the once-weekly treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.</s><s>Its effect on the rate and extent of absorption of concomitant oral medications (metformin, warfarin, atorvastatin and digoxin) was evaluated in healthy subjects.</s><s>Methods Subjects received metformin (500 mg twice daily for 3.5 days), warfarin (25 mg, single dose), atorvastatin (40 mg, single dose) or digoxin (0.5 mg, single dose) before and with subcutaneous semaglutide treatment at steady state (1.0 mg).</s><s>Lack of drug-drug interaction was concluded if the 90% confidence intervals for the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratio before and with semaglutide were within a pre-specified interval (0.80-1.25).</s><s>Results Overall, metformin, warfarin, atorvastatin and digoxin pharmacokinetics were not affected to a clinically relevant degree with semaglutide co-administration.</s><s>Estimated area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios for all concomitant medications before and with semaglutide treatment were within the pre-specified interval.</s><s>In addition, semaglutide did not affect maximum plasma concentration of concomitant medications to a relevant degree.</s><s>Furthermore, no clinically relevant change in international normalised ratio response to warfarin was observed with semaglutide co-administration.</s><s>Most adverse events with semaglutide treatment were mild or moderate.</s><s>Adverse events with semaglutide and coadministered medication were comparable to those reported during treatment with semaglutide alone, and were mostly gastrointestinal related.</s><s>Conclusions No clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were identified and no new safety issues observed with combined treatment with semaglutide.</s><s>This suggests that no dose adjustments should be required when semaglutide is administered concomitantly with these medications.</s></p></div>
