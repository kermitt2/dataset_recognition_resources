<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Data-driven models constrained with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can elucidate some of the dependencies that involve a combination of multiple brain regions underlying the observed activity.</s><s>Previous studies show that the activity in some brain regions during resting-state fMRI can be predicted with high accuracy using the activities in other regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The activity in each region of interest (ROI) can be modeled as a weighted sum of the activities of predictor ROIs ("features"), and the weights are found by optimization methods.</s><s>Weights estimate the contribution of activity in predictor ROIs to activity in the modeled ROI, and can give clues about the connectivity between the regions (either indirect or direct) with respect to signal integration.</s></p><p><s>While previous models of ROI resting-state activity achieved high prediction accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, it remains unclear in which ROIs resting-state activity depends on multiregional integration.</s><s>Some degree of prediction accuracy can be achieved using the predictor ROI most correlated with the modeled ROI.</s><s>Therefore, it is important to identify ROIs whose activity exhibits unique integration of multiple varied signals (in contrast to activity that is redundant with other ROIs and/or integrates fewer varied signals).</s><s>Estimating dependencies between ROIs is challenging due to the low temporal resolution and correlations between regions that can increase false positives.</s><s>Previous studies used support vector regression to find ROI dependencies, in a manner that was inclusive in terms of predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Finding a minimal set of ROIs that predict activity in a modeled ROI with high accuracy could serve to reduce false positives and thus better estimate the key ROIs involved and their contribution to the observed activity in the given ROI.</s><s>To address this question, methods of feature selection, which generate sparser models and relate prediction accuracy to the number of predictors in the model, are particularly useful.</s></p><p><s>One commonly-used method is recursive feature elimination (RFE), a backward feature selection method that generates models iteratively, eliminating one or more predictors in each iteration-commonly the predictor with smallest weight, which least influences the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>By examining the effect of elimination on validation error, RFE can be used to exclude redundant and spurious predictors, to arrive at a model with the minimal set of predictors that yields the most accurate prediction.</s><s>RFE was originally used to classify cancer genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and more recently was used successfully to classify brain states and conditions (e.g., resting vs. task or disease vs. control) from fMRI activity in predictor ROIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>However, the method has not been used thus far to fit and predict activity in modeled ROIs from the activity in predictor ROIs.</s></p><p><s>Another method of feature selection, "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator", or Lasso, uses L1 norm regularization of the regression.</s><s>Regularization constrains properties of the predictor weights, and generally yields models with better prediction accuracy than ordinary least-squares regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>L1 norm regularization minimizes the magnitude of the weights, and therefore yields sparse models with fewer redundant and spurious predictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>As such, Lasso has been successfully applied to fMRI data for feature selection, disease prediction and classification <ref

target="#b17">[18]</ref>, though it has not been used thus far to fit and predict activity in modeled ROIs from the activity in predictor ROIs.</s><s>Whereas RFE examines directly the relationship between model prediction accuracy and the number of predictors in the model, Lasso relates prediction accuracy to the magnitude of predictor weights.</s></p><p><s>While feature selection methods such as RFE and Lasso are useful in addressing the challenging issue of spurious predictors (reduce false positives), other methods such as elastic net use additional L2 norm regularization to reduce missing true predictors (reduce false negatives), although at some cost to the reduction of false positives <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The choice of which modeling method to use depends on the question at hand.</s><s>In this study we were interested in finding the predictors on which activity strongly depended (reduce false positives), and accordingly chose RFE and Lasso as the primary modeling methods, and used elastic net models to corroborate our results.</s></p><p><s>It is noteworthy that while the covariance matrix or partial correlations provide information about potential dependencies between pairs of ROIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, models derived from the activity data by ROI selection infer the number and combination of multiple ROIs that are jointly necessary for explaining/predicting the activity in a given ROI.</s><s>This information cannot be derived just from looking at the correlations.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we first compared different methods for modeling ROI activity, in terms of prediction accuracy and feature selection.</s><s>We used resting-state fMRI activity data from 46 subjects, and for each ROI per subject we generated models using whole-brain RFE, Lasso or elastic net to select the minimal set of ROIs that best predicted activity in the ROI.</s><s>We then determined the degree to which ROI activity depended on multiple predictor ROIs, by comparing prediction accuracy of models incorporating multiple predictor ROIs to models that used

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We used resting-state fMRI activity data of 46 subjects (~20 minutes in length per subject), and divided each brain volume to 128 ROIs (Fig 1A, see Methods).</s><s>We first compared different methods for feature selection and modeling of ROIs (for each ROI per subject), in terms of model prediction error and the number of predictor ROIs selected.</s><s>Two of the methods used RFE for feature selection, the third used Lasso, and the fourth used elastic net (see Methods).</s><s>In the RFE approach (Fig 1B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">and 1C</ref>), the validation error of models generally decreased as predictor ROIs were removed, reaching a minimum beyond which elimination of predictors generally increased the validation error.</s><s>One method to generate the final model for the ROI (which we termed RFE2), was to use the model that had the minimal validation error during the elimination process (Fig 1C, the minimum of the curve).</s><s>However, due to fluctuations in the validation error curve, even after the minimum there were decreases in validation error that followed some of the increases, indicating that not all the predictor ROIs of the model at the minimum were necessary.</s><s>Therefore, in the primary RFE method that we used, the final model for the ROI was generated using only predictor ROIs whose elimination increased the smallest validation error across the rest of the iterations that followed (Fig 1C, magenta dots).</s></p><p><s>After generating models for ROIs using the different methods mentioned above, we assessed their prediction error using the test data segment, which was not used in any stage of model generation.</s><s>The average prediction error across 108/112 cortical ROIs (excluding temporal pole and entorhinal cortex that had particularly large errors in all models, see below) was similar for the different modeling methods (24.8 ± 6.4% of the activity variance for ROIs modeled using RFE, 24.4 ± 6.5% for RFE2, 21.4 ± 5.4% for Lasso, and 21.2 ± 5.4% for elastic net, Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Prediction error of null models (see Methods) was significantly larger (111.5 ± 17.4%, chance level = 100%, p &lt; 10 −79 ).</s><s>For all ROIs, Lasso and elastic net models had comparable prediction error (difference &lt; 1%), which was also slightly smaller than the prediction error of RFE models.</s><s>However, for most (95/108) ROIs the difference between RFE and Lasso/elastic net ranged between 0.1-5.3%, and was therefore negligible in terms of effect size.</s><s>The 13 ROIs with slightly larger difference (5-8%) had large prediction error in Lasso/elastic net models (25-36%), and were therefore not well-modeled by any of the methods.</s><s>Thus, performance of models generated by the different methods was similar.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the similarity in prediction error between the different modeling methods, RFE selected considerably fewer predictor ROIs (9 ± 1) compared to RFE2 (22 ± 4, p &lt; 10 −64 ), .</s><s>The model for an ROI expressed the activity as a weighted sum of the observed activities in predictor ROIs ("features"), and predictor weights that best fitted the training data segment were found by regression.</s><s>Models were generated iteratively, and in each iteration the predictor ROI with smallest weight was eliminated.</s><s>The validation error of each model was assessed using the validation data segment.</s><s>C.

10 −6 ), as determined by t-test corrected for multiple comparisons (see Methods).</s><s>ROIs with moderate multiregional prediction gain (8%-13%) included left/right precuneus cortex 2 , left/right fusiform gyrus 2 , left cuneus cortex, and left/right lateral occipital cortex 1-3 .</s></p><p><s>ROIs with small multiregional prediction gain (&lt; 8%), and thus no dependence of activity on unique multiregional integration, included pericalcarine cortex, isthmus cingulate cortex, precuneus cortex 1 , and lingual gyrus.</s><s>For these ROIs, the activity was strongly correlated with a single predictor ROI, indicating a strong coupling between the two ROIs, which masked evidence of dependence of the activity on other ROIs.</s><s>For example, the small gain of left isthmus cingulate cortex was due to strong coupling with right isthmus cingulate cortex in 85% of the cases (with average activity correlation of 0.84 between the two ROIs), left precuneus cortex 1 in 10% of the cases (activity correlation = 0.8), and left precuneus cortex 2 in the rest of the cases (activity correlation = 0.77).</s><s>For these ROIs, the data therefore indicated redundancy in terms of signal integration during resting state.</s></p><p><s>We note that whereas ROIs whose activity is highly correlated with other ROIs would have small prediction gain, ROIs that are well-modeled and whose activity depends on multiregional integration (large prediction gain) cannot be found just by looking at the activity correlation matrix.</s><s>This is because ROIs that are only moderately correlated with other ROIs could differ in terms of how well their activity can be predicted from multiple regions, and therefore differ in their multiregional prediction gain.</s><s>For example, the maximal activity correlation of right inferior parietal cortex 2 with other ROIs was 0.78 and its average activity correlation was 0.42, its average prediction error was 17%, and its average prediction gain was 23.5%.</s><s>In contrast, whereas the maximal and average activity correlations of left supramarginal gyrus 3 with other ROIs were 0.78 and 0.42 as well, its average prediction error was higher (27%) and its prediction gain was lower (12%).</s><s>Thus, the level of activity correlation did not in itself indicate the extent of multiregional integration or prediction error.</s></p><p><s>We also note that the magnitude of multiregional prediction gain need not necessarily be correlated with the number of predictor ROIs.</s><s>For example, a multiregional prediction gain of 20% could theoretically depend on 2 predictor ROIs just as it could depend on 20 predictor ROIs.</s><s>In the first case, each predictor ROI would be responsible on average for a larger portion of the prediction gain compared to the latter case (10% vs. 1%, respectively).</s><s>Thus, a difference in prediction gain between ROIs could either be related or not to the number of predictor ROIs.</s><s>We therefore examined the relationship between the multiregional prediction gain and the number of predictor ROIs in the models, and found that ROIs with larger multiregional prediction gain tended to include a larger number of predictor ROIs (r = 0.78, p &lt; 10 −26 ).</s><s>Therefore, the different gain between ROIs corresponded to a difference in the number of predictor ROIs on which the activity depended, rather than a difference in the average contribution of predictor ROIs to the prediction gain.</s><s>Multiregional prediction gain for an ROI was not correlated with the tSNR of its time series (r = 0.16, p &gt; 0.05, n = 128 ROIs).</s><s>We found no correlation between multiregional prediction gain and subject age in any of the ROIs (p &gt; 0.05).</s></p><p><s>For each of the 20 integrator ROIs (with large multiregional prediction gain) mentioned above, we looked for key predictor ROIs on which the activity depended most (see Methods).</s><s>In the analysis of predictor ROI weights, the weights were normalized as % of the total weight onto the modeled ROI (see Methods).</s><s>For example, in models of right inferior parietal cortex   correlations), further supporting the meaningfulness of the estimated weight.</s><s>We did not find any correlation between subject age and predictor weights (p &gt; 0.05 for all ROIs).</s></p><p><s>To corroborate our results with modeling methods that do not prune predictors as heavily as RFE or even Lasso, we compared predictor ROI weights as determined by RFE to weights determined by elastic net.</s><s>Predictor ROI weights were strongly correlated between the two types of models, with the difference mainly in that RFE pruned predictors that had small weights in models derived by elastic net (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6A</ref>).</s><s>For the 20 integrator ROIs highlighted above, the correlations between model weights derived using the two methods were 0.77 ± 0.03 on average, and ranged from 0.69 ± 0.13 to 0.79 ± 0.11 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, key predictor ROIs were identified to a similar degree by the two methods.</s></p><p><s>Prediction error of models for cortical ROIs (excluding the 4 ROIs in each hemisphere with large prediction error mentioned above) was only weakly correlated with ROI size, either for single subjects (r = -0.19,</s><s>Fig 7A <ref type="figure">)</ref> or across subjects (r = -0.2,</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7B</ref>).</s><s>Some correlation is to be expected by the de-noising effect of averaging more voxels in larger ROIs compared to smaller ROIs.</s><s>While the estimated head motion was small (0.12 ± 0.07 mm, see Methods) but correlated with subject age (r = 0.71, p &lt; 10 −7 ), as is commonly the case <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the average prediction error was not correlated with subject head motion (r = -0.09,</s><s>p = 0.56,</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We used whole-brain recursive feature elimination to select minimal sets of ROIs that best predicted the resting-state fMRI activity in ROIs of each subject.</s><s>We used these data-driven models to highlight ROIs whose activity depended considerably on multiple predictor ROIs, reflected in a substantial gain in prediction accuracy of models that used multiple predictor ROIs compared to single predictor ROI.</s><s>We determined the key predictor ROIs that contributed to the activity in each integrator ROI, and showed that the integrator and predictor regions formed interconnected integration networks during resting state.</s></p><p><s>Multiregional prediction gain measures both the variety of signals that a region integrates and the uniqueness of this integration compared to other regions.</s><s>Thus, a region that is wellmodeled and whose activity integrates different streams of information more uniquely compared to other regions (less correlated with other regions) will have a larger multiregional prediction gain.</s><s>In contrast, a region that integrates similar streams of information or whose activity is coupled (strongly correlated) to the activity of other regions will have a small multiregional prediction gain, so far as is evident in the data of activity during the particular brain state tested.</s><s>Importantly, whereas high activity correlations are associated with small multiregional prediction gain, data-driven models are necessary to find ROIs with large multiregional prediction gain, and to infer the number and combination of multiple predictor regions on which ROI activity depends.</s></p><p><s>ROIs whose resting-state activity depended on multiple predictor ROIs were seen within superior frontal gyrus, rostral-middle frontal gyrus, caudal middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, and lateral orbital cortex in both hemispheres, as well as right superior parietal cortex, right supramarginal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus.</s><s>The large dependence on multiregional integration that we found in the frontal/parietal regions agrees with their involvement in higher cognitive functions such as reflection during resting state <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and supports previous indications based on correlations that these regions are functional hubs during resting state <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>The high prediction accuracy in these regions agrees also with previous modeling studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and with their high activity during resting-state <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The integrator ROIs and their key predictor ROIs formed interconnected resting-state integration networks, consisting mostly of ROIs in the parietal and frontal lobes, in line with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Our models indicate long-distance dependencies connecting the frontal and parietal networks between parietal cortex and middle/superior frontal gyrus.</s><s>The activity in the integrator ROIs did not depend significantly on subcortical ROIs, indicating that during resting-state they integrated primarily cortical activity.</s></p><p><s>For some ROIs, the models predicted activity with high accuracy but did not depend on multiple predictor ROIs, due to strong and stable correlation (coupling) between the modeled ROI and a single predictor ROI.</s><s>The size of ROIs was sufficiently large (e.g.</s><s>55 ± 14 voxels for pericalcarine or 74 ± 21 for isthmus cingulate) to be spatially well-separated to reduce the effect of spatial correlations between nearby voxels.</s><s>Thus, the small multiregional prediction gain in these regions indicates a degree of redundancy among some regions during resting state in terms of informative activity (as in the case of isthmus cingulate cortex), and/or that the regions do not integrate numerous and varied cortical signals (as in the case of primary sensory regions such as pericalcarine cortex).</s><s>While it is not possible to distinguish between these two possibilities solely based on multiregional prediction gain, the small gain can be informative along with other pieces of information.</s><s>E.g., as isthmus cingulate cortex was previously shown to be a hub during resting state <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the small multiregional prediction gain in our study indicates that its signal integration during resting state is redundant with that of homotopic and precuneus ROIs.</s></p><p><s>We have shown that RFE models predict resting-state activity with similar accuracy as Lasso or elastic net models, but with considerably fewer predictor ROIs (on average less than 10).</s><s>RFE is therefore a useful whole-brain method for generating parsimonious models that predict activity with high accuracy, and for discovering key predictor ROIs in high-dimensional brain activity data.</s><s>Future studies that focus on minimizing false negatives rather than false positives can use our framework of analyzing multiregional prediction gain and predictor ROIs with other types of models such as elastic net.</s></p><p><s>Our method is somewhat related to other multivariate methods such as partial correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> and partial least squares analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, with the advantage that our modeling method grounds the estimated interregional dependencies with their joint prediction of ROI activity.</s><s>Future studies should systematically compare our method to other common multivariate methods of fMRI analysis, for the purpose of properly ascertaining the manner in which these methods complement one another.</s><s>In addition, data-driven RFE models of ROI activity could complement connectivity analysis of pairwise correlations, by pruning ROIs that are correlated with the modeled ROI but are not necessary for predicting its activity and therefore are likely to be spurious.</s></p><p><s>The high prediction accuracy of RFE models indicates stability of integration of signals during resting state, which agrees with the previously reported stability in activity correlations between structurally connected regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>High prediction accuracy was associated with errors of ~15%-25% of the activity variance, indicating that 75%-85% of the activity in these regions was driven by stable interactions.</s><s>The prediction error could result from measurement noise as well as from activity driven by variable interactions on top of a stable core.</s><s>Given that prediction error was only weakly inversely-correlated with tSNR of the ROI time series, it is likely that the error was more influenced by the variability in interactions between regions.</s><s>Thus, for ROIs such as anterior superior/middle temporal gyrus, and rostral/caudal anterior cingulate cortex, where the error was larger (30-40%) and tSNR was average, it is likely that the resting-state activity depended on other ROIs more variably.</s><s>Considerably large prediction errors (50-60%) were seen only in temporal pole, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex and transverse temporal cortex, which are prone to susceptibility artifacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and had small tSNR in our study.</s><s>We did not observe significant relationships between subject age and prediction accuracy or multiregional prediction gain, indicating that the portion of stable interactions between regions was similar across a wide age span.</s></p><p><s>While care must be taken in interpreting predictor weights <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, in our analysis of predictor ROI weights we have used normalized weights (% of total weight onto the modeled ROI) rather than raw coefficients, to allow a meaningful comparison of weights within and between models.</s><s>Furthermore, there are several indications that the predictor weights we estimated signify their importance in influencing the modeled ROI activity.</s><s>First, the models predicted new data with high accuracy, indicating that the estimated weights capture true dependencies underlying the observed activity.</s><s>Second, the weights of predictor ROIs were strongly correlated with the activity correlations between the predictor ROIs and modeled ROI, further supporting their meaningfulness.</s></p><p><s>Similarly to previous modeling studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we show that despite the low temporal resolution of fMRI and the correlations between regions, training data segments that are not too long (~300 points, or ~10 minutes of scanning) can be used to generate models with high prediction accuracy for most regions.</s><s>Nevertheless, future models will benefit from utilizing longer datasets (e.g., the Human Connectome Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>), which we expect will better constrain the models and improve determining the key dependencies between regions.</s><s>Such datasets could also be used to corroborate the findings of this study.</s><s>Other validations could be made by comparing the robustness of models and results using different parcellations <ref
