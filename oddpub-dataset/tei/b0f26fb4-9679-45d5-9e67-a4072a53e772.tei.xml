<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>The present study was a prospective, operator-blinded study for the evaluation of potential benefit of a modified 12lead Lewis-lead ECG registration in comparison with the standard 12-lead ECG for correct diagnosis of VA conduction during ventricular stimulation.</s><s>In patients undergoing an electrophysiological study, ECGs were registered during ventricular pacing.</s><s>Standard-lead ECG and modified Lewislead ECGs of the documented wide complex tachycardias were presented to blinded examiners, who were informed about the ventricular origin of the presented ECGs.</s><s>The blinded examiners judged the ECGs on the presence of visible P waves and VA conduction ratio.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p><s>The ECGs in this study were acquired prospectively according to a study protocol approved by the ethics committee of the Charit é-University Medicine Berlin.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to participation in the study protocol.</s><s>We evaluated 94 ECGs from 47 patients.</s><s>Patients underwent electrophysiological investigation for different types of ablation, such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, differential diagnosis of syncope, and the evaluation and ablation of VT.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ventricular Stimulation and Lewis-Lead Electrocardiogram Registration</head><p><s>In the course of the electrophysiological procedure, patients were catheterized with at least 1 ventricular and 1 atrial catheter to reliably document the ventricular as well as the atrial excitation.</s><s>Ventricular stimulation was performed via a catheter positioned in the right-ventricular apex with a constant cycle length of 400 ms for about 10 seconds.</s><s>Intracardial electrograms for documentation of VA conduction type were recorded.</s><s>Simultaneously, a standard-lead ECG registration over a length of 2 pages-including Einthoven leads I, II, and III; Goldberger leads aVL, aVF, and aVR; and precordial Wilson leads V 1 through V 6 -was performed using a registration speed of 50 mm/sec.</s><s>Thereafter, ECG electrodes were moved to allow a modified Lewis-lead ECG registration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The right arm electrode was moved to the second intercostal space, right sided, adjacent to the sternum; the left arm electrode was moved to the fourth intercostal space, parasternal right, sided likewise.</s><s>The other body surface electrodes remained in the same place.</s><s>The now-varied lead I was the actual Lewis lead.</s><s>For the purpose of our study, a modified 12-lead Lewis-lead ECG version was recorded, which included the recording of the additional now-modified leads of Einthoven II and III; Goldberger leads aVL, aVF, and aVR; and precordial Wilson leads V 1 through V 6 .</s><s>This 12-lead ECG will be referred to as the modified Lewis-lead ECG in the text of this article.</s><s>Ventricular stimulation was repeated from the same stimulation site and with the same cycle length of 400 ms, as before.</s><s>Registration duration and ECG speed remained unchanged (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electrocardiographic Evaluation</head><p><s>All ECGs were presented to 6 blinded examiners.</s><s>The ECGs were anonymized and presented in random order.</s><s>No further information than the 12-lead ECG and its distinct ventricular origin was provided to the examiners.</s><s>The examiners were all physicians specializing in cardiology and cardiac electrophysiology.</s><s>Each examiner assessed the ECGs on the presence of detectable P waves and on the type of VA conduction.</s><s>Three different types of possible VA conduction could be selected: VA dissociation, 1:1 conduction, and 2:1 conduction.</s></p><p><s>Thereafter, the examiners were asked to select the 1 out of all 12 leads in the modified Lewis-lead ECG and in the standard-lead ECG that allowed the best detection of P waves and VA conduction type.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Electrocardiographic Data and Patient Characteristics</head><p><s>All together, 94 ECGs from 47 patients were presented to the examiners.</s><s>All ECGs showed a cycle length of 400 ms.</s><s>Mean patient age was 63 ± 13.21 years (20-83 years), and 28 (60%) were male.</s></p><p><s>The following VA conduction types were documented: In the standard-lead ECG group, 13 (28%) ECGs showed a 1:1 conduction, 8 (17%) ECGs showed a 2:1 conduction, and 26 (55%) ECGs showed a VA dissociation.</s><s>In the modified Lewis-lead ECG group, 13 (28%) ECGs displayed a 1:1 conduction, 9 (19%) ECGs displayed a 2:1 conduction, and 25 (53%) ECGs displayed a VA dissociation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differences Between Electrocardiographic Leads</head><p><s>The VA conduction type was significantly more often correctly detected in the modified Lewis The interobserver agreement was moderate in the standard-lead ECG group (κ = 0.45) as well as in the modified Lewis-lead ECG group (κ = 0.49).</s></p><p><s>The examiners rated lead V 1 as best lead for correct detection of VA conduction type in the standard-lead ECG group.</s><s>Details on all leads in the standard-lead ECG group are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, lead I was rated the best lead for correct detection of VA conduction type in the modified Lewis-lead ECG group.</s><s>This would be the original Lewis lead.</s><s>Details on all leads in the modified Lewis-lead ECG group are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The majority of wide complex tachycardias are of ventricular origin (about 70% to 80%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Because of their potential hemodynamically compromising impact, a quick and reliable differentiation of wide complex tachycardias is inevitable.</s><s>Misdiagnosis of those tachycardias often occurs and might lead to a poorer outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Although several ECG-based algorithms have been proposed, 1 -3 differentiation of ventricular or supraventricular origin still can be challenging.</s><s>Differentiation criteria such as the Brugada criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref>     setting by various study groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>In the clinical setting, those criteria showed less sensitivity and specificity than the initial publication suggested. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Furthermore, several of the morphological criteria favoring VTs were found in patients with intraventricular conduction defects during sinus rhythm, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> suggesting a lower specificity of those criteria in this patient group.</s><s>Possible reasons for misdiagnosis of wide complex tachycardias can include insufficient clinical experience of treating physicians; on the other hand, complexity of the available ECG criteria can be a relevant problem as well, especially in the emergency situation.</s></p><p><s>A detectable VA dissociation during wide complex tachycardia has been described as one of the most reliable criteria to identify a ventricular origin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Nevertheless, detection of VA dissociation is present in only about 50% of those tachycardias, and only a fractional amount of them can be recognized by the observer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>In our series, all ECGs were of ventricular origin because of fixed frequent ventricular pacing.</s><s>Ventriculoatrial dissociation was present in 53% of ECGs in the modified Lewis-lead ECG group and 55% of ECGs in the standard-lead ECG group.</s><s>This was correctly identified in significantly more patients in the modified Lewis-lead ECG group than in the standard-lead ECG group (mean, 71% vs 49%).The inter-rater agreement for correct detection of VA conduction type was moderate in both ECG groups, which emphasizes the difficulty of correct P-wave detection during VTs.</s></p><p><s>In our study, all ECGs were recorded at paper speeds of 50 mm/sec, and only 2 ECG pages were presented to the examiners.</s><s>It remains speculative whether a longer ECG registration strip and additional registrations with a paper speed of 25 mm/sec would have enhanced the differences between the 2 groups.</s><s>Additional ECG registration with different paper speed has been shown to improve the accuracy of rhythm diagnosis in narrow QRS-complex tachycardias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>e present the first systematically prospective comparison of the standard-lead ECG with a modified 12-lead Lewis-lead ECG.</s><s>Originally, the Lewis lead was described by Sir James Lewis with the objective of enhancing P-wave amplitudes for better identification of atrial excitation in atrial fibrillation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>The initially described Lewis lead corresponds to lead I in our modified 12-lead Lewis-lead ECG.</s><s>It has been occasionally used by clinical physicians to improve differential diagnosis in different arrhythmias.</s><s>The Lewis lead recently has been described in 2 case reports as a crucial diagnostic tool in 2 patients with different wide complex tachycardias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>It is easy and quick to apply and available nearly everywhere.</s></p><p><s>The most probable reason for the varying visibility of P waves with the 2 groups of ECG leads is the different lead vector in relation to the excitation vector.</s><s>This might cause a different P wave-to-QRS amplitude relationship, and thereby change visibility of P waves.</s><s>P amplitude itself has been shown to be not higher in the Lewis-lead ECG than the lead with the highest amplitude in the standard-lead ECG. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> In our study, in addition to the originally described Lewis lead, which is only lead I, the other lead electrodes remained in their positions and the resulting ''modified 12-lead Lewislead ECG'' was presented to the examiners.</s><s>Because right and left arm electrodes of the standard-lead ECG were thereby changed, not only the single Lewis lead itself, but also the Goldberger leads as well as the Wilson leads, were changed in their vector.</s><s>Changing the position of the right and left arm electrodes will change the average potential of the Wilson's central terminal, which is used as negative pole for the 3 augmented limb Goldberger leads and the 6 precordial leads.</s><s>This explains why the modified 12-lead Lewis-lead ECG appears to be different in all 12 leads (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Thereby, possible additional leads for better detecting P waves and VA dissociations emerged.</s></p><p><s>The ECG examiners were asked to name the ECG lead of each presented ECG that allowed the most reliable P-wave detection.</s><s>The examiners were blinded to whether the presented ECG was a standard-lead ECG or a modified Lewislead ECG, and all ECGs were presented in random order.</s><s>In the modified Lewis-lead ECG group, lead I was selected for the most reliable P-wave detection, compared with lead V 1 in the standard-lead ECG group.</s><s>Lewis lead I presents the originally described single lead by Sir James Lewis.</s><s>However, a relevant number of examiners still voted for other leads in the Lewis-lead ECG group.</s><s>So for clinical practice, the modified 12-lead Lewis-lead ECG seems to be preferable.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Implications</head><p><s>The additional recording of a modified Lewis-lead ECG in cases of unclear wide complex tachycardias might help to properly differentiate the origin of a tachycardia and, as a consequence, guide safer and faster treatment of patients with unclear wide QRS complex tachycardias.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Limitations</head><p><s>Our study has some limitations.</s><s>First, we present a singlecenter study.</s><s>Further evaluation of our interrogation with a larger, multicenter study will be necessary.</s><s>Second, the VTs in our study were all focal tachycardias, simulated by fixed ventricular pacing from the right ventricular apex.</s><s>Ventricular fixed frequent pacing in our study was only performed at a cycle length of 400 ms.</s><s>We did not evaluate the Lewis-lead ECG during faster tachycardias or in the context of scar-related re-entry tachycardias and preexisting intraventricular conduction disturbances.</s><s>And third, the evaluation of VTs in our study was performed in a nonemergency setting.</s><s>The clinical value of an additional modified Lewis-lead ECG in the emergency setting, implying less time and possibly less experience of the treating physician for ECG analysis, is still unclear.</s></p></div>
