<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>With the discovery of 45S5 Bioglass V R (45 SiO 2 -24.5 CaO-24.5 Na 2 O-6 P 2 O 5 in wt.</s><s>%) a new class of bioactive ceramic materials was created, characterized by their ability to form a strong and stable chemical bond with bone tissue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Bioactive glasses (BAGs) have since attracted immense interest in the field of tissue engineering because of their demonstrated osteoconductive (stimulation of bone growth along its surface) and osteostimulatory (activation of osteoprogenitor cells in the bone environment) properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Additionally, BAGs facilitate the formation of a carbonated hydroxyapatite layer on their surface when exposed to biological fluids, and resorb over time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Various in vivo studies have reported on the stimulatory effects of BAGs on bone healing-ranging from the regeneration of cranial defects in pre-clinical models <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> to the successful treatment of challenging bone defects in humans. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Thus, various types of BAGs have been developed with tailored chemical compositions and fine-tuned ion release kinetics to harness distinct biological processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>This has opened a whole new exciting field of research of cell stimulation by synthetic materials without the need for organic growth factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Furthermore, mesoporous silica based glasses can be produced as micron and submicron sized SiO 2 -CaO or SiO 2 -CaO-P 2 O 5 particles for the storage of signaling molecules and their localized release at the implantation site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>The design of bioactive glass structures with nano to micro scale dimensions results in an increase in the glasses' bioactivity and enables the loading of therapeutic biomolecules to further stimulate the tissue regeneration process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>oday, different classes of silicate BAGs are available on the market for clinical applications such as NovaBone, Biogran V R and Perioglas which are based on the 45S5 Bioglass V R composition.</s><s>Also, BonAlive V R (S53P4: 53 SiO 2 -20 CaO-23 Na 2 O-4 P 2 O 5 in wt.</s><s>%) is a medical grade bioactive glass in clinical use, just as Cerabone-AW V R which is an apatite-wollastonite glass-ceramic composed of a mixture of SiO 2 -CaO -B 2 O 3 and SiO 2 -CaO -MgO -CaF -P 2 O 5 glasses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>In the clinic, BAGs are mainly applied in particulate form with a size of 90 to 1000 mm, and incorporated in bone defects as stacked particulates or putties.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> Much of the pre-clinical research with BAGs has been carried out using large porous bioactive glass scaffolds, either in pure sintered form, or more frequently as polymer-ceramic composites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>Sintered bioactive glass scaffolds are brittle in nature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and may break down into smaller particles and debris in response to wear, articulation, or mechanical loads experienced in vivo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>Due to increased bioactivity with higher surface-to-volume ratios, BAGs have increasingly been used in particulate form either directly applied to defect sites or combined with polymers to create bioactive composites.</s><s>Composite scaffolds, such as those created using 3D printing or polymer-filler blending techniques, typically consist of BAG particles homogenously distributed within a polymer matrix. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref></s><s>The biodegradable nature of these materials raises the likelihood of fine BAG particles being released in vivo, potentiating the need to investigate the cellular response to such BAG particles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>To date, there is a lack of studies that use clinically relevant human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) to investigate the influence of micron-sized (monodispersed) bioactive glass particles and their ionic dissolution products on cell behavior.</s><s>This is especially relevant nowadays because of the ever increasing applications of degradable BAGs and their compositional variants in biological settings intending to regenerate bone and soft tissue defects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s>he aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two types of BAGs in different presentation modes on hMSC behavior.</s><s>Due to their widespread use in marketed medical devices, and wide use in tissue engineering studies, 45S5 and 1393 (53 SiO 2 -20 CaO-6 Na 2 O-4 P 2 O 5 -12 K 2 O-5 MgO in wt.</s><s>%) bioactive glass particles were tested.</s><s>Both have a track record of stimulating in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref></s><s>owever, there is only limited previous work in which the biological activity of the two BAGs has been directly compared.</s><s>In this study, we assessed hMSC metabolic activity, cell spreading, and proliferation capacity when cultured for up to 1 week in direct contact with BAG particles, and compared this to cells exposed to only the BAG dissolution products.</s><s>Furthermore, we studied the interaction of BAG particles with hydrogel encapsulated hMSCs, thereby providing insights that may be highly relevant for 3D tissue engineering strategies.</s><s>It is known how ion release influences cell behavior and function, but we hypothesized that local cell populations might additionally physically interact with the implanted BAG particles and respond differently than to mere ionic stimuli.</s><s>From a clinical translational perspective it would be equally beneficial to investigate the effects of direct physical interactions between BAGs and hMSCs, and with hMSCs cultured in 3D environments.</s><s>This is the first study to look in-depth in a comparative matter into the cellular behavior of primary hMSCs exposed directly and indirectly to lower micron-sized bioactive glass particles.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this study, we investigated the effect of micron sized particles of 45S5 and 1393 BAGs and their ionic dissolution products on hMSC behavior.</s><s>The outcomes revealed that basic cellular functions such as metabolic activity, proliferation, and cell spreading can vary largely depending on the concentration and type of bioactive glass, as well as the mode of interaction between hMSCs and the BAG particles.</s></p><p><s>The 45S5 BAG used in this study is the BAG originally reported by Hench, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> which has subsequently been commercialized for bone grafting procedures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref></s><s>From a clinical perspective, synthetic graft materials in the form of particulates and granules are preferred because they can be mixed with biological fluids such as blood and compacted into the quite often irregularly shaped defect sites during implantation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s>herefore, most of the bioactive glass based products are marketed as granules in the 90-1000 mm size range. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s>ecent research efforts have involved the incorporation of BAG particles into polymer based composites to exploit the improved bioactivity associated with high surface-to volume-ratios of micron and sub-micron sized particles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>AG granules as well as BAG containing composites not only release cell stimulating ions, but are also likely to break down into smaller micro-and nano-particle debris which can interact with cells present in the local biological milieu.</s><s>Although a number of studies have highlighted the beneficial effects of bioactive glass dissolution products, often in a conditioned media setting, the influence of particle contact on relevant cells such as MSCs remains unexplored.</s></p><p><s>Hence, the direct contact setup employed in this study aimed to investigate how hMSC behavior is influenced by the physical interaction with bioactive glass particles.</s><s>The results demonstrate that basic cellular functions such as metabolic activity, proliferation, and cell spreading were adversely affected by higher concentrations of the BAGs.</s><s>To decouple the physical and chemical effects of the BAG particles, we used transwell inserts to prevent direct cell-particle interaction but permit cell interaction with BAG dissolution products.</s><s>In comparison to the direct setup, hMSCs showed much higher metabolic activities and proliferation when physical contact with BAG particles was prevented.</s><s>Despite the change in interaction mode, the highest concentration of 45S5 BAG particles had a considerable negative influence on hMSC metabolic activity and proliferation.</s><s>The higher concentrations were included in the study because they are more likely to induce desirable bioactive (hydroxyapatite formation), osteogenic, angiogenic, and anti-microbial effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref></s><s>Moreover, in a clinical setting, smaller voids and defects are often completely filled with bioactive graft materials, which results in high, local concentrations of the material.</s><s>Host cell populations from the surrounding tissue (e.g.</s><s>bone marrow or periosteum) are expected to migrate into the graft material, attach and proliferate to induce a regenerative outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref></s><s>That this cell-material interaction may be more complex (physical interaction vs. ionic interaction, low concentration vs. high concentration) is apparent from our results.</s><s>In agreement with our observations, previously published reports indicate negative effects on cell viability and proliferation in response to high BAG concentrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s>Interestingly, we observed that at almost all tested concentrations, 1393 bioactive glass particles showed better effects on hMSC behavior over 45S5 particles.</s><s>This difference was clearly evident from the morphological analysis of the cultured hMSCs, which showed significantly higher cell spreading in the presence of 1393 BAG particles compared with 45S5 particles.</s><s>Increased cell spreading with filopodial extensions is indicative of cells probing their surrounding environment, whereas cell rounding and blebbing have been linked to increased cellular stress and a transition to cell death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref></s><s>Based on SEM analysis, the two bioactive glass particles used in this study had a size range of 3-8 mm with narrow size distributions, making it less likely that the differences in hMSC functional behavior between 45S5 versus1393 BAGs was caused by differences in surface roughness or internalization of the particles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref></s><s>It is more probable that the observed effects were caused by the differences in BAG ion release.</s><s>For instance, despite containing a higher concentration of CaO (24.5 vs. 20%), rapid and significantly higher release of Ca ions was observed from 1393 BAG particles.</s><s>The highest absolute concentrations were recorded for sodium ions from 45S5 BAG microparticles (2200 ppm over 7 days), which was 3-fold higher than the concentrations recorded from 1393 BAG microparticles (550 ppm over 7 days).</s><s>The ion release profiles in this study were obtained from experiments conducted in high purity water, and may vary slightly if the study is conducted using culture medium or carried out in vivo.</s><s>These ion release trends were in agreement with those reported previously in literature for BAG-based scaffolds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref></s><s>Contrary to 45S5 BAG, 1393 BAG is composed of additional K 1 and Mg 21 ions.</s><s>Previous studies have already reported on the positive effects of magnesium ions on cell viability, proliferation, and spreading. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref></s><s>Furthermore, it is well documented that hMSCs express cationic channels on their cell membrane and that K 1 , Na 1 , and Ca 21 channels are involved in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref></s><s>The blocking of Na 1 channels, for instance, increases hMSC proliferation, while blocking calciumactivated K 1 channels results in diminished hMSC proliferation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref></s><s>The exact mechanism underlying the regulation of cell proliferation by ion channels remains to be clarified, and is beyond the scope of this study.</s><s>However, the stark differences in released Ca, Na, and P ions from 1393 and 45S5 BAG particles, together with the potential effects of K and Mg ions from 1393 BAG particles might play a role in promoting more cell proliferation and the better results observed with this type of BAG.</s><s>Future studies could address this hypothesis by investigating the dose dependent effects of separate ions on MSC behavior and correlating observed effects with ion release profiles from BAG particles.</s></p><p><s>Since cells in vivo are organized in a 3D microenvironment through cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, it was interesting to investigate the influence of bioactive glass and its dissolution products on 3D cultured hMSCs.</s><s>To control this 3D environment, hMSCs were encapsulated at high cell densities in an alginate hydrogel functionalized with a well-defined composition of cell interactive integrin binding RGD motifs.</s><s>The cell encapsulating beads were then co-cultured with BAG microparticles suspended in culture media.</s><s>Contrary to our initial assumption that the 3D environment would provide an additional protection to the cells, we observed a significant decrease in cell viability at the two highest tested concentrations of both BAGs.</s><s>In particular, this effect was most pronounced for the 45S5 BAG conditions, where a significant decrease in cell viability and cell metabolic activity was observed even at the lowest tested concentrations.</s><s>When cell loaded alginate beads were cultured with the two highest tested 45S5 BAG concentrations, cell function (both metabolic activity and proliferation) dropped below 20% compared with the control cultures in non-BAG-supplemented medium.</s><s>This observed effect was also apparent in the live/dead staining of the entrapped cells, where the majority of the hMSCs stained positive for propidium iodide, a dye to distinguish dead cells.</s></p><p><s>Alno et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> reported a similar differential effect of 45S5 BAG ionic dissolution products (1 w/v %-400 mm particle size) on the proliferation of human fetal osteoblasts cultured in 2D versus 3D spheroid culture.</s><s>While they observed an increase in cell viability at 4 and 7 days for TCP cultured cells in contact with BAG conditioned medium, they report a significant decrease in cell viability for 3D cultured cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref></s><s>In native adult tissues, the microenvironment is characterized by greater cell-matrix interactions than cell-cell interactions.</s><s>Therefore, spheroid cultures may not be the optimal set up to investigate BAG-cell interactions in 3D.</s><s>Moreover, multicellular spheroids can have a hypoxic cluster of cells at their core, which may interfere with cell viability and metabolic activity measurements.</s><s>These potential issues are avoided in the current system where alginate encapsulated MSCs maintain high viability in non-BAG stimulated conditions.</s><s>A further practical advantage is the relatively convenient retrieval of the cells from their 3D environment for further single cell characterization.</s></p><p><s>Contrary to the data for the metabolic activity, the cell proliferation data did not show any significant differences between both BAGs at any of the tested concentrations for the encapsulated cells.</s><s>This was to be expected since the cell proliferation graph represents the total number of encapsulated cells in the beads and the hydrogel matrix surrounding encapsulated cells does not permit cell spreading or multiplication.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the data presented here demonstrates that basic cellular responses can vary depending on the composition, concentration, and presentation mode of bioactive glass microparticles.</s><s>Future work should address how the differentiation, paracrine, and immunomodulatory behavior of MSCs could be influenced by exposure to these BAGs.</s><s>Additionally, a comparative assessment of the ability of these biomaterials to induce in vivo bone formation in an appropriate model of bone injury such as critical size long bone defects would help to validate these in vitro findings.</s></p></div>
