target="#b91">(Zarkowski et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sauseng et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In several other studies no association of the responsiveness to TMS with power in either

oscillations is far from being purely stochastic and demonstrates scale-free patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Palva et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Functional significance of variability in cortical oscillations stems from the findings showing its relationship to behavioral variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Palva et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Smit et al.,

dynamics of alpha EEG oscillations during rest correlate with the strength of ICF <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Fedele et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>A possibility to use neuronal variability to predict inter-subject difference of the TMS responses is also clinically relevant due to the growing evidence that spTMS and ppTMS phenomena changes may have a diagnostic value in many neurological and psychiatric disorders such as stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bütefisch et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Oh et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Lioumis et al.,

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Seventeen right-handed healthy volunteers (six females) between 19 and 34 years of age (mean: 24 ± 4, SD) participated in the experiment after giving a written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>Subjects were screened for contraindications to TMS <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Rossi et al., 2009)</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TMS Coil Positioning and Determination of Threshold</head><p><s>A MagPro X100 (MagVenture) stimulator connected to a water-cooled MCF-B65 induction coil with 75-mm wing radius was used to produce biphasic TMS pulses.</s><s>A frameless TMS navigation system (Localite TMS Navigator, Localite GmbH) was used for MRI-guided navigation, which ensures consistent coil position and orientation in a 3D space through the sequence of stimulations.</s><s>TMS coil position was optimized accordingly to individual MR scan (1.5 T MRI scanner; T1 weighted; 1 mm thickness; sagittal orientation; acquisition matrix 256 × 256; MRscanner Siemens Magnetom Avanto).</s><s>Stimulation targeted the left primary motor cortex [i.e., motor knob <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Yousry et al., 1997)</ref>], a "hot spot" for the motor representation of the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle.</s><s>The resting motor threshold (RMT) for the given "hot spot" was determined as a minimal stimulator output evoking contralateral APB MEPs of minimum 50 µV in a resting muscle, in 5 out of 10 given stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Rossini et al., 1994)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol</head><p><s>Three blocks of stimuli (101-114 trials each) were delivered: single-pulse (SP) TMS and two ppTMS protocols: short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) and ICF.</s><s>The inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) for the paired-pulse stimuli were set at 2 ms or 12 ms for SICI and ICF protocols, respectively.</s><s>The intensity of 110% of RMT was used for spTMS pulses and for the test pulses (S2) in ICF and SICI protocols.</s><s>Conditioning pulses (S1) for both paired-pulse paradigms had 90% RMT intensity.</s><s>The interval between the stimuli (or pairs of stimuli) varied randomly from 3 to 10 s and the inter-condition interval varied between 1 to 5 min.</s><s>We provide the following reasons for determining inter-stimulus intervals.</s><s>Firstly, we aimed at having a large variability of the intervals in order to avoid the anticipation effect.</s><s>Secondly, as we used the same distribution for delays in all subjects, the results are unlikely to be due to the chosen inter-stimulus delays but rather would reflect genuine impact of oscillatory activity on cortical excitability.</s><s>The three blocks were performed in a random order across participants.</s><s>During all the conditions the coil was held by the operator who constantly monitored its position and orientation with respect to the target using navigation system.</s><s>Subjects were seated in a comfortable armchair with elbows flexed at 90 • and prone hands in a relaxed position, eyes were open and fixed at the mark on the opposite wall.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EEG and EMG Acquisition</head><p><s>In order to measure EEG, we used BrainAmp DC (Brain Products, Germany) amplifier.</s><s>91-electrode BrainCap Fast'n Easy Standard Electrode Cap (Brain Products) was used with TMS-compatible electrodes.</s><s>The reference electrode was at the bridge of the nose, and ground electrode was placed on the left cheekbone.</s><s>Three electrooculographic (EOG) electrodes were placed above the nasion and below the outer canthi of the eyes as indicated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Schlögl et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>The impedance of each electrode was kept &lt; 5 k throughout the experiment.</s><s>All data were recorded in the frequency band 0.016-1000 Hz and digitized at a sampling rate of 5 kHz.</s><s>For the latter analysis the data was re-referenced to a common average electrode.</s></p><p><s>MEPs to single-and paired-pulse TMS (SP, SICI, ICF) were recorded from the right APB muscle with surface bipolar EMG, using Ag-AgCl bipolar electrodes in a belly-tendon montage and were also recorded with the BrainAmp DC amplifier.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MEP</head><p><s>EMG activity was high-pass filtered with a fourth order Butterworth high-pass filter (cut-off frequency at 10 Hz) and with the band-stop filter at 50 Hz to remove power-line noise.</s><s>MEP peaks were identified within the range of 20-62 ms from the onset of the TMS stimulus for the three conditions (SP, SICI, and ICF).</s><s>This range was sufficient to include MEPs in all subjects.</s><s>Peak-to-peak measures of the largest positive-negative deflection were used as the MEP amplitudes.</s><s>Visual inspection was also performed in parallel to remove possible artifactual trials.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preprocessing</head><p><s>Electroencephalographic recordings were segmented using TMS event marker.</s><s>Pre-stimulus segment was 1200 ms (−1210 ms to −10 ms).</s><s>Channels with excessive amount of noise were excluded from further analysis (maximum 15 channels per subject).</s><s>Blinkrelated artifacts in EEG were removed with fastICA algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hyvärinen, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>After the blink removal, we rejected noisy trials according to the variance criteria.</s><s>For the further analysis we used a pre-stimulus length of 1000 ms for EEG data.</s><s>The variance of EEG data in each trial was calculated and then a distribution was built.</s><s>Trials exceeding 99% of the distribution were rejected.</s><s>Channels with more than 20% artifactual trials were removed (instead of the trials).</s><s>MEPs corresponding to these trials were excluded from the analysis as well.</s><s>On average, the percentage of the missing channel was between 15 and 18% for different TMS conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power of Pre-stimulus Alpha Oscillations</head><p><s>Pre-stimulus alpha power was estimated from the spectrum calculated with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Hanning window (duration 1000-ms immediately preceding TMS pulse in spTMS or conditioning pulse in ppTMS).</s><s>For the single-trial analysis the power was calculated separately for each pre-stimulus interval.</s><s>For the across-subjects analysis, the power was averaged across all trials in each condition, electrode and subject.</s><s>As has been performed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Klimesch et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Pfurtscheller et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Frenkel-Toledo et al., 2013)</ref>, we considered power in low-alpha (8-10 Hz) and high-alpha (10-12 Hz) sub-bands which might reflect different neuronal processes.</s><s>Mean substitution method was used for the missing channel values for across subject analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability of Power and MEP Amplitudes</head><p><s>The variability was estimated from single trials both for the amplitude of MEPs and for the pre-stimulus alpha power obtained in each subject, electrode and condition.</s><s>It was quantified with the coefficient of quartile variation (CQV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bonett, 2006</ref>) -a descriptive statistic based on quartiles' information:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">CQV = Q 3 − Q 1 Q 3 +Q 1 (1)</formula><p><s>In ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>), Q 1 and Q 3 denote the first (lower) and third (upper) quartiles of the data, respectively.</s><s>Quartiles are the points that divide any ranked data set into four equal groups.</s><s>Each group contains a quarter of the data.</s><s>Q 3 − Q 1 is defined as the interquartile range and it is a measure of the spread.</s><s>Let vectors P j = p 1 , p 2 . .</s><s>.p n contain pre-stimulus power values from n trials in a given subject, condition and jth-electrode (j = 1,2. . .</s><s>E, where E is the number of EEG electrodes).</s><s>CQV will then be applied iteratively to all vectors P j thus leading to E estimates of CQV.</s></p><p><s>Similarly, CQV was also calculated for the amplitude of MEPs (but only for one bipolar EMG electrode).</s><s>For each jth EEG electrode, CQV of the pre-stimulus power was then correlated with CQV of MEP amplitudes (across subjects) to study the relationship between neuronal variability in the cortex and the variability in motor responses.</s><s>In general, CQV has an advantage compared to frequently used coefficient of variation since it is less sensitive to the deviations from normality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bonett, 2006)</ref>.</s></p></div>
