<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study setting</head><p><s>The study was carried out in the Lawra District hospital.</s><s>The Lawra District lies in the North-West corner of the upper West Region of Ghana.</s><s>The total area of the District is 1051.2</s><s>km 2 .</s><s>The District has two hospitals located in Lawra and Nandom.</s><s>They provide clinical and public health services as well as serve as a referral centres for the sub-districts.</s><s>There are 10 sub-districts which provide primary health care services.</s></p><p><s>Apart from agriculture, which engages about 80% of the population, there are small scale enterprises such as petty trading, artisanal works, small-scale industry enterprises, hotel/restaurants/chop bar and transport services.</s><s>There are also those employed as public servants, although wages are low.</s><s>The dominant economic activity is agriculture which does not yield the required returns necessary for meaningful standards of living.</s><s>The result is wide spread poverty among the people with severe impact on women and children.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The study design, population, sampling</head><p><s>A cross-sectional study was carried out in June 2014 on a sample of 422 lactating mothers and their children.</s><s>The primary study population comprised women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years) who have delivered a live baby within the past 12 months prior to the conduct of this study.</s><s>The 12-month limit was set with the intention of mitigating recall bias by the mother.</s><s>A systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants who attended post-natal clinic in the Lawra District Hospital.</s><s>The list of mothers contained in the attendance register for mothers who sought post-natal care served as the sampling frame.</s><s>A sampling interval was calculated by dividing the total number of mothers (800) by the required sample size of 422.</s><s>A random number between 1 and the sampling interval was selected to be the starting point of the sample extraction.</s><s>Subsequently, the study participants were selected by adding the sampling interval to the number corresponding to the previous mother chosen on the list.</s><s>This process was continued until the required number was obtained.</s></p><p><s>A sample size of 384 was required to ensure that the estimated prevalence of the main outcome variable (coverage of essential new born care practices) was within plus or minus 5% of the true prevalence at 95% confidence level.</s><s>An additional 10% to adjust for unexpected events (e.g.</s><s>damaged/incomplete questionnaire) was factored in the sample size determination and so the sample size was 422.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>A structured questionnaire was administered through face to face interview to obtain information from respondents.</s><s>The questionnaire comprised different sections including socioeconomic and demographic information, birth preparedness, knowledge of women about newborn danger signs, care during pregnancy and delivery (Additional file 1).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent and independent variables</head><p><s>The women were asked questions on essential newborn care practices including a) type of instrument used to cut the umbilical cord b) whether the newborn was dried and wrapped soon after delivery, c) the number hours or days after birth the newborn was first bathed d) the temperature of the water used in bathing e) whether any pre-lacteal food or drink was given, and f ) the number of hours or days after birth breastfeeding was initiated g) whether colostrum was fed to the baby h) whether exclusive breast feeding was practiced.</s></p><p><s>Three composite indices of essential newborn care practices (safe cord care, optimal thermal care and good neonatal feeding practices) were the main outcome measures used in the study.</s></p><p><s>Safe cord care was defined as use of a clean cutting instrument to cut the umbilical cord plus clean thread to tie the cord plus no substance applied to the cord.</s><s>Optimal thermal care was defined as baby wrapped within 10 min of birth plus first bath after 6 or more hours plus using warm water to bath the baby.</s><s>A child was considered to have received good neonatal feeding, he/she should be breast feeding at the time of the study, initiated breastfeeding within the first 1 hour after birth, not being fed with prelacteals, fed with colostrum and avoidance of bottle-feeding.</s><s>If one or more of the conditions were not met, then the feeding practice was described as inadequate or bad.</s></p><p><s>The independent variables included socio-demographic factors, maternal age, educational attainment, ethnicity, religion etc. Socio-economic status (SES) was measured as household wealth index.</s><s>Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to quantify a proxy measure of SES based on ownership of specified durable goods (television, radio, car, mobile telephone, etc.) and housing characteristics (access to electricity, source of drinking water, type of toilet facilities, type of flooring material and type of cooking fuel) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Utilization of antenatal care services and maternal knowledge on newborn danger signs were also assessed as explanatory variables.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>Descriptive and inferential statistics were done using the predictive analytic software (PASW) for Windows version 18.0 and statistical significance was taken when p &lt; 0.05.</s><s>Chi-square statistics were performed to compare the levels of each of the dependent variables with the explanatory variables.</s><s>A multiple logistic regression was used to identify socio-demographic, mothers' knowledge of specific newborn danger signs, attendance at delivery by skilled birth attendant, antenatal and delivery care factors that were associated with the three newborn care practices (that is, safe cord care, optimal thermal care and good neonatal breastfeeding).</s><s>Explanatory variables which were significant at bivariate analysis at a p-value of 0.05 or less were fed into the regression model after confirming the absence of multi-collinearity between these independent variables.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study is the first that has assessed the prevalence and determinants of newborn care practices in the Lawra District of Ghana.</s><s>Though some studies conducted in Ghana have highlighted on optimal thermal care and clean delivery practices for newborns <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, issues regarding neonatal feeding practices have received less attention.</s><s>Furthermore, this present study has used composite indices which give a better reflection of safe  cord, optimal thermal care and neonatal feeding.</s><s>The findings of our study remain relevant because they confirm that of earlier studies and also fill a knowledge gap by showing that using single practice indicators could be less informative in the magnitude of essential newborn practices.</s><s>For example, optimal thermal care as assessed in the present study included summing up scores for wrapping the baby within 10 min of birth, delaying for at least 6 h and using warm water.</s><s>A study that uses only one of these indicators will present a different situation from one that uses a combination of these variables.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence of essential newborn care practices</head><p><s>Three composite newborn care practices (safe cord care, optimal thermal care, and good neonatal breastfeeding) were investigated and the coverage of these was found to be generally low.</s><s>These composite variables give a better reflection of safe cord, optimal thermal care and neonatal feeding.</s><s>The three newborn care practices were associated with socio-demographic, antenatal and delivery care factors.</s></p><p><s>As in other studies, safe cord care was defined as use of a clean cutting instrument to cut the umbilical cord plus clean thread to tie the cord plus no substance applied to the cord <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Cord cutting with safe instruments such as new razor blades and scissors was commonly practiced (96.9%) but then when one takes a closer and more holistic approach to safe cord care (that is using composite indicators), only 36.8% actually received that.</s><s>This means assessing the situation using single practice indicators could be misleading.</s><s>Poor cord care was driven mainly by putting substances on the cord.</s></p><p><s>Most mothers applied various things like shea-butter, methylated spirit, shea-butter mixed with powder to the cord stump.</s><s>The reasons given for applying substances to the cord stump include hastening the healing process, prevent cord stump from smelling and infections and also to prevent water from entering into newborn's stomach.</s><s>Since these substances are coming from unsterile sources the likelihood of contamination is high and may thus be harmful to newborns.</s><s>Similar findings have been reported in the Asante Akim North District in Southern Ghana <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and in Bangladesh where unhygienic cord care practices were prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Optimal thermal care (defined as baby wrapped within 10 min of birth plus first bath after six or more hours plus using warm water to bath the baby) is an essential intervention for the survival of the newborn especially during the first 24 h of birth.</s><s>Though most babies were wrapped soon after delivery and were also bathed with hot water, poor thermal care was caused mainly by early bathing.</s><s>In this study, 46.7% of the newborns were given a bath in less than 6 hours of delivery.</s><s>Apart from exposing newborns to hypothermia, early bathing removes maternal bacteria and the vernix caseosa (a potent inhibitor of Escherichia coli) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and eliminates the crawling reflex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Aside its role as a protective barrier from liquids while in the uterus, vernix serves as an antioxidant, skin cleanser, moisturizer, temperature regulator, and a natural, safe antimicrobial for the new baby post-delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>These are some of the reasons why WHO recommended delay bathing up to at least 24 h.</s><s>Overall adequacy of new born care practices was defined to comprise safe cord care, optimal thermal care and good neonatal feeding This notwithstanding, many societies have some reasons why babies are bathed early after delivery.</s><s>For a normal uncomplicated vaginal birth in a health facility, it is recommended that healthy mothers and newborns should receive care in the facility for at least 24 h after birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In Ghana, women who deliver in health facilities are detained for a minimum of 6 h and not 24 h.</s><s>Women who for some reasons deliver at home do not even wait for the 6 h before bathing the newborn.</s><s>This is why in our study, we limited waiting period to at least 6 h.</s><s>Early bathing of the baby is a cultural practice and so asking for a waiting time of 24 h appears to be something that is impossible at least for now.</s><s>Our data showed that only 4 (1%) of the newborns in our sample will have received optimal thermal care if the 24-h cutoff was used instead of 6 h.</s></p><p><s>In an intervention trial in Ghana that used home visits to promote positive behavior change regarding thermal care, only 41% of mothers delayed bathing for more than 6 h in the intervention areas compared to 29% in the comparison areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The timing of bathing the newborn appears inconsistent as reported in some earlier studies conducted in Ghana <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Whereas some mothers reported bathing their newborns shortly after delivery, others mentioned waiting until later in the day but the exact waiting period has not been more than a few hours after delivery.</s><s>As reported in one of these studies, early bathing was commonly practiced in Ghana as a measure to reduce body odour in later life, shaping the baby's head, and to make the baby sleep and feel clean <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Some studies conducted on thermal practices in many countries including Ghana, Tanzania, Uganda and India have reported strong cultural beliefs in the benefits of early bathing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, which largely promotes the practice.</s><s>The practice of early bathing is rooted in the firm belief that the birth process is dirty and that the baby is dirty after birth.</s><s>This is particularly the case if there is an obvious sign of vernix which is regarded as dirty.</s></p><p><s>The problem of early bathing of the newborn appears to be widespread across the world.</s><s>A study in Nepal reported that newborn babies are considered dirty since they came out of their mother's womb, so almost all newborn babies are bathed within the first hour of birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Another study conducted in low socioeconomic settlements of Karachi, Pakistan, revealed that newborns were bathed immediately after delivery as the vernix was considered "dirty looking" and it was felt it should be removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A composite index comprising good neonatal feeding showed that more than 70% of respondents practiced adequate feeding behaviours.</s><s>For example, timely initiation of breastfeeding (TIBF) rate was 97%.</s></p><p><s>There are a number of benefits associated with early

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predictors of essential newborn care practices</head><p><s>In logistic regression analysis, the main predictors of essential new born care practices were maternal educational attainment, maternal age, and adequacy of antenatal care (ANC) attendance and maternal knowledge of newborn danger signs.</s><s>Adequacy of antenatal care in particular was a consistent determinant of safe cord care, optimal thermal care and good neonatal feeding.</s></p><p><s>Maternal education of secondary school level or higher was one of the strongest socio-demographic factors that determined safe cord care, optimal thermal care practice and good neonatal feeding.</s><s>This association has been reported from several countries including India and Nepal <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The educational attainment of the mother was positively associated with the adequacy level of ANC attendance (χ2 = 59.1, p &lt; 0.001) and maternal knowledge of newborn danger signs (χ2 = 16.7,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>The effect of maternal education on essential newborn care practices was therefore mediated through ANC attendance and knowledge of newborn dangers.</s></p><p><s>We observed very strong association between use of antenatal and delivery care and the newborn care practices.</s><s>This may be explained by the fact that when pregnant women make contact with health workers during ANC, they are provided with health information and made aware of proper newborn care practices.</s><s>Clean cord care practice and thermal care have found to be positively associated with receiving antenatal care <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mothers' knowledge of newborn care danger signs</head><p><s>Poor knowledge of newborn danger signs delays care seeking and ultimately greater risk of death and so early detection of neonatal danger signs is an important step towards improving newborn survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>Overall, the mothers' knowledge of newborn care issues was not satisfactory in the sample population.</s><s>In our study sample, only 45.2% of the mothers knew at least four newborn danger signs out of the seven.</s><s>Knowledge on critical newborn danger signs other than high body temperature, diarrhoea, excessive crying was inadequate and similar findings have earlier been reported in the Asante Akim North District Ghana <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The low mothers' knowledge of newborn care practices reported in the present study confirmed what has been reported in some other developing countries including Sri Lanka, Kenya, Uganda and Nepal had unsatisfactory level of knowledge in the recognition of newborn danger signs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Available evidence from the literature shows that the maternal knowledge is an important intermediate factor that may lead to good practices and child survival outcomes child survival outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Though maternal knowledge of newborn danger signs was positively associated with the odds of optimal thermal care, only a small proportion of mothers were knowledgeable in newborn danger signs.</s><s>This means the majority of the women lacked adequate knowledge of good newborn care practices, so their newborn practices were likely to be adversely affected.</s><s>The low knowledge levels of mothers may be due to inadequate messages received on newborn care practices at the ANC.</s><s>This calls for strengthening of focused health education on newborn care practices especially during prenatal care to mitigate these problems.</s><s>By integrating health education on newborn care practices into routine antenatal care services, it may increase a woman's knowledge and the ability to practice safe newborn care behaviours.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>The analysis from this study showed that the expected essential newborn care practices are not getting to a greater proportion of the newborns.</s><s>Early bathing, nonimmediate drying and application of substances to cord stump were commonly practiced.</s><s>This may be depriving newborns of basic protections against infection and death.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the findings show that good neonatal feeding practices, optimal thermal care and overall adequate newborn care practices were commonly adopted by women aged 20-34 years.</s><s>The results also showed that essential newborn care practices are positively associated with high maternal educational attainment, adequate utilization of antenatal care services and high maternal knowledge of newborn danger signs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Policy implications and recommendations</head><p><s>Greater improvement in essential newborn care practices could be attained through modifiable proven lowcost interventions such as effective ANC services, health and nutrition education that should span from community to health facility levels.</s></p><p><s>Of the three-composite essential newborn services indicators, optimal thermal care was the least provided to babies.</s><s>Unfortunately, uptake of adequate ANC services in this study population was unrelated to optimal thermal care.</s><s>This finding has important implications for the implementation of focused ANC to improve essential newborn care practices, especially that of thermal care.</s><s>Therefore, ANC interventions should lay emphasis on the promotion and provision of thermal care for all newborns to prevent hypothermia (that is, immediate drying, warming, skin to skin, delayed bathing).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the study</head><p><s>There are some limitations of the findings of this study.</s><s>The recall period was limited to the past 1 year in order to avoid recall bias over a longer period of time.</s><s>This notwithstanding, some amount of recall bias cannot be completely ruled out.</s><s>During the interviews, the women had to recall a number of events including antenatal care visits and neonatal practices.</s><s>So, recall bias and misclassification might happen.</s><s>In order to reduce misclassification errors, the women were required to present their antenatal records booklet for confirmation of verbal information provided.</s></p><p><s>Our design was a cross sectional study and as with all such studies, the strength of causality is weak.</s><s>The cross-sectional nature of the data limits our ability to draw any causal conclusions on the relationships found in the current study.</s><s>Despite these limitations, our results have shed more light on critical areas of newborn care practices that need urgent pragmatic intervention.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Socio-demographic and reproductive characteristics of respondents (N = 418)</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Age category</cell><cell>Frequency n (%)</cell></row><row><cell>Under 20 years</cell><cell>14 (3.3)</cell></row><row><cell>20-34 years</cell><cell>349 (83.5)</cell></row><row><cell>At least 35 years</cell><cell>55 (13.2)</cell></row><row><cell>Religion</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Christianity</cell><cell>239 (57.2)</cell></row><row><cell>Islam</cell><cell>179 (42.8)</cell></row><row><cell>Marital Status</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Married</cell><cell>333 (79.7)</cell></row><row><cell>Single</cell><cell>81 (19.4)</cell></row><row><cell>Divorced</cell><cell>1 (0.2)</cell></row><row><cell>Widowed</cell><cell>3 (0.7)</cell></row><row><cell>Educational Level</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>None</cell><cell>29 (6.9)</cell></row><row><cell>Primary</cell><cell>54 (12.9)</cell></row><row><cell>JHS</cell><cell>113 (27.0)</cell></row><row><cell>SHS/Vocational/Technical</cell><cell>147 (35.2)</cell></row><row><cell>Tertiary</cell><cell>75 (17.90</cell></row><row><cell>Occupational Level</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Unemployed</cell><cell>69 (16.5)</cell></row><row><cell>Petty trader</cell><cell>182 (43.5)</cell></row><row><cell>Farmer</cell><cell>18 (4.3)</cell></row><row><cell>Civil / Public Servant</cell><cell>50 (12.0)</cell></row><row><cell>Others</cell><cell>99 (23.7)</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Maternal Knowledge of dangers of newborn care signs</cell></row><row><cell>1-3</cell><cell>229 (54.8)</cell></row><row><cell>At least 4</cell><cell>189 (45.2)</cell></row><row><cell>Total</cell><cell>418 (100.0)</cell></row><row><cell>Gravidity</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Primigravidae</cell><cell>166 (39.7)</cell></row><row><cell>Secundigravidae</cell><cell>132 (31.6)</cell></row><row><cell>Multigravidae</cell><cell>120 (28.7)</cell></row><row><cell>Parity</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Primiparous</cell><cell>211 (50.5)</cell></row><row><cell>Secundiparous</cell><cell>111 (26.6)</cell></row><row><cell>Multiparous</cell><cell>96 (23.0)</cell></row><row><cell>Timing of first ANC visit</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>First trimester</cell><cell>372 (89.0)</cell></row><row><cell>Second trimester</cell><cell>41 (9.8)</cell></row><row><cell>Third trimester</cell><cell>5 (1.2)</cell></row></table><note><p><s>were 6.6 times more likely to provide safe cord care to their babies (AOR = 6.57,</s><s>Cl: 1.71-25.31),</s><s>p = 0.006.</s><s>Compared to women aged at least 35 years, their counterparts aged 20-34 years were 3.3 times (AOR = 3. 28 [CI: 1.34, 8.04]), 2.0 times (AOR = 2.02 [CI: 1.11, 3.70]) and 7.3 times (AOR = 7.31 [CI: 1.65, 32.44]</s></p></note></figure>
