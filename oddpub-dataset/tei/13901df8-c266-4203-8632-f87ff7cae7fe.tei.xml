<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Almost 75 years ago, Saul <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rosenzweig (1942)</ref> introduced the idea that the time spent looking at sexual stimuli could be used as an indicator of sexual interest, with the assumption that sexually appealing stimuli would result in longer latencies.</s><s>Inspired by the phenomenon that men visiting penny arcades put substantial amounts of money into slot machines to get timelimited visual access to preferred erotic depictions, Rosenzweig created the first indirect latencybased measure of sexual interest that is "…both natural in its imitation of everyday behavior and simple to employ because of its relative freedom from complicated apparatus or interpretative scoring" <ref type="bibr">(Rosenzweig, 1942, p. 150)</ref>.</s><s>Rosenzweig presented participants erotic and non-erotic control pictures and allowed participants to choose how long they looked at the pictures while the VTs were unobtrusively recorded.</s><s>In line with his notion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Rosenzweig (1942)</ref> was able to show that groups of schizophrenics differing in sexual activity levels could be discriminated based on VTs for erotic vs. non-erotic stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Comparing VTs for stimuli of men and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zamansky, 1956</ref>), Rosenzweig's measure of sexual interest has been adapted into a frequently used, robust latency-based measure of adult sexual orientation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ebsworth &amp; Lalumière, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Imhoff et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Israel &amp; Strassberg, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lippa, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Quinsey, Ketsetzis, Earls, &amp; Karamanouikan, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rönspies et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, not until the end of the 20 th century were VT measures validated as a measure of pedophilic sexual interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Abel, Lawry, Karlstrom, Osborn, &amp; Gillespie, 1994)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since then, a body of research, typically with forensic populations, has been generated that hitherto awaits cumulative integration (for a recent narrative review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Schmidt, Banse, &amp; Imhoff, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The current study presents a meta-analysis of VT measures' validity in terms of the ability to discriminate between criterion groups and to converge with conceptually different measures of sexual interest in children.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Processes Underlying Viewing Time Measures</head><p><s>Over the decades, the general VT effect of sexual orientation has seen multiple independent replications corroborating its robustness.</s><s>The VT effect emerges when respondents are asked to rate a series of sexually relevant versus irrelevant stimuli in terms of their subjectively perceived sexual attractiveness.</s><s>Procedural and methodological differences aside, most VT assessments involve asking respondents to rate pictures and, thus, leave the diagnostic purpose of the procedure obvious to the individual being assessed.</s><s>At the same time, however, the focal dependent variable -rating latency -remains unobtrusive.</s><s>VT measures can be categorized as task-relevant indirect measures 1 due to the fact that the primary task is based on evaluating sexual features.</s><s>There is preliminary evidence that the primary sexual focus increases group discrimination of task-relevant over task-irrelevant latency-based measures of sexual interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Rönspies et al., 2015)</ref> because the structural overlap between predictor and criterion is maximized <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Perugini, Richetin, &amp; Zogmaister, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>What causes longer latencies when sexually attractive versus unattractive stimuli are rated in VT measures?</s><s>Earlier theoretical reasoning focused on two underlying causal mechanisms: (a) deliberate delay due to the hedonic quality of sexually preferred targets and (b) (automatic) attentional adhesion that slows decision-making after the presentation of explicit erotic material.</s><s>However, these two causal hypotheses were ruled out in a series of experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Imhoff et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Imhoff, Schmidt, Weiß, Young, &amp; Banse, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schmidt, Imhoff, &amp; Banse, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, it was shown that prolonged response latencies for sexually relevant versus irrelevant stimuli still emerged when target pictures were removed after a fixed duration prior to the rating task even when possible afterimages were masked <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Imhoff et al., 2010</ref>, Experiments 1 and 2).</s><s>Additionally, VT effects occurred when sexual decisions were performed under time pressure (&lt; 1,000ms) or when based exclusively on facial stimuli without any further erotic content <ref type="bibr">(Imhoff et al., 2010, Experiments 3 and 4)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, experimental manipulations of participants' response perspective (e.g., heterosexual men should rate target stimuli from a gay perspective) showed that VT effects were rather a function of the rating perspective than of the stimuli characteristics alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Imhoff et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, without a primary rating task VT effects were absent but could be demonstrated in a sexual attractiveness rating task of completely abstract/non-pictorial symbols representing target age and target gender <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Schmidt, Imhoff et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>These experiments rule out attentional adhesion and deliberate delay as causal explanations.</s><s>Instead, findings corroborate that the primary task of scrutinizing a set of criteria subjectively relevant for determining sexual attractiveness is likely causing VT effects of sexual orientation: Denying any single attractiveness criterion results in fast rejection of targets whereas more criteria need to be checked to determine subjective sexual attractiveness which takes longer (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pohl, Wolters, &amp; Ponseti, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, VT effects should better be described as prolonged decision latencies for targets' sexual attractiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Imhoff et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>From an applied perspective the described task-driven effects pose a potential threat to the diagnostic validity of VT paradigms: Only as long as participants comply with the instructions to rate targets' sexual attractiveness, would the measure be expected to produce meaningful results.</s><s>On the contrary, whenever participants perform sexually irrelevant rating tasks, latency patterns in standard VT paradigms will be invalid <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Imhoff et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pohl et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validity of Viewing Time as a Measure of Sexual Interest in Children</head><p><s>Sexual interest in children is routinely included in risk assessment instruments (e.g., <ref type="bibr">STABLE-2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">, Hanson, Harris, Scott, &amp; Helmus, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sex Offender Risk Appraisal Guide, SORAG, Quinsey, Harris, Rice, &amp; Cormier, 1998)</ref> and is an important target in many North American sexual offender treatment programs (e.g., <ref type="bibr">McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, &amp; Ellerby, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Relatedly, sexual interest in children is one of the best predictors of sexual recidivism among sexual offenders against children (d = 0.32, p &lt; .05;</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, the accurate assessment of sexual interest in children is of critical importance in community supervision, risk assessment and management, as well as treatment of sexual offenders.</s><s>There are several different methodologies available to assess sexual interest in children, each with their strengths and limitations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kalmus &amp; Beech, 2005</ref>, for review).</s><s>VT measures are especially appealing to forensic contexts because of their unobtrusiveness.</s></p><p><s>Validating (not only VT) measures of sexual interest in children is not a trivial task.</s></p><p><s>Currently, there exists no psychometrically flawless criterion for pedophilic interest.</s><s>Obviously, self-report questionnaires or interviews as direct measures of, for example, sexual fantasies are limited by self-report biases given the severe legal and psychosocial repercussions for individuals who admit such inclinations.</s><s>Observable behavior as an alternative diagnostic indicator is problematic as the link between sexual behavior involving children and pedophilic interest remains equivocal.</s><s>Sexual abuse of children is not a regular epiphenomenon of corresponding sexual motivations.</s><s>On the one hand, only roughly 20% to 50% of convicted child sexual abusers are considered to be pedophilic <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Schmidt, Mokros, &amp; Banse, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Seto, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Seto, , 2010))</ref>.</s><s>Among males in the community, on the other hand, many more men self-report indications of sexual interest in children than indicating sexual offences against children <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dombert et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, more specific victim characteristics (Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interest SSPI <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Seto, &amp;

Dahle, 2014)</ref> have been associated with sexual interest in children.</s><s>Phallometric or penile plethysmographic (PPG) assessment of penile tumescence is frequently used as an indirect physiological indicator of sexual arousal although this measure also is not free from methodological and conceptual problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kalmus &amp; Beech, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Laws, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, modifications of the Implicit Association Test (IAT; <ref type="bibr">Greenwald, McGee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998)</ref> have only recently been reported as valid indirect latency-based measures of sexual interest in children (mean weighted Cohen's d [fixed-effects] = 0.63, 95% CI [0.47, 0.79]; k = 12; N = 707; <ref type="bibr">Babchishin, Nunes, &amp; Herman, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, at the present stage it remains unclear, how IAT measures of pedophilic interest relate theoretically to other modalities of sexual interest in children such as self-reported fantasies or physiological sexual arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Babchishin, Nunes, Hermann, &amp; Malcom, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Schmidt et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Ultimately, all of the abovementioned indicators of pedophilic interest have their specific shortcomings.</s><s>In consequence, validity calculations based on each specific criterion have to be regarded as approximations of the "true" extent of sexual interest in children -independent from the yet open question of an optimal scientific operationalization of the empirically elusive concept of sexual interest in children due to its multimodal nature.</s></p><p><s>In the literature, the prototypical validation study of VT measures of sexual interest in children uses convicted sexual offenders against children (SOC) as criterion group in comparison against different control groups, such as sexual offenders against adults (SOA), non-sexual offenders (NSO), or non-offenders (NO).</s><s>Less frequently, VT measures have been used along with external criteria indicative of sexual interest in children such as offending behavioral indexes, self-report, conceptually different indirect latency-based measures, and/or PPG assessments without necessarily implementing control group comparisons (for an descriptive overview of corresponding studies see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological Issues: Stimulus Sets and Scoring Algorithms</head><p><s>A crucial factor influencing measurement validity is methodological variability concerning scoring algorithms and procedural aspects, such as stimuli and task characteristics.</s></p><p><s>Similar to PPG research, where lack of standardization is a major criticism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kalmus &amp; Beech, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Laws, 2009)</ref>, one cannot speak of a standardized VT measure but rather of a family of tasks that share the same dependent variable (i.e., decision latencies) but are quite heterogeneous in terms of stimulus characteristics and scoring algorithms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus factors.</head><p><s>Viewing time measures of sexual interest in children typically rely on comparisons of stimulus sets of child and adult pictures.</s><s>Although in most countries, 14 or 16 years of age is the legal threshold for sexual contacts, from a psychological point of view this is a problematic demarcation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Prentky &amp; Barbaree, 2011)</ref> as it concerns the possible dissociation between targets' physical age and bodily sexual maturation as a function of pubertal development.</s><s>Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between pre-, peri-, and postpubescent developmental stages corresponding to pedophilic, hebephilic, and teleiophilic sexual interests, respectively.</s><s>Notably, this distinction according to pubescence status must not be mapped onto specific age bands.</s><s>For the sake of the present study, VT studies vary how stimuli sets are constructed in terms of the differentiation between adults and children according to pubertal stages (i.e., are child categories restricted to prepubescent stimuli or are peripubescent categories included as well).</s><s>Moreover, stimuli sets differ in degrees of sexual explicitness (nude, partially clothed, or fully clothed stimuli) and type of pictures (computer-generated vs. real photos).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scoring algorithms.</head><p><s>Most VT paradigms use a pedophilic difference index/pedophilic differential to quantify pedophilic sexual interest, which has been shown to maximize validity in PPG research <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blanchard et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Harris, Rice, Quinsey, Chaplin, &amp; Earls, 1992)</ref>.</s><s>Crucially, this difference value represents a relative measure of sexual preference of one target category over the other.</s><s>Additionally, VT difference measures of one stimulus category over another stimulus category inherently control for potential influences of general processing speed as baseline response latency is canceled out of the final score.</s><s>Accordingly, general processing speed was not associated with relative VT measures of sexual interest in children (r = -.07;</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schmidt, Gykiere et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, when the highest mean category latency for male or female adult stimuli is subtracted from the highest mean category latency for male or female child stimuli the resulting maximized pedophilic differential score also controls for respondents' sexual gender preferences (i.e., sexual orientation).</s><s>Finally, using category aggregates increases reliability and prevents capitalizing on idiosyncratic characteristics that influence latencies for single stimuli (i.e., outliers).</s><s>Only the latter advantage refers also to the use of aggregated VTs for single target categories as an absolute measure of sexual interest.</s><s>Absolute sexual interest levels might be of interest due to the fact that, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Harris et al. (1996)</ref> have shown that SOC's VT sexual interest levels across all stimulus categories are reduced in comparison with NO.</s><s>This kind of information will be missed when resorting to relative measures of sexual interest exclusively.</s><s>In summary, scoring methods might add method variance to the literature and, thus, the scoring algorithm (relative versus absolute) will be tested as a potential moderator in the present meta-analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRESENT META-ANALYSIS</head><p><s>The current study presents a meta-analysis of the ability of VT measures of sexual interest in children to distinguish between criterion groups and its convergent validity with conceptually different measures of pedophilic interest.</s><s>In addition to common moderator variables (i.e., published vs. unpublished research, peer reviewed vs. non-peer reviewed studies, publication year), we tested possible moderators of the aggregated effect sizes such as scoring method (relative pedophilic difference indexes vs. absolute VTs), children stimuli type (only prepubescent stimuli vs. mixture), type of pictures (computer-generated vs. real photos) sample location (institution vs. community), type of SOC criterion (index is SOC vs. any history of SOC), adult vs. juvenile SOC samples, treatment status, and type of control group.</s><s>Because NO controls are much more different from SOC than offender controls and among offending populations NSO should be less similar to SOC than SOA in terms of all kinds of control variables (e.g., range of paraphilic interests, executive functioning, socio-economic status, selfregulation skills, etc.) we hypothesized for the latter moderator the more different the control groups the larger the contrast with the criterion group.</s><s>Accordingly, we expected a linear trend of effect sizes from unspecific to more specific contrasts based on the similarity of the respective contrast groups (i.e., SOC vs. NO &gt; SOC vs. NSO &gt; SOC vs. SOA; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Babchishin et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, in line with findings from PPG research <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Harris et al., 1992)</ref> we expected relative pedophilic difference indexes to produce larger VT effects than scores based on absolute VTs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD Selection of Studies</head><p><s>Online searches for studies on VT measures of sexual interest in children were conducted eligible studies representing the same number of unique, non-overlapping samples (7 US-American samples, 4 Canadian samples, 1 mixed US-American/Canadian sample, 4 German samples, 2 British samples, 1 Belgian sample).</s><s>To be included in the current meta-analysis, eligible studies had to report on an identifiable sample of male SOC as well as a comparison sample of male SOA, NSO, or NO that were scored on a VT measure of sexual interest in children (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>If studies included no comparison group, at least VT correlations with measures of external criteria indicative of sexual interest in children (i.e., self-report, PPG assessment, SSPI) or actuarial risk scales had to be reported (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All studies had to include sufficient statistical information to calculate relevant effect sizes (Cohen's d for group comparisons, r for correlations with external criteria) and each subsample had to consist at minimum of seven individuals.</s><s>Unfortunately, due to a lack of sufficient information on relevant effect sizes some potentially informative samples had to be excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Abel et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abel et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Giotakis, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gray &amp; Plaud, 2005)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability of Viewing Time Validity</head><p><s>We identified moderators that can explain the observed variability in VT effects.</s><s>First, as hypothesized, effect sizes were a direct function of the type of contrast group: The more similar control groups became, the smaller were the corresponding VT effects (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>For example, the mean weighted VT effects for comparisons with NO led to increases of effects sizes by roughly 60% compared to the average meta-analytic VT effect.</s><s>This could be due to the fact that NO should differ in more aspects (e.g., range of paraphilic sexual interests, cognitive abilities, socio-economic status, etc.) from SOC than other types of sexual offenders (e.g., rapists) and, thus, are likely to produce larger effects.</s></p><p><s>Second, VT effects were significantly more pronounced in adult than in juvenile <ref type="bibr">SOC (d = 0.78 vs. 0.50,</ref><ref type="bibr">respectively)</ref>.</s><s>This finding may be explained by a larger fraction of SOC with genuine pedophilic interest in the adult samples as compared to the juvenile samples.</s><s>According to DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), a gap of at least five years of age between a SOC and his victim is a necessary precondition for the diagnosis of pedophilic interest/disorder.</s></p><p><s>In samples that by definition are not older than 18 years of age, this criterion is more difficult to fulfill.</s><s>Therefore, juvenile SOC were more likely to offend against minors who might have been subjectively perceived as peers than adult offenders with a much larger age and sexual maturation gap.</s><s>In line with this notion, sexual victim profiles indicative of sexual interest in children (i.e., SSPI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Seto &amp; Lalumière, 2001)</ref> showed less strong associations with phallometrically assessed pedophilic interest in adolescents than in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Seto, Murphy, Page, &amp; Ennis, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>The reduced pedophilic sexual interest levels of adolescent vs. adult SOC, however, need not necessarily contradict studies that have found that PPG is a valid indicator of sexual interest in children for adolescent sex offenders <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Rice, Harris, Lang &amp; Chaplin, 2012</ref>; see <ref type="bibr">Ryan, 2016, for review)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Third, restricting the database to adult samples exclusively, the validity of VT measures was substantially increased to a conventionally large effect size when relative pedophilic difference scores were used instead of VT measures based on absolute VTs for child categories (d = 1.03 vs. 0.63, respectively).</s><s>This is concomitant with earlier findings from <ref type="bibr">Harris and colleagues (1992)</ref> who showed that maximized difference scores also increased the validity of PPG assessments.</s><s>Utilizing optimal scoring algorithms, thus, substantially increases mean weighted VT effects by roughly 70% and raises the validity of VT measures of sexual interest in children well above indirect latency-based measurement alternatives, such as the IAT (d = 0.63; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Babchishin et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This has important implications for applied forensic contexts: First of all, if scored properly (i.e., difference scores), VT outperforms IATs in terms of known-groups discrimination.</s><s>This finding is corroborated in all available studies comparing both VT and IAT paradigms in the same sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Babchishin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Banse, Schmidt, &amp;

Banse, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, although IAT measures are inherently based on a difference score they still fall short of VT difference scores' validity.</s><s>Most importantly, maximized difference scores overcome the problem of sexual orientation (i.e., sexually favoring one target sex over the other reduces mean differences when averaging categories across both sexes) and individual differences in cognitive abilities (i.e., due to inherently controlling for confounds by contrasting two comparison categories).</s><s>Hence, maximized difference scores have to be favored over scores based on absolute category VTs if absolute sexual interest differences are not the prime variable of interest.</s></p><p><s>Finally, stimulus type -but not whether pictures are computer-generated or represent real photos -may moderate VT effects (marginally statistically significant at p = .079)</s><s>as effect sizes increased with the degree of nudity in the pictorial stimuli (d = 1.09 in nude vs. 0.68 in fully clothed stimuli; Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Notably, as outlined in the introduction, research has shown that VT effects (at least in non-forensic populations) are driven to a much larger extent by task characteristics (i.e., rating the subjective sexual attractiveness of stimuli) than by stimulus features alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Imhoff et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Although all VT variants in the present research had implemented similar rating tasks, our findings corroborate that stimulus features such as degree of nudity increases effect sizes by roughly two thirds.</s><s>This is in contrast to findings reported in <ref type="bibr">Schmidt, Imhoff, &amp; Banse (2014)</ref> where nude vs. partially clothed stimuli of adults did not interact with the VT effect of sexual orientation in men and women from the community.</s><s>Hence, this is not only an interesting theoretical research question that warrants further research but is particularly relevant for applied forensic assessment purposes where it is ethically much more adequate to use partially clothed stimuli than pictures involving nude children.</s><s>At the same time, according to the present findings, using ethically unproblematic pictures comes at the cost of diagnostic accuracy for a construct that is substantially linked to sexual reoffending risk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gray et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mann, Hanson, &amp;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Outlook</head><p><s>The current meta-analysis is limited by the actual number of existing studies that report a sufficient amount of statistical information necessary for meta-analytic integration.</s><s>In the present case, the number of available independent studies (k = 14 for group comparisons) has to be considered relatively small for a meta-analysis.</s><s>To deal with this limitation, we based our interpretations exclusively on the results from fixed-effects meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Schulze, 2007)</ref>, although we reported random-effect models in all corresponding tables (without substantial variation in terms of the cumulated effect sizes).</s><s>For the meta-analysis of convergent validity with external criteria of sexual interest in children the available database was particularly small with independent samples ranging from four to seven studies.</s><s>Although promising in general, the convergent validity results have to be regarded as preliminary at the present stage.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, the reported mean weighted effect for comparisons of SOC and non-SOC controls (fixed-effect d = 0.60, 95% CI [0.51, 0.68], N = 2,705, k = 14; rising to a substantial d = 1.03 in case of using difference scores) has to be considered as a lower bound of the potential validity of VT measures of sexual interest in children.</s><s>As outlined in the introduction, the variability of true pedophilic interest in the comparison groups is not fully explained by offending status alone.</s><s>Not every SOC is necessarily an exclusive or a non-exclusive pedophilic individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dombert et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Seto, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, for the present results, it has to be kept in mind that the pedophilic interest criterion groups (i.e., SOC) are only proxy groups with an increased but unspecified likelihood of containing a higher fraction of males with sexual interest in children.</s><s>As such, the outcome of comparisons of SOC vs. non-SOC groups on measures of sexual interest in children will be influenced by the actual fraction of individuals with such a paraphilic interest in these groups.</s><s>Hence, under ideal conditions of "pure" criterion groups the validity of VT measures will much likely be higher.</s><s>Therefore, future studies should include additional information on conceptually different proxy measures that help to identify the amount of pedophilic interest at least in the SOC groups (e.g., SSPI levels, boy-girl sexual interest ratios, or PPG difference score levels across comparison groups).</s><s>These additional sample descriptors could be used as potential moderators in further meta-analyses.</s></p><p><s>Only two studies examined the cross-sectional link between VT measures and risk of recidivism <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Babchishin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schmidt, Gykiere et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Moderate effect sizes were reported for static risk factors (r = .33 in both studies) primarily tapping into past criminal and sexually deviant behavior but not for a broader range of fluctuating and potentially changeable dynamic risk indicators indicative of self-regulation problems (rs ranging from -.07 to .19).</s></p><p><s>Despite the fact that research shows lower recidivism rates over the last few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Helmus, Hanson, Thornton, Babchishin, &amp; Harris, 2012)</ref>, VT measures of sexual interest in children have been prospectively linked to sexual reoffending recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gray et al., 2015)</ref>, further justifying their usefulness for forensic assessments.</s><s>Of note, associations with risk levels can only be regarded as an indirect proof of construct validity for sexual interest in children as recidivism risk is only partially driven by pedophilic sexual interest (e.g., Brouillete-Alarie, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Babchishin, Hanson, &amp; Helmus, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mann et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, for applied forensic purposes it remains an important open empirical question at the present stage whether VT measures are amenable to faking attempts once the measurement rationale is known to the respondents or when processnaïve individuals try their subjective best to manipulate the assessment outcome.</s><s>It is surprising that the fakeability of VT measures has yet to be empirically researched.</s><s>One big advantage of VT measures is the ease of technical implementation and scoring as well as the ease of the instructions.</s><s>This renders VT measures of sexual interest as a highly flexible tool to investigate all kinds of atypical and/or paraphilic sexual interests (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Larue et al., 2014</ref> for a VT measure tapping into sexual preferences for sexual violence).</s><s>Nevertheless, we end with a cautionary statement as VT measures rely on their measurement rationale not being transparent to the respondents.</s><s>Therefore, it is debatable whether it has been a wise decision that the DSM-5 explicitly refers to "viewing time" as valid indirect assessment of pedophilic sexual interest (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 699).</s><s>In short, the simplicity and parsimonious nature of VT tasks that renders them attractive to researchers and diagnosticians alike might at the same time pose a significant danger to their validity.</s><s>Note.</s><s>SOC = sexual offenders against children;
