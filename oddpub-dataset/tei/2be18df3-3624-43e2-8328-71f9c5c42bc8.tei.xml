<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Most people have strong moral beliefs about what is right and wrong.</s><s>Although the existence of moral values is universal across different cultures and ethnic groups, people vary in their moral development (also called moral reasoning), that is, the ability to analyze complex moral issues 1 .</s><s>Kohlberg's seminal theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> is the most influential and widely researched theory of moral reasoning and moral development.</s><s>Even today more than twenty-five years after Kohlberg's death, there is considerable research conducted using his theory.</s><s>Much of this influence can be attributed to this theory's central and much-tested assumption that an individual's moral reasoning will predict moral behavior.</s><s>To capture such individual differences in moral development, Kohlberg's theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> classified moral development into three levels: pre-conventional level (motivated by self-interest); conventional level (motivated by maintaining social-order, rules and laws); and post-conventional level (motivated by social contract and universal ethical principles).</s><s>These three levels of moral reasoning can be objectively assessed by the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2) developed by Rest and colleagues 2 in terms of preferences for specific cognitive schemas (see Material and Methods for a detailed explanation).</s><s>Based on this theory, the DIT is the most widely used instrument in moral development research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and the best documented in terms of reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>A revised version of the DIT, known as the DIT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , makes several improvements, including updating dilemmas and items, constructing a new index (called N2 score which reflects the extent to which a person prefers post-conventional moral thinking), and detecting unreliable participants.</s><s>In addition, the DIT-2 is highly correlated with the DIT (r = 0.79) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and has been used to investigate links with brain structure and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>However, the underlying reasons why people reach different moral development levels are still unclear.</s><s>In our current study, we aim to explore the possible neural basis of individual differences in moral development.</s></p><p><s>At the psychological level, researchers have explored links between moral judgment and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> .</s><s>Moral judgment and decision making share several common components, such as value representations and reinforcement learning.</s><s>Specifically, Cushman (2013) has argued that action-based and outcome-based values are two important representations in a dual-system framework used to understand diverse moral judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>According to this framework, the motivations for moral judgment can be valuing the intrinsic status of actions (e.g., I don't steal bread because theft is wrong) or valuing the expected consequences of actions (e.g., "If I steal bread, it will cause the owner harm").</s><s>Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> have demonstrated that normal controls are able to pair the representations of the transgressive action with the distress cues of the victim (i.e., make reference to another's pain) through classical conditioning.</s><s>However, psychopaths fail to establish this conditioning to make reference to another's pain, suggesting the important role of value-based reinforcement learning in moral reasoning development in situations such as avoiding outcomes that might hurt others.</s></p><p><s>Reward motivation is another possible explanation of individual differences in moral development.</s><s>According to conventional economic theories of decision making, people aim to maximize subjective expected values, but differ with regard to preferences for given options (e.g., taking or avoiding risks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Accumulating evidence also suggests a relationship between moral reasoning and prosocial behaviors oriented towards the common good <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , showing that individuals with high-level moral reasoning are more likely to engage in moral and prosocial behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , albeit not always <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Although the mechanisms underlying prosocial behaviors remain controversial, two competing theories exist.</s><s>One theory suggests that prosocial behaviors, regardless of the presence/absence of social pressure, can be guided by the objective of maximizing the intrinsic value (moral value) placed on social principles (e.g., fairness and cooperation).</s><s>An alternative theory proposes that any actions of prosociality under social pressure are selfishly motivated to protect one's reputation or avoid others' resentment.</s><s>According to Kohlberg's moral development theory, individuals who reach the post-conventional level live by their own ethical principle, including basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice.</s><s>They tend to pursue "the greatest good for the greatest number of people" 1 .Thus, it raises the possibility that differences in reward motivation for prosocial behaviors between individuals are associated with different moral development level.</s><s>It is conceivable that higher level moralists perform prosocial behavioral based on their own ethical principles instead of protecting their reputations or avoiding others' resentment.</s></p><p><s>At the neural level, both value-based reinforcement learning and prosocial behaviors engage overlapping neural systems with moral judgment.</s><s>Decades of neuroimaging research have identified multiple brain regions associated with moral judgment, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posterior cingulate cortex, superior temporal cortex, temporal poles, temporoparietal junction, striatum, amygdala, and insula <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, recent studies have provided evidence that subjective value, in both moral and non-moral contexts, is represented in a domain-general manner, in ventral striatum (VS) and vmPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s>For instance, Shenhav and Greene <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> showed that activations in the VS and vmPFC were correlated with the expected moral value of actions (i.e., the expected number of lives lost/saved) during hypothetical life-and-death moral dilemmas.</s><s>Most of these regions are also utilized in value-based decision making.</s><s>Specifically, a "reward-network" composed of the striatum and vmPFC subserves affective/incentive processing of rewards and punishments during decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, prosocial behaviors are also mediated by these value-based brain regions.</s><s>For example, increased activation in the VS and vmPFC has been observed when individuals make charitable donations and altruistic decisions in a similar manner to that observed when individuals receive monetary rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, these findings suggest the involvement of the mesolimbic frontostriatal value-based processing system in moral reasoning.</s><s>Remarkably, we recently found an association between high-level post-conventional moral reasoning and increased gray matter volume (GMV) in vmPFC/ subgenual ACC (sgACC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>This work established a link between moral reasoning and brain structure in the frontostriatal system, suggesting that the frontostriatal network may be one of the key neural bases of individual differences in moral development.</s><s>Here, we further investigate whether this link extends to the function, in addition to the structure, of the brain's frontostriatal reward system.</s></p><p><s>To directly test this association, in the present study we examined a sample of 64 Wharton School Master of Business Administration (MBA) students using functional MRI (fMRI) during a resting state without task requirements, as well as during the performance of a monetary risky decision making task.</s><s>For the resting state, we used arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion fMRI to quantify resting neural activity (i.e., cerebral blood flow, CBF) in the absence of task requirements.</s><s>We hypothesize that individuals with different levels of moral development will show different resting CBF in the frontostriatal system.</s></p><p><s>For the task state, we used blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI to examine the task-induced brain response during the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>We chose the BART task for several reasons.</s><s>First, previous studies have consistently shown that the BART task can induce reliable and robust activation in the frontostriatal reward processing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> , which is involved in both moral judgment and value-based decision making.</s><s>Thus, we use the BART task with fMRI to examine whether task-induced brain activation in the frontostriatal reward processing system differs according to moral development levels.</s><s>Second, the relationship between moral development and risk taking behaviors remains controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Some studies argue that individuals tend to view risky behaviors (i.e., substance use, suicide, sexual involvement) as a matter of personal choice instead of a moral issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , and moral reasoning does not consistently predict risky behaviors, such as substance involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> .</s><s>However, other studies have observed the association between lower moral reasoning and higher drug usage, especially in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>The BART is able to provide an ecologically valid model for the assessment of risk taking propensity, and performance on the BART has been shown to correlate with real-world risk-taking and impulsive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> .</s><s>Thus we use the BART performance to examine the relationship between moral development and risk taking behaviors.</s><s>We aim to explore whether moral development will modulate both risk taking behavior and frontostriatal activation during the BART.</s></p></div>

neural activity in these regions, both at rest and during a decision making task.</s><s>Although these results are exploratory, they provide new insights into the potential neural basis and underlying psychological processing mechanism of individual differences in moral development.</s></p><p><s>As we mentioned before, value representations and reinforcement learning are shared components of moral judgment and decision making.</s><s>Cushman's dual-system approach which emphasizes valuation of actions versus valuation of outcomes provides a useful framework to understand diverse moral judgment and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>From Cushman's dual-system framework perspective (action-based value and outcome-based value) of moral judgment, activation differences in the VS and vmPFC/sgACC between the two DIT groups may reflect the potential importance of outcome valuation in moral reasoning development because the VS and vmPFC are more involved in outcome-based rather than action-based valuation in this framework.</s><s>This is in line with Kohlberg's theory that higher levels of reasoning do tend to focus on outcomes (i.e., the greatest good

type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the current findings of the activation differences in the VS and vmPFC between two DIT groups may raise the potential importance of positive motivations towards others in moral reasoning development, rather than inhibition or selfish motives.</s><s>Again, this is in line with Kohlberg's theory that higher levels of moral reasoning tend to be promotion/other-focused (i.e., do it because it is right) rather than prevention/self-focused (i.e., do not do it because it is wrong).</s></p><p><s>There

trials, while antisocial individuals with externalizing behavior disorders showed increased VS activity during both reward and non-rewarding trials, suggesting that antisocial individuals may be impaired in processing the omission of reward.</s><s>Second, our previous findings regarding impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) support the notion that the change in VS

prosocial behavior in our study.</s><s>Future studies could also investigate the link between the neural correlates identified here and actual moral/prosocial behavior using moral reasoning or moral decision making tasks.</s><s>Second, although our sample is relatively homogeneous in terms of age and level of education since these variables affect moral reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> , unfortunately, we were not able to collect further education background information from our participants.</s><s>For future research, it would be beneficial to know if individuals' previous education background has any influence on their moral development.</s><s>Third, previous studies have suggested that neural responsiveness in the VS and vmPFC may be modulated by mood states <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> .</s><s>Although we did not assess participants' mood states, this should be examined in further research.</s><s>Fourth, we used the online version of the DIT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> to assess participants' moral reasoning level.</s><s>However, level of moral reasoning can also be defined according to other metrics, such as the prosocial moral reasoning objective measure (PROM), which is similar to the DIT-2, but centered on a caring or prosocial perspective rather than on a justice-or prohibition-oriented perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> .</s><s>Future studies could also characterize moral reasoning using this measure.</s><s>In addition, although some evidence suggests that resting CBF measured by ASL fMRI primarily reflects trait-like brain function <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> , longitudinal studies are needed to determine the stability of CBF in the brain reward system.</s><s>Finally, recent studies suggested that the VS may not be homogenous and subregions of the VS may play differential roles in reward learning and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> .</s><s>Specifically, in the VS core, dopamine dynamics are consistent with learning-based theories (such as reward prediction error), whereas in the VS shell, dopamine dynamics are consistent with motivation-based theories (e.g., incentive salience) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> .</s><s>However, the limited spatial resolution of ASL and BOLD fMRI in this study does not allow us to localize the CBF and BOLD activation differences to more specific subregions of the VS, and it is unknown whether the observed differential VS activity between the two DIT groups reflects learning-based or motivation-based differences in moral reasoning development.</s><s>Future imaging studies with much higher spatial resolution are needed to address this question.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we combined ASL perfusion and BOLD fMRI and examined both resting and task-induced brain activity associated with post-conventional moral reasoning in a relatively homogeneous cohort of 64 Wharton School MBA students.</s><s>Individuals who reached the post-conventional moral reasoning level have increased resting CBF and task-induced activation in the VS and vmPFC/sgACC, which are key regions related to decision making and reward processing.</s><s>This suggests that high-level moral reasoning is associated with increased activity in the frontostriatal system, both in task-dependent or task-independent states.</s><s>These
