<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>ALIGN was a randomised, multicentre, doubleblind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study conducted in 68 study centres in Europe, Canada and the USA (NCT01061723).</s><s>The study duration was 22 weeks, including 4 weeks of screening, 12 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of post-treatment follow-up.</s><s>Patients were randomised with balanced allocation to receive either SC placebo or sarilumab (100, 150 or 200 mg every other week (q2w), or 100 or 150 mg every week (qw), with q2w dosing alternating with placebo) for 12 weeks.</s><s>Patients were stratified according to levels of high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP (≤1.5 mg/dL or &gt;1.5 mg/dL) at screening and region (Western countries vs non-Western countries).</s><s>Patients who completed the 12-week treatment period were offered enrolment in a long-term extension study, NCT01118728.</s><s>Patients who chose not to enrol in the extension study had a post-treatment safety follow-up visit 6 weeks after the end-of-treatment visit.</s><s>Further details regarding scheduling of clinic visits are provided in online supplemental materials.</s></p><p><s>This study was performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practice.</s><s>The appropriate institutional review boards/ethics committees approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient before study participation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Consecutively enrolled patients were randomised using a central randomisation scheme generated by an Interactive Voice Response System.</s><s>All data were collected during scheduled clinic and home visits.</s><s>Patients included in the study were men and women between the ages of 18 and 75 years, had had active AS for at least 3 months, and Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">21</ref> and total back pain score ≥4 at screening and baseline, without complete fusion of the spine, and did not respond adequately to, or were intolerant of, ≥2 NSAIDs (each taken for ≥2 weeks).</s><s>Patients treated with oral prednisone or equivalent corticosteroids (≤10 mg/day) must have been taking a stable dose for ≥2 weeks prior to baseline.</s><s>Patients treated with the disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs hydroxychloroquine (≤400 mg/day), sulfasalazine (≤3 g/day) or methotrexate (MTX) (≤25 mg/week) must have been on a stable dose ≥12 weeks prior to baseline.</s></p><p><s>Patients were excluded from the study if they had a past history of non-response to any anti-TNF-α agent or non-response to any other biological treatment for AS, had received treatment with a disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (except those allowed in the inclusion criteria) or any biological agent within 3 months prior to screening, had received oral prednisone or equivalent corticosteroids &gt;10 mg/day within 6 weeks prior to screening, intramuscular or intra-articular corticosteroids within 4 weeks of screening, or had previously been treated with cyclosporine or azathioprine.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study objectives and efficacy endpoints</head><p><s>The primary study objectives were to evaluate sarilumab efficacy during the 12-week treatment period according to the Axial SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">22</ref> outcome measure in patients with AS, and to define the best dose/dosage regimen for further development.</s></p><p><s>The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved the ASAS20 response criteria at week 12.</s><s>This was defined as an improvement of at least 20% and an absolute improvement of at least one unit relative to baseline on a 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS) in at least three of the following four ASAS improvement criteria (ASAC-IC) domains: physical function (Bath AS Function Index (BASFI)), <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">23</ref> total back pain, patient global assessment and inflammation (mean of intensity and duration of morning stiffness components from the BASDAI); and no worsening ≥20% and ≥1 unit relative to baseline on a scale of 0-10 NRS in the remaining fourth domain.</s></p><p><s>Secondary efficacy end points at week 12 included the percentage of patients who achieved: ASAS40 response (as for ASAS20, with improvement ≥40% and absolute improvement ≥2 units), ASAS partial remission (value of ≤2 units on a 0-10 NRS in each of the four ASAS-IC domains), ASAS5/6 response (composite score of six domains ie, ASAS-IC, spinal mobility The incidences of swollen and tender joints were not captured, and the impact of sarilumab on peripheral disease was not assessed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size calculation</head><p><s>On the basis of previous trials with biologics in AS, it was assumed that the response rates would be 25% in the placebo group and 60% in at least one of the active treatment groups.</s><s>With 50 patients per group, the study had ∼80% power to detect a difference of 35 percentage points between any dose of sarilumab and placebo using a two-sided test with α=0.01 due to the application of Hommel's procedure to adjust for multiplicity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses Primary efficacy analysis</head><p><s>The primary efficacy end point, ASAS20 response at week 12, was assessed to demonstrate that at least one sarilumab dose differed from placebo.</s><s>Comparisons made between each sarilumab dose group and the placebo group were adjusted for multiplicity using Hommel's procedure.</s><s>ASAS20 response at week 12 was analysed using the two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by screening hs-CRP and region.</s><s>Pairwise comparisons of response rates and 95% CIs for ORs between each sarilumab dose and placebo were derived by testing each active dose group versus placebo separately.</s><s>The Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the OR and the corresponding 95% CIs were derived the same way.</s></p><p><s>A last-observation-carried-forward procedure was used to impute any missing ASAS20 components for patients who missed at least one ASAS component at week 12 for any reason.</s><s>Patients who discontinued study treatment due to lack of efficacy before week 12 were considered as non-responders.</s><s>Treatment-by-subgroup interactions were also analysed for ASAS20 response.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary efficacy analyses</head><p><s>Binary secondary efficacy end points, for example, ASAS40 response, ASAS partial remission and ASAS5/6 response at week 12 were analysed as defined above for the primary efficacy end point.</s><s>An analysis of covariance model, including terms for baseline, treatment, screening hs-CRP level and region, was used to assess treatment differences in change from baseline for continuous efficacy variables.</s><s>Descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, median, minimum and maximum were provided.</s><s>Additionally, difference in least-square means, the corresponding 95% CIs and the p values were provided for comparisons of each sarilumab dose versus placebo.</s></p><p><s>Active inflammation in the spine visible on MRI short tau inversion recovery sequence was analysed by applying the MRI score for ASspiMRI-a, as has been described before. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">24</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety analysis</head><p><s>Safety summaries were descriptive and no hypothesis testing was conducted.</s><s>Summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities coding of verbatim terms reported by investigators.</s><s>TEAEs were defined as any AEs that newly developed or worsened, or became serious on or after the day of first dose intake of study drug, up to the day of end of study.</s><s>The incidences of abnormal laboratory values, vital signs and ECG parameters were recorded.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The ALIGN study showed that SC-administered sarilumab was generally well tolerated but did not demonstrate a statistically or clinically significant effect compared to placebo in patients with active AS who had an inadequate response to, or were intolerant of, NSAIDs.</s><s>A statistically significant reduction in hs-CRP following SC sarilumab treatment demonstrated that a biological effect of IL-6 blockade was achieved.</s><s>However, lack of associated clinical or imaging improvement that is, similar reductions in functional and clinical parameters as measured by MRI, BASDAI, BASMI and BASFI scores in placebo-treated and sarilumab-treated patients, further suggests that IL-6 may not play a major role in the inflammatory process underlying AS.</s><s>The significant reduction observed in the ASDAS score with sarilumab likely reflects inclusion of hs-CRP in this composite measure, suggesting that ASDAS may not be a robust outcome parameter when changes in CRP values could be dissociated from changes in disease activity, as with anti-IL-6 therapies.</s><s>Variability in the observed efficacy of sarilumab among individual treatment groups in the ALIGN study most likely reflects the inclusion of only 49-52 subjects in each individual treatment group, since no sarilumab dose group yielded a statistically significantly greater proportion of ASAS20 responders when compared to the placebo group (figure 2A, p&gt;0.05 for all groups).</s><s>Variability of ASAS20 response at week 12 by hs-CRP stratification among sarilumab groups (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) potentially supports this assertion.</s></p><p><s>There was no relationship between changes in hs-CRP and changes in the MRI scores, suggesting that the drug did not have an effect on AS disease-specific inflammation.</s></p><p><s>Although case reports of treatment with TCZ have suggested benefit of IL-6Rα blockade in AS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[19]</ref> a recent 12-week phase II multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of TCZ in AS patients did not confirm this.</s><s>That study used the same primary efficacy end point as the ALIGN study to compare intravenous TCZ 8 mg/kg versus placebo in 102 AS patients (TCZ, n=51; placebo, n=51).</s><s>Similar to sarilumab, TCZ also failed to reach its primary efficacy end point despite reducing hs-CRP and ASDAS scores. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">20</ref></s><s>These results caution that positive case reports or evidence for a certain pharmacological intervention based on preclinical data, may not always predict the clinical efficacy of a targeted drug in complex diseases of unknown aetiology such as AS.</s><s>Anti-IL-6Rα therapies have shown efficacy in RA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">15</ref>  <ref type="bibr">25 26</ref> Sarilumab was studied in the treatment of RA in the phase II/III MOBILITY study (NCT01061736) using the same five doses as in the current trial.</s><s>Part A of this study demonstrated efficacy of sarilumab in addition to MTX in patients with active, moderate-to-severe RA who had inadequate response to MTX. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">27</ref> Several other drugs with proven efficacy in RA, including sulfasalazine, leflunomide, MTX, anakinra, rituximab and abatacept, have been investigated for the treatment of AS and, thus far, none has shown any clear therapeutic efficacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">28</ref></s><s>TNF-blockers appear to be effective across a number of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, including RA and AS, whereas, the efficacy of other targeted therapies may be limited to fewer specific indications.</s><s>Encouraging data from a small study in AS patients evaluating IL-17 blockade, which has shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis, <ref type="bibr">29 30</ref> will require further confirmation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">31</ref></s><s>n the current study in AS patients, sarilumab showed a safety profile similar to reports with other IL-6 inhibitors.</s><s>Infections and laboratory abnormalities, including neutropenia, elevated transaminases and hyperlipidaemia, were the most commonly observed safety findings.</s></p></div>
