<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p><s>We investigated the existence of a concern for group reputation and its positive effects on levels of prosociality in a laboratory study with 5-year-old children.</s><s>In our experiment, groups of 3 children each were assigned to the same group (the "yellow group") using a minimal group paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Billig &amp; Tajfel, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dunham, Baron, &amp; Carey, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Children were each handed 10 toys and told that if they wanted to, they could share any number of toys with children from a different kindergarten.</s><s>While they distributed their toys, participants were observed by two peers.</s><s>At the end of the procedure, children pushed their donations into a donation box, and we systematically manipulated whether observers could see what children had donated to the other kindergarten.</s><s>Specifically, we varied (a) group reputation-that is, whether the group's combined donation was public or private-and (b) individual reputation-that is, whether children's individual donations were public or private.</s></p></div>

91.7% of the children answered the question correctly.</s><s>Finally, Experimenter 2 filmed the number of toys in each child's waist pack to infer how many toys each participant had shared (since in the both-private and onlygroup-public conditions, individual donations could not be inferred from the donation box).</s><s>Once this had been done, the child who was a member of the red group was allowed to distribute 10 toys as well.</s></p><p><s>Coding and analysis.</s><s>The number of toys given to the other kindergarten was coded from tape by the first experimenter and the first author.</s><s>A research assistant, who was unaware of the study design and hypothesis, independently coded 25% of all trials.</s><s>Interrater agreement was excellent (Cohen's Îº = 1).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Study 1 provides evidence that young children care not only about their individual reputation but also about the reputation of their group and that this concern for group reputation can positively influence their prosociality.</s><s>However, it is unclear whether children's behavior in the crucial condition-the only-group-public condition-was motivated only by concern for their group's reputation.</s><s>An alternative is that children's increased prosociality in this condition is rooted in concern for individual reputation.</s><s>Indeed, some outcomes might have allowed observers to make inferences about individual contributions.</s><s>For example, children might have reasoned that if they do not share anything and their peers do not share anything either, then the two observers would know how much they shared.</s><s>Study 2 tested these different alternatives.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p><s>Participants.</s><s>We tested 24 children (age range = 61 months, 17 days, to 70 months, 29 days; mean age = 66 months, 12 days; 12 females) in groups of three each (each subject participated in the study with two confederates).</s><s>Five additional children had to be excluded because confederates mentioned how many toys they were going to share (4 children), and 1 child did not want to continue playing the game.</s><s>In total, 30 children acted as confederates (age range = 62 months, 27 days, to 82 months, 8 days; mean age = 67 months, 12 days; 15 females).</s><s>Confederates participated in multiple trials.</s><s>Each group was observed by two peers, one of the same and one of the opposite gender.</s><s>Twenty-eight additional children acted as observers (age range = 60 months, 1 day, to 66 months, 8 days; mean age = 64 months, 6 days; 14 females).</s><s>Observers participated in multiple trials.</s><s>Children were randomly assigned to the participant, confederate, or observer role.</s></p><p><s>Procedure.</s><s>There was one condition (the no-group condition) in this study, and the procedure was identical to that in the other conditions, except for two modifications.</s><s>First, given that children were not assigned to a minimal group in this condition, there was no group manipulation.</s><s>Second, since we wanted to minimize the possibility of participants developing a sense of group membership as a result of engaging in the same task, participants were introduced to the sharing game individually and not in groups of three.</s><s>Furthermore, since we wanted to avoid some participants having to wait longer than others before starting the sharing task (introduction to the task took about 15 min), each subject participated in the game with two same-sex and same-age confederates who were recruited from the same day-care centers.</s><s>Thus, the overall sequence of this condition was as follows.</s><s>First, Experimenter 1 introduced the two confederates to the task and told them that later in the game they should put five toys in the drawer and five toys in their waist pack (theoretically, confederates could have distributed toys in any way they wished since participants could neither see nor hear their distribution, but we wanted to give them clear directions).</s><s>Then, Experimenter 1 introduced the participant to the task (this was identical to the familiarization in the other conditions).</s><s>From this point, the procedure was the same as in Experiment 1 (i.e., from the section "Playing the Sharing Game" onward); all three children were in the room together, and the procedure was the same as in all other conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>In the no-group condition, children shared on average 4.3 toys (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>To compare the number of toys shared in this condition with the number of toys shared in the only-group-public condition of Study 1, we used a generalized linear model, which we fitted with negative binomial error structure and log link function <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McCullagh &amp; Nelder, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The model was fitted in R (R Core Team, 2015) using the function glm.nb of the package MASS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Venables &amp; Ripley, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>We found a significant difference between the two conditions, indicating that children shared more toys in the only-grouppublic condition (estimate = â0.298,</s><s>SE = 0.135), Ï 2 (1) = 5.495, p = .027,</s><s>95% CI = [â0.563,</s><s>â0.034].</s><s>There was no difference when comparing the no-group condition to the both-private condition (estimate = 0.274, SE = 0.229), Ï 2 (1) = 1.425, p = .233,</s><s>95% CI = [â0.185,</s><s>0.726].</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Study 2 shows that children's increased donations in the only-group-public condition were due to concern for group reputation.</s><s>The fact that children gave more toys in a condition where group reputation was at stake (only-group-public condition) compared with the exact same condition without a group manipulation (nogroup condition) suggests that children care about and actively invest in the reputation of their group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p><s>Our results show that young children care about the reputation of their group and that this concern positively influences levels of prosociality.</s><s>When the reputation of their group was at stake, young children were motivated to invest in their group's reputation by selectively increasing their prosociality-even when individual contributions were anonymous and prosocial deeds could not be attributed to any child individually.</s><s>Specifically, when 5-year-old preschoolers acted from within an assigned group and that group's combined donation was public, they shared more toys with children from a different kindergarten compared with a situation in which the collective donation remained private.</s><s>Notably, this effect was observed using a minimal group paradigm in which children were assigned to novel social groups with which they had no previous experience.</s></p><p><s>We also found that young children care about and invest in their individual reputation.</s><s>When contributions could be traced back to each individual, children shared significantly more of their own toys than when personal donations were private.</s><s>This result corroborates previous work on young children's concern for reputation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Engelmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fu et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Leimgruber et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>From at least the age of 5 onward, young children show a robust tendency to care about the impressions they make on others coupled with a motivation to invest in a reputation as a prosocial person.</s></p><p><s>This raises the question as to the relationship between concern for individual reputation and concern for group reputation.</s><s>There is no doubt that individuals often benefit from being members of groups, institutions, or organizations that have good reputations.</s><s>That is to say, belonging to a group with a positive reputation can have welcome consequences for individual reputation-especially in cases where group reputation is taken as a proxy for individual reputation.</s><s>To return to the example from the introduction, this might include a doctor being chosen on the basis of his or her degree from a prestigious university and not because of his or her individual reputation.</s><s>The question is whether the concern of individuals for group reputation is, motivationally speaking, separate from and irreducible to their tendency to manage individual reputation.</s><s>Results of the present studies suggest that concern for group reputation is distinct from concern for individual reputation.</s></p><p><s>In Study 1, in the most relevant condition (only group public), the groups' overall donation was public, whereas children's individual donations were anonymous.</s><s>Children were aware that their individual contributions were unknown to the observers in this condition; in fact, more than 90% of participants correctly stated so in response to our control question.</s><s>Nevertheless, children proved significantly more generous in this condition than in a condition where both group and individual donations were private (bothprivate condition).</s><s>However, it is possible that children's increased donations in the only-group-public condition can be explained in terms of concern for individual reputation. 3</s><s>Study 2 tested this alternative explanation by comparing the only-group-public condition with an additional condition, the no-group condition.</s><s>In both conditions, the combined output of three children was visible to observers (and individual input was unknown), but group reputation was at stake only in the only-group-public condition (since children were not assigned to the same group in the no-group condition).</s><s>Children shared significantly more toys in the only-group-public condition than in the no-group condition.</s><s>It would thus seem that children's concern for group reputation is not reducible to concern for individual reputation.</s><s>This is not to say that investment in group reputation provides evidence for any form of group-level selection mechanisms.</s><s>Ultimately, individuals probably evolved to care about the reputation of their group because of the positive effects on individual reputation.</s><s>But this does not mean that the proximate mechanism cannot be a genuine concern for the reputation of one's group that is, at least to some extent, independent of concern for individual reputation.</s></p><p><s>Developing a thorough understanding of the interplay between individual and group reputation is an exciting avenue for future research.</s><s>One approach would be to study experimental contexts in which actions that benefit one of the forms of reputation (group or individual) result in negative effects on the other form of reputation.</s><s>For example, would individuals act in ways that advance their group's reputation even if doing so would simultaneously diminish their individual reputation?</s><s>This is the first study to show that concern for group reputation can increase prosociality-even in children as young as 5 years old.</s><s>Our findings demonstrate that levels of prosociality not only vary as a function of whether individual reputation is at stake but also are based on whether group reputation is affected by one's actions.</s><s>Previous work has shown that concern for individual reputation can stabilize cooperation in groups featuring a manageable pool of potential collaborators (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Milinski, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The current results build on and extend this line of research by showing that concern for group reputation promotes prosociality, thus potentially suggesting a mechanism that can positively influence levels of cooperation in larger communities.</s><s>Modeling mechanisms of large groups, institutions, or organizations in experimental contexts is far from straightforward, and one limitation of the current study is that we used fairly small groups consisting of three children.</s><s>In larger groups, individuals can more easily submerge into the anonymity of their group and, as a result, have more opportunities to "free-ride" on the efforts of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Henrich, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, although our experimental groups were smaller than most natural groups, we believe that our design captures the crucial aspect of such situations: Group output is public, but individual contribution is not, creating an incentive to exploit others' efforts in building and maintaining the group's reputation.</s></p><p><s>In contexts where information about individual reputations is not easily accessible, the reputation of the group or institution that we are associated with-the university where we studied, the company for which we work, the organization of which we are a membercan serve as a proxy for individual reputation.</s><s>This creates pressure to care about and invest in the reputation of one's group.</s><s>Here, we have shown that 5-yearold children show concern for group reputation and selectively act more prosocially when their group's reputation is at stake.</s></p></div>
