(2011)</ref> claim that deliberative reasoning requires overriding System 1. Overriding System 1 and activating System 2 demands an individual's executive control, as well as a propensity to think actively and resist the premature closing of problems.</s><s>Executive control processes thus play a crucial role in analytical System 2 processes (see De <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Neys and Glumicic, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Evans, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Thompson, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>System 2 function relates to general measures of cognitive ability such as IQ (Intelligence Quotient), whereas System 1 function does not <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Stanovich, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Dual process theories of thinking have been mainly developed in deductive reasoning tasks and there is a lot of evidence for the relevance of both systems of thinking in propositional and syllogistic reasoning (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">De Neys, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barrouillet, 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Reasoning is a kind of thinking activity that has a precise starting point, a set of premises, and the goal of drawing a conclusion.</s><s>In induction, the conclusion involves an increment in semantic information; whereas in deduction the conclusions do not involve any increase in semantic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Johnson-Laird, 1988)</ref>.</s><s>Abstract reasoning, even the most elementary kind, is hence a complex phenomenon that requires that individuals follow a sequential process that includes various steps and tasks, and the passage from one to another.</s><s>A second source of complexity comes from the need to temporarily store and update in WM the diverse representations needed to carry out a reasoning sequence.</s><s>Indeed, individual differences in reasoning are substantially correlated with the amount of information learners can hold in WM while perform the required inferential reasoning task <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Süß et al., 2002)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are diverse theories of deduction, the two most important being that of "mental rules" and "mental models."</s><s>According to mental rules theories, people possess a set of rules, a sort of "natural logic" from which they reach a conclusion by following a sequence of steps (see <ref type="bibr">Rips, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Braine and O'Brien, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>The current work, however, has been planned and carried out according to the mental model approach.</s><s>The mental model theory of reasoning postulates that when individuals face deductive problems they construct models or possibilities of the meaning of assertions consistent with what they describe (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Johnson-Laird, 1983</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991)</ref>.</s><s>Mental models only represent what is true according to the premises, but not what is false.</s><s>For instance, for the conditional "if p, then q" people might construct the following true possibilities: "p and q, " "not-p and q, " "not-p and not-q."</s><s>A main assumption of model theory concerns the crucial role of WM in deduction: representing and manipulating models in order to reach a conclusion entails cognitive work and effort.</s><s>For complex deductive problems, for instance conditionals, several possibilities are true, but people think about as few alternatives as possible because of the limitations of their WM <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, reasoners are likely to base most of their inferences from the initial and incomplete representation or models of the premises.</s><s>The model theory's fundamental prediction is thus drawn from the number of models required for reaching a conclusion: the more models, the greater the problem's difficulty.</s><s>When the number of models to be held in mind is reduced, reasoning improves <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(García-Madruga et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>An inferential conclusion is necessarily valid if it holds in all the models of the premises.</s><s>Therefore, finding a valid conclusion to complex problems requires that individuals build complete representations of premises and validate initial conclusions by searching for counterexamples that can make them false.</s><s>From a mental model perspective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">García-Madruga et al. (2007)</ref> have highlighted the central executive processes as the crucial WM component in the explanation of propositional reasoning performance, as well as its relationship with the two systems of reasoning processes, System 1 and System 2. They found positive correlations between WM and reasoning responses that require high levels of mental word, and negative correlations between WM and reasoning responses that require low levels of mental work.</s><s>Moreover, high WM individuals were more able to resist superficial responses and rely on the semantic process of constructing models of the meaning of premises from which they drown correct conclusions.</s><s>Likewise, studies with syllogistic reasoning problems have borne out the crucial role of WM, particularly the executive processes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Gilhooly et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Capon et al., 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In deductive reasoning, the process of connecting premises to the conclusion is ruled by logic.</s><s>That is, the conclusions have to be necessary and consistent.</s><s>The restrictions that rule deductive reasoning are hence metadeductive.</s><s>Metadeduction involves an individual's capacity to reflect on one's own logical activity itself and to distinguish between logical validity and reality (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Byrne et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Metadeductive abilities include the implicit understanding of the logical system and its basic concepts of necessity and validity, as well as the explicit use of this knowledge by applying metalogical strategies, such as searching for counterexamples <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Moshman, 1990)</ref>.</s><s>Metacognition has been proposed as an important basis for overrides of System 1 by System 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Thompson, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In developmental terms, there is a gradual acquisition of metalogical understanding during preadolescent and adolescent years: from 11 to 12 years preadolescents begin to understand the concepts of necessity, consistency and the validity of logical conclusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Moshman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Santamaría et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, complete explicit metalogical capacity only becomes possible in late adolescence and adulthood.</s><s>In this work, we will use a Deductive Reasoning Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(García-Madruga et al., 2014a</ref>) that assesses both deductive and metadeductive abilities.</s></p><p><s>Dual process theorists agree that abstract and hypothetical System 2 processes can guide our reasoning on specific tasks toward normative answers, whereas System 1 processes have a mayor influence on everyday judgement.</s><s>The role of dual processes of thinking in education, and particularly the capacity of the Cognitive Reflection Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Frederick, 2005)</ref> to predict academic achievement, have been demonstrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gómez-Chacón et al. (2014)</ref> within the field of mathematics.</s><s>According to these authors, the dual processes approach has direct application to mathematical learning.</s><s>A teacher has to direct attention toward two basic educational objectives: firstly, the promotion of an in-depth understanding of mathematical concepts; and secondly, the inhibition of superficial processes and strategies that otherwise lead to error.</s><s>Our view is that these two basic objectives are cross-sectional in education, so that they underlie academic achievement not only in mathematics, but across all the diverse school subjects.</s></p><p><s>The present paper addresses the relationship that abstract reasoning has with academic achievement in secondary school, and focus not only on classic fluid intelligence measures but also on two new measures of cognitive reflection and verbal deduction.</s><s>We examine the underlying idea that other reasoning measures will be a relevant predictor of academic achievement, even beyond the predictive value of fluid intelligence measures.</s><s>We argue that abstract reasoning processes are involved in most of the complex learning tasks students commonly face at school, and constitute an important higher-order cognitive ability that underlies academic achievement.</s><s>In order to extend and clarify this supposition, the main goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between two new reasoning measures, one mathematical (Cognitive Reflection) and the other verbal (Deductive Reasoning), and a third classic visuospatial reasoning measure that evaluates fluid intelligence, as well as test their capacity to predict academic achievement in adolescence.</s><s>In spite of the obvious differences in contents and materials, all of them involve the construction and manipulation of abstract representations in a sequential process that requires supervision and control.</s><s>Thus, we provide a new estimate of the association between cognitive ability and education by having multiple reasoning tests as predictors of academic achievement at secondary school.</s><s>Participation of an adolescent sample seemed particularly relevant, as reasoning skills are increasingly important during this developmental period <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barrouillet, 2011)</ref>, when learning activities become more complex.</s><s>In order to assess this view, we used three diverse kinds of reasoning tests, as we shall describe in more detail in the Methods section: Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Frederick, 2005)</ref>, DRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(García-Madruga et al., 2014a</ref>) and Raven's Progressive Matrices Test (RPMT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Raven, 1941</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Raven, , 1962;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Raven et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>The academic achievement is the criteria for assessing students learning outcomes.</s></p><p><s>The Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; Frederick, 2005; for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Campitelli and Gerrans, 2014</ref>; for a metaanalysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brañas-Garza et al., 2015)</ref> assesses an individual's ability to use System 2 processes and resist the tendency to give an immediate response (System 1).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Frederick (2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Toplak et al. (2014)</ref> found that many people show a tendency to give the fast incorrect answers that are automatic, superficial, compelling, without thinking deeply enough.</s><s>Frederick's problems are hence difficult and people who give the incorrect responses tend to underestimate their difficulty.</s><s>Prior research has also evidenced that individuals who perform well tend to perform also well at other general ability tests, and tend to avoid biases in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Campitelli and Labollita, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Toplak et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we expected a high rate of erroneous intuitive responses and a significant positive correlation between intuitive responses and the rating of the difficulty of the problems.</s></p><p><s>The DRT (García-Madruga et al., 2014a) assesses both deductive and metadeductive abilities in propositional and syllogistic reasoning.</s><s>According to mental model theory, most of the deductive problems included in the test (11 out of 15) require the construction of multiple models, that is, require the use of System 2 reflexive thinking.</s><s>The problems were designed so that they covered a range of difficulty (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Johnson-Laird and Byrne, 1991</ref>, for an analysis of tasks in terms of mental models).</s><s>We hence expected that most of the problems would be difficult and predicted a close relationship between performance in CRT and DRT.</s></p><p><s>In order to have a measure of abstract non-verbal reasoning, in this work we used the RPMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Raven et al., 1995)</ref> that evaluates fluid intelligence.</s><s>The RPMT assesses a participant's ability to solve new problems by perceiving relationships, inducing rules and completing abstract analogies; in other words, by solving diverse relational reasoning tasks that are carried out in working memory, and governed by the executive processes of "assembly and control" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carpenter et al., 1990)</ref>.</s><s>The more difficult problems entail more rules or more difficult rules.</s><s>Erroneous responses can be yielded by System 1 processes, that is, by a superficial or incomplete kind of reasoning that leads one to give intuitive responses that agree only partially with the rules governing the search for the correct responses.</s><s>We hence also predict a close relation between performance in CRT and Raven test.</s></p><p><s>Apart from the general expectations concerning the results in CRT, we expected positive correlations between cognitive reflection, deductive reasoning, and Intelligence measures, given that there are common cognitive, metacognitive and WM's executive processes that underlie them.</s><s>Likewise, we predicted that the three reasoning tasks would correlate with academic achievement.</s><s>In particular, the correlations between erroneous intuitive responses (System 1) and the ratings of difficulty in CRT with accuracy measures of reasoning (System 2) and academic achievement should be negative.</s><s>Our second hypothesis includes the main prediction that cognitive reflection, deductive reasoning and intelligence measures should predict a relevant amount of variance of academic achievement.</s><s>Regarding the CRT, recent findings indicate that it is a predictor of rational thinking performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Toplak et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Toplak et al., , 2014))</ref>.</s><s>Our approach maintains that CRT provides a way to assess a main control executive function: the ability to supervise and inhibit cognitive processes and responses.</s><s>Therefore, we expected that CRT would be able to predict a relevant amount of variance of deductive inferences, metadeductive inferences and intelligence.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In order to solve new and complex intellectual problems individuals have to think in an active and deep way, using all their WM resources and applying their main executive processes.</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we have investigated abstract reasoning in 15-17 years old students in their final year of Secondary school, using three different reasoning tasks: the CRT, the deductive reasoning task and the fluid intelligence test.</s><s>Our key predictions concern the relationships between the three kinds of reasoning measures and their capacity to predict academic achievement.</s><s>With respect to this, we would like to make two main points: first, this study confirms the trend noted in previous research regarding the relationship between reasoning and academic achievement; and second, the present novel findings revealed the relevance of verbal deductive reasoning to predict academic achievement, even beyond a visual fluid intelligence measure.</s></p><p><s>We provide new evidence on the interplay between the three cognitive variables.</s><s>As claimed by our first hypothesis, the inter-correlations were all significant and in the predicted direction.</s><s>Furthermore, on the whole, the magnitude of predicted correlations was medium to high, in particular, the correlations between correct and intuitive responses in the CRT with Intelligence (RPMT), Deductive and Metadeductive inferences (DRT).</s><s>These results confirm our theoretical conception regarding the tight relationships between the diverse kind of reasoning studied in this paper, as well as the common cognitive, metacognitive, and executive processes that underlie them.</s><s>An interesting, but not unexpected, result is the high correlation between Cognitive Reflection and Metadeductive Inferences.</s><s>The greater predictive ability of the CRT on Metadeductive inferences would be explained by the increased involvement of the metacognitive component in the metadeductive tasks.</s><s>Thus, the pattern of results supports their common metacognitive nature and gives support to the important role that metacognitive processes may play in determining the interventions of System 2, as claimed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Thompson (2009)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Thompson et al.
