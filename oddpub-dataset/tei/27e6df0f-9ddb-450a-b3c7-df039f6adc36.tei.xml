<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>We studied quantitative and phenotypic alterations of CD4 þ T cells in the duodenal mucosa of HIV-infected patients in the context of different stages of HIV disease and timing of cART initiation.</s><s>One major finding was that absolute CD4 þ T-cell numbers in the intestinal mucosa of HIV-infected patients were preserved, if cART was initiated during the acute phase of the disease.</s><s>According to our quantitative analysis, decline in mucosal CD4 þ T-cell percentages that has often been described for untreated acute HIV infection 1,2,14,15,20 is largely HIV-infected patients may therefore be missed if their frequency is determined as a percentage of total mucosal T cells.</s><s>Furthermore, levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation and intestine epithelial damage were comparable between treated acutely HIV-infected patients and controls, which suggests that the well-preserved mucosal CD4 þ T cell pool may help to attenuate inflammatory disease progression.</s></p><p><s>In treatment-naı ¨ve chronically HIV-infected patients, mucosal CD4 þ T cells were severely depleted at all stages of the disease.</s><s>Maximum severity of loss of mucosal CD4 þ T-cell numbers was already achieved in the early stage of chronic HIV disease, that is, when CD4 þ T-cell count in peripheral blood is still over 350 per ml.</s><s>In contrast to peripheral blood, where T EM cell frequencies among peripheral CD4 þ T cells rather increase during chronic disease progression, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> T EM cells among CD4 þ T cells in the intestinal mucosa progressively declined.</s><s>Our results suggest that enhanced recruitment of mucosal CD4 þ T cells into the terminal stage of differentiation is one mechanism behind this loss of mucosal T EM cells.</s></p><p><s>With regard to the CD4 þ T-cell subset proliferative potential, we identified a major difference between the mucosal and peripheral immune compartment.</s><s>Specifically, whereas CD4 þ T CM cells in peripheral blood of HIV-infected patients exhibit a higher proliferation rate than other T-cell subsets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> we found no proliferation within their mucosal counterparts, which is in agreement with previous observations in SIVinfected rhesus macaques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>This suggests that mucosal CD4 þ T CM cells are in a resting, non-activated state, a property that potentially makes them less susceptible to HIV infection.</s><s>Moreover, in this resting cellular state, CD4 þ T CM cells are most likely not able to differentiate into new effector cells, which may enhance the preferential loss of T EM cells from the mucosal CD4 þ T-cell compartment.</s><s>Because CD4 þ T EM cells have a pivotal role in maintaining protective immunity, their severe contraction in patients with late-stage disease may be one determinant of the clinically evident mucosal immune dysfunction (that is, opportunistic infections and cancers at the level of the gastrointestinal tract) that usually occurs after years of untreated HIV infection.</s><s>Consistent with this assumption, studies performed in SIV-infected rhesus macaques indicate a close association between the host susceptibility to opportunistic infections and the depletion of effector site CD4 þ T EM cells below a critical threshold level. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>In addition, we found that semi-activated mucosal CD4 þ T cells shift toward a fullyactivated state in chronically HIV-infected patients.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> Incomplete regeneration of the mucosal immune system during treated HIV infection likely promotes disease progression.</s><s>In patients with initiation of cART during chronic HIV infection, repopulation of the intestinal mucosa with CD4 þ T cells was insufficient to achieve full reconstitution.</s><s>At all stages of chronic disease, CD4 þ T cells in the duodenum restored to less than half of the numbers observed in HIV-negative controls.</s><s>Thereby, levels of CD4 þ T-cell intermediate/latestage activation remained elevated in the gastrointestinal tract of these patients, suggesting a link between insufficient downregulation of local immune hyperactivation and persistent lack of mucosal CD4 þ T cells.</s><s>Inflammatory conditions can prevent sufficient cell trafficking and thus limit CD4 þ T-cell repopulation with cART.</s><s>A previous study demonstrated an association of enterocyte damage and consequent dysregulated chemokine expression with defective homing of CD4 þ T cells to the gut. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>Consistent with this study, we found increased plasma concentrations of I-FABP in our treated patients with chronic HIV infection reflecting persistent damage to enterocytes.</s><s>Fibrotic damage to gut inductive sites, as has recently described for ileal Peyer's Patches, may additionally limit mucosal T-cell survival and expansion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>he clinical consequences of this persistent defect in the mucosal immune system are currently unknown.</s><s>An association between impaired mucosal CD4 þ T-cell reconstitution and non-specific enteritis has recently been described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>oreover, evidence for increased incidence of adenomas and intestinal malignancies in treated chronically HIV-infected patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> suggests that mucosal immune defects increase the risk of adverse outcome despite otherwise effective long-term cART.</s><s>Our findings of increased systemic immune activation and enterocyte damage indicate ongoing inflammatory disease progression in treated patients with persistent mucosal CD4 þ T-cell depletion.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the proportion of T EM cells among CD4 þ T cells normalized in chronically HIV-infected patients who had initiated cART with peripheral CD4 þ T-cell counts of 4350 per ml but not in patients whose treatment was started later.</s><s>A recent study revealed that secondary lymphoid structures and functions are preserved in early treated HIV-infected patients, which suggests that gut inductive sites still have a potent capability to induce T-cell differentiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>By contrast, insufficient restoration of inductive lymphoid tissue described for patients with later start of cART <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> may hamper T-cell differentiation and thus might be linked to the persistent lack of mucosal CD4 þ T EM cells observed in our patients with later start of cART.</s><s>Together, these observations suggest a beneficial effect of early cART on mucosal protective immunity.</s><s>1]<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> Therefore, whether or not mucosal protective immune function can be restored in chronically HIV-infected patients despite the persistent overall reduction in total mucosal CD4 þ T cells would be interesting to address in future studies.</s><s>Such functional analyses were not possible in the present study because of the limited amount of cells that can be isolated from the available human tissue specimens.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that preservation of mucosal CD4 þ T cells at both the quantitative and the differentiation levels is possible if cART is initiated during the acute phase of HIV infection.</s><s>In chronically HIV-infected persons, restoration capacity of mucosal CD4 þ T-cell counts is irreversibly compromised.</s><s>Both persistent depletion of mucosal CD4 þ T cells and enhanced levels of CD4 þ T-cell activation in the largest immunological organ are characteristic features of treated chronic HIV infection, regardless of the timing of cART initiation.</s><s>Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of the development of adjunctive immunomodulatory therapies <ref
