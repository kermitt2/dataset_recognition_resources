in that study, progesterone administration was associated with a 2.5-fold acute increase in daytime mean LH and a 2.9-fold increase in daytime LH pulse amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hutchens et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Our current results also contrast with other previous studies demonstrating acute positive feedback effects of progesterone on gonadotropin release when in the setting of estradiol pretreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chang and Jaffe 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liu and Yen 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nippoldt et al. 1987)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, these findings are consistent with the notion that estradiol priming is required for progesterone augmentation of gonadotropin release from pituitary gonadotropes.</s><s>However, in the aforementioned study in late pubertal girls, who were studied during late follicular phase without estradiol pretreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kim et al. 2018)</ref>, progesterone was associated with an approximately twofold increase in LH pulse mass.</s><s>Subjects in that study had estradiol levels similar to the levels observed in this study; and it is possible that the threshold estradiol level necessary for progesterone-related augmentation of gonadotropin release may be different depending on the developmental maturation stage.</s><s>Alternatively, there may be other cycle phase relevant factors that impact positive feedback effect of progesterone on gonadotropin release <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Taylor et al. 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, these data suggest that in regularly cycling, nonobese women without hyperandrogenism studied during the midfollicular phase, a single dose of exogenous progesterone does not alter LH pulse frequency, LH pulse amplitude, or LH pulse mass within 10 h.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 2.
