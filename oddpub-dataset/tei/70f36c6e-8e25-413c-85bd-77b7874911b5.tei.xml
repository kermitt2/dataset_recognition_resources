<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The costs and benefits of group living often depend on the spatial position of individuals within groups and the ability of individuals to occupy preferred positions.</s><s>For example, models of predation events for moving prey groups predict higher mortality risk for individuals at the periphery and front of groups.</s><s>We investigated these predictions in sardine (Sardinella aurita) schools under attack from group hunting sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) in the open ocean.</s><s>Sailfish approached sardine schools about equally often from the front and rear, but prior to attack there was a chasing period in which sardines attempted to swim away from the predator.</s><s>Consequently, all sailfish attacks were directed at the rear and peripheral positions of the school, resulting in higher predation risk for individuals at these positions.</s><s>During attacks, sailfish slash at sardines with their bill causing prey injury including scale removal and tissue damage.</s><s>Sardines injured in previous attacks were more often found in the rear half of the school than in the front half.</s><s>Moreover, injured fish had lower tail-beat frequencies and lagged behind uninjured fish.</s><s>Injuries inflicted by sailfish bills may, therefore, hinder prey swimming speed and drive spatial sorting in prey schools through passive self-assortment.</s><s>We found only partial support for the theoretical predictions from current predator -prey models, highlighting the importance of incorporating more realistic predator -prey dynamics into these models.</s></p><p><s>This article is part of the themed issue 'Physiological determinants of social behaviour in animals'.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The costs and benefits of group living are not equally distributed across spatial positions in groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Individuals at the front of moving groups often have higher foraging rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, but front positions can also incur higher energy expenditures (fish schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>; bird flocks <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>).</s><s>Predation risk has also received considerable attention in this context <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>A number of theoretical models make predictions for which spatial positions are particularly at risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Hamilton's model for stationary groups is based on the assumption that a predator strikes at the closest prey and predicts higher risk at the periphery than the centre of groups.</s><s>For moving prey groups, Bumann et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> simulations suggest an additional risk gradient from the front to the rear of the group (in addition to the periphery-to-centre gradient) because front individuals have a higher encounter probability with predators.</s><s>If both predator and prey groups are moving, the front-to-rear gradient is predicted to be weaker, albeit still present, since predators are more likely to attack the rear of the groups compared to a situation with stationary predators.</s></p><p><s>There is strong empirical support for Hamilton's original prediction of higher predation risk at peripheral compared with central positions within stationary groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>However, which prey are targeted in moving groups has received considerably less attention and the available evidence is ambiguous: Krause <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> reported that alarmed minnows (Phoxinus phoxinus) moved to central positions within shoals and concluded that these positions are perceived to be safer.</s><s>By contrast, when sea-bass (Centropristis striata) attack silverside schools (Medidia menidia), central positions received higher per capita attacks than peripheral ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Another laboratory study by Krause et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> reported that rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) attacking from a refuge, targeted creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) more often at the front than the rear of shoals.</s></p><p><s>If certain positions within groups are associated with increased risk, then individuals currently occupying those positions should attempt to move out of them.</s><s>However, there may be two reasons why individuals may not move out of these positions.</s><s>First, individuals may be unaware they are occupying these riskier positions, owing to only local knowledge of their whereabouts with respect to other near neighbours, but not the entire group.</s><s>This seems unlikely, however, for individuals in small groups, or individuals that occupy positions on the edge of groups.</s><s>Second, individuals may be unable to remove themselves from these positions owing to energetic or other movement constraints.</s><s>For example, individuals with lower aerobic capacity may not be able to maintain pace with individuals that have higher capacities without the aero-or hydrodynamic advantages that rear positions afford <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Constraints on individuals' ability to occupy particular positions, therefore, may also affect the spatial sorting of individuals within groups.</s></p><p><s>Almost all studies testing the effect of spatial positioning and predation risk in fish schools have been conducted in laboratory settings.</s><s>Although these studies have rendered important insights, they also suffer from several constraints.</s><s>In captivity, prey usually have little to no opportunity to (i) avoid approaching predators (due to space limitations), likewise they cannot (ii) form large groups (a common antipredator behaviour).</s><s>Studying predation in the wild, however, is challenging since predation events are rarely observed and often occur under conditions in which quantifying the entire capture sequence including predator approach and attack behaviour and prey responses and spatial positioning is difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here we report on attacks of group hunting sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) on schools of sardines (Sardinella aurita) in the open ocean, with the aim of quantifying predator behaviour, prey behaviour and spatial positions of prey within groups.</s><s>We used high-speed video to record sailfish -sardine interactions and image analysis of sardine schools to quantify injury levels across schools.</s><s>Different groups of sailfish were observed attacking prey schools for prolonged periods (hours), whereby both predator and prey schools were highly mobile.</s><s>During these attacks, sailfish alternate attacks on the prey school, usually not attacking simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>We used this predator -prey system to test the predictions by Bumann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> that predation risk is higher for fish (i) at the periphery than in the centre of the school and (ii) at the front compared to the rear.</s><s>The risk at different spatial positions within the school was then linked to tail-beat frequency (TBF) and positioning behaviour of sardines within the school.</s><s>Prey schools contained individuals with different injury levels from previous attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and we investigated the consequences of these injuries on spatial positioning and swimming characteristics.</s><s>We hypothesized that during chases by the sailfish, sardine schools get sorted by swimming speed with injured individuals being slower and more often found at the rear of groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Material and methods</head><p><s>Research was conducted offshore of Cancun in the Gulf of Mexico.</s><s>To find sardine schools, we boated to locations where frigate birds (Fregata magnificiens) were observed feeding at the water surface.</s><s>Under snorkel, we used Casio EX-FH100 cameras and GoPro HD HERO cameras to film the sardine schools under sailfish attack.</s></p><p><s>Over a 3-year period (2011-2013), we filmed 11 schools of sardines (estimated school size range: approx.</s><s>30 -1000 individuals) that were under attack by sailfish (estimated group size range: 1 -14).</s><s>To obtain information about the approach and attack stage of the predator-prey interaction, we recorded whether the sailfish was at the front or the rear of the sardine school (relative to the swimming direction of the school) (i) during an approach of a sailfish and (ii) immediately prior to an attack with the bill.</s><s>Sailfish are known to take turns when making their approaches and attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and an approach started when a given sailfish was replaced by another.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(a) School positions</head><p><s>We divided sardine schools into a front and rear half based on our video footage such that similar numbers of fish were present in each half, thereby making this approach independent from the school's absolute size.</s><s>Peripheral positions were defined as those that were within one sardine body length (19 cm) of the outline of the school as defined by the vertices of a convex polygon <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, a commonly used criterion for defining peripheral and central positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, we recorded how far the sailfish's bill entered into the prey school during attacks.</s></p><p><s>In addition to front versus rear and centre versus periphery we recorded in how many cases the sailfish attacked and captured a sardine that was in the last row of fish in the school.</s><s>In those cases, we counted the number of fish in the last row (whenever possible, N ¼ 16) and divided this number by the overall rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org Phil.</s><s>Trans.</s><s>R.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Sailfish attacked mostly the rear half and peripheral positions of the sardine schools.</s><s>Injured fish were more frequently observed in these riskier positions than in the safer positions at the front of the schools.</s><s>Our data on TBFs, relative positions and switching probabilities between rear and front halves (see electronic supplementary material), all suggest that reduced swimming speed of injured fish is the underlying mechanism explaining the higher proportion of injured fish in the rear of the school compared with the front.</s><s>Most of the predator -prey models that simulated predation events assumed instantaneous attacks of predators and do not distinguish between predator approach and attack <ref type="bibr">[10 -12]</ref>.</s><s>We identified these as two separate stages in the attack sequence because an approach triggered countermeasures by the prey before an attack could be initiated (see below).</s><s>In contrast with Bumann et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> model, sailfish approached the school from the front and rear about equally often.</s><s>This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that sailfish often surround their prey schools and approaches take place in quick succession.</s><s>A sailfish will approach the moment it has free access to a nearby prey when no other sailfish is with the sardine school, resulting in approaches from any direction.</s><s>The second discrepancy with Bumann et al. was that most attacks and captures occurred in the rear half of the school.</s><s>Upon a sailfish's approach, the sardines usually turned away from the sailfish as an anti-predator response and a period of chase followed.</s><s>The smaller size of the sardines (approx.</s><s>19 cm) compared with the sailfish (mean + s.d.</s><s>¼ 184.7 + 20.9 cm; range: 143.5-242.0</s><s>cm) gives sardines considerably higher relative manoeuvrability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, a factor unaccounted for by Bumann et al.</s><s>Taken together, this illustrates the importance of incorporating more realistic features, such as predator attack strategy and prey response upon predator detection into models of predator -prey dynamics.</s><s>Which prey are targeted in moving groups, therefore, likely depends on both predator attack strategy and prey response.</s></p><p><s>Several studies on interactions between marine teleost predators and their schooling prey have focused on predators that attack at high speeds, thereby rapidly moving along the periphery or right through the prey schools <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>By contrast, sailfish swim at approximately the same speed as their prey when they enter their bill into the school to launch an attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>This difference in attack strategy may explain why peripheral and rear positions were primarily targeted in our study making front and presumably also central positions safer.</s><s>We were not able to record fish numbers exactly in the periphery and centre.</s><s>However, it seems highly likely that peripheral positions are more risky given the attack strategy of the sailfish to enter at most the first third of the bill into the school.</s><s>Furthermore, we did not observe any attacks on central positions (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>More research on free-swimming predators using different attacking strategies is needed to better understand the effect of predator attack strategies on spatial gradients of predation risk in prey groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies found that individuals in rear positions in groups require a lower TBF than individuals in the front to maintain position within the group, and therefore possibly less energy for locomotion ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, we observed the highest TBF in the rear of the school.</s><s>Our results have to be interpreted in the context of the predatory -prey dynamics of this system.</s><s>On detection of an approaching sailfish, the sardine school often performed a turn and accelerated in the opposite direction.</s><s>These manoeuvres also often resulted in an elongated school shape, with fish at the back attempting to catch up with the rest of the school, and therefore temporarily using higher TBF than those at the front.</s><s>Fish at the rear thus likely prioritized predator escape above potential hydrodynamics benefits of rear positions, and increased swimming effort to reach more frontal positions.</s><s>The higher presence of injured fish at the rear of the group is likely to be the result of reduced locomotor performance, because uninjured fish had higher TBFs and gained (in terms of body lengths) on injured fish.</s></p><p><s>Differences in locomotion speed/acceleration might, however, only partly explain the spatial differences between injured and uninjured fish.</s><s>Theoretical work suggests that a set of local interaction rules can influence the spatial position of individuals within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>For example, differences in turning rates and inter-individual distances may play an important role in positioning behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>Little is known about how these factors are affected by injury.</s><s>Injuries could also hinder the ability to coordinate movements with neighbours (for example, because of longer response latencies regarding directional changes of school mates) which may not only affect an injured fish's predation risk but also information transmission within schools.</s><s>Indeed, social information is key for allowing group members to respond to threats that have not been privately detected <ref type="bibr">[34 -36]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> found that fish at the front and centre were the first to respond to aerial threats, while individuals at peripheral and rear positions responded later.</s><s>Detailed studies of schools containing different ratios of injured and uninjured fish could extend the investigation by Marras &amp; Domenici <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> on heterogeneity of individual responses within fish schools to predation stimuli.</s></p><p><s>In our system, injured fish may have a reduced ability to detect the sailfish's bill due to injury to their lateral line system.</s><s>This may reduce the likelihood of socially transmitted information, which could increase predation risk not only for themselves, but for other school members as well.</s><s>This type of research could shed light on how predator attack strategies might have evolved to disrupt collective prey defences.</s></p><p><s>In addition to injuring sardines, sailfish also used their bill to separate sardines from the school.</s><s>Isolation of prey (from the rest of the school) for which many other predators need coordinated group attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> or high-speed attacks, were instead accomplished by taps and slashes with the bill.</s><s>This is similar to the tail slaps of thresher sharks (Alopius pelagicus, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) and killer whales (Orcinus orca <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>), but can be a lot more controlled in targeting specific individuals.</s><s>How sailfish select their target and the attack strategy (e.g.</s><s>tap or slash), is currently not understood.</s><s>Future work could investigate whether sailfish actively select injured individuals as they might be easier to identify, hit and capture given that injuries may make them behaviourally and morphologically conspicuous, because of an oddity effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>Predators are known to focus on odd individuals in groups.</s><s>Interestingly, the presence of odd individuals can also reduce the overall predator confusion effect thus increasing predator risk for all group members <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>-an aspect which warrants further empirical research to understand the underlying mechanism.</s></p><p><s>Ethics.</s><s>All research was conducted in line with laws and legislation of Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Mexico.</s></p><p><s>Authors' contributions.</s><s>All authors except F.S., D.S., S.K., P.B., P.S.S. and P.Z.</s><s>collected field data.</s><s>R.H.J.M.K., J.E.H.-R.</s><s>and J.K. analysed the empirical data and performed statistical analyses.</s><s>P.Z.</s><s>performed the CT-analysis of the bills.</s><s>All authors wrote the paper.</s><s>All authors gave final approval for publication.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure1.</s><s>Micro-CT image of a 5 cm bill-tip showing (a) the dorsal surface with curved micro-teeth and (b) a cross-section with micro-teeth mainly on the sides of the bill.</s><s>Sailfish bills were scanned on a Skyscan 1172 (Brucker-CT, Kontich, Belgium) with an effective pixel size of 7 mm, an energy of 65 KeV, 3608 scans using an Al filter 500 mm thick.</s><s>Reconstruction was performed using manufacturer software (NRecon v. 1.6.9.4) and data were visualized (CTvox) and further processed using Fiji<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,331.61,312.14,195.98,149.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
