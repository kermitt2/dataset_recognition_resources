<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>T umour necrosis factor (TNF) is primarily characterized as an immunomodulatory cytokine <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Its ubiquitous expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , however, implies important functions beyond the immune system.</s><s>Our previous work in cerebral and mesenteric arteries demonstrates that smooth muscle cell-derived TNF is central to the pathological augmentation of myogenic reactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> ; it enables systemic diseases with the ability to alter microvascular autoregulation and hence, local tissue perfusion.</s><s>Accordingly, sequestering TNF with etanercept (ETN) normalizes pathologically enhanced myogenic responsiveness in cerebral arteries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s><s>In mesenteric arteries, however, the same intervention abolishes myogenic reactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , fuelling the hypothesis that TNF may serve as a constitutive regulator of myogenic signalling in certain microvascular beds.</s><s>If this observation extends to skeletal muscle resistance arteries, which prominently regulate total peripheral resistance (TPR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , TNF would emerge as a physiological regulator of mean arterial pressure (MAP).</s><s>The immediate clinical ramification would be that anti-TNF therapy must be more cautiously applied and monitored, since it could possess an unappreciated capability to modulate TPR and hence, haemodynamic parameters.</s><s>Indeed, anti-TNF therapeutics have cardiovascular side effects that are incompletely understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The biology of TNF is complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> .</s><s>TNF is expressed on the cell surface as membrane-bound form (26 kDa) that can be cleaved by extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (TNF converting enzyme; TACE) to yield a soluble form (17 kDa) (refs 11,12).</s><s>The membrane-bound (mTNF) and soluble (sTNF) forms of TNF exist as homotrimers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> that are both biologically active and partially overlap in function <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>sTNF activates welldescribed signalling pathways via two receptors (TNF receptor 1; TNFR1/TNF receptor 2; TNFR2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> .</s><s>For mTNF, both forward (via receptors) and reverse (outside-in signalling through the TNF protein) signalling pathways have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Of the options available, an mTNF signal makes intuitive sense: since myogenic signalling is perpetually active, proteolytic shedding (that cleaves mTNF to release sTNF) would rapidly deplete cellular TNF and is, therefore, unsustainable.</s></p><p><s>In this report, we show that acutely deleting the TNF gene in smooth muscle cells or scavenging TNF with the clinical therapeutic ETN reduces resistance artery myogenic responsiveness and hence, systemic blood pressure.</s><s>The inhibitory effect on myogenic responsiveness is conserved across five distinct species, including humans.</s><s>Changes in transmural pressure are transduced into intracellular signals by membrane-bound TNF (mTNF), thereby positioning mTNF as a mechanosensor; this 'reverse signal' connects to the established intracellular myogenic signalling elements extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1).</s><s>Our data, therefore, suggest that several side effects of clinical ETN therapy result from interfering with TNF's pivotal mechanosensor function and hence, microvascular tone and systemic haemodynamic.</s><s>Thus, perturbing TNF signalling can potentially elicit deleterious effects in the cardiovascular system.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Etanercept abrogates the myogenic response in heart failure.</s><s>Consistent with our hypothesis that TNF constitutively drives myogenic signalling in skeletal muscle resistance arteries, ETN abolishes myogenic responsiveness in an experimental mouse model of heart failure (HF; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,b</ref>), rather than simply normalizing it.</s><s>Unfortunately, germline TNF knockout mice (Tnf À / À mice) do not provide an appropriate genetic correlate of pharmacological TNF inhibition: the myogenic mechanisms adapt to the inherited loss of TNF activity through the recruitment of alternative cellular signalling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Thus Tnf À / À and wild-type mice have quantitatively similar myogenic responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>,d) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and systemic haemodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> under non-pathological settings.</s></p><p><s>Acute TNF deletion reduces myogenic tone and blood pressure.</s><s>To bypass the compensatory adaptations that occur following germline Tnf gene deletion, we employed a model of acute smooth muscle cell Tnf gene removal (that is, 3 days of tamoxifen treatment in SMMHC-CreER T2 mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> crossed with Tnf flox/flox mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , generating Sm-TNF-KO <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> ).</s><s>Although MAP is normal in anaesthetized Sm-TNF-KO mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), further analysis reveals a 20% reduction TPR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) and a concomitant 16% increase in cardiac output (CO, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>The latter is driven by a combination of elevated heart rate and cardiac contractility (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1 and 2</ref>) and is a typical, sympathetically mediated compensatory response to reduced TPR.</s><s>We therefore capitalized on well-characterized diurnal fluctuations (that is, activity vs rest phase) in sympathetic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and cardiac performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> to further segregate our MAP analysis.</s><s>We predicted that the capacity to compensate for reduced TPR should be minimized when sympathetic activity is lowest (that is, during the light/rest phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> ).</s><s>Indeed, telemetric measurements demonstrate that Sm-TNF-KO have reduced MAP in the light phase (20% reduction at day 4 of tamoxifen treatment, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d,e</ref>), without overt heart rate compensation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) or differences in ambulatory activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f</ref>).</s><s>In the dark/active phase, the restoration of normal MAP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2g-i</ref>) is driven by a heart rate-dependent increase in CO (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The progressive reduction of MAP in tamoxifen-treated Tnf flox/flox mice (the decline in mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressures in Sm-TNF-KO have statistically significant non-zero slopes; Po0.05 in a F-test; control slopes are statistically zero in a F-test, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2j-l</ref>) strongly associates with the progressive attenuation of myogenic responsiveness in isolated skeletal muscle resistance arteries (at days 2 and 3, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2m,n</ref>).</s><s>This positions myogenic responsiveness, a significant contributor to TPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , as the root cause for the haemodynamic changes.</s><s>The effect of silencing TNF signalling is specific to myogenic responsiveness, since receptor-dependent vasoconstriction is not altered (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>We therefore conclude that TNF is a constitutive regulator of skeletal muscle resistance artery myogenic vasoconstriction and hence, TPR and MAP.</s></p><p><s>Etanercept reduces blood pressure and myogenic signalling.</s><s>Our Sm-TNF-KO data predict that pharmacological TNF inhibition in vivo should alter systemic haemodynamic parameters and lower MAP levels in the rest/light phase.</s><s>Indeed, ETN injection (20 mg kg À 1 , intraperitoneal) induces a rapid B50 mm Hg drop in MAP in the light/rest phase, without reducing heart rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a,b</ref>); this MAP reduction also occurs in mice with HF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c,d</ref>).</s><s>To confirm that ETN induces haemodynamic changes by specifically interacting with TNF, we disrupted ETN's structure (heat denaturation) and thereby abolished its haemodynamic effect (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e,f</ref>).</s><s>Injections of equal volumes of saline do not affect either MAP or heart rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3g-l</ref>).</s></p><p><s>ETN's systemic effect on MAP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) strongly correlates with altered microvascular reactivity: in vitro, ETN attenuates myogenic vasoconstriction in cremaster arteries isolated from naı ¨ve mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a,b</ref>).</s><s>The effect is (i) dose-dependent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4c</ref>), (ii) specifically inhibits myogenic responsiveness (that is, ETN does not affect general vasoconstriction to phenylephrine, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d</ref>), (iii) ineffective in arteries from Tnf À / À mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4e,f</ref>) and (iv) prevented by heat denaturing the ETN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4g,h</ref>).</s><s>Further, ETN does not alter artery distensibility (% distension control: 10.4±0.6 vs 10 mg ml À 1 ETN: 10.4±0.7,</s><s>P ¼ nonsignificant in a paired Student's t-test, n ¼ 5 arteries), suggesting that TNF scavenging does not affect the serial elastic properties of the microvascular wall.</s></p><p><s>ETN disrupts several established cellular/molecular events that drive myogenic vasoconstriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Specifically, increasing transmural pressure stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4i</ref>;
