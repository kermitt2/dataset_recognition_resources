<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), relapse represents the most common reason for treatment failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In this situation, no standard therapy is defined, but treatment options generally aim to reduce disease burden and to enforce a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect.</s><s>Commonly employed options are chemotherapy as well as cellular-based approaches, such as donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) or second transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Still, long-term survival is scarcely observed, as indicated by 2-year survival rates hardly exceeding 20%.</s><s>In addition, because of accompanying toxicities, the use of intensive chemotherapy and second transplantation are limited to medically fit patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Considering its efficacy and moderate toxicity profile in older patients with AML and MDS not eligible for allo-HSCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine (Aza) has also been tested for treatment of relapse after allo-HSCT.</s><s>So far, 2 prospective studies and some small retrospective series covering a total of 152 patients demonstrated feasibility and clinical efficacy of Aza as salvage therapy for relapse after allo-HSCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>As a consequence, Aza has become a viable treatment alternative in this setting.</s><s>Still, because of the heterogeneity and limited number of patients reported so far, predictive factors for response and long-term survival are unknown.</s><s>This prompted us to perform a retrospective analysis of 154 patients with relapse of AML or MDS after allo-HSCT who were treated with Aza and were scheduled for DLI at 12 German transplantation centers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>Between 2005 and 2013, 66 patients were treated with Aza and envisaged DLI for relapse of AML or MDS after allo-HSCT at the University Hospital Duesseldorf.</s><s>Their data were analyzed together with an additional 88 patients treated with Aza and planned DLI at 11 transplantation centers participating in the German Cooperative Transplant Study Group.</s><s>Data from the latter patients were obtained by a retrospective survey aiming to collect all patients treated at the participating centers within this interval.</s><s>In addition, demographic data and basic transplantation information were retrieved from European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Med-A form, and a specific questionnaire asking for further details regarding relapse and treatment was sent to participating centers.</s><s>Physicians' review of data and personal requests at respective centers helped to improve data quality.</s><s>Thirty patients were treated within a prospective phase II trial (NCT-00795548) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Their results and results of an additional set of 22 patients had been published previously but were updated for this analysis <ref type="bibr">[8-9-14]</ref>.</s><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf (approval number 4138) and written informed consent was obtained from patients who were alive at the time of data collection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions and Response Criteria</head><p><s>Hematologic relapse was defined as bone marrow (BM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> blasts !5%, appearance of blasts in peripheral blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, reappearance of dysplastic features fulfilling the diagnosis criteria for MDS and/or extramedullary disease manifestation.</s><s>Molecular relapse was defined as decrease of donor chimerism (DC) 95% assessed by the individual method of the respective center and/or reoccurrence of patient-specific disease markers, eg, chromosomal aberrations or molecular alterations, without evidence of hematologic relapse.</s></p><p><s>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cytogenetics, remission status before allo-HSCT, and conditioning intensity were defined as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, for evaluation after relapse, no complete hematologic reconstitution was required for definition of complete remission (CR), as factors other than the underlying disease and treatment for GVHD or viral infections might contribute to cytopenias.</s><s>Still, for diagnosis of CR, restoration of complete DC and, if available, negativity of disease-specific markers were required.</s><s>Outside the prospective trial, there was no planned response monitoring consisting of marrow evaluation, molecular testing, and chimerism analysis, but they were performed according to the individual center policy.</s><s>Overall survival (OS) was defined as interval from start of Aza treatment until death or last follow-up.</s><s>Patients who received a second allo-HSCT were censored at that date.</s><s>Time to response was calculated from start of Aza treatment until detection of best response, whereas duration of response was defined as time from best response until loss of response and death.</s><s>Patients who were alive with ongoing remission were censored at last follow-up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p><s>Continuous variables were summarized using median (range), whereas frequency tables were used for categorical variables.</s><s>Time-to-event curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test was employed for univariate comparisons.</s><s>For univariate comparison cross tabulation, Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test were used.</s><s>Factors influencing outcome or response in univariate analysis with a P value &lt;.10 were included into multivariate analysis.</s><s>For OS, a Cox regression model was used with a step-wise backward procedure deleting factors in the final model above the cut-off significance level of .05.</s><s>For variables associated with achievement of CR, a multinominal logistic regression analysis was performed.</s><s>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc.</s><s>Chicago, IL).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this retrospective multicenter study, we analyzed data of 154 patients with AML or MDS who were treated with Aza and planned DLI for relapse after allo-HSCT.</s><s>This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the largest cohort of patients reported so far.</s><s>In addition, Aza with planned DLI was the first intervention for relapse in the great majority of these patients (93%).</s><s>Both enabled us to provide sufficient data on response and survival and to compare them with available data from the literature on the use of other treatment strategies for relapse after allo-HSCT.</s><s>Furthermore, the number of patients and the quality of data provided by respective centers allowed us to identify patients who may benefit most from the combination of Aza and DLI.</s></p><p><s>Remission induction in patients relapsing after allo-HSCT is essentially associated with survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However, remission rates after intensive chemotherapy range between only 17% and 32% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, it has to be taken into account that intensive chemotherapy requires inpatient treatment and can only be applied to a selected group of medically fit patients because of associated toxicities.</s><s>The CR rate after Aza and DLI in our analysis was 29%, with multivariate analysis identifying patients with molecular relapse and those with diagnosis of MDS to have the highest likelihood of response.</s><s>This response rate confirms results from 2 prospective studies, as well as retrospective series reporting on the use of varying schedules of Aza with or without DLI <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref

target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, it is also worth noting that the combination of Aza and DLI was mainly given on an outpatient basis despite a rather high median patients' age and a relevant proportion of 32 patients (21%) relapsing within the first 100 days.</s><s>Whereas these findings reflect the good tolerability of Aza, its direct antileukemic effect is reflected by the 11 patients who achieved CR either before first DLI or without receiving any DLI.</s><s>Of note, in line with previous case reports, Aza was also able to induce CR in 3 of 6 patients with extramedullary relapse including 1 patient treated by Aza alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, with regard to response and tolerability, our results seem to compare at least very well with results observed after intensive chemotherapy.</s></p><p><s>Regardless of the type of salvage therapy, Schmid et al. recently demonstrated that the use of donor cells is required to achieve long-term survival in patients with CR <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Two thirds of the patients in our analysis received at least 1 DLI.</s><s>In the CR group, even more patients received DLI.</s><s>In addition, CR was obtained after the first DLI in 78% of patients, suggesting a pronounced cell-induced immune reaction.</s><s>Though the limited number does not allow definitive conclusions, the finding that all 3 CR patients who did not receive DLI relapsed within 7 months also argues in favor for donor cellebased consolidation.</s><s>In accordance with this idea, remissions induced by Aza and DLI in our analysis were ongoing for a median period of 20 months in 66% of patients and lasted for a median of 13 months in those who finally relapsed again.</s><s>In contrast, in the study of Platzbecker et al., even though it was given pre-emptively, Aza alone could prevent hematologic relapse only in a minority of patients, probably related to the fact that DLI were not part of the protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Still, this should be interpreted with caution, as the opportunity to give DLI and time required to develop a GVL effect might also reflect a less aggressive disease.</s></p><p><s>Although the data presented here strongly support the use of DLI in combination with Aza to enhance a GVL reaction, the potentially detrimental and life-threatening induction GVHD by DLI has to be considered.</s><s>In a large registry-based survey on the use of DLI, frequency of aGVHD and cGVHD were 43% and 46%, respectively, with 80% suffering from grade II to IV aGVHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>After Aza and DLI, we observed an aGVHD rate of 23%, consisting mostly of grade I and II disease, and a cGVHD rate of 27%, being mostly limited disease.</s><s>This rather low incidence and mild presentation of GVHD, which also appeared when considering only patients who had received DLI (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S4</ref>), complements the favorable toxicity profile of the combination of Aza and DLI, underlining its role as clinically relevant treatment alternative.</s><s>This obvious mitigation of DLI-associated GVHD, without hampering the GVL effect, might be related to an Aza-induced expansion of regulatory T cells, as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite the promising CR rate of 29%, with two thirds of the patients remaining in long-term remission without any additional therapy, one third of patients, even with the use of DLI relapsed again and the majority of those patients rapidly died.</s><s>This suggests that Aza together with DLI was indeed able to induce morphological and even molecular remissions, but probably failed to eliminate so-called (pre-) leukemic stem/progenitor cells.</s><s>It has already been demonstrated that this cell population persists in clinical remission after treatment with Aza in the nontransplantation setting and after chemotherapy and represents a cellular reservoir with potential to give rise to relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Serial monitoring of this cell population during treatment with Aza and DLI might, therefore, be of interest to identify patients requiring treatment adaption.</s></p><p><s>In our study, clinical responses after Aza and DLI translated into a 2-year OS rate of 29%.</s><s>This outcome compares well with survival rates observed after other treatment options, such as intensive chemotherapy, DLI, and/or second transplantation.</s><s>Schmid et al. recently reported a 2-year OS rate of 13.9% in 776 patients with AML relapse after allo-HSCT receiving chemotherapy and/or DLI and second transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>After DLI, a 2-year OS rate of 21% was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, whereas in another recent analysis focusing on second transplantation including 132 patients with AML, the 2-year OS was 25%, even when using an alternative second donor <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The median age in the latter reports on DLI and second transplantation was 39 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and 36.5 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, respectively, thereby remarkably lower than median age of 55 years in our analysis as well as median age of 55.7 years in the AML cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>On the 1 hand, this supports once again the favorable balance between efficacy and tolerability of Aza and DLI.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, it also points out that a direct comparison between these treatment strategies is difficult because of different patient characteristics and a potential selection bias, as retrospective studies on DLI and second transplantation only include patients surviving until the intervention.</s></p><p><s>By multivariate model, we identified risk factors for OS, which could predict the individual patient's prognosis from start of treatment with Aza and DLI.</s><s>In particular, diagnosis of MDS correlated with a better outcome, reflecting the primary indication in the nontransplantation setting.</s><s>In contrast, the 2-year OS rate of AML patients was lower (26%), but it was still at least comparable with outcome after intensive chemotherapy or second transplantation.</s><s>Hence, AML patients can also be rescued by Aza and DLI, particularly when treated early.</s><s>The latter aspect was indicated by a clear association between disease burden in terms of relapse type (eg, molecular only) as well as BM blast count and OS, which might also reflect relapse kinetics.</s><s>This correlation between blast count and survival is in accordance with recent data <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and also applied when other cut-off points (&lt;10%, 10% to 20%, &gt;20% BM blast count) were employed (Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).</s><s>Hence, this finding emphasizes the need for stringent disease monitoring and early intervention.</s><s>Because prospective studies comparing treatment options for relapse after allo-HSCT will not be available in the near future, results from our analysis might help clinicians to identify patients with a chance for long-term remission.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, based on its efficacy and low GVHD rate, the combination of Aza and DLI is a valuable treatment alternative for patients relapsing after allo-HSCT, in particular those with MDS or AML with low disease burden.</s></p></div>
