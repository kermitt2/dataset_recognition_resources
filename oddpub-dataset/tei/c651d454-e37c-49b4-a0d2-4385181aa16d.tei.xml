and growing interest for the creation of model systems to study human disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>For example, iPSCs can be generated from patient-derived cells and differentiated down a number of lineages, including ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm, for use in fundamental biological studies and development of disease models for drug screening. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>In these applications, iPSCs typically have been cultured on top of either an inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layer or a thin layer of Matrigel coated on tissue culture treated plastic (TCP). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>While useful, these culture systems have inherent batch-to-batch variability, where Matrigel is harvested from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma, a tumor enriched in extracellular matrix proteins found in basement membrane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>urther, the planar nature of these culture systems polarizes cells in the z-direction, unlike the multidimensional in vivo environment in which cells are surrounded by their microenvironment and related cues (e.g., cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions).</s><s>To reduce culture variability, TCP coated with whole proteins (i.e., collagen-IV, laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin) or recombinant protein isoforms of them has been shown to promote stem cell pluripotency, self-renewal, and differentiation for two-dimensional (2D) culture; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> however, three-dimensional (3D) culture has been limited.</s><s>Well-defined materials with tunable properties relevant for 3D culture of cells provide opportunities to probe which factors may play a role in iPSC viability and differentiation while providing a multidimensional environment.</s></p><p><s>Several synthetic matrices have been utilized for the culture and expansion of pluripotent stem cells in three dimensions.</s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> For example, a thermoreversible hydrogel (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-poly(ethylene glycol), PNIPAAm-PEG) was designed for 3D culture and long-term expansion (~ 10 27 -fold over 280 days) of a variety of multipotent and pluripotent stem cells broadly for biomedical applications, including neural differentiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Additionally, in this seminal study by Lei et  al., inclusion of a ROCK inhibitor in the culture medium, which prevents apoptosis of dissociated stem cells, was identified as important for stem cell expansion within these polymer networks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Other investigations have evaluated the effect of cell-matrix and cell-cell properties on ESC proliferation and self-renewal within hydrogel-based matrices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>or example, 3D hydrogel microarrays formed with Michael-type thiol-ene reactions have been used for high-throughput screening of the effects of multiple extracellular factors on ESC proliferation and self-renewal: soluble factors (leukemia inhibitory factor), degradability of the hydrogel, and low matrix modulus were found to be most influential.</s><s>In a complementary study, integrin-binding peptides were presented within a similar system to evaluate their influence on self-renewal and stemness of ESCs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>ile a number of 3D culture studies have examined how cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions influence pluripotency and self-renewal, another important property of pluripotent cells is their potential to differentiate down a variety of lineages for the generation of progenitor and terminally-differentiated cell subtypes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>For example, iPSCs can be generated from cells derived from patients for studies of both regeneration and disease, from mechanistic investigations to drug screening, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> where many are particularly interested in iPSC differentiation into neural subtypes for studying neurodegenerative diseases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>However, to date, few studies in well-defined synthetic matrices have focused on the encapsulation and subsequent differentiation of iPSCs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> which could prove useful in such disease modeling applications.</s><s>Progenitor cells that were derived from iPSCs have been encapsulated and cultured in hydrogels, where conditions have been optimized for progenitor cell growth and differentiation.</s><s>For example, biomimetic peptides have been incorporated within an acrylated hyaluronic-acid hydrogel, formed by Michael-type addition with cysteine-functionalized peptides, where an optimized peptide cocktail enhanced neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from iPSCs in 3D culture.</s><s>25   Despite these advances, many researchers utilize Matrigel for the culture of pluripotent stem cells, partly owing to the challenge of maintaining iPSC viability in many synthetic culture systems while also permitting complex downstream differentiation processes.</s><s>This harvested material contains a mixture of both large and small bioactive proteins, including laminin, collagen IV, and entactin with some batch-to-batch variation, and has been shown to bind key integrins on iPSCs, including α 5 , α 6 , α v , β 1 , and β 5 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>Additionally, ROCK inhibition has been observed to increase the expression of these integrins (α v , α 6 , β 1 ) during iPSC culture on Matrigel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>We hypothesized that incorporation of ligands that bind to integrins key for iPSC adhesion to and survival on Matrigel within a well-defined synthetic biomaterial would permit iPSC culture, growth, and differentiation in three dimensions.</s></p><p><s>To test this, we sought to establish a 3D culture platform utilizing light-mediated chemistries for probing key cues for maintaining iPSC viability and enabling their differentiation.</s><s>Light initiated 'click' chemistries allow for rapid, triggered formation of hydrogels, enabling the encapsulation of single cells, and inclusion of specific biochemical cues often independent of the mechanical properties of the network. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> Such materials have been used for the encapsulation and culture of multipotent or iPSC-derived cells.</s><s>For example, McKinnon and co-workers have used photo-initiated hydrogels for controlled encapsulation of ES-derived motor neurons (ESMNs) and, in a follow up study, demonstrated the effect of controlled photo-degradation for the formation of channels to promote axon extension and connectivity, including with other cell types. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>However, to date, there are few demonstrations of the use of light-mediated chemistries with pluripotent cells.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we aimed to establish an approach for the encapsulation and culture of iPSCs within photoinitiated PEG-peptide-based synthetic matrices and to utilize this system to test hypotheses about key cell-matrix interactions for both maintaining iPSC viability and permitting their differentiation.</s><s>Specifically, we designed poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels formed by light-triggered thiol-ene 'click' chemistry with specific receptorbinding peptides for investigating their influence on iPSC viability and differentiation.</s><s>We encapsulated a single-cell suspension of iPSCs and tested the effect of ROCK inhibition and integrin binding on iPSC viability in a cell-degradable hydrogel initially presenting RGDS, which is known to bind a number of integrins for promoting cell adhesion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s>We then selected a range of motifs inspired by iPSC binding to Matrigel, including laminin-derived IKVAV and YIGSR, α 5 β 1 -binding PHSRNG 10 RGDS, and α v β 5 -binding KKQRFRHRNRKG, and assessed their effect on iPSC viability and proliferation in 3D culture.</s><s>In these studies, both ROCK inhibition and activation of β 1 integrin were observed to be key for iPSC viability in 3D culture within these synthetic matrices.</s><s>Lastly, we examined if these environments were not only permissive to iPSC viability and growth but also their pluripotency and subsequent differentiation in the presence of appropriate soluble factors.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref></s></p></div>
