<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Process of Categorization and the Level of Inclusiveness</head><p><s>There is ample research on the development of object categorization during infancy and early childhood, when children continue to encounter new objects and situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bornstein, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rakison and Oakes, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>In the literature, two main views on categorization have emerged.</s><s>The first view focuses on the process of categorization, and stresses the fact that objects can be categorized in different ways.</s><s>The main finding is that people categorize the same entities differently depending on instructions, contexts, and task demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schyns and Rodet, 1997)</ref>.</s><s>Even young children change categorization strategies depending on their familiarity with the objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Oakes et al., 1996)</ref>, the distribution of exemplars <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bornstein et al., 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hund and Plumert, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Oakes and Ribar, 2005)</ref>, or the properties of the category entities (whether they are prototype exemplars or not, whether the exemplars are presented singly or in pairs) in their task environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bauer et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Oakes et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Younger and Furrer, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mareschal and Tan, 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The second view, which we focus on in this study, centers on the structure of the objects to be categorized, often referred to as the level of inclusiveness at which the objects are presented.</s><s>The level of inclusiveness reflects the hierarchical taxonomy of the objects, consisting of nested sets into which objects are organized <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berlin et al., 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Berlin et al., , 1974;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Atran, 1990)</ref>.</s><s>For example, the category "animals" includes, among others, dogs, fishes and birds.</s><s>The category "dogs" in turn includes, among others, Retrievers, Dalmatians, and Collies.</s><s>In this taxonomy, the category "animals" is at a higher level of inclusiveness than the category "dogs, " which, in turn, is at a higher level of inclusiveness than the category "Retrievers, " which in turn includes different subcategories, such as Golden Retrievers or English Setters.</s><s>In infant, child, and adult cognitive studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Rosch, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Mervis and Rosch, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Herwig, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Liu et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Murphy, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ellis and Oakes, 2006)</ref> the different levels of inclusiveness have been referred to as superordinate (e.g., "animals"), basic (e.g., "dogs"), and subordinate level (e.g., "Retriever").</s><s>In this study we will be following this definition, although we recognize that the level of inclusiveness of a category cannot be defined in absolute terms, and that it depends, for example, on a person's level of expertise and cultural background <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dougherty, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Tanaka and Taylor, 1991;</ref><ref

ethnobiologists, this level occupies a psychologically privileged taxonomic position because it captures categories widely found in nature and affords the requirements for categorization, reasoning,

in cognitive psychology has similarly shown that objects presented at the basic level are the first named and understood by children because they mirror natural kinds and the organization of our knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rosch, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Mervis, 1987)</ref> and emphasize information about the basic structures, functions, and perceptual

on the precedence of basic-level words and basiclevel categories . . .</s><s>children can categorize and label objects at the basic level . . .</s><s>long before they can do so at other levels" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Liu et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>For example, Rosch and colleagues found that preschoolers matched adults in classifying objects into basiclevel categories such as shoes, chairs, and cars but not into superordinate categories such as clothes, furniture, or vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rosch et al., 1976)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Twenty Questions Game and the Present Studies</head><p><s>Previous research investigating children's information search has used versions of the Twenty Questions game.</s><s>In its experimental version, participants are presented with a fixed number of alternatives and their task is to identify the target alternative by asking as few questions as possible.</s><s>Only yes/no questions are allowed.</s><s>This paradigm has been used to study children's question-asking strategies both in causal learning tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ruggeri and Lombrozo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">submitted)</ref>, where participants have to identify the cause of an observed event, and in sequential binary categorization tasks, either generating the questions from scratch <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mosher and Hornsby, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Denney and Denney, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Herwig, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chouinard, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Legare et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ruggeri et al., 2015)</ref> or selecting them from a list of provided alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nelson et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Overall, experimental results show that the ability to ask effective questions undergoes a large developmental change from age 4 to 10. Specifically, younger children tend to ask questions concerning particular objects (i.e., so-called hypothesis-scanning questions, such as "Is it a dog?"), whereas older children and adults tend to ask questions about object features that help rule out more than one object at a time (i.e., so-called constraintseeking questions, such as "Does the animal fly?").</s><s>The observed transitions are explained as a shift from a perceptual focus on individual stimuli and objects to a tendency to recognize objectgeneral features that can be used to group and cluster similar objects into categories (e.g., flying animals vs. nonflying animals) and, by this, to guide categorization strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mosher and Hornsby, 1966)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous work have demonstrated that the Twenty Questions game can provide a rich source of data that reflects developmental changes in children's strategies for inquiry.</s><s>Moreover, although the Twenty Questions game may appear quite artificial, the problem of sequential binary information search is a general one, encountered throughout the lifespan.</s><s>For instance, a similar process can be used for medical diagnoses: In emergency medicine, resident physicians learn to check for the presence or absence of certain physiological changes to rule out lethal conditions that can be associated with a particular complaint (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Green and Mehr, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hamilton et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Also, various real world decision-making, categorization, and causal inference tasks have been modeled with fast and frugal trees that involve sequential, binary branching (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berretty et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Martignon et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, studying children's performance on a 20questions task is a good compromise between experimental tractability and real-world generalizability.</s></p><p><s>Taking <ref type="bibr">Rosch et al.'s (1976)</ref> results into account, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Herwig (1982)</ref> tested preschoolers, first, second, and fifth graders on the Twenty Questions game.</s><s>Herwig hypothesized that performance would be best when children are given objects represented at the subordinate level <ref type="bibr">(e.g., sportscar, van, raincoat, jacket)</ref> because they are familiar with features that differentiate the basic-level categories to which those objects belong (e.g., cars and coats).</s><s>These higher order features are necessary to ask effective questions in the Twenty Questions game.</s><s>When given objects represented at the basic level (e.g., car and coat), they should perform worse because children are less familiar with features that differentiate between superordinate categories to which those objects belong (e.g., vehicles and clothes).</s><s>Indeed, children's performance in the Twenty Questions game improved when given subordinate-level objects, but only if they had the chance to group the objects into categories before starting the game.</s><s>Without training, in contrast, children's performance was best when objects were represented at the basic level.</s><s>This suggests that basic-level objects help children generate higher order features that lead them to ask effective questions in the Twenty Questions game, without requiring prior training.</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we sought to replicate, extend and explain the facilitating effect of basic-level objects on categorization performance in a sequential binary categorization task.</s><s>In particular, we investigated the effect of the level of inclusiveness (basic-level vs. subordinate-level) on the ability to ask effective questions in a computerized version of the Twenty Questions game (Study 1).</s><s>We further attempted to disentangle the effect of the level of inclusiveness on two crucial abilities necessary to ask effective questions: In Study 2, we investigate participants' abilities to generate features useful for categorization, that is, features ruling out classes of objects (e.g., Does it have four legs?) rather than individual objects (e.g., Is it a dog?).</s><s>In Study 3, we investigated participants' abilities to select the most efficient among a given set of questions.</s></p><p><s>To assess the generality of our findings, we tested children with different stimuli in two domains (animals and professions) and elaborated the developmental trend in how 7-yearolds generate, select and use object-differentiating features as compared to 10-year-olds and adults.</s><s>These age ranges were motivated by prior research suggesting a developmental shift in children's strategies for inquiry between the ages of 7 and 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mosher and Hornsby, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ruggeri and Lombrozo, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">submitted)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Effect of Domain</head><p><s>We chose the animals and the professions domains because children and adults likely differ in how familiar they are with animals and professions.</s><s>Children, in contrast to adults, naturally focus on perceptual features of objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Wartella, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Flavell, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">John and Sujan, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Springer, 2001)</ref>, and animals' morphological features are usually learned in school and often sufficient to differentiate between them.</s><s>Differences among professions, on the other hand, are less perceptual in nature and are mainly learned later in life.</s><s>Thus, with respect to object domains, we expected a decline in performance for children asked to categorize professions, but not for adults.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>We tested 53 7-year-old children (15 females, M age = 7.1 years; SD = 0.8), 61 10-year-old children (30 females, M age = 9.5 years; SD = 0.5), and 94 adults (36 females, M age = 27.9 years; SD = 1.8).</s><s>Two additional 7-year-old children were excluded from the analyses because they did not know one or more of the objects used in the study.</s><s>All children were recruited from the Istituto Sacro Cuore primary school in Livorno, Italy.</s><s>Adult participants were recruited from the University of Pisa, Italy.</s><s>The experimental procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, and all the parents of the children involved, as well as the teachers and the schools' Institutional Review Board, were informed and consented (in written form) to let the children participate prior to data collection.</s><s>Children participants were asked to give their assent to participate.</s><s>Adult participants also consented to participate in written form.</s><s>All participants were free to withdraw from the experiment at any time.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>We tested 30 seven-year-old children (13 females, M age = 7.7 years; SD = 0.5), 30 ten-year-old children (14 females, M age = 9.8 years; SD = 0.6), and 28 adults (12 females, M age = 27.5 years; SD = 0.2).</s><s>All children were recruited from the Fondazione Sacro Cuore primary school in Livorno, Italy.</s><s>Adult participants were recruited from the University of Pisa, Italy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Procedure</head><p><s>Participants were presented with a computerized version of the Twenty Question game similar to the one used in Study 1 and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the basic-level or subordinate-level condition.</s><s>They played the same experimental condition twice, once with objects from the animal domain and once with objects from the profession domain (see Appendix 1 in Supplementary Material).</s><s>The order in which the domains were presented was randomized.</s><s>Participants could ask only three questions for each game: Across three rounds, they could select and click from among a set of six options displayed as buttons on the screen.</s><s>The six options always included two constraintseeking questions (e.g., "Does it live in the water?")-one with higher and one with lower information gain, when possibletwo pseudoconstraint-seeking questions (e.g., "Is it a flat kind of fish?"), and two hypothesis-scanning questions (e.g., "Is it the sole?").</s><s>Upon selection of a question, the computer automatically darkened the buttons corresponding to the objects the question had ruled out.</s></p><p><s>After participants had asked the third question, they had to guess the object the computer had randomly chosen by selecting one of the remaining objects.</s><s>Children who guessed the right object in both games received a box of colored pencils.</s><s>Adults who guessed both objects were entered in a lottery the winner of which was awarded a 20-Euro Amazon gift card.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We ran a repeated-measures ANOVA with the order of the questions (i.e., whether a question was asked in the first, second, or third round) and domain as within-subject factors, and inclusiveness and age group as between-subjects variables for all dependent measures.</s><s>As in Study 2, when presenting the results for the type of questions selected, we report only the analysis of the proportion of constraint-seeking questions, for the sake of brevity.</s><s>All main effects and interactions were tested but we report only significant effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information Gain</head><p><s>We found no effect of the order of questions (p = 0.13) or inclusiveness (p = 0.55) but a main effect of age group, F (2, 82) = 18.6, p &lt; 0.001, Œ∑ 2 = 0.31.</s><s>A Bonferroni posthoc analysis showed that adults selected questions with higher information gain (M adults = 0.9; SD = 0.1) than older children (M older_children = 0.7; SD = 0.2, p = 0.003), who selected questions with higher information gain than younger children (M younger_children = 0.6; SD = 0.2, p = 0.021).</s></p><p><s>The analysis also showed a main effect of domain, F (1, 82) = 4.5, p = 0.037, Œ∑ 2 = 0.05.</s><s>Participants selected questions with higher information gain in the animals domain (M animals = 0.79, SD = 0.02) than in the professions domain (M professions = 0.75, SD = 0.02).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Question Type</head><p><s>With the proportion of constraint-seeking questions as dependent variable, the analysis showed no effect of domain (p = 0.08), order of questions (p = 0.54), or inclusiveness (p = 0.58), but a main effect of age group, F (2, 82) = 19.7,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001, Œ∑ 2 = 0.32.</s><s>Bonferroni post-hoc analyses showed that adults selected a higher proportion of constraint-seeking questions (94%; SD = 14) than older children (69%; SD = 30; p = 0.002), who in turn selected a higher proportion of constraint-seeking questions than younger children (48%; SD = 36; p = 0.007).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of Study 3</head><p><s>The effect of object inclusiveness did not emerge in Study 3. In other words, domain and inclusiveness do not help or hinder participants in identifying and selecting more effective questions from a given set.</s><s>This suggests that the facilitating effect of basiclevel objects on categorization performance and the hindering effect of subordinate-level objects (Study 1) may have emerged only because of the types of features they trigger (Study 2).</s><s>However, Study 3 also showed that to some extent all age groups were able to select the more effective constraint-seeking questions from a set of differentially effective questions.</s><s>Whereas a random pick would have resulted in constraint-seeking questions in only about one third of the cases, even younger children picked the more effective question about 50% of the time.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p><s>In this paper we replicated and extended the investigation of the facilitating effect of basic-level objects on the ability to ask effective questions in a sequential binary categorization task (Study 1).</s><s>Moreover, we aimed at providing a tentative explanation for this effect across different developmental stages, by disentangling the effect of the level of inclusiveness on the ability to generate features useful for categorization (Study 2), and on the ability to select the most efficient among a given set of questions addressing different categorization features (Study 3).</s><s>To do so, we compared the effect of two different levels of object inclusiveness (basic-level and subordinate) in two object domains (animals and professions) on both formal quantitative and content-based qualitative measures of categorization performance of 7-and 10-year-olds, as well as adults.</s></p><p><s>Our experiments showed that the level of inclusiveness impacts the kinds of object-differentiating features participants think about (object-general vs. object-specific features) when reasoning about the objects.</s><s>To differentiate animals/professions defined at the subordinate level from other animals/professions, participants in Study 1 and 2 could have referred to the object-general features that pertained to these objects and were generated by participants in the basic-level conditions.</s><s>However, participants rarely considered object-general features when presented with subordinate-level objects.</s><s>The fact that object-general features are more readily available in the basiclevel condition made it more likely that participants ask effective categorization questions that help rule out more than one object at a time.</s><s>In Study 3, we showed that the level of inclusiveness does not impact participants' ability to identify the most efficient from a set of given questions.</s><s>This suggests that the level of inclusiveness at which objects are presented impact categorization performance mainly because of the kinds of features they trigger.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developmental Implications</head><p><s>Our studies allow us to suggest a developmental trajectory of sequential binary categorization abilities.</s><s>The performance pattern of our studies both confirmed and extended previous findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Van Horn and Bartz, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Denney and Denney, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Siegler, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Herwig, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ruggeri and Lombrozo, submitted)</ref>.</s><s>First, although all age groups seemed to benefit from basic-level objects (Studies 1 and 2), younger children were clearly limited by a lack of knowledge of a sufficient number of object-differentiating features (e.g., they "invented" contrasting features in Study 2).</s><s>As in previous studies, Study 1 also showed that younger children needed more questions to reach the solution than older children and adults, and they asked fewer constraint-seeking questions with lower information gain than older children, who in turn asked fewer constraint-seeking questions than adults.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, categorization performance improved across all age groups when participants were asked to choose from a set of differentially effective questions (Study 3).</s><s>Thus, despite clear developmental differences, 7-and 10-year-olds seem to know what an effective categorization question looks like.</s><s>Whereas younger children are mainly limited by their ability to generate enough object-differentiating features, older children are similar to adults in their ability to generate object-differentiating features but are still limited in their ability to generate and select those that are most effective for categorization (Studies 1 and 3).</s><s>The developmental trajectory of these abilities should be taken in account when designing experiments where children have to generate questions or select among given questions.</s></p><p><s>In sum, the basic level of inclusiveness can help people of all ages to come up more readily with good categorization questions.</s><s>However, with experience (e.g., as for adults) categorization performance remains robust independently of the level of inclusiveness and domain of the objects to be categorized.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical Implications</head><p><s>Our findings suggest that "cognitive algorithms. . .</s><s>cannot be divorced from the information on which they operate and how that information is presented" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gigerenzer and Hoffrage, 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Categorization is one of the most fundamental reasoning skills, deeply involved in decision-making, causal learning and probabilistic inferences.</s><s>Our results can be made useful for teaching binary categorization (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Martignon and Krauss, 2009)</ref> and to train categorization skills (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Petursdottir et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>We suggest, based on our studies, that categorization problems should be set up using basic-level objects, because they tend to result in the most robust performance patterns across domains and age groups.</s><s>Considering the strong domain differences, it is also crucial to start teaching categorization skills in commonly known domains.</s><s>More generally, our studies point to an effective way to teach categorization based on the level of inclusiveness, that is, based on teaching people how to translate specificlevel into basic-level descriptions and features rather than on teaching effective categorization strategies alone.</s><s>In light of our results concerning how categorization can be improved without instruction, tutoring systems that enhance the idea of basic level of inclusiveness with instruction, explanation of strategies, and visual aids may prove most effective.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | Number of questions needed to reach the solution, displayed by domain (animals, professions) and condition (basic level, subordinate level).</s><s>Error bars indicate one SEM in each direction.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,123.14,346.63,348.72,331.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
