<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a syndrome characterized by acute respiratory distress within 6 hours following blood transfusions and is presently the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Apart from supportive measures (oxygen and ventilation), no therapy currently exists for TRALI.</s><s>A significant number of TRALI cases are related to the presence of HLA-or human neutrophil antigen-specific antibodies in the donor blood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>A 2-hit model has been hypothesized to underlie antibody-mediated TRALI, where the first hit comprises patient-predisposing factors such as inflammation and the second hit is due to donor antibodies in the transfused blood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Other first-hit patient risk factors for TRALI include chronic alcohol abuse, liver surgery, shock, higher peak airway pressure while undergoing mechanical ventilation, smoking, and positive intravascular fluid balance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Systemic inflammation is characterized by elevated recipient interleukin-6 (IL-6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and IL-8 levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and appears to be a major risk factor for TRALI induction.</s><s>More specifically, the acute phase protein C-reactive protein, a general biomarker for acute infection and inflammation, was recently shown to synergistically act with 34-1-2s to enhance antibody-mediated TRALI in otherwise TRALI-resistant mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>he lung injury of TRALI is considered part of the spectrum of acute respiratory distress syndrome, although the mechanisms responsible for TRALI are distinct from other lung injury states such as those associated with sepsis or aspiration-induced lung injury. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The pathogenesis of antibody-mediated TRALI, however, is still poorly understood, although animal models have added to our understanding of some of the recipient mechanisms of TRALI induction, for example using a mouse-model based on injection of the anti-major histocompatibility complex (anti-MHC) class I antibody 34-1-2s.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), for instance, were shown to be directly stimulated by 34-1-2s enabling reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and subsequent damage to the pulmonary endothelium.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> Of interest, wild-type (WT) BALB/c mice are generally resistant to 34-1-2s antibody-mediated TRALI, whereas mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) are hypersensitive to the antibody's effects.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> The relative protection of BALB/c against antibody-mediated TRALI was shown to be primarily mediated by T cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> although the T lymphocyte subsets responsible were not thoroughly analyzed.</s><s>We demonstrate here that recipient resistance to the effects of TRALIinducing antibodies is mediated via the Treg-DC axis related to an IL-10 response to the transfusion.</s><s>More importantly, IL-10 administration completely protected against antibody-mediated TRALI induction, and this suggests that stimulating the IL-10 anti-inflammatory pathway may be a potent therapeutic strategy for alleviating the lung injury.</s></p></div>

colleagues may contain a significant degree of nonpathogenic anti-HLA antibodies.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> In addition, anti-HLA class I antibodies have been implicated in severe as well as fatal cases of TRALI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> which coincides with the 60% mortality we observed in the case of murine DC-depleted TRALI induction (Figures <ref type="figure">4 and 5</ref>).</s><s>Secondly, human TRALI occurs very rapidly, mostly occurring during transfusion or within the first 1 or 2 hours after transfusion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> and these temporal kinetics are very similar to what

on a BALB/c and importantly on a C57BL/6 background, will provide a means to further advance our knowledge of TRALI pathogenesis by allowing us to use genetically altered mice to interrogate in vivo physiological responses.</s></p><p><s>The group that originally described 34-1-2s as a TRALI-inducing antibody in 2006 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> subsequently could not replicate the

their ability to stimulate secretion of IL-10.</s><s>Using a murine SCID model, we previously suggested that T cells are protective in TRALI <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ; however, the protective effect was also found for CD8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> T cells.</s><s>In that study, CD8 1 T cells were positively selected in vitro via an anti-CD8 antibody, and the selected CD8 1 T cells with bound anti-CD8 antibodies were subsequently injected into SCID mice.</s><s>We believe the protective effect of that infusion may not have been due to the CD8 1 T cells themselves but more likely due to the anti-CD8 antibody, which remained bound to the CD8 1 T cells.</s><s>Those antibodies may have induced immune complex formation or blockade of Fc receptors in vivo, prior to the infusion of the 34-1-2s antibody.</s><s>As Fc receptors have been suggested to be crucial in MHC class I-mediated TRALI, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> blockade of Fc receptors by those anti-CD8 antibodies most likely prevented 34-1-2s-mediated TRALI in the SCID model.</s><s>Using our immunocompetent murine models in the current study, without adoptive transfer of positively selected cells, we demonstrate that only removal of CD4 1 Tregs, DCs, or IL-10 resulted in severe TRALI reactions upon MHC class I antibody injection (Figures <ref type="figure">1E, 4C, and 6E</ref>).</s><s>DC depletion in our murine model involved CD11c 1 DCs, of which at least a fraction appeared to be CD8 1 (25%) and CD4 1 (15%), as determined by anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 treatment (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>We believe that likely there is hierarchy of effects in which CD11c 1 DCs play a more prominent role in antibodymediated TRALI than Tregs.</s><s>Firstly, when depleting CD11c 1 DCs in vivo, the severity of antibody-mediated acute lung injury was significantly worse than when eliminating Tregs in vivo (lung W/D ratios of 7.33 on average plus 60% mortality upon DC depletion vs lung W/D ratios of 5.50 on average plus no deaths upon Treg depletion; Figures <ref type="figure">4C and 1E</ref>).</s><s>These effects also corresponded to IL-10 levels, as IL-10 dropped to nearly undetectable levels upon DC depletion (Figure <ref type="figure">6B</ref>), while upon Treg depletion, there was still some detectible IL-10 present despite being significantly lower (Figure <ref type="figure">6A</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, we have shown that within the same TRALI-resistant mice (no cellular depletion in vivo) in which IL-10 levels were significantly increased upon TRALI-inducing antibody injection, the CD11c 1 DC numbers were increased while the Treg numbers stayed relatively constant (Figure <ref type="figure">6C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is known to require stimulation by agents such as microbial products or specific antibodies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref></s><s>Accordingly, WT mice (BALB/c or C57BL/6) stimulated with the anti-MHC class I antibodies had significantly elevated levels of plasma IL-10 and were resistant to TRALI induction (Figure <ref type="figure">6A-B</ref>).</s><s>We investigated if this resistance was caused by a direct hit by the TRALI antibodies on DCs or Tregs by isolating CD11C 1 DCs and CD4 1 CD25 1 FoxP3 1 Tregs, culturing them with the TRALI antibodies, and analyzing the supernatants for IL-10.</s><s>We could not detect any IL-10 production in vitro (data not shown), that the TRALI antibodies may be working indirectly and required in vivo factors are missing in vitro.</s><s>As mentioned, we could demonstrate that in this TRALI-resistant setting, CD11c 1 DCs were 1.5-fold increased while Treg numbers remained relatively constant (Figure <ref type="figure">6C</ref>), suggesting that the DCs are perhaps higher in the hierarchy of protecting against TRALI, although further studies are needed to more thoroughly test this hypothesis.</s><s>In contrast to the TRALI-resistant setting, depletion of Tregs or DCs reversed the parameters; depleted mice had significantly lower levels of plasma IL-10 along with severe TRALI reactions (Figure <ref type="figure">6A-B</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, IL-10 KO mice succumbed to TRALI upon anti-MHC class I antibody injection (Figure <ref type="figure">6E</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, our murine findings are

was subsequently lost, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42</ref> and our current data do not support increased IL-10 levels in antibody-mediated TRALI (Figure <ref type="figure">6A-B</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, in contrast to other acute transfusioninduced lung disorders such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload, TRALI may perhaps be uniquely characterized by lack of IL-10 secretion.</s></p><p><s>In addition to demonstrating that removal of the Treg-DC-IL-10 axis in vivo resulted in severe lung injury after anti-MHC class I antibody infusion, we validated an important
