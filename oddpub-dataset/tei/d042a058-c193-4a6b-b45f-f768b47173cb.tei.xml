oxidative challenge at 21% O 2 in comparison to 5% O 2 does not result in apoptotic activity, as shown by TUNEL analysis in primary OPC cultures.</s><s>Instead, oxidative stress at 21% oxygen causes

O 2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , oligodendroglial cell cultures maintained at 21% O2, are therefore in fact being exposed to a relatively high O 2

oxygen-mediated growth inhibitory effects.</s><s>It remains to be determined whether oxygen concentrations of lower than 10% should be used for in vitro experiments in OPCs and oligodendroglia to adapt the experimental conditions more closely to the natural situation and avoid oxygen-related impairment.</s><s>Our results suggest the possibility that lower oxygen levels applied at the beginning of mixed glial culture procedure even before enrichment or purification of OPCs may benefit development.</s></p><p><s>Our results further indicate that oxidative stress and HIF-related dysregulation of oligodendroglial genes can be avoided by using lower oxygen such as 5% in oligodendroglial cell cultures.</s><s>This is in agreement with results in neural stem cells, which show improved survival under low oxygen conditions in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and in human mesenchymal stem cells in which proliferation was increased at 2% compared to 20% oxygen <ref type="bibr"

might represent supraphysiological oxygen levels for the cellular environment.</s><s>The degree of vulnerability to the higher oxygen condition will vary between cell types, however, OPCs and immature oligodendroglia are well described to be highly susceptible to oxygen toxicities.</s></p><p><s>As the primary role of oligodendroglial cells in myelination is the wrapping of oligodendroglial
