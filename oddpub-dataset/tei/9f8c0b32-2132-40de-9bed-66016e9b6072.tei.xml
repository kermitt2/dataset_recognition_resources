<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Extraction of oxygen from the surroundings and delivery of oxygen throughout an organism are critical functions served by the microcirculation.</s><s>The short diffusion distance of oxygen necessitates an extensive network of small capillaries to provide a large area for exchange and to bring flowing blood close to every part of the organism.</s><s>Conversely, efficient transport over larger distances is achieved by convection within branching networks of vessels with larger diameters.</s><s>Microvascular structures must be able to satisfy both of these contrasting requirements.</s><s>Moreover, consideration of the large number of vessels involved shows that microvascular structures cannot be pre-programmed at the level of individual vessels but must emerge as the result of vascular responses to local conditions including biochemical and biomechanical stimuli.</s><s>This concept, which has been explored previously in relation to the supply of oxygen to peripheral tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>, applies equally to organs responsible for the uptake of oxygen from the environment.</s><s>Direct observation of microvascular structures is important for gaining insight into their function and development.</s><s>Tissues such as the mesentery that form thin sheets with essentially two-dimensional vascular networks are particularly suitable for this purpose <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>More recently, advances in casting, microscopic imaging and image processing techniques have provided extensive information on three-dimensional network structures in various tissues including myocardium, cerebral cortex and tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>However, only limited information is available on three-dimensional microvascular structures in the lungs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chick embryo is widely used for studying the development of vascular structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The CAM is analogous to the placenta in mammals, supplying oxygen and nutrients to the developing chick embryo <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>As a site of oxygen uptake, it is also analogous to the lungs.</s><s>Its two-dimensional structure makes it suitable for visualization of microvascular network structure and determination of red blood cell velocities via video microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> over long enough periods to observe its structural development.</s><s>A number of morphometric studies have reported statistics such as vessel density, length and intercapillary distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>During development of the CAM, treelike arterioles and venules emerge from an initially homogeneous capillary plexus.</s><s>This process, known as intussusceptive arborization, occurs in the CAM between days 7 and 14 of incubation, with most activity on days 10 and 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>The resulting microvasculature exhibits a characteristic pattern of interdigitating arterioles and venules that are displaced from the underlying capillary plexus, but remain connected to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous theoretical studies of blood flow in the CAM or comparable developing tissues have mainly focused on growth through intussusceptive angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>Gödde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> implemented stochastic simulations of shear stress-regulated sprouting angiogenesis and regression, which generated interdigitating patterns of arteriolar and venular trees similar to those found in the CAM.</s><s>The goal of the present work is to provide a quantitative description of the hemodynamics of the CAM, including prediction of the distributions of blood pressure and flow.</s><s>Such a description would provide a basis for analyzing the CAM's oxygen transport characteristics.</s><s>Furthermore, hemodynamic stimuli (wall shear stress and circumferential wall stress) are important for the structural remodeling of blood vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, a hemodynamic model, as developed in the present study, is an essential component for theoretical analyses of the structural changes occurring during development of the CAM.</s></p><p><s>In recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the morphological, topological and hemodynamic characteristics of CAM vessel trees were observed using intravital microscopy.</s><s>The geometrical structure of a microvascular network in a day-14 ex ovo CAM containing one venular and two arteriolar trees, with dimensions 15.1 mm × 11.1 mm, was digitally reconstructed, providing information about length, diameter, and location of over 4500 arterial and venous vessel segments with diameters of 10 μm or more.</s><s>Red blood cell velocities were measured in about 100 arterioles and 100 venules with diameters 16 to 100 μm in similar CAM networks using video microscopy and spatial correlation techniques.</s><s>These data provide the experimental basis for the present analysis.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> shows an image of a CAM network at the same developmental stage.</s></p><p><s>The intravital imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> did not allow resolution of the individual vessels forming the capillary plexus.</s><s>Imaging at higher resolution, for example using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of corrosion casts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, shows that the capillary networks in the CAM have a somewhat regular, mesh-like structure.</s><s>Therefore, the capillary plexus is modelled here as a homogeneous two-dimensional porous medium characterized by its blood flow conductivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Flows in the arteriolar and venular networks are coupled to the homogenized capillary plexus via distributions of sources and sinks.</s><s>This approach leads to a computationally tractable framework for calculating pressures and flows in the CAM microcirculation without the need for a detailed reconstruction of the capillary mesh geometry.</s></p><p><s>In the systemic microcirculation, the capillary networks typically form connections between the terminal branches of the arteriolar trees and the venular trees.</s><s>In the intravital observations of the CAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, the connections between the arteriolar and venular trees and the plexus could not be resolved.</s><s>However, SEM imaging indicates the presence of connections to the capillary plexus not only at the termini of arterioles and venules but also distributed along their lengths <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. Analogous vascular structures have been observed in the human lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>To explore the effects of such connections, two versions of the model were developed, one with only terminal connections (terminal sources model) and one with connections along arterioles and venules (distributed sources model).</s><s>The resulting predictions of blood velocity were compared with measurements of red blood cell velocity in arterioles and venules obtained by Maibier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analysis</head><p><s>A sensitivity analysis was conducted for the distributed sources model in Network 1, by altering the following parameters ±10% relative to their control values: p a -p v = 1.31 mmHg, L S = 22.4 μm, κ = 3 mm 3 s/kg, D dummy = 10.28 μm, μ = 1.3 cP, D c = 100 μm, and r 0 = 0.5 μm.</s><s>Percentage changes in four metrics in response to ±10% changes to various parameters, relative to the values listed in, are shown in for Network 1.

of diameters implied that vascular connections to the capillary plexus must be present along the lengths of the arterioles and venules, and not only at the ends of terminal arterioles and venules.</s><s>The terminal sources model was not able to match the measured velocity distributions.</s><s>Because diameters in the CAM network decrease sharply along the arteriolar tree, velocities would have to increase in smaller diameter vessels in the absence of flow out of the arterioles along their lengths.</s><s>This is in contrast to the systemic circulation where the diameter decrease along vascular trees is more gradual.</s></p><p><s>It might be argued that arteriolar and venular structures with only terminal sources would be equally effective as the structure with distributed sources in perfusing the capillary plexus, if the diameters did not decrease so markedly toward the terminal branches of the vascular trees.</s><s>To test this possibility, we considered the terminal sources model with re-scaled vessel diameters:</s></p><p><s>With an initial value of D 0 , the parameter N was chosen by fitting vessel shear stress as a linear function of (unscaled) diameter and minimizing the slope of this curve, with the goal of generating uniform shear stress across the network.</s><s>This would represent the result of structural adaptation of vessel diameter in response to variations in wall shear stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Using this value of N, D 0 was then chosen by minimizing the difference in the total source flux from the arterioles relative to the distributed sources model.</s><s>The same value of p a derived for the distributed sources model was used.</s><s>These two steps were iterated until the values of D 0 and N were unchanged, giving D 0 = 119 μm and N = 0.51 in Network 1.</s><s>In this Network, arteriolar and venular pressures were locally more uniform but with wide variance across the network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9A</ref>), with large pressure drops in the venules and some venular pressures approaching p a .</s><s>This solution did not match the velocity data well (rmsV = 1.12).</s></p><p><s>Plexus velocities were lower than the distributed model but higher than the terminal sources model (0.19 mm/s on average) with much higher coefficient of variation <ref type="bibr">(1.6)</ref>.</s><s>The spatial distribution of plexus velocities was heterogeneous with large regions of high velocity and other regions of very low velocity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9B</ref>).</s><s>These results imply that a structure with only terminal sources would not perfuse the capillary plexus as effectively as the structure with distributed sources, even with redistributed vessel diameters.</s></p><p><s>The result that capillary plexus velocities were higher and more homogeneous in the presence of distributed sources indicates that this may be a functionally important structural feature.</s><s>In a fertilized egg, oxygen diffuses from the external environment through the egg shell into the air cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The CAM absorbs oxygen from this air space, which can be assumed to have an approximately uniform partial pressure of oxygen under normal conditions.</s><s>In the lung, matching of perfusion to ventilation leads to optimal gas transport, for given total ventilation and perfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Correspondingly, oxygen transport in the CAM is optimized for a given total perfusion if local perfusion is uniform across the surface of the CAM.</s><s>The present study shows that this condition is more closely approximated when distributed sources are present on the arterioles and venules.</s></p><p><s>The model involves a number of assumptions and simplifications.</s><s>The capillary plexus is represented as a continuous sheet with a uniform hydraulic conductivity.</s><s>Given more detailed information on the structure of the plexus, this assumption could be tested by detailed fluid mechanical simulations on the capillary scale.</s><s>The simulation of flow in the arteriolar and venular networks requires the imposition of boundary conditions on the multiple vessels that cross the domain boundaries in addition to the main feeding and draining vessels, as described earlier.</s><s>The resulting flows and pressures generally took more extreme values near network boundaries, suggesting dependence on the chosen boundary values.</s><s>However, the domains chosen were sufficiently large that the results in the interior of the domain can be assumed to have only a mild dependence on these conditions.</s></p><p><s>As shown by Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, the parameter L S describing the spacing of sources is a key parameter of the distributed sources model.</s><s>The deviation between measured and observed velocities was sensitive to the value of L S , and increased with variations above or below the optimized value.</s><s>In the model, a cut-off diameter D C = 100 μm was enforced above which vessels did not have any sources, with uniformly distributed sources on smaller vessels.</s><s>Some images suggest that the cutoff diameter should be smaller <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>More detailed structural data could be used to improve the model for the distribution of the sources along arterioles and venules.</s></p><p><s>The CAM microcirculation represents a useful model for studying various aspects of microvascular function due to its relatively homogeneous structure.</s><s>The complexity (both structural and functional) of the CAM lies between simplified, idealized networks often considered for modelling purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> and microvascular networks in tissues such as the myocardium or the cerebral cortex.</s><s>The CAM acts as a two-dimensional functional analog to the lung, and the results presented here are relevant to the pulmonary circulation, which is difficult to study due to its complex 3D structure and due to respiratory motion.</s><s>Both structures absorb oxygen over a surface where the oxygenation is high, and the very dense mesh of capillaries maximizes oxygen absorption.</s><s>This is in contrast to skeletal muscle, for example, in which a three-dimensional array of capillaries occupying only 1 to 2% of the tissue volume is sufficient to supply oxygen throughout the tissue under normal conditions.</s><s>In a recent intravital microscopy study of the microvasculature of the mouse lung, it was reported that 50% of oxygen exchange occurs in precapillary arterioles of diameter less than 30 μm <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>In hypoxic states, precapillary oxygenation was significantly reduced, with most of the oxygenation occurring at the capillary level, indicating that capillaries act as back-up mechanism in hypoxia.</s><s>This is analogous to results of previous studies in skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and cerebral cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>The present results provide a basis for quantitative investigation of oxygen transport in the CAM, using existing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To function efficiently, microvascular networks require both a dense mesh of small vessels for exchange of materials and a hierarchical branching network of feeding and draining vessels to minimize hydrodynamic flow resistance.</s><s>The development of such structures presents a patterning problem, which has been discussed in the context of growth by sprouting angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The CAM represents a different paradigm for network formation, in which interdigitating tree structures emerge from an existing dense capillary plexus by intussusceptive arborization.</s><s>The mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood, but likely involve responses to wall shear stresses generated by blood flow in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The hemodynamic model presented here represents an essential tool for studies aimed at understanding growth and structural remodeling of microvascular networks in the CAM, and also potentially in analogous tissues including the lung.</s></p></div>
