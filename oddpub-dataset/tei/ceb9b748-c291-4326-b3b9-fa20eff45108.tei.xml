<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are uncommon and heterogeneous neoplasms of epithelial origin, in which neoplastic cells retain many of the structural and functional characters of normal endocrine cells, including the expression of typical endocrine and neuroendocrine markers (such as chromogranin A and synaptophysin) and the capacity to synthesize, store and secrete peptidic hormones and neuropeptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Although NETs may develop in almost any organ, the predominate locations are within the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract.</s><s>The incidence of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is 3.65/100,000 individuals per year which has increased markedly over the last 3 decades, probably as a result of trends in imaging and improvements in diagnosis.</s><s>Although most endocrine tumors present slow and local development, some of them become malignant with metastatic disseminations and are associated with poor prognoses.</s></p><p><s>Conventional cancer therapies include surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.</s><s>Doxorubicin, which belongs to the anthracylin chemotherapeutic drug family, has been used for decades as a cytotoxic drug for the treatment of many cancer types, such as breast, lung, stomach, bone cancers and endocrine tumors, including gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Doxorubicin exerts its anti-tumoral activity through the inhibition of topoisomerase II and thus, prevents chain unfolding and separation in DNA replication as well as DNA repair.</s><s>This ultimately leads to cell death by apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Other mechanisms that might be involved are intercalation into DNA resulting in the inhibition of DNA synthesis and function, and the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) that results in single-and double-stranded DNA breaks with subsequent inhibition of DNA synthesis and function.</s><s>On the other side, the benefits of doxorubicin may be hampered by its significant dose-related adverse effects, including cardiotoxicity, mainly in the form of cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure, myelosuppression, gastrointestinal distress, alopecia, stomatitis, etc., which lead to dose limitations in doxorubicin use <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Hyperthermia has been recently introduced as an adjuvant therapy for cancer and presents promising opportunities to treat cancers, especially in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</s><s>Indeed, many clinical experiments have demonstrated that the addition of hyperthermia to radiotherapy or chemotherapy significantly improves tumor control and patient survival rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Hyperthermia is defined as a treatment in which the target tissue is exposed to high temperatures that either destroy the tissues directly (thermal ablation with temperatures above 47 • C) or render the cancer cells more susceptible to other treatment modalities (thermal sensitization in the temperature ranges of 41-45 • C).</s><s>The commonly used heating methods are based on limb perfusion, incubation chambers, lasers, microwaves, radiofrequency or ultrasound thermal ablation, implantable ferromagnetic needles, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> Magnetic hyperthermia is a promising method for site-specific heating that reaches deeper tissue, in which magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) play an important role by relaying the externally delivered high frequency alternating magnetic field (AMF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, direct injection of MNPs into solid tumors, followed by AMF exposure, has been shown to result in tumor regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, conventional hyperthermia methods, including standard magnetic hyperthermia, do not discriminate between the target and the surrounding normal tissues, and this non-selective tissue heating can lead to serious side effects.</s><s>These drawbacks must be overcome by the development of an efficient, targeted hyperthermia method.</s><s>For this purpose, magnetic remote actuation of intra-lysosomal heat generation has been recently proposed as a means of eradicating cancer cells.</s><s>Indeed, we and others have shown that intracellular or intra-lysosomal hyperthermia induced by targeted MNPs, which have been internalized and accumulated in the lysosomes of cancer cells, can specifically kill cancer cells without damaging healthy surrounding cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Indeed, in these studies, no perceptible temperature rise in the cell culture medium occurred during AMF exposure.</s><s>We elaborated a nanoplatform, termed Gastrin-MNP, which is composed of an iron oxide MNP coated with polyethylene glycol-amine and decorated with (i) a synthetic replicate of gastrin, which binds specifically to the gastrin receptor (CCK2R), a receptor overexpressed in endocrine tumors, and allows MNPs internalization in cells overexpressing this receptor; (ii) a fluorescent label DY647 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Gastrin-MNPs recognized the endocrine tumoral cells INR1G9 expressing the CCK2R (INR1G9-CCK2R) with high specificity that is subsequently internalized using the CCK2R-dependent signaling and finally accumulated in the lysosomes.</s><s>We showed that the internalization of a minute amount of Gastrin-MNPs (1-2 pg Fe/cell) induced the death of ~30% of INR1G9-CCK2R cells upon AMF exposure (40 mT, 275 kHz) without affecting the viability of cells devoid of MNPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, we showed that cell death is initiated in the lysosomes, consecutively to a significant temperature increase in the immediate vicinity of the MNPs in response to AMF application without increasing the temperature at the outer surface of lysosomes and is mediated through a lysosomal death pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, this approach that we called magnetic intra-lysosomal hyperthermia (MILH), differs from standard magnetic hyperthermia whereby tumor eradication is achieved with large doses of MNPs, which cause the temperature elevation of the whole tumor.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to analyze whether the combination of MILH with chemotherapy can increase the efficiency of cancer cell eradication.</s><s>Endocrine tumoral cells were incubated with Gastrin-MNPs, treated with doxorubicin, the drug commonly used to treat endocrine tumors, and exposed to AMF.</s><s>The impact of combined treatments was analyzed on cell viability and cell death.</s><s>The molecular mechanisms of cell death were also studied.</s><s>Here, we report that the combination of MILH with doxorubicin increases the eradication efficiency of endocrine tumor cells with synergism.</s><s>We also demonstrate that these two treatments activate two different cell death pathways that respectively depend on Caspase-1 and Caspase-3 activation.</s></p></div>
