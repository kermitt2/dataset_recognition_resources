<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S. pneumoniae-Induced Expression of MIR146A Does Not Involve Autocrine IL-1β or TNF-α Regulation</head><p><s>We demonstrated that S. pneumoniae-induced expression of MIR146A depends on TLR-2 signaling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Next, we investigated whether autocrine stimulation of the receptors for IL-1 (IL-1R) or TNF-α in response to the S. pneumoniae-induced release of IL-1β and TNF-α, respectively, induces MIR146A expression.</s><s>Cytokine secretion analysis in BDMs stimulated with S. pneumoniae revealed significant release of IL-1β and TNF-α following infection (Figure <ref type="figure">6A and 6C</ref>).</s><s>Both, IL-1β and TNF-α significantly induced MIR146A expression in BDMs (Figure <ref type="figure">6B</ref> and 6D), with TNF-α stimulation leading to a rather moderate induction.</s><s>Blockade of IL-1R or sequestration of TNF-α prior to cytokine stimulation completely abolished induction of MIR146A expression.</s><s>However, neither inhibition affected MIR146A induction in response to subsequent S. pneumoniae infection (Figure <ref type="figure">6B and 6D</ref>).</s><s>In line with these results, IL-8 release from antagonist-treated BDMs was abrogated upon cytokine stimulation but did not significantly change in response to pneumococcal stimulation (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Thus, although macrophages infected with S. pneumoniae secreted IL-1β and TNF-α, treatment with antagonists for IL-1R or TNF-α did not prevent induction of miRNA-146a release, thereby implying that MIR146A expression upon pneumococcal infection does not rely on autocrine IL-1β or TNF-α regulation in the context of an infection within the tested time frame.</s></p></div>
