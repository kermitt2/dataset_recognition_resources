<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>We performed a search among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, to identify all patients diagnosed with a discoid meniscus between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2015.</s><s>The data were obtained from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP), a database that provides access to complete medical records for residents of Olmsted County, which had a 2010 United States (US) census population of 144,260.</s><s>This database captures all Olmsted County patients regardless of the location in the county where care was provided, ascertaining that these patients belong to a geographically defined community.</s><s>The validity and generalizability of data collection using the REP system have been demonstrated previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>Patients who had International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes consistent with a discoid meniscus were identified.</s><s>A full review of their medical records, including clinical notes, surgical reports, and imaging studies, was conducted by a senior orthopaedic resident (O.D.S.) to confirm the diagnosis and gather relevant data with regard to patient demographics, associated injuries, and rate of surgical interventions.</s><s>This study was approved by the institutional review board of the supporting institutions.</s></p><p><s>Patients were included if they presented with knee pain, mechanical symptoms (painful popping, snapping, or decreased knee extension), or meniscus injuries, and a discoid meniscus was diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or at the time of diagnostic arthroscopic surgery.</s><s>A discoid meniscus was defined on MRI if the ratio of the minimal meniscal width to the maximal tibial width in the coronal plane was greater than 20% and/or if there was continuity between the anterior and posterior horns of the meniscus on 3 consecutive slices in the sagittal plane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>A discoid meniscus was defined at arthroscopic surgery as a hypertrophic semilunar or discoid-shaped meniscus completely covering (Watanabe type I) or partially covering (Watanabe type II) the tibial plateau (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) and/or if there was presence of a hypermobile meniscus as a result of deficient posterior tibial attachments (Watanabe type III or "Wrisberg variant") (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>Peripheral instability was determined from the operative report based on the surgeon's assessment of hypermobility in response to probing.</s><s>We excluded patients initially thought to have a discoid meniscus on MRI but later found to have normal meniscus tissue at the time of diagnostic arthroscopic surgery.</s><s>Patients who were treated surgically were Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</s></p><p><s>categorized into 1 of 2 groups: partial meniscectomy (including saucerization) or meniscus repair (including saucerization).</s><s>Partial meniscectomy was defined as debridement of an unstable portion of the meniscus with or without reshaping of the remaining meniscus.</s><s>Saucerization was defined as partial meniscectomy of intact meniscus tissue for the sole purpose of reshaping.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>Age-and sex-specific incidence rates of symptomatic discoid menisci were calculated and adjusted to the 2010 US white population.</s><s>The calculation was performed using incident cases of discoid menisci as the numerator and population estimates based on the decennial census as the denominator.</s><s>Only residents of Olmsted County who were diagnosed with a discoid lateral meniscus within the time interval determined in the study were counted as incident cases, and linear interpolation was performed between census years.</s><s>Assuming that the yearly incidence of discoid menisci follows a Poisson distribution, we calculated incidence rates using the Poisson regression model with 95% CIs.</s><s>We also calculated the rate of surgical interventions using the same methodology for each incident case of a discoid meniscus.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>We identified 81 patients with a diagnosis of a discoid lateral meniscus on MRI.</s><s>Two patients were subsequently noted to have normal meniscus tissue at the time of diagnostic arthroscopic surgery and were excluded.</s><s>Thus, we identified a cohort of 79 patients diagnosed with a symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus with a mean follow-up of 4.

tears in patients with a discoid meniscus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>A recent study analyzing the ultrastructural content of discoid menisci with transmission electron microscopy showed a discoid meniscus to have a lower number of collagen fibers and a more heterogeneous arrangement of these fibers compared with a normal meniscus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>The authors proposed that these differences may contribute to the overall vulnerability of discoid menisci by affecting their vascularity and stability.</s><s>A higher incidence of symptomatic discoid menisci in young patients could be explained if young age is interpreted as a surrogate for increased activity levels.</s><s>Thus, younger, more active patients could have a higher propensity to injure an already abnormal meniscus compared with less active groups.</s><s>Nevertheless, without a direct comparison with tear rates in patients with a nondiscoid meniscus, these observations require further investigation.</s><s>This cohort demonstrated a high rate of meniscus tears and a high rate of surgical treatment (75.9%) for patients presenting with a symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus.</s><s>Most authors agree that surgical management for symptomatic or unstable discoid lateral meniscus tears is warranted to relieve symptoms and prevent early lateral compartment wear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>Although the choice of treatment remains highly

target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>Yet, considering the likely aberrant nature of discoid meniscus tissue and poor vascular supply, there is concern for a decreased

meniscectomy but failed to demonstrate improved results with meniscus repair. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>However, available data are limited, and the decreased healing potential of discoid menisci has not been thoroughly explored.</s></p><p><s>The incidence of peripheral instability in the surgical group was 20.0%.</s><s>This is comparable with reported values of 28% in prior retrospective studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Additionally, patients noted to have peripheral instability were significantly younger than those without peripheral instability.</s><s>Because of the high incidence of associated intrasubstance meniscus tears in those with peripheral instability, it is unclear whether the principal cause of patients' symptoms was associated with their mechanical instability or with the meniscus tear.</s><s>Nevertheless, these findings suggest that special attention should be devoted to excluding peripheral instability, particularly in young patients presenting with a symptomatic discoid meniscus.</s></p><p><s>No discoid medial menisci were observed in this cohort.</s><s>This observation is in agreement with prior studies showing a greater prevalence of discoid lateral menisci, as incidence rates for discoid medial menisci have ranged from 0.06% to 0.3%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>To date, there is no consensus on the likely cause of a discoid meniscus, particularly one that could more definitively explain its predilection for the lateral compartment.</s><s>Some theories suggest that a discoid meniscus is the result of shear stress that results in meniscocapsular separation and secondary hypermobility, which may lead to compensatory meniscus hypertrophy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>The lateral compartment of the knee may be more prone to this sheer stress during meniscus development because of its convex rather than concave surfaces.</s><s>This could explain the higher incidence of discoid menisci on the lateral side.</s><s>Moreover, the medial meniscus could be less prone to result in mechanical symptoms and/or injuries because of its relatively decreased mobility compared with the lateral meniscus.</s></p><p><s>Our cohort demonstrated a low percentage of bilateral symptomatic discoid lateral menisci (12.6%).</s><s>This number is in general agreement with prior reported estimates of  20%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> All patients in this cohort with bilateral discoid menisci presented with bilateral knee symptoms.</s><s>No diagnostic studies were performed on asymptomatic contralateral knees if a discoid meniscus was diagnosed.</s><s>Accordingly, the true incidence of bilateral discoid menisci is likely higher than the 12.6% reported in this study.</s><s>A congenital cause of a discoid meniscus is supported by a few case reports documenting its occurrence in twins and the familial transmission of a discoid meniscus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Therefore, a higher rate of bilateral discoid menisci may discovered with long-term follow-up.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of the study include the unique medical records linkage system provided by the REP, which allows almost complete ascertainment of all clinically recognized symptomatic discoid meniscus diagnoses within a welldefined population.</s><s>Yet, this database may not capture patients who were misdiagnosed or who relocated outside Olmsted County and sought medical care elsewhere.</s><s>Additionally, a search for the incidence of discoid menisci in all meniscus tears could have yielded a higher number of discoid meniscus cases not correctly identified with an ICD-9 code for a discoid meniscus.</s><s>The REP database is composed of a mostly white population.</s><s>As a result, data from our cohort may not be generalizable to other geographic regions with more ethnic diversity.</s><s>For instance, a series from South Korea reported a larger incidence of bilateral discoid menisci (79%) in Asian populations, 2 while the incidence of discoid menisci in the Greek population is quoted to be as low as 1.8%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>In keeping with this observation, the incidence of symptomatic discoid menisci was calculated and adjusted to the US 2010 white population.</s><s>This cohort only includes patients who presented with a symptomatic discoid meniscus, and as such, it is likely an underestimate of the true incidence of discoid menisci.</s><s>Moreover, given that patients with a diagnosed discoid meniscus in 1 knee did not undergo diagnostic screening on the contralateral asymptomatic side, this work may underestimate the true incidence of bilateral discoid abnormalities.</s></p></div>
