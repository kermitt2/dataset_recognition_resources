<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In an early effort to harmonize PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in pulmonary squamous-cell and adenocarcinoma, two sets of n = 15 resection specimens were centrally stained for PD-L1 and scored by nine pathologists.</s><s>Scoring of the carcinoma cells was found be reproducible for two laboratory developed assays and four clinical trial assays.</s><s>Scoring of the tumor-associated immune cells yielded low concordance levels.</s><s>The four clinical trial assays showed distinctive staining patterns and differences in the proportions of PD-L1 stained carcinoma cells.</s></p><p><s>The predictive value of clinical biomarkers relies on their biological significance and technical feasibility.</s><s>For immunohistochemistry, the technical aspects encompass the employed assay and their reagents, the type and quality of the investigated biomaterial and the interpretation of the staining pattern by the pathologists. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Harmonization trials may greatly improve standardization and interobserver concordance for immunohistochemistry scoring as was demonstrated for HER2/neu <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and ALK. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> In this study, we focused on the scoring of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry to provide a starting point for the harmonization of the clinical assays (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The different cut-offs were integrated into a 6-step scoring system.</s><s>In two sets of pulmonary carcinoma resection specimens including squamous-cell carcinoma (n = 12) and adenocarcinoma (n = 18), the score yielded moderate concordance levels (κ≈0.50;</s><s>PD-L1 stained carcinoma cells).</s><s>The use of six scoring categories is a quite detailed way to interpret the rate of PD-L1-positive cells, in particular as the cut-offs 1, 5, and 10% are close to each other.</s><s>Furthermore, large resection specimens were used, which complicated proportion scoring; thus, κ≈0.50 seems an acceptable value.</s><s>Moreover, the included cut-offs show good concordance levels of κ = 0.6-0.8.</s><s>The integrated scoring system contains more information than a pure dichotomous cut-off.</s><s>Several studies have indicated that the response rates to immunotherapy, median duration of responses, and overall survival times raise proportional to the rate of PD-L1-positive carcinoma cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> indicating that the information might be clinically valuable.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, no significant differences in the interobserver concordance levels were noticed among the four clinical trial assays.</s><s>Apparently each assay can be interpreted reproducibly in pulmonary squamous-cell and adenocarcinoma, despite their differences in staining patterns.</s><s>However, the finding cannot be directly translated to other entities: studies with HER2/neu indicated that specific guidelines and training are required for breast cancer and gastric cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Analogous, entity-specific studies, and guidelines will be required for PD-L1 testing given that tumors with different morphologies and modes of carcinogenesis are investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>coring of the tumor-associated immune cells yielded low concordance levels.</s><s>The two sets were not perfectly suited for concordance analysis of immune cells as only two cases (training set) or one case (validation set) featured immune cells that stained PD-L1 negative by each assay.</s><s>Such an extreme ratio of positive/negative cases limits the interpretability of concordance coefficients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>On the other hand, case discussions by the nine observers revealed that several aspects about immune cell scoring require standardization including a definition of 'tumor area' in not-well delimited carcinomas, a definition of area 'covered' by PD-L1-positive immune cells and a definition of the borders of necrotic areas.</s><s>Given that the SP142 assay has been used reproducibly in published clinical trials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> we assume that specific instructions and training may raise concordance of immune cell scoring.</s></p><p><s>Although scoring of carcinoma cells seems to be reproducible for all tested assays, the staining results by the four clinical trial assays differed systematically: with the limitation of having seen only n = 15 resection specimens, the assays yield differences in both the proportion of stained carcinoma cells as well as the staining intensity and proportion of stained tumor-associated immune cells.</s><s>The findings are not surprising since each assay was developed and optimized as predictive biomarker for a different therapeutic antibody. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>In particular, immune cells are part of the scoring for atezolizumab 8 (SP142 assay) but not for nivolumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> (28-8 assay), or pembrolizumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> (22C3 assay).</s><s>Thus, it seems plausible that SP142 stains immune cells more intense.</s><s>Our results give an early quantitation specifically why the clinical trial assays may not be used interchangeable.</s></p><p><s>A practical next steps towards harmonization could be to compare the staining patterns and predictive value of the 28-8 and 22C3 assays on a large cohort of samples.</s><s>The limited number of cases investigated in our study indicates that the Dako assays might show comparable staining patterns in pulmonary squamous-cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.</s><s>It would be of high interest to directly compare their predictive value.</s></p><p><s>Ultimately, the clinical utility of each PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay has to be evaluated by its predictive value.</s><s>An initial study design could be to stain PD-L1 in tumor samples of patients treated with immunotherapy with all four immunohistochemistry assays and compare their predictive value.</s><s>Biochemical studies to determine the measurement range of each assay as well as mapping of the bound PD-L1 epitopes might facilitate interpretation of the immunohistochemistry results.</s><s>If the divergent staining patterns that we report are confirmed by larger studies, relating PD-L1 immunohistochemistry of all assays to response and outcome of the same patient cohort will shed light on clinical significance of the staining differences.</s></p><p><s>for kindly performing the Dako 28-8 pharmDx and U Zenz, A and U Rommerscheidt-Fuß for excellent technical assistance.</s><s>The work was supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb, MSD, Roche and AstraZeneca by providing the clinical trial assays and by supporting three joint meetings.</s><s>The authors did not receive honoraria for conducting the harmonization-trial or for drafting the manuscript.</s></p></div>
