target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In order to specifically investigate the direct connection between MP1 and MVP2 neurons without globally affecting the physiology of the whole MB compartment, we expressed RNAi against dopamine receptors in MVP2.</s><s>Four dopamine receptors have been characterized in Drosophila.</s><s>dDA1 is the homolog of mammalian D1 receptor.</s><s>DAMB (dopamine receptor in MB) was originally described as another type 1 receptor, because it can be positively coupled to cyclic AMP (cAMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref> signaling, although it can also trigger calcium signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> through Gq coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Sequence comparisons revealed that it rather belongs to an ''invertebrate type'' class of dopamine receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Both dDA1 and DAMB are necessary in the MB for appetitive olfactory memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>dD2R is the homolog of the mammalian D2 receptor and has an inhibitory effect on downstream cAMP signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, DopEcR is a dual ecdysone and dopamine receptor, which is also a type 1 dopamine receptor with no clear homology to mammalian receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We first downregulated DAMB in MVP2 neurons by expressing a RNAi against DAMB under the control of the highly specific MVP2 split-Gal4 driver MB112C <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Under these conditions, we observed an appetitive LTM defect, whereas memory retention after 2 hr (hereinafter termed 2-hr memory), olfactory acuity, and sugar response were all normal (Figures <ref type="figure">1A and 1B</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>We obtained the same results using a second nonoverlapping DAMB RNAi (Figures <ref type="figure">S1A and S1B</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>To exclude any developmental effect from DAMB RNAi expression, we used the R83A12 MVP2 Gal4 driver <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> in combination with the thermosensitive Gal4 inhibitor Gal80ts expressed ubiquitously (tubulin-Gal80 ts ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Restricting the downregulation of DAMB in MVP2 neurons to the adult stage still resulted in an LTM impairment (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>) without any effect on 2-hr memory (Figure <ref type="figure">1D</ref>).</s><s>Without thermal induction, LTM was normal, and so were the sugar response and olfactory acuity (Figure <ref type="figure">S1C</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to DAMB, a knockdown in MVP2 neurons of the two other D1-like receptors, dDA1 and DopEcR, did not affect LTM (Figures <ref type="figure">S1D and S1E</ref>).</s><s>Hence, DAMB seems to be the only type 1 receptor mediating dopaminergic input on MVP2 for appetitive LTM.</s></p><p><s>We next addressed the question of the D2-like receptor requirement in MVP2 for appetitive LTM.</s><s>Intriguingly, we observed also an LTM defect when dD2R was constitutively downregulated in MVP2 using the MB112C split-Gal4 driver (Figure <ref type="figure">1E</ref>).</s><s>However, 2-hr memory was also affected by dD2R constitutive downregulation in MVP2m whereas olfactory acuity and sugar response were all normal (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>To exclude any developmental effect from dD2R RNAi expression, we restricted the downregulation of dD2R in MVP2 neurons to the adult stage using only the tubulin-Gal80 ts ; R83A12-Gal4.</s><s>Similarly to the constitutive downregulation, both LTM and 2-hr memory were impaired (Figures <ref type="figure">1G and 1H</ref>), while sugar response and olfactory acuity were normal (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).Without induction of the RNAi, LTM performance was normal (Figure <ref type="figure">S1F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These results, altogether, indicate that dopamine signaling acts on MVP2 neurons for appetitive memory.</s><s>Surprisingly, two dopamine receptors with opposite effects on downstream signaling are involved in the formation of appetitive LTM.</s><s>MVP2 dendrites are intertwined with MP1 terminals in the g1 and peduncle MB modules.</s><s>In addition, in the electron microscopy reconstruction of the adult MB vertical lobes, no synapses were found between other DANs and MVP2 neurons in which MVP2 is post-synaptic (Table <ref type="table">5</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>).</s><s>Hence, dopaminergic input on MVP2 is likely to come from MP1 neurons.</s><s>To understand this phenomenon, we therefore focused on the temporal involvement of both MP1 and MVP2 neurons.</s></p><p><s>The Effect of MVP2 Activity on LTM Consolidation Is Time Dependent Since MP1 neurons are required for appetitive LTM consolidation immediately after training <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and since an activating dopamine receptor is required in MVP2 neurons for proper LTM performance, we wondered whether MVP2 neuronal activity is also required in the first hours of LTM consolidation.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we specifically blocked MVP2 neurotransmission by expressing the dominant-negative thermosensitive Shibire protein (Shi ts ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> in MVP2 neurons.</s><s>Using the MB112C split-Gal4 driver, we observed that MVP2 blockade for 1.5 hr immediately after appetitive training resulted in a strong LTM impairment (Figure <ref type="figure">S2A</ref>), whereas LTM was normal when the experiment was led at the permissive temperature (Figure <ref type="figure">S2B</ref>).</s><s>Importantly blocking MVP2 neurons on a later time window, from 1.5 to 3 hr postconditioning, had no effect on LTM (Figure <ref type="figure">S2C</ref>).</s><s>Finally, blocking MVP2 neurons immediately after conditioning did not affect 2-hrmemory scores (Figure <ref type="figure">S2D</ref>).</s><s>The specific requirement of MVP2 neurons' activity after conditioning for LTM, but not for STM, was confirmed using the R83A12 driver (Figures <ref type="figure">S2F-S2H</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We previously described the existence of a 0.5-hr time window during which calcium oscillation of MP1 neurons is crucial for LTM consolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>We thus further refined the analysis of MVP2 requirement over time to ask whether it has the same requirement of MP1 neurons.</s><s>We first observed that blocking MVP2 neurons for 1 hr after conditioning was sufficient to impair LTM formation (Figure <ref type="figure">S2E</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, blocking MVP2 neurons immediately after conditioning for 0.5 hr did not impair LTM (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>), while blocking between 0.5 hr and 1 hr post-conditioning did (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s><s>Hence, the requirement of MVP2 for appetitive LTM starts at the end of the time period of MP1 neuron's requirement.</s></p><p><s>In a recent report, it was shown that suppressing the activity of MVP2 neurons during an odor presentation leads to the formation of an aversive memory toward this odor <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>This raises the question of whether the defect in appetitive LTM that we observed in this series of experiments is due to the blockade of an actual role of MVP2 neurons in memory consolidation or to the fact that MVP2 silencing behaves like an aversive learning signal.</s><s>However, in favor of the former alternative, we observed that the appetitive LTM of wild-type flies was not sensitive to the delivery of a series of electric shocks 45 min after conditioning, i.e., in the middle of the time window when MVP2 silencing gives an appetitive LTM defect (Figure <ref type="figure">S2I</ref>).</s><s>Overall, we conclude that the activity of MVP2 neurons is actually required after appetitive conditioning for LTM formation.</s><s>The dD2 receptor is required in MVP2 neurons for LTM formation, which suggests that MVP2 neurons have to be inhibited at some point by dopamine signaling.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we expressed the thermosensitive cation channel TrpA1 with MB112C to allow for temperature-induced overactivation of MVP2 neurons.</s><s>When MVP2 neurons were activated immediately after conditioning for 0.5 hr, LTM performance was impaired (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, overactivation of MVP2 neurons between 0.5 hr and 1 hr post-conditioning did not alter LTM (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>), consistent with MVP2 activity being necessary during this time window (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>These results indicate that MVP2 neurons are involved in LTM formation according to a precise timing.</s><s>Activity from MVP2 is deleterious for LTM immediately after conditioning but beneficial from 0.5 hr post-conditioning.</s><s>Strikingly, the time interval where MVP2 activation is deleterious precisely matches the period when MP1 neurons need to be active.</s><s>This prompted us to investigate whether MVP2 neurons could inhibit MP1 activity.</s><s>We first sought to gather anatomical clues in support of this hypothesis.</s><s>We could observe a co-labeling of MVP2 pre-synaptic boutons labeled with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged synaptotagmin and of MP1 neurons labeled with membrane-bound GFP.</s><s>This confirms the presence of MVP2 pre-synaptic connections in the a/b peduncle compartment at the site of MP1 dendritic arborization (Figures <ref type="figure">S2I and S2J</ref>), as suggested by Aso et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, anatomical data indicate that the MVP2 neuron can, indeed, directly give feedback to the MP1 neuron to modulate its activity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MVP2 Neurons Are Required to Terminate the Enhanced Oscillation Period in MP1 Neurons after Appetitive Training</head><p><s>The association of an odor and a sugar leads to a robust appetitive LTM only if the sugar carries a nutritious value <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Previously, we showed that the pairing of an energetic sugar with an odorant increased the frequency of MP1 calcium oscillations, as compared to pairing with a non-energetic sugar <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we monitored MP1 calcium activity by expressing the GCaMP3 probe in MP1 neurons using the LexA/LexAop system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref> with the 30e11-LexA driver <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> to allow for independent manipulation of MVP2 neurons using the GAL4/UAS system.</s><s>In accordance with our previous work, we observed an increase in the frequency of MP1 oscillations when the nutritious sugar presentation was associated with the odorant presentation Similarly to the oscillations frequency, the quality factor of MP1 calcium oscillation was increased, whereas the amplitude of MP1 calcium oscillations was not significantly affected by paired training or blocking of MVP2 activity (see Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).</s><s>Control experiments were done immediately after conditioning, using both 30E11-LexA;R83A12-Gal4 &gt; AOP-GCaMP3;UAS-Shi ts and 30E11-LexA;+ &gt; AOP-GCaMP3;UAS-Shi ts flies to assess that the association between the odorant and the sugar (paired protocol) induced an increase in both the frequency and the quality factor of MP1 oscillations compared to an unpaired protocol in which the presentation of the sugar is done before odor presentation (see Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).</s><s>The amplitude of MP1 oscillations was not modified between paired and unpaired protocols (see Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>) (paired protocol), as compared to an unpaired protocol in which the sugar and odorant presentations are dissociated (Figures <ref type="figure">S3A-S3H</ref>).</s><s>These results further support that the increase in MP1 oscillation frequency observed in paired flies is not merely due to the ingestion of a caloric sugar but is also truly linked to appetitive LTM formation.</s></p><p><s>To challenge functionally the existence and the physiological significance of an MVP2-to-MP1 feedback, we monitored MP1 neuron activity after blocking MVP2 in flies trained for appetitive memory.</s><s>Our previous study also demonstrated that the enhanced MP1 oscillations associated with appetitive LTM formation last for less than 1 hr after conditioning.</s><s>Because MVP2 neurons are inhibitory GABAergic neurons, we hypothesized that their activity might be required to terminate the enhanced MP1 oscillation phase.</s><s>We used the paired protocol to train flies expressing GCaMP3 in MP1 and Shi ts in MVP2 (30E11-LexA;R83A12-Gal4 &gt;

prevent the formation of irrelevant memory from insignificant stimuli.</s><s>Given the role of MP1 in the signaling of negative stimuli during aversive learning, this finding and its interpretation are fully consistent with the existence of an inhibitory feedback from MVP2 neurons to MP1 neurons, as reported in the present work.</s><s>MP1 neurons are also central in the formation of LTM after conditioning.</s><s>Tonic signaling through slow oscillations of MP1 neurons gates the formation of aversive LTM after spaced training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr"

study).</s><s>Both in aversive and appetitive paradigms, this LTM-gating function involves DAMB signaling in MB neurons.</s><s>After aversive spaced training, it was shown that DAMB activation triggers an upregulation of MB energy metabolism, which starts the consolidation of LTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, MP1 neurons also regulate the retrieval of appetitive

neurons, by indiscriminately disturbing this MP1-MVP2 inhibitory link, would impair the odor-specific message carried by M4/M6 neurons for memory retrieval and cause an STM defect (Figure <ref

activate.</s><s>A finer understanding of these processes calls for higher resolution physiological measurements to understand how the various dopamine receptors are sensitive to different modalities or kinetics of dopamine release.</s></p><p><s>Recently, it was shown that acquisition and consolidation of appetitive LTM also rely on a positive-feedback circuit involving the a1 MB compartment, dopaminergic PAM-a1, and glutamatergic MBON-a1 neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, consolidation of appetitive memory involves two different recurrent circuits that share

of the a1 compartment loop is also necessary for proper LTM formation, presumably to stabilize a nascent memory trace <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, the electron microscopy reconstruction of the adult MB vertical lobes recently showed that MVP2 neurons form direct synapses with MBONs in the a2 and a3 modules and, probably, in the a1 compartment as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the two feedback circuits may not be independent, and MVP2 neurons may also mediate a feedforward input from the MP1/MVP2 loop to the PAM-a1/MBON-a1 loop.</s><s>The dD2R-mediated inhibition of MVP2 neurons by MP1 activity immediately after conditioning could, therefore, help in maintaining the recurrent activity in the a1 compartment.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have shown here that a negative-feedback loop functions to control appetitive LTM formation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4H</ref>), likely involving two antagonist dopaminergic receptors.</s><s>This negative-feedback loop is strikingly similar to one recently described in the mammalian mesolimbic system in which feedback from inhibitory neurons prevents the over-activation of dopaminergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</s><s>These two circuits have at least three common features: they rely on the metabotropic receptors DA1 and GABA B R 1 ; they comprise dopaminergic and inhibitory neurons, which are monosynaptically connected in mammals, and possibly also in Drosophila; and they are involved in the memory acquisition of motivationally relevant stimuli.</s><s>These shared properties of negative-feedback loops highlight how similar strategies exist at both the network and molecular levels to regulate
