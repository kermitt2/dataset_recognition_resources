<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Purpose The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of multiple growth factors on the development of individually cultured murine embryos.</s><s>Methods Embryos produced by in vitro fertilization using in vitro (IVM) or in vivo (IVO) matured oocytes from three strains of mice (CF1, Swiss Webster, B6D2F1) were cultured individually (10 μl) in the absence (control) or presence of growth factors (paf, epidermal growth factor [EGF], insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]).</s><s>Blastocyst formation, hatching, and blastocyst cell numbers (trophectoderm, inner cell mass, and total) were evaluated on days 4 and 5 of culture.</s><s>Post-hatching development of CF1 IVO embryos was also evaluated in vitro and in vivo.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The presence of growth factors did not improve the proportion of embryos forming blastocysts or initiating hatching for any of the types of embryos tested.</s><s>The only significant (P &lt; 0.05) effect of growth factors was a decrease in the proportion of embryos that formed blastocysts by day 5 in CF1 IVM embryos.</s><s>The presence of growth factors also did not affect blastocyst cell numbers.</s><s>For CF1 IVO embryos, the presence of growth factors during culture did not affect the proportion of embryos that attached to fibronectin-coated dishes, the size of the resulting outgrowths, or in vivo development following transfer.</s><s>Conclusion Combinations of paf, EGF, GM-CSF, and IGF-1 did not improve development of murine embryos cultured individually in a sequential medium containing a defined protein source.</s></p></div>

insufficient growth factors in the medium to support normal development.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that the addition of growth factors to the culture medium used for individual mouse embryos would improve in vitro and in vivo development, but our results did not support this hypothesis.</s><s>Although the tested growth factors have been reported to stimulate embryo development in other studies,

combined effect of low concentrations of multiple growth factors may be equivalent to a higher, ineffective, or inhibitory dose of a single growth factor.</s></p><p><s>The strain of mouse used for oocyte or embryo collections, as well as the developmental stage of the oocyte or embryo at collection, can affect the sensitivity of the resulting embryo to culture conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</s><s>We have recently demonstrated that embryos resulting from IVM and IVF provide a sensitive assay for the detection of contaminants in the culture environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Similar correlations have been reported between embryo quality and responsiveness to growth factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</s><s>Based on these previous findings, we evaluated embryos from three strains of mice derived from in vitro or in vivo matured oocytes and in vitro fertilization in order to assess the effects of growth factors on embryos with a range of developmental potentials.</s><s>For example, the proportion of control embryos that had initiated hatching on D4 ranged from 4.4% for in vitro matured oocytes from CF1 females to 76.9% for in vivo matured oocytes from BDF1 females.</s><s>However, we were unable to find a strain of mouse and/or source of oocyte that demonstrated improved in vitro development (blastocyst formation, hatching, or blastocyst cell number) in the presence of growth factors.</s></p><p><s>The effects of growth factors on embryo development can also be dependent on the culture conditions.</s><s>Many of the studies demonstrating positive effects of growth factors have used sub-optimal culture conditions or embryos that have been stressed in some way.</s><s>Culturing with low concentrations There were no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) between treatments of protein or in atmospheric oxygen can the beneficial effects of growth factors

growth factors can be more pronounced for embryos exposed to heat or oxidative stress or embryos that have previously been cryopreserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>.</s><s>Although embryos in the present study were presumably stressed by culturing them individually, we still did not observe beneficial effects of the growth factors.</s><s>It is possible that the growth factors secreted by a single embryo in just 10 μl of medium accumulate in sufficient amounts to support development in the absence of additional, exogenous growth factors.</s><s>Alternatively, the presence of protein, the use of reduced O 2 , and the use of a medium containing amino acids may have allowed the embryos to better cope with the stress of individual culture, even in the absence of growth factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59]</ref>.</s><s>Trophectoderm outgrowth, implantation, and fetal development were also unaffected by growth factors, but this portion of our study was limited and should be interpreted cautiously.</s><s>Only one strain of mouse (CF1) and one source of oocytes (IVO) were evaluated for these endpoints.</s><s>A large proportion (&gt; 70%) of embryos from these oocytes were capable of reaching the blastocyst stage by day 5; &gt; 60% of those were hatching, and the embryos displayed cells of both the TE (CDX2+) and ICM (SOX2+) lineages, so we had assumed that these embryos would provide a suitable model to evaluate the effects of growth factor exposure on posthatching development.</s><s>It is difficult to speculate why so few developed into fetuses following transfer.</s><s>There is limited data concerning the outcomes of embryo transfers using CF1 × BDF1 IVF embryos, but it is possible for ~40% of transferred embryos to develop into pups <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61]</ref>.</s><s>However, these studies used different culture conditions (group culture with BSA) and transfer protocols (surgical) than we used in the present study (individual culture with recombinant albumin and nonsurgical transfers).</s><s>While the low fetal development may have prevented us from detecting significant effects of the growth factors on this parameter, comparisons of the proportions of females becoming pregnant or the proportions of embryos implanting remain useful measures of the effects of growth factors that are often used with embryos from sensitive strains of mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, two different sources of oocytes (in vitro and in vitro matured) from three strains of mice were used to produce six different types of embryos with varying degrees of developmental competence.</s><s>When these embryos were individually cultured with combinations of paf, EGF, GM-CSF, and IGF-1 in a sequential medium system containing a defined protein source, blastocyst formation, hatching, and blastocyst cell number and allocation were not affected.</s><s>While our culture conditions may have been able to minimize some of the stress associated with individual culture and support blastocyst development in the absence of growth factors, the low fetal development of embryos from CF1 IVO oocytes suggests deficiencies in the environment for individual embryo culture that were not overcome by the tested growth factors.</s></p></div><figure
