of A 2A R on the sub-cellular localization of GR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5g</ref>).</s><s>The reduced nuclear localization upon A 2A R inhibition provides a straightforward

reestablishing the HPA-axis and GR levels in the hippocampus 1 .</s><s>These findings are critical, not only for possible treatment strategies of the memory dysfunction associated with psychopathologies, but also in the context of aging and other circumstances in which the glucocorticoid response is impaired.</s></p><p><s>We have also observed that the A 2A R synaptic responses in tg(CaMKII-hA2AR) are dependent on PKA activation and that in vivo administration of an A 2A blocker rescues the higher LTP recorded in these animals back to WT levels (panel f), Fig. <ref

target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Since A 1 receptor levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>) are not changed in transgenic animals, and we obtain the same A 2A R effect on synaptic

now presented suggest that an increase in neuronal A 2A R is sufficient to drive age-like changes also in adenosine modulation and consequent LTP impairment.</s><s>In accordance, the LTP magnitude that we obtained from young adult Tg(CaMKII-hA 2A R) animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2g</ref>) is similar to the LTP observed previously in aged animals <ref type="bibr"

further reinforces this relationship.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies already hinted on a direct A 2A R-HPA axis link, but data were contradictory.</s><s>Global knockout of the A 2A R was shown to impact on both plasma corticosterone levels and melanocyte stimulating hormone levels of pro-opiomelacortin expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s><s>This was mainly mediated by a profound effect on adenosine tonic modulation by the deletion of the gene during embryonic and postnatal development, which occurs both centrally and systemically.</s><s>Exposure to higher levels of corticosterone in early-life, as occurs in these KO animals, induces an independent disruption of the inhibitory hippocampal-hypothalamic feedback control of corticosterone release resulting in chronic higher levels of this hormone in plasma, as we have demonstrated previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Due to the intrinsic limitations of that constitutive model, the authors could not prove whether the central effects would simply derive from knocking out A 2A R KO in the adrenal glands.</s><s>Our current model overcomes this confounding factor, since CAMKIIa activity which drives A 2A R expression occurs only from postnatal day 4 onwards, mainly in glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> , thus inducing an age-like physiological pattern of A 2A R overexpression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The transducing pathways by which A 2A R trigger GR/GRE transcriptional activity remain to be elucidated.</s><s>Given the complexicity of A 2A R signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> and its engagement in numerous signalosome protein complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> , this has been difficult to dissect.</s><s>A 2A R can recruit multiple signaling pathways, being the most common in the hippocampus the cAMP/PKA/CREB, PKC and MAPK pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> .</s><s>Our data indicate that A 2A R effects are probably associated to the activation of PKA rather than PKC.</s><s>The effects observed in GILZ and Bcl-2 expression levels in Tg(CaMKII-hA 2A R) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d</ref>) may thus result either from the modulation of GR actions on the glucocorticoid response element (GRE), or reflect an independent action following A 2A R-driven CREB activation and binding to cyclic AMP response elements (CREs).</s><s>It is known that CREB is a positive activator of Bcl-2 expression in rat <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand, Per1 gene contains CRE responsive elements and its levels are elevated by activation of CREB <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> .</s><s>If A 2A R would act directly through CRE in our model, one would expect an up-regulation of both Bcl-2 and Per1 in Tg(CaMKII-hA 2A R) animals.</s><s>However, we observed a clear down-regulation of Bcl-2 and no differences in Per1 expression, which is consistent with a response to the GR downregulation and less GRE-mediated gene expression, rather than a CRE-activation for these two genes.</s><s>Furthermore, there is no evidence of putative binding sites for CRE in the rat GILZ, neither in the literature nor in databases such as TRED (Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database).</s><s>Alternatively, a direct protein kinase A (PKA) modulation of GR binding to GRE is also possible, as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> .</s><s>PKA exerts a regulatory role in the activation of multiple nuclear hormone receptors.</s><s>For example, it has been shown that PKA activates GR-dependent DNA binding in cotransfection studies.</s><s>In addition, PKA can directly phosphorylate GR in vitro, enhances transcription by the retinoic acid receptor, and regulates dimerization of human estrogen receptor-α (revised in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> ) It has been shown that PKA associates with GR and potentiates GR-dependent transcription, namely that PKA attenuates GR cross-repression <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> .</s><s>Our observation that tg(CaMKII-hA 2A R) have an enhanced A 2A R-PKA activation associated to an increased sensitivity to dexamethasone favours the latter hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>Finally, there is an apparent paradox that arises from the present study: the fact that both stress and A 2A R upregulation decrease GR levels in the hippocampus, while simultaneously potentiating GR activation.</s><s>The former is however reconciled by the fact that GR activation is an important pathway to decrease GR expression and activation effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> , particularly upon chronic exposure to glucocorticoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> as in chronic stress or aging.</s><s>Indeed, this combination of GR downregulation and increased levels of cortisol is observed upon aging: while GR mRNA is significantly reduced in several hippocampal subfields (i.e.</s><s>stratum granulosum and temporal hippocampus proper) of aged cognitively impaired rats compared to young animals, their cortisol levels take significantly longer to return to baseline following an acute stressor, and this was significantly correlated with poorer spatial learning ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, by increasing GR nuclear location and GR-mediated transcription, A 2A R not only increase the susceptibility to stress, but also, through the same pathway, contribute to the downregulation of GR.</s><s>Whether GR are more prone to activation in these conditions due to increased nuclear localization, a higher affinity for DNA, or to faster kinetics, remains to be clarified.</s><s>Additionally, a redistribution of GR receptors in the hippocampus was also observed after exposure to corticosteroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> which may also account for a modified susceptibility upon higher circulating corticosterone levels.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our results provide the first evidence for a functional interaction between GR and A 2A Rs, revealing that A 2A R modulate GR transcriptional activity and nuclear localization directly affecting GR target genes.</s><s>Moreover, we demonstrate that this interaction impacts GR-mediated effects on synaptic plasticity, and that A 2A R blockade prevents the deleterious effects associated with GR activation/function.</s><s>Our data also reveal that this interaction may be particularly important in situations where A 2A R are over-activated, such as in chronic stress or aging, possibly due to an activation of the PKA pathway.</s></p><p><s>The beneficial effects of A 2A R antagonists, namely caffeine, against cognitive impairments may be, at least partially, due to the now reported effects on GR.</s><s>The expansion of this interaction to the immune response, cell proliferation, tumor response and other cellular functions that imply GR or corticosteroids use in therapeutics, could have an enormous clinical impact.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
