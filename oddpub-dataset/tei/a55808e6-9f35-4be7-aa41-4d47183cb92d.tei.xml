contributes to restoration of ion gradients following moderate neuronal activation in brain slices.</s><s>Indeed, the elevations of potassium concentration observed in the present study might be sufficient to induce astrocytic lactate release in line with a recent report <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Sotelo-Hitschfeld et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The recovery kinetics of stimulus-induced K ϩ , Na ϩ , and Ca 2ϩ concentration changes were significantly prolonged due to blockade of the neuronal MCT2 by 4-CIN.</s><s>Orthodromic but not antidromic population spikes were decreased by 4-CIN, at least partially due to activation of K ATP channels.</s><s>The aforementioned effects were mediated by a shortage of ATP rather than a direct effect on the lactate HCA1 receptor as HCA1 agonists led to effects which were opposite to those of 4-CIN.</s><s>Indeed the decreased respiration and mitochondrial redox changes upon 4-CIN application indicated a significant contribution of lactate uptake to energy metabolism in spite of ample supply of glucose.</s></p><p><s>Effects of lactate uptake blockade on synaptic signaling.</s><s>Similarly to previous findings in nucleus tractus solitarii neurons and in hippocampal area CA1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Nagase et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Galeffi et al. 2007</ref>) synaptic signaling is reduced following reduced lactate uptake via MCT2.</s><s>The 4-CIN effect on evoked potentials could be explained by a decrease in cytosolic ATP concentration leading to activation of K ATP channels.</s><s>This conclusion is supported by the observed effect of glibenclamide.</s><s>In addition to activation of K ATP channels, decreased ATP synthesis could also directly impair synaptic signaling by interfering with transmitter recycling and vesicle packaging.</s><s>With respect to this, it is of importance that 4-CIN depressed the changes in PO 2 associated with purely presynaptic axonal activation.</s><s>In high concentrations, 4-CIN might interfere with pyruvate uptake into mitochondria.</s><s>However, introduction of 4-CIN into the intracellular space by patch electrodes had no effect on postsynaptic potentials suggesting MCT2 as the main target for 4-CIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Nagase et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, 4-CIN bath applied for 20 min would never fully equilibrate the slices in interface chambers and thus it is very unlikely that there is enough accumulation of 4-CIN intracellularly to block pyruvate import into mitochondria.</s><s>Alternatively, the 4-CIN effects on synaptic transmission could be mediated by activation of HCA1 receptors.</s><s>Blockade of lactate uptake into neurons is presumably associated with extracellular lactate accumulation However, the decreased efficacy of synaptic signaling was not due to extracellular lactate accumulation as activation of these receptors by 3,5-DHBA did not mimic the effects of 4-CIN and indeed augmented antidromic and orthodromic population spikes rather than reducing them as was observed during application of 4-CIN.</s><s>The fact that in presence of 4-CIN pH was shifted by 0.1 units is compatible with an extracellular lactate accumulation by 6 mM since addition of 6 mM lactic acid to the aCSF shifted the pH in this solution by the same amount.</s></p><p><s>Contribution of neuronal lactate uptake to maintenance of ion homeostasis.</s><s>Application of 4-CIN led to an increase in baseline [K ϩ ] o , suggesting that baseline Na ϩ -K ϩ -ATPase activity relies on lactate-dependent ATP synthesis.</s><s>In spite of the initial decrease in orthodromic population spikes by 4-CIN, the maximum amplitude of stimulus-induced [K ϩ ] o changes was not significantly altered during repetitive stimulation suggesting that 4-CIN had little effect on extracellular K ϩ accumulation.</s><s>If 4-CIN would diminish glial uptake either by spatial buffering of K ϩ or by KCl couptake, then the rise in K ϩ would be enlarged.</s><s>This was indeed found when extracellular K ϩ accumulation during repetitive stimulation or during extracellular K ϩ accumulation were studied in the presence of low levels of Ba 2ϩ , which lead to depolarization of astrocytes and blockage of astrocytic Kir 4.1 channels <ref type="bibr">(Gabriel et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jauch et al. 2002</ref>).</s><s>An effect of 4-CIN on astrocytic membranes is also not expected as K ϩ buffering requires practically no energy and also KCl uptake is largely energy independent driven by Cl Ϫ and K ϩ leak channels.</s><s>In fact
