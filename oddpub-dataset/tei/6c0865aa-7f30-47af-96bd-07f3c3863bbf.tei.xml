<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>CD8 + T cell responses play an important role in the clearance of intracellular pathogens and in protection from subsequent infections.</s><s>CD8 + T cells react to epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) molecules at the cell surface.</s><s>Epitope generation usually starts through proteasomal processing of pathogen-derived intracellular proteins.</s><s>Peptides released by the proteasome are translocated by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they may undergo N-terminal trimming by ER-resident aminopeptidases (ERAPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cascio et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rock et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sijts and Kloetzel, 2011)</ref> and are loaded onto MHC class I molecules for presentation at the cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Groettrup et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Given the central role of proteasomes in MHC class I antigen processing, their catalytic activity plays a fundamental role in shaping the pathogen-derived peptide repertoire toward which CD8 + T cells may react.</s><s>The catalytic activity of proteasomes is displayed by three subunits, b1, b2, and b5, which are replaced by the induced catalytic subunits b1i/LMP2, b2i/ MECL1, and b5i/LMP7 when cells are exposed to an inflammatory milieu <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Groettrup et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sijts and Kloetzel, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The changes in the catalytic subunit composition induce subtle modifications in conformation of the active sites, which affect proteasome proteolytic dynamics, and have consequences for the quantities of peptides produced <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arciniega et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Liepe et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mishto et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ruschak and Kay, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sijts et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Proteasomes can simply hydrolyze the peptide bonds of the antigen, thereby releasing canonical non-spliced peptides, or splice two distal fragments of the antigen, thereby generating peptides with a novel sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Vigneron et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The latter mechanism is called proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mishto et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite the well-established crucial role of proteasomes in MHC class I antigen processing, the immunological relevance of PCPS is still a matter of debate, in part because only a few proteasome-generated spliced epitopes, mainly derived from tumor-associated antigens <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dalet et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ebstein et al.,

type="bibr" target="#b33">Warren et al., 2006)</ref>, have been described so far.</s><s>Some recent studies, however, hint at the importance of PCPS in MHC class I antigen presentation.</s><s>Indeed, based on mass spectrometry (MS) analyses, approximately one-third of the peptides presented by MHC class I molecules on human lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cells are proteasome-generated spliced peptides, and one-third of self-antigens presented by MHC class I on these cells are represented by spliced peptides only <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Liepe et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Such a significant increase in the variety of peptides potentially recognized by CD8 + T cells due to PCPS is also strengthened by their amount, which has been calculated in the order of one fourth of the MHC class I-restricted self-peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Liepe et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>This is in agreement with the amount of tumor-associated spliced epitopes presented by human MHC class I molecules at the cell surface, as shown for the gp100 mel antigen <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ebstein et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The relevance of PCPS in the cell-mediated immune response during infections is still unknown.</s><s>We recently described crossreactivity of CD8 + T cells, primed during L. monocytogenes by the dominant listeriolysin O (LLO)-derived epitope LLO 296-304 , toward the spliced epitope LLO 294/297-304 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Platteel et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, so far, no clear evidence that PCPS leads to spliced peptide-specific CD8 + T cell responses during infection has been found.</s><s>The scarcity of knowledge on the role of PCPS in immune recognition illustrates the difficulty of identifying immunologically relevant spliced epitopes, which lies in adopting a reverse immunology approach, requiring a complex in silico-in vitro workflow.</s><s>To propel further investigation into the role of PCPS in antigen processing, we have developed a multi-level spliced epitope identification strategy, which we tested in the murine L. monocytogenes infection model.</s><s>L. monocytogenes is a Gram-positive bacterium that primarily infects phagocytes and then mobilizes the host cell cytoskeleton to spread to neighboring cells.</s><s>To enter the cytosol of infected cells, the bacteria secrete LLO and the phospholipases PlcA/phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and PlcB/phosphatidylcholine-preferring phospholipase C (PC-PLC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bielecki et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pamer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Portnoy et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>Bacterial clearance during L. monocytogenes infection is mediated by CD8 + T cells specific for the secreted bacterial proteins.</s><s>Therefore, to test and validate our spliced epitope identification approach, we decided to use the secreted PlcA and PlcB proteins as model antigens.</s></p></div>

triggering T cell activation.</s><s>Given the absence of a CD8 + T cell response (1) toward the spliced PlcB epitopes in uninfected mice, (2) toward a non-spliced peptide sharing part of the spliced epitope sequence in infected mice, and (3) toward EL4 cells expressing a PlcB variant in which the MHC class I anchor sites of the two spliced epitopes are mutated, the possibility of cross-reactivity of the spliced PlcB epitope-specific CD8 + T cells is unlikely.</s><s>This is further supported by the absence of other peptides produced by proteasomes and predicted to efficiently bind to H-2K b

of H-2K b molecules bound to the control epitope LLO 296-304 .</s><s>Comparing the data for all spliced peptides tested, we found a significant inverse correlation between the predicted IC 50 and the measured half-lives of H-2K b -peptide complexes at the cell surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6D</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, we also found a significant direct correlation between the half-lives of H-2K b -peptide complexes and the relative frequency of IFN-g + CD8 + T cells among infected mouse' splenocytes for the spliced peptides derived from PlcB (Figure <ref type="figure"
