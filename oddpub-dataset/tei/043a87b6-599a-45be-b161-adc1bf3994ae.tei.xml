<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In our study, we explored the time course of the MST1 phosphorylation level and cellular localization, as well as the function and mechanism of MST1 in the early brain injury during SAH.</s><s>We determined that the phosphorylated MST1 expression was increased at 12 h after SAH compared to the sham group, with a peak at 72 h.</s><s>It was colocalized with the microglia marker Iba1 in the cortex.</s><s>A high dose of XMU-MP-1 (15 mg/kg), identified as an inhibitor of MST1/ 2, alleviated the neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB disruption caused by SAH.</s><s>In addition, to rule out nonspecific effects of the MST1 inhibitor, we also used shRNA (packaged by AAV) to in vivo knock down MST1; the downregulation of MST1 increased the neurological score and reduced the neuroinflammation, BBB disruption, and white matter injury.</s><s>MST1 knockdown suppressed the NF-κB-MMP-9 pathway, thus preserving the reduced tight junction proteins.</s><s>In summary, these results supported our hypothesis that MST1 suppression could alleviate early brain injury in SAH mice by inhibiting the NF-κB/MMP-9 pathway.</s><s>After subarachnoid hemorrhage, BBB disruption contributes to brain edema, followed by brain swelling, increased intracranial pressure, neuronal death, and neurologic deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response may increase BBB permeability after SAH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>However, the involvement of MST1 and its associated pathological process is unknown.</s><s>MST1, the mammalian Hippo ortholog, is the central component of the Hippo pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies have suggested that MST1 activation contributes to neuronal apoptosis and inflammation.</s><s>Genetic deletion of MST1 may reduce the inflammation and microglial activation after spinal cord injury and ischemic stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with these reports, we determined that pharmacological inhibition of MST1 or its knockdown alleviated the neurological deficits, brain edema, and BBB disruption induced by SAH.</s><s>Furthermore, the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines was suppressed by MST1 inhibition, which is associated with NF-κB inhibition.</s><s>The activation of MMPs, particularly MMP-9, may contribute to the disruption of the BBB via degradation of tight junction proteins after SAH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our current results suggested that MST1 suppression repressed the MMP-9 expression, alleviated the degradation of tight junction proteins, and reduced the leakage of Evans blue dye.</s><s>Moreover, we determined that the cytoplasmnuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB was substantially decreased by MST1 suppression.</s><s>MST1 has been associated with the immunological response in various systems.</s><s>Our results demonstrated that increased MST1 contributes to the higher expressions of cytokines (TNF-α) and chemokines (I-309, ICAM-1, M-CSF, MCP-1, CCL3, CXCL12, CXCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10), which play vital roles in neuroinflammation and early brain injury after SAH.</s><s>Salojin et al. knocked out MST1 to alleviate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and improve collagen-induced arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, MST1-mediated dendritic cell-(DC-) dependent Th17 differentiation has been shown to regulate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and antifungal immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Kurz</ref>  neutrophils were unable to migrate into inflamed tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>However, to date, the mechanisms by which MST1 and its downstream pathways affect neuroinflammation in acute central neural system injuries remain unknown and require further investigation.</s></p><p><s>After SAH, acute white matter injury is an important pathological process during early brain injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Several recent studies have indicated that the activation of MMP-9 contributed to SAH-induced white matter injury.</s><s>Genetic deletion of MMP-9 may alleviate the white matter damage observed after SAH <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Our studies also indicated a role of MST1 in activating MMP-9; therefore, we evaluated the effect of MST1 suppression on white matter after SAH.</s><s>Consistent with previous studies, pretreatment with MST1 shRNA partially rescued the reduction in MBP (marker of myelin degradation) expression caused by SAH, whereas the elevated expression of β-APP (maker of axonal damage) induced by SAH was moderately inhibited by MST1 shRNA pretreatment.</s><s>These results suggested that MST1 suppression protects nerve fibers and reduces brain edema after SAH.</s></p><p><s>The present study has several limitations.</s><s>First, we investigated the short-term neuroprotective effects of MST1 suppression within 3 days after SAH.</s><s>The long-term effects of MST1 suppression should also be examined in the future to  further understand the MST1 involvement after SAH.</s><s>In addition, XMU-MP-1 is an inhibitor of MST1/2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Although MST1 and MST2 have been shown to have the same effects in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, they may not be equivalent in SAH.</s><s>Thus, we cannot eliminate the possibility that MST2 suppression provided the neuroprotective effects for the early brain injury post-SAH.</s><s>Finally, we explored the relation between MST1 and NF-κB-MMP-9;
