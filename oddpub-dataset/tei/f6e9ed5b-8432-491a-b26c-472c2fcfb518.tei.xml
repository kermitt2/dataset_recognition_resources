<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Heart failure is characterised by high mortality irrespective of the predominance of either systolic or diastolic functional impairment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Several imaging techniques are available to characterise its aetiology and severity, amongst which cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has a pivotal role.</s><s><ref type="bibr">3e5</ref> In particular, the opportunity of easy and fast quantitative image analyses makes this technique attractive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>There is evidence to suggest that quantitative deformation imaging derived strain assessment based on echocardiographic speckle tracking has higher value for the prediction of mortality than ejection fraction (EF) in consecutive patients subjected to echocardiography. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>CMRderived myocardial feature tracking (FT), a technique analogous to echocardiography speckle tracking, derives similar quantitative deformation parameters from routinely available steady state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences.</s><s>Reasonable agreement between speckle tracking and CMR-FT has been demonstrated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Furthermore, CMR-FT agrees well with myocardial tagging, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> which is considered the reference standard for CMR quantitative wall-motion assessment, but the former does not require the acquisition of additional sequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Its clinical applicability has been demonstrated in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, <ref type="bibr">8,11e13</ref> its feasibility of detailed assessments of systolic and diastolic cardiovascular physiology has been demonstrated, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and there is evidence of prognostic relevance in dilated cardiomyopathy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Although the vast majority of such studies have been carried out with the software provided by TomTec Imaging Systems (Diogenes or 2D Cardiac Performance Analysis-MR, TomTec GmbH, Unterschleissheim, Germany) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> recently Circle Cardiovascular Imaging (cvi 42 , Calgary, Canada) have introduced an alternative tool called Tissue Tracking.</s><s>Given the fact that a widespread clinical use of these new measures of deformation is highly desirable and likely important, prerequisites to achieve this goal are to ensure that the assessments are reproducible and comparable with a high amount of intervendor agreement.</s><s>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the reproducibility and intervendor agreement of both commercially available types of software for the derivation of ventricular circumferential (Ecc) and radial (Err) strains, as well as rotational mechanics expressed as left ventricular (LV) torsion.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods</head><p><s>The study cohort consisted of 10 healthy volunteers.</s><s>CMR imaging was carried out on a 1.5 T system (Intera R 12.6.1.3,</s><s>Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands).</s><s>All participants gave written informed consent after approval of the study protocol by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CMR imaging</head><p><s>The CMR examination was carried out in the supine position using a five-channel cardiac surface coil.</s><s>Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated SSFP cine sequences were acquired during brief periods of breath-holding in 12 to 14 equidistant short-axis planes completely covering the LV.</s><s>Typical CMR parameters were as follows: 8 mm section thickness; 1e2 mm gap; 360Â480 mm field of view; 196Â172 matrix size.</s><s>Dobutamine stress CMR imaging was performed as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Complete short-axis stacks were acquired at rest and with 10 and 20 mg/kg/min dobutamine, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CMR-FT</head><p><s>CMR-FT was performed using dedicated software provided by TomTec Imaging Systems (2D CPA MR, Cardiac Performance Analysis, Version 1.1.2.36) and Circle Cardiovascular Imaging (Tissue Tracking, cvi 42 ).</s><s>For the purposes of this paper the different software tools are referred to as "TomTec" and "Circle".</s><s>Identical short axis sections were analysed at apical, mid-ventricular, and basal levels to compare short-axis-derived global LV Ecc and Err (based on all three analysed sections) alongside the time-to-peak (TPK) strain duration.</s><s>Short-axis CMR images were analysed at rest and with 10 and 20 mg/kg/min dobutamine, respectively.</s><s>Myocardial torsion was calculated from the rotational raw data provided with the TomTec software using an in-house-developed post-processing tool as recently described by the authors' group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>The model underlying this assessment makes use of linear interpolation and takes standardized rotational measurements at 25 and 75% LV locations after the analysis of a whole LV short axis stack.</s><s>In this model the most apical section showing LV cavity at end-systole is considered at the 0% LV location and the most basal section including a complete circumference of myocardium at end-systole is considered at the 100% LV location.</s><s>In comparison to TomTec, Circle commercially provides torsion measurements within its software interface.</s><s>This is done by manually choosing an apical and basal section.</s><s>In order to allow accurate comparisons between vendors, apical and basal sections at the closest distance to 25% and 75% LV locations were chosen.</s></p><p><s>With both types of software LV endocardial and epicardial borders were manually delineated in all analysed sections with the initial contour set at end-diastole.</s><s>In case of insufficient tracking, as defined by apparent deviations of the contours from the endocardial and epicardial borders, contours were manually corrected and the algorithm reapplied.</s><s>The tracking was repeated three times in all sections.</s><s>One single observer analysed all data using both types of software.</s><s>Intra-observer variability was derived from the repetition of the analysis after 4 weeks.</s><s>The analysis of a second skilled observer for both types of software was used to assess interobserver reproducibility.</s></p><p><s>Reported results are based on the average of three analysis repetitions (R3).</s><s>To study the impact of repeated measurements on reproducibility, the reproducibility derived from results based on a single repetition (R1), averaged results for two (R2) and three repetitions (R3) were compared with each other.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Statistical analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 for Windows.</s><s>Data are expressed as mean (AE standard deviations).</s><s>Pairwise nonparametric data at rest and with increasing levels of dobutamine were compared using the Wilcoxon test.</s><s>Significance was determined at &lt;0.05.</s><s>The intra-and interobserver variability was assessed using three different methods: intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), BlandeAltman analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and coefficients of variation (CoV).</s><s>The CoV was defined as the standard deviation of the differences divided by the mean. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>The level of agreement was defined as previously described: excellent for ICC&gt;0.74,</s><s>good for ICC ¼ 0.60e0.74,</s><s>fair for ICC ¼ 0.40e0.59,</s><s>and poor for ICC&lt;0.4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 5</head><p><s>Intervendor agreement and reproducibility for torsion, circumferential and radial strain based on single measurements (R1).</s><s>TomTec as compared to Circle.</s><s>This may be related to the fact that TomTec has been around for several years and been subjected to changes of the tracking algorithm several times (last change in December 2012); however, Circle showed better reproducibility for Err than TomTec.</s><s>Considering these results, further refinements in the performance and subsequent increases in agreement between vendors and within vendors seem highly desirable.</s><s>To achieve this, the impact of repeated measurements and subsequent averaging of results was tested.</s><s>Although each of the parameters shows somewhat improved intervendor agreement and intravendor reproducibility with repeated analysis runs, this effect is most evident for myocardial torsion (reduction of intervendor CoV from 55% to 38%, see Tables <ref type="table">3 and 5</ref>).</s><s>In comparison, three repetitions have a lower effect on Ecc as opposed to the lesser reproducible myocardial torsion.</s><s>Even though Err has comparable reproducibility to myocardial torsion there is only modest improvement of reproducibility with repeated analyses based on CoV and no improvement based on ICC.</s><s>Consequently, one needs to decide whether the positive effects of repeated analyses on intervendor agreement and intravendor reproducibility for most parameters would justify a threefold increased analysis time, especially in the setting of a large volume clinical practice.</s><s>Doubling or tripling the time of analysis with an increase from about 9e12 to 27e35 minutes may represent a limitation of the feasibility of CMR-FT for clinical routine.</s><s>From a time versus cost view, the analysis based on three repetitions may consequently not proof costeffective.</s><s>From a time versus use standpoint, the clinical applicability of both software types seems comparable because of similar analysis durations for a single case with either software; however the fact that Circle provides built-in torsion measurements within their software interface may well enhance the clinical feasibility of deriving this parameter.</s><s>In comparison, at present Tom-Tec derived rotational displacement and resulting data need to be further analysed, in the present case with inhouse Matlab software, for torsion calculation.</s><s>An automatic and consistent selection of the apical and basal levels for the estimation of torsion removes the human factor in the selection of sections (in this study not accounted in the results of Circle, the sections were predefined in each case).</s><s>In the present study, reproducibility was comparable using either software suggesting reliability of both approaches.</s></p><p><s>When interpreting the results of the current study, it is important to note that the main user action involves the manual delineation of the endocardial and epicardial contours in the first frame of an existing sequence of images, to start the tracking algorithm and to correct the initial contours if the tracking is not sufficient or has failed.</s><s>The identification of these two initial contours is easily and quickly performed by a skilled user.</s><s>Nevertheless, this factor introduces considerable variability in the results.</s><s>This can be explained by the intrinsic difficulty to estimate rotation and strain metrics neglecting the out-of-plane movement that the myocardium experiences through the heart cycle.</s></p><p><s>Having two vendors performing similarly in terms of reproducibility suggests that FT in conventional short axis CMR has fundamental limitations that need to be tackled by the combination of different views in an attempt to reconstruct the true three-dimensional (3D) deformations and strains.</s></p></div>
