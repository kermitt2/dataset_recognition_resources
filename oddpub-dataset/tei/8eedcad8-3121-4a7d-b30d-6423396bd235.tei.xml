<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>We bred ATP6AP2 flox/1 females with male mice expressing Cre recombinase under the Lck promoter (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; available on the Blood Web site).</s><s>Male mice with PRR conditionally deleted from T cells (ATP6AP2 flox/y ;Lck Cre ) are hereafter referred to as "cKO."</s><s>Full methods are available online (see supplemental Methods).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p><s>The cellularity of peripheral lymphoid organs and blood were analyzed by flow cytometry.</s><s>In PRR cKO mice, a significant decrease in CD3 1 T cells was observed in all tissues, with no difference in the number of B, macrophage, or dendritic cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>; supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2-3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A striking reduction in both CD4 1 and CD8 1 naïve T cells was evident, with no change in the number of peripheral T-cell receptor (TCR) gd cells observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>As PRR is found to be essential for homeostasis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> we asked if the remaining peripheral T cells had the PRR gene excised.</s><s>We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that specifically amplified a segment of the PRR gene only after it was mutated by Cre recombination (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Using this approach, we could detect the recombined gene (ie, with the PRR gene excised) in thymic but not peripheral CD90.2 1 T cells, which expressed similar levels of PRR protein as control T cells (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results indicate that peripheral cKO T cells simply do not develop or survive.</s><s>Instead, those few cells that do not recombine the PRR gene have an enormous selective advantage and reach the periphery.</s></p><p><s>The striking reduction in peripheral naïve T cells is consistent with a defect in thymic T-cell development, so we turned our focus to this organ.</s><s>A severe atrophy of PRR cKO thymi was observed, evidenced by a reduction in weight and cellularity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>PRR cKO thymi had a 10-fold increase in the proportion of double-negative (DN) thymocytes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>A significant increase in the proportion of intermediate single-positive (ISP) and TCRgd cells was observed, whereas all other populations were decreased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>The number of DN cells was unchanged, whereas the numbers of ISP, DP, CD8 SP, CD4 SP, and regulatory T cells were reduced (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Histologic analysis indicated that the loss of SP T cells was associated with a reduction in the thymic medulla of cKO mice but preserved corticomedullary junction (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>), consistent with other models of severe SP T-cell loss. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>No change in the number of TCRgd cells was evident.</s><s>This is unsurprising as the lineage commitment for TCRgd cells begins at the DN2 stage, prior to Lck-driven Cre recombinase expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>Taken together, the almost 100-fold  reduction in SP cells indicates that PRR cKO mice have drastically altered thymocyte development.</s></p><p><s>We next analyzed early T-cell developmental events (DN1-4).</s><s>There was an increase in the proportion of DN3 cells in cKO mice, which was correlated with a decreased proportion of DN4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>These proportional changes were not associated with differences in the number of DN3 or DN4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>At the DN3 stage, cells commit to the T-cell lineage and rearrange the TCR b-chain gene locus.</s><s>PCR products corresponding to rearranged TCRb locus were detected in both control and cKO cells, indicating that this process was not disturbed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>There was no difference in intracellular TCRb levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next performed gene expression analysis of sorted DN3 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>; supplemental Table <ref type="table">1A</ref>).</s><s>In cKO, 615 and 518 genes were up-and downregulated .1.5-fold.</s><s>Of these, 9 genes were significantly different and encoded molecules important for processes including the cell cycle (Mcts1, Cetn2), mitochondria (Tomm7, Uqcrh) and vesicular trafficking (Ier3ip1, Rabac1).</s><s>We next performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on the differentially expressed genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>; supplemental Table <ref type="table">1B</ref>).</s><s>Several GO pathways were enriched in cKO DN3 cells, indicating disturbances in transcription, translation, and the mitochondria.</s><s>Collectively, these represent cellular activities essential for this developmental period, providing an explanation for why PRR deletion has such a profound effect on T-cell development.</s></p><p><s>Comparing our findings to conditional deletion of the Wnt pathway in T cells, several similarities are evident: reduction in peripheral T cells and a change in the proportion of DN3:DN4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>However, overall it is clear that PRR deletion induces a more profound phenotype.</s><s>Wnt cKO led to an increase in the proportion of DN cells to 12%, and a partial block at the DN3-DN4 transition, leading to an increased number of DN3 cells and decreased DN4.</s><s>In the periphery, there was a fourfold reduction in T cells, which did have the b-catenin deleted allele. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>In contrast, PRR cKO leads to an increase in the proportion of DN cells to ;50% of thymocytes, we detect no increase in the number of DN3 cells, and we find that DN4 numbers are decreased only in old mice (data not shown).</s><s>Furthermore, we are unable to detect the deleted allele in peripheral T cells, indicating that PRR-deficient T cells do not develop/survive.</s><s>To understand these results further, we sorted thymocytes and again performed PCR to specifically identify cKO cells.</s><s>This revealed the presence of cKO cells beyond the DN3 stage, including DN4, DP, and CD4 SP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>).</s><s>We analyzed DP cells further and observed an impaired survival and, subsequently, rearrangement of the TCR a chain (Tcra) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H-I</ref>).</s><s>Thus, given the striking severity of our phenotype, that no single precursor thymocyte population accumulates, and that we also observe defects in DP cells, we propose that deletion of PRR affects thymocyte survival and development from DN3 and beyond (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2J</ref>).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Abnormal thymic T-cell development in PRR cKO mice.</s><s>(A) Absolute numbers of T (all CD3 1 ), B, macrophage, and dendritic cells from spleens of 7-to 8-weekold mice were determined by flow cytometry.</s><s>(B) Absolute numbers of naïve (CD44 lo CD62L 1 ) CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells and gdT cells.</s><s>(C) Morphology, tissue weight, cellularity, and number of CD3 1 cells of thymi from 6-week-old mice.</s><s>(D) Thymocytes from 6-week-old control and cKO mice were analyzed by flow cytometry.</s><s>The gating strategy for CD4 and CD8 expression is shown.</s><s>(E) From panel D: the percentage (top) and number (bottom) of DN, ISP, double-positive (DP), CD4 single-positive (SP), CD8 SP, TCRgd, and regulatory T (Treg) cells.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,57.03,66.73,478.04,442.49" type="bitmap" /></figure>
