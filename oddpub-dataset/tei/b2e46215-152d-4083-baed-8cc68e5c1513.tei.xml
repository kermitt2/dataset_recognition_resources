<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized trial included 18 centers from 8 European countries, and was registered with the US National Institutes of Health (NCT00876525, www.clinicaltrials.org).</s><s>Patients were enrolled as part of a US Food and Drug Administration study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</head><p><s>Patients were referred for native or prosthetic aortic valve replacement and had to be at least 18 years old and capable of providing written informed consent.</s><s>Patients with previously implanted mitral or tricuspid prostheses, active endocarditis, or congenital bicuspid valves or those requiring concomitant valve replacement were excluded.</s><s>Clinical examination and transthoracic echocardiography were performed after hospital discharge, at 3 to 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up (follow-up window, 11 to 13 months).</s><s>The ethical committee of each center approved the study.</s><s>An independent Clinical Events Committee adjudicated the reason for primary cause of death, valve explant, and specific adverse events.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valve Description</head><p><s>The FS consists of two pericardial sheets: the inner sheet originates the three valvular cusps, and the outer sheet is trimmed as a collar that allows the valve to be sutured to the aortic wall (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Pericardium is fixed using a lowpressure glutaraldehyde solution and detoxified with homocysteic acid, which has been demonstrated to reduce mineralization in vitro and in vivo through the neutralization of unbound glutaraldehyde groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Although the Pericarbon Freedom stentless valve required two suture lines during implantation, the FS can be implanted with a single suture line in a totally supra annular position, following O'Brien's technique (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Seven hundred two patients were recruited for the study between March 2009 and September 2012.</s><s>Eleven patients were withdrawn before surgery, and 75 patients were excluded during the procedure: 17 for heavily calcified aortic root, 15 for bicuspid valve discovered intraoperatively, and 43 for other anatomic reasons.</s><s>Eventually, 616 patients received the FS (mean age, 74.5 AE 5.9 years; male, 54.1%; log EuroSCORE, 10.1% AE 8%).</s><s>Systemic hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease were the main risk factors in the patient cohort (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The indication for aortic valve replacement was symptomatic pure stenosis in 410 patients (66.5%), mixed lesion in 197 patients (32.0%), and regurgitation in 8 patients (1.3%; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operative Technique</head><p><s>Full median sternotomy (90.6%) or limited partial sternotomy (9.4%) were used as the surgical approach.</s><s>Myocardial protection was achieved with cold crystalloid or blood cardioplegic solution delivered in antegrade or retrograde fashion, according to the surgeon's preference.</s><s>The aorta was opened with a transverse incision approximately 1 cm above the sinotubular junction, and the valve was excised with debridement of the annulus.</s><s>Valve sizing was performed, choosing the labeled valve size corresponding to the sizer that comfortably passed through the annulus.</s><s>Care was taken to not oversize the valve because the FS is already upsized by the manufacturer to obtain the best supra annular seating.</s><s>The valve was implanted through a single continuous suture line as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>After weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, transesophageal echocardiography was performed.</s><s>Anticoagulation therapy was administered according to each centers' standard practice for biologic valves.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Assessment and Follow-Up</head><p><s>Medical history, physical examination, laboratory results, electrocardiogram, New York Heart Association functional class assessment, and echocardiography were reported as per the study protocol preoperatively, at discharge, after 3 to 6 months, and at 1 year; follow-up was complete (100%) in all 544 active patients at 1 year (22 patients withdrew, 36 deaths, and 14 explants).</s><s>Data collection aimed at evaluating early ( 30 days) and late (&gt;30 days) postoperative outcomes along with the rate of adverse events, reported according to established guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preoperative and Postoperative Echocardiography</head><p><s>Hemodynamic performance of the FS was assessed using quantitative echocardiography in all patients, as established by the protocol.</s><s>Patients' echocardiographic examinations were read by an independent core laboratory.</s><s>Both the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta were recorded in a two-dimensional parasternal and four-chamber view.</s><s>Aortic geometry and diameters were registered in a parasternal long-axis view.</s><s>Subaortic and aortic Doppler flow velocities were recorded in the apical four-chamber view using pulsed-wave and continuous-wave Doppler mode.</s><s>Peak and mean aortic valve pressure gradients were calculated from the velocity measurements with a modified Bernoulli equation.</s><s>The LV mass was calculated according to the American Society of Echocardiography recommended formula and indexed to the body surface area to generate the LV mass index <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Platelet Counts</head><p><s>Periodic blood samples were drawn to evaluate postoperative platelet trending.</s><s>Platelet counts were assessed according to the protocol.</s><s>Thrombocytopenia was considered "severe" when the platelet count dropped to less than 50,000/mL <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>Cumulative survival and freedom from events were estimated through the Kaplan-Meier method, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).</s><s>For comparative analysis, hemodynamic data were expressed as mean AE standard deviations (SD) or median.</s><s>For descriptive analysis, data were expressed as number and percentage.</s><s>Student's t test was applied to compare echocardiographic data as a function of time.</s><s>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (release 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).</s></p><p><s>A probability value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operative Data</head><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> provides the operative results.</s><s>Approximately 50% of this cohort received a 23-mm valve or smaller.</s><s>One or more concomitant procedures were required in 43.2% of patients, with coronary artery bypass grafting being the most common (91.4%).</s><s>Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 64 minutes for isolated aortic valve replacement and greater than 71 minutes when additional procedures were required.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mortality</head><p><s>There were 9 deaths during the first 30 days after surgery (30-day mortality, 1.5%).</s><s>All of them were classified by the Clinical Event Committee.</s><s>Five deaths were classified as noncardiac causes, specifically stroke (2 patients), both occurred on the same day of surgery and were adjudicated as procedure-related, and multiorgan failure (3 patients); 2 deaths were classified as non-valve-related cardiac causes, myocardial infarction (1 patient) and ventricular arrhythmia (1 patient); and 2 deaths (0.3%) were classified as valve-related, 1 stroke and 1 sudden death (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>One-year mortality was 4.5% (27 deaths).</s><s>Seven deaths were adjudicated as valve-related (1.1%; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>), caused by cerebral bleeding (2 patients), endocarditis (1 patient), sudden death (1 patient), stroke (1 patient), bleeding (1 patient), and reoperation as a result of aortic regurgitation (1 patient).</s><s>Four deaths were classified as cardiacrelated, specifically progressive heart failure (2 patients) and myocardial infarction (2 patients).</s><s>The remaining 16 deaths were classified as non-cardiac-related: cerebral bleeding (2 patients) in patients with concomitant disease, carcinoma and lymphoma (2 patients), pulmonary  embolism (1 patient), sepsis (8 patients), stroke (1 patient) in a high-risk patient with a history of thromboembolism, and other uncategorized causes (2 patients).</s><s>Actuarial 1-year overall survival and freedom from valve-related death were 94.0% (95% CI, 91.7 to 95.6) and 98.6% (95% CI, 97.3 to 99.3), respectively (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events</head><p><s>Twenty-eight patients (4.5%) underwent early reoperation for bleeding at the surgical site, with 23 of them being performed on the day of surgery (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Other early adverse events included 1 patient who required a valve explant for endocarditis, and 2 patients who needed a valve explant for paravalvular leakage.</s><s>Ten patients (1.6%) had early stroke, resulting in 3 deaths.</s><s>Nineteen patients required a pacemaker implant (3.1%); in 8 patients (1.3%) this was a new atrioventricular conduction abnormality.</s><s>Three patients experienced early myocardial infarction (0.5%), with 1 death.</s><s>Late adverse events included 9 explants for endocarditis, 2 explants for paravalvular leakage, and 1 explant for structural valve deterioration (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Five patients (0.8%) experienced late strokes, 2 of them fatal, whereas 1 patient who had a stroke in the early postoperative period died after 30 days.</s><s>Three patients required a pacemaker implant during late follow-up, 1 for a new atrioventricular conduction problem.</s><s>Five late cases of myocardial infarction (0.8%) were reported, 2 of them leading to death.</s><s>Valve thrombosis was described in 1 patient at 5 months after surgery, but was successfully resolved by modifying the anticoagulation therapy.</s><s>One-year freedom from all-cause explant was 97.6% (95% CI, 95.9 to 98.6; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>), whereas freedom from structural valve deterioration was 99.8% (95% CI, 98.6 to 100).</s><s>Freedom from endocarditis, valve thrombosis, and non-structural valve dysfunction at 1 year were 97.9%, 99.7%, and 98.5%, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional Status and Hemodynamics</head><p><s>At 1 year, 96.9% of patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Valve gradients and effective orifice area at discharge were maintained at 1-year follow-up (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s><s>Overall mean pressure gradient was 6.9 AE 4.5 mm Hg and 7.2 AE 4.0 at discharge and 1 year, respectively.</s><s>Overall peak pressure gradient at discharge was 13.7 AE 8.7 mm Hg, whereas at 1 year it was 14.6 AE 7.9 mm Hg.</s><s>Overall effective orifice area was 1.6 AE 0.4 cm 2 and 1.5 AE 0.5 cm 2 at discharge and 1 year, respectively.</s><s>There was no significant difference between pressure gradients and effective orifice area both at discharge and during follow-up.</s><s>Indexed LV mass was 138 g/m 2 at discharge, 129 g/m 2 at 3 to 6 months, and 122 g/m 2 at 1 year, reflecting a decrease of 12% (p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="bibr">Fig 7)</ref>.</s><s>No cases of severe regurgitation were reported at each follow-up.</s><s>and negative heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody test required re-exploration for bleeding on the day of surgery, while 4 patients received a single unit of transfused platelets.</s><s>The remaining patients with early low platelet counts didn't experience any valve-related complications within the first year of follow-up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comment</head><p><s>Historically, tissue heart valves were anticipated to last for 10 to 15 years before calcific degeneration required their replacement.</s><s>Subsequent improvements in valve design and biologic materials have further reduced the rate of valve calcification and reoperation, with particular relevance in the elderly population, in which prolonged durability of bioprosthetic valves has been broadly reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</s><s>Stentless valves were introduced into clinical practice in the early 1990s with the goal of further improving clinical outcomes.</s><s>They were designed to be less obstructive to achieve lower transvalvular gradients and faster reduction of ventricular hypertrophy, but their implant technique was usually more complex and demanding.</s><s>The resulting prolonged aortic cross-clamp and surgical procedure times led to a limited adoption of these first-generation stentless valves.</s><s>Repossini and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> first described a single suture line technique with a modified Pericarbon Freedom stentless valve that resulted in a simplified procedure, optimizing at the same time hemodynamic performance thanks to the supra annular position.</s><s>The valve gained immediate interest because of the excellent clinical and hemodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the reduced cross-clamp time resulting from the modified implant technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The present study reports clinical and hemodynamic results from a prospective multicenter trial, representing the largest published experience with the FS at 1 year.</s><s>Furthermore, it demonstrates that implantation of the FS can be achieved with mean cross-clamp times, procedure times, and hemodynamic performance comparable with surgically inserted stented aortic valve prostheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>No intraoperative deaths were reported in the present series, and the low 30-day mortality (1.5%) demonstrates that good short-term clinical outcome can be achieved, despite the advance age of the cohort (80% of patients were older than 70 years).</s><s>Although there were a large number of risk factors, early and late mortality were comparable to those reported by Beholz and associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, with 1-year survival of 94.0% versus 90.4% and equivalent freedom from valve explant and endocarditis.</s><s>Adverse valve-related events, such as stroke, endocarditis, structural valve deterioration, nonstructural valve dysfunction, and valve thrombosis, were also rare in this series.</s></p><p><s>Hemodynamic performance was excellent as reflected by the functional status after surgery with 97% of the surviving patients in New York Heart Association functional classes I and II at 1 year.</s><s>The mean pressure gradient of 6.9 mm Hg in the early postoperative period increased trivially to no more than 7.2 mm Hg by the end of the first year with stable and low gradients observed in the small sizes as well.</s><s>As a result of these excellent hemodynamics, the mean LV mass index decreased by 12% in 1 year.</s></p><p><s>The current data confirm the results from a previous Italian multicenter study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The same study showed progressive reduction of the LV mass index from the immediate postoperative period throughout the 1-year follow-up.</s><s>In this study patients also underwent a stress echocardiography, which demonstrated a well-preserved hemodynamic profile of the FS during exercise.</s><s>Superior hemodynamic performance of the FS is achieved by the supra annular seating, which aligns the valve orifice to the patient's tissue annulus, preventing any impingement in the sewing ring, as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>According to Jamieson and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, age is a risk factor for endocarditis.</s><s>Comparing cohorts of patients with the same mean age <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref>, endocarditis rates in this study compare favorably both in the early period (0.3% versus 0.5%) and at 1-year follow-up (97.6% versus 96.0%).</s><s>Similar data are reported by Beholz and associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The indication for a permanent pacemaker implant for complete atrioventricular block was less common (1.3%) in the present series than in studies for other valves, in which it ranged from 3% to 6.6% <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref>.</s><s>One of these experiences demonstrated a statistically significant increase of the 30-day mortality in patients requiring a pacemaker implant (4.2%) versus patients not requiring it (1%; p ¼ 0.046) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Although it cannot be unequivocally proven by this study alone, the low incidence of postoperative atrioventricular block may be related to the supra annular implant position of the FS and the relatively reduced compression on the bundle of His.</s><s>Similar low rates of permanent pacemaker implants have been reported in a previous experience with the FS <ref type="bibr"
