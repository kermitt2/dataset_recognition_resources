<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Image Concerns in Moral Hypocrisy</head><p><s>A possible measurement for how individual difference and situations affect nonmaterial-motivated deception is moral hypocrisy.</s><s>Research have shown that people show moral hypocrisy by misreporting the results of a coin flip in allocations tasks to assign a desirable job to themselves and a boring one to others, in which they need to perform the assignment by privately flipping the coin (C.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Daniel Batson et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">C Daniel Batson et al., 1999)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Two possible explanations have been proposed for moral hypocrisy: self-deception and impression management (C Daniel <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Batson et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lönnqvist et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rustichini and Villeval, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The self-deception explanation regards moral hypocrisy as a way to protect one's self image by not admitting the conflicts between actual behaviors and moral standards.</s><s>According to this account, people perceive their behaviors as fair, even though they are actually unfair.</s><s>The impression management explanation assumes that moral hypocrisy enhances one's positive social image perceived by others.</s><s>In that case, apparently fair behaviors are motivated to meet public expectations as they are sensitive to evaluation from others <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Caviola and Faulmüller, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, moral hypocrisy has been classified into interpersonal and intrapersonal forms based on the existence of public claims <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Graham et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Interpersonal moral hypocrisy such as moral duplicity or moral deception involves self and other processing.</s><s>It is essentially interpersonal.</s><s>Thus, it might be closer to impression management and more sensitive to situational contexts.</s><s>Whereas intrapersonal moral hypocrisy is caused by the conflicts between moral values and behaviors without public claims, which could be linked with self-deception.</s><s>Therefore, situations with or without social image concerns might shape moral hypocrisy in different directions, and take different effects on prosocials and proselfs since proselfs are more responsive to situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Folmer and De Cremer, 2012)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GENERAL DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Across two experiments, we found that participants showed great individual difference in hypocritical fairness by deceiving in different situations.</s><s>Experiment 1 demonstrated that the individual difference could be characterized by SVO, as proselfs deceived more and behaved more hypocritically than prosocials and they are more sensitive to in deception revelation.</s><s>Experiment 2 provides further evidence that social image concerns take stronger effects on proselfs than prosocials, since existence of a third-party reviewer only led proselfs to decrease apparent fairness when deception was revealed and increase it when deception was not revealed.</s><s>Taken together, our results suggest that proselfs are more hypocritical than prosocials, especially when they are confronted with social image concerns.</s></p><p><s>Difference of deceptive behaviors between prosocials and proselfs is considered to be caused by their different social goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Strombach et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>According to this conceptual model, both prosocials and proselfs would choose to lie if lying is the most effective way to reach their goals.</s><s>Thus, prosocials would lie for prosocial motives such as helping others with white lies, which decreased moral conflicts they are confronted with in deception; whereas, proselfs would lie for selfish motives such as gaining more material reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Sun et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cui et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Our results support this model and extend it into moral hypocrisy.</s><s>One goal of being moral hypocrisy is to avoid cost of being truly moral (C Daniel <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batson et al., 1999)</ref>, which is consistent with proselfs' selfish motives but contrary to prosocials' prosocial motives.</s><s>Thus, proselfs behave more hypocritically than prosocials.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the results that proselfs preferred apparent fairness more than truly unfairness suggest that they behaved hypocritically for nonmaterial goals since the material outcomes for these two types of behaviors would be same.</s><s>The existence of social evaluation from a hird-party reviewer in Experiment 2 then highlight the importance ofsocial image concerns for proselfs.</s><s>This finding is consistent with previous studies that show proselfs tended to be fairer and more generous when their behaviors would be perceived by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Van Dijk et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Proselfs mightuse apparent fairness as a strategy to avoid being perceived as unfair partners by others, since people usually use social evaluation to recognize prosocial and antisocial partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdai, 2016)</ref>, or to avoid punishment andexclusion in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Henrich et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gausel and Leach, 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, proself men were more sensitive to revelation of truth than proself women.</s><s>Findings about whether women and men differ in deception are inconsistent in previous studies.</s><s>For instance, women lie more in non-anonymous conversations than men with expectation of future interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tyler and Feldman, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Men are more likely to lie than women in anonymous and private contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dreber and Johannesson, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Houser et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, some researchers showed that men and women did not differ in frequency of lying but showed difference in the types of lies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(DePaulo et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Feldman et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Childs, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>That is, men tend to tell more lies about abilities, personal characteristics, and plans, whereas women lie more about feelings.</s><s>These findings suggest that men are less responsive to interpersonal processes in deception than women.</s><s>As it would be more difficult for them in generating lies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Marchewka et al., 2012)</ref>, they deceive more in contexts without interpersonal cues, but reduce deception in interpersonal contexts.</s><s>In our study, revelation of truth would expose participants' hypocritical fairness to recipients, which is closely associated with interpersonal processes, leading proself men to deceive less than proself women.</s></p><p><s>These findings also provide implications for decreasing deception in moral hypocrisy.</s><s>As previous studies show, great fraction of people show moral hypocrisy <ref type="bibr">[i.e., 90% in Baston et.al.'s Study 2 (C. Daniel Batson et al., 1997)</ref>, 100% in Lönnqvist et al.'s Study 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lönnqvist et al., 2014)</ref>, about 90% in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tang et al., 2017)</ref>].</s><s>However, research about how to decrease it is still at the early stage.</s><s>Although increasing the concerns of self-image could decrease moral hypocrisy (C Daniel <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Batson et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lönnqvist et al., 2014)</ref>, self-deception was found to be hardly diminished and quickly recovered even after repeatedly presenting the reality to people <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chance et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Our previous study found that facilitating prosocial motives could effectively decrease deception in moral hypocrisy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tang et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Results in the current study support this finding by showing that prosocials were less deceptive and hypocritical than proselfs.</s><s>Specifically, results in Experiment 2 suggest that enhancing the role of social goals such as social image concerns would also be effective to decrease moral hypocrisy, especially for proselfs.</s><s>In addition, our findings also provide applications for treating individuals with different ways in deception prevention and reduction.</s><s>For instance, measurements about individuals' social orientation could be used firstly to identify individuals.</s><s>Then, for individuals with prosocial orientations, emphasizing moral principles or cost for others in deception might be more useful in deception prevention and reduction than using cues related to social image management.</s><s>However, for individuals with selfish orientations, highlighting the importance of others' opinions or impression about their behaviors might be more effective.</s></p><p><s>One limitation of our research is that we did not directly manipulate factors related to self-image, making it hard to know how hypocritical fairness caused by self-deception would be changed.</s><s>Self-deception has been used as a defense mechanism to serve "egoistic bias" and "moralistic bias" and maintain a positive perception of intellectual status and morality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Paulhus and John, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>When people perceive conflicts between moral standards and their actions for self-interest, they would use selfdeception strategy to deal with these conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Trivers, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr">C Daniel Batson et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, in our study, participants wanted to obtain more but did not want to be directly truly unfair then they chose to be transparently fair even when they knew that their truth would be revealed.</s><s>We did not find that self-deception motivated moral hypocrisy was changed with social context and evaluation from others, supporting the assumption that self-deception serves social advancement on the basis of self-enhancement rather than social image concerns in situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Von Hippel and Trivers, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Thus enhancing self-enhancement such as endorsing self-affirmation in behaviors or strengthening the power of moral standards by explicitly emphasizing them such as oath taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jacquemet et al., 2018)</ref>, might be more useful in increasing or decreasing self-deception.</s></p><p><s>Besides, although we tried our best to control the effects of the lab settings or existence of an experimenter on participant by leaving them in a separate room or compartment to finish the task and telling them their totals would be only known by themselves before they made divisions, their deception was still affected by this context in Experiment 1 compared to the completely anonymous online context in Experiment 2. For proselfs, deception revelation decreased deception in Experiment 1 (R vs. UR: 57.03% vs. 85.36%),</s><s>whereas this effect was weakened in Experiment 2 (R vs. UR: 68.38% vs. 78.07%);</s><s>for prosocials, it did not affect deception in Experiment 1 (R vs. UR: 41.82% vs. 38.98%),</s><s>but removing it increased deception in Experiment 2 (R vs. UR: 36.85% vs. 62.65%).</s><s>These findings suggest that both prosocials and proselfs were sensitive to the lab context which might reveal their identity or ways of behaviors, and proselfs were more responsive to others' evaluation compared to simple revelation in deception.</s><s>Therefore, to increase the effects of being watched or observed on deception in social context <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lönnqvist et al., 2014)</ref>, stronger manipulations about public claims such as adding both revelation and evaluation in deception prevention and reduction should be considered in future studies.</s></p><p><s>Overall, our findings contribute to understanding of the role of social value orientations and social image concerns in nonmaterial-motivated deception, moral hypocrisy.</s><s>We hope that they can not only facilitate exploring the individual difference in deception, but also prove useful for future studies that aims to decrease deception and moral hypocrisy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>[F(1,143) = 26.44,</s><s>p &lt; 0.001, η 2 p = 0.16], Revelation [F(1,143) = 4.53, p = 0.04, η 2 p = 0.03], interaction of SVO × Revelation [F(1,143) = 6.77, p = 0.01, η 2 p = 0.05].</s><s>Proselfs deceived more than prosocials in both R and UR conditions (Fs &gt; 3.23, ps &lt; 0.07, η 2 ps &gt; 0.02); proselfs deceived more in the UR than in R condition [F(1,143) = 10.28,</s><s>p = 0.002, η 2 p = 0.07], whereas prosocials did not differ in deception in two conditions [F(1,143) = 0.12, p = 0.73] (Figure</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
