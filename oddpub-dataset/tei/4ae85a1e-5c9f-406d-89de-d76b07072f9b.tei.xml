<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>T he skeletal elements of all mammals are made of nanocomposites incorporating a carbonated apatite (dahllite) mineral.</s><s>Typical bone tissues comprise mineralized collagen nanofibrils, where the protein backbone is stiffened and embedded in nanometre sized tablets of dahllite <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>The degree of mineralization is an important contributor to the mechanical performance of the tissue and has been the subject of investigation for many decades mainly in human bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Together with fibrillar orientation, the mineral density defines the mechanical properties of bones, including toughness and susceptibility to fracture, hardness and stiffness.</s><s>In healing bones or osteoporosis for example, the degree of mineralization is a strong indicator of the state of tissue pathology or the progress of biological repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, medical treatment is often directed at controlling or increasing tissue mineral content, using measures of mineral density as indicators of therapy needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In the crowns of human teeth bone tissue forms the dentine matrix that surrounds the pulp and supports an outer layer of hard and brittle enamel <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> as can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>The matrix houses parallel, micrometre-thick tubules, extending outwards from the pulp and often confined by a micrometre-thick rim of collagen-free mineral.</s><s>Dentine is thus a naturally occurring intertubular bony tissue (intertubular dentine, ITD) with regularly spaced high-density mineral columns (peritubular dentine, PTD) surrounding empty (or dental liquid-filled) voids <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Much is known about dentine structure and chemistry, and efforts are continuously made to obtain reliable and precise measurements of the mineral characteristics, ideally in three dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The most widely used methods to quantify mineral density in bony tissues are quantitative backscattered electron microscopy imaging (BSE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and X-ray absorption microCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>The former method benefits from the nanometre resolution provided by electron microscopy methods, yet it suffers from being limited to analysis on two dimensional (2D) surface slices, providing no tissue depth information.</s><s>In addition, BSE requires sufficient tissue volume to backscatter the electrons, typically micrometres in depth, and relies on the use of careful tissue stabilization and sample preparation procedures.</s><s>Absorption microCT, on the other hand, has the advantage of providing 3D information non-destructively but suffers from poor sensitivity at high resolutions, as the signal collected is inherently weak, even when using high-intensity and monochromatic X-ray sources such as synchrotron facilities.</s></p><p><s>Penetrating a multi-micrometre thick mineralized sample requires X-rays with a photon energy of at least a few kiloelectron volts.</s><s>At this energy, the sample refracts the incident X-ray waves much more efficiently than it attenuates them, rendering phase contrast methods much more sensitive than absorption methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Thus, phase contrast X-ray imaging can be used to combine a high sensitivity comparable to BSE with the 3D nature of X-ray absorption micro computed tomography (microCT).</s></p><p><s>Here, we explore the potential of ptychographic X-ray nanoCT (PXCT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> to reveal the three-dimensional mass density distribution within mineralized human tooth dentine.</s><s>Similar to other X-ray phase contrast methods, e.g., Ref. 13, but without any assumption about tissue composition, PXCT gives direct access to the distribution of the electron density <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and thus to the mass density within the specimen (see Methods section).</s><s>PXCT is used to image juxtaposed fully mineralized tissues with different densities, in 3D, at the micrometre and sub-micrometre length scales.</s></p><p><s>We measured human dentine specimens by scanning thin (30-50 mm) samples using a coherent micrometre-sized X-ray beam, followed by ptychographic and tomographic reconstruction (see Methods section).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a comparison of typical BSE and PXCT cross-sectional images from similar premolar bulk crown tooth samples.</s><s>Viewed orthogonal to the tubule axis, in both images, the air-filled lumen of the dentinal tubules appears in black, while the highly mineralized (bright) rings of PTD are seen to be scattered within the ITD matrix.</s><s>In a typical volume of interest, we observe a range of density values with specific zones exhibiting mass densities exceeding 2.5 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> corresponding to the PTD.</s></p><p><s>The spatial resolution of 158 nm in our reconstructed volume has been calculated using the Fourier shell correlation method with the half-bit threshold criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>This result has been confirmed through analysis of the signal from the smallest features observed in the PXCT images: a lateral tubule ''branch'', known to connect neighbouring tubules in teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>The profile (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (c</ref>)) of the selected branch (indicated with arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (b</ref>)) has a full width at half maximum of 190 nm (i.e. about 3 pixels of size 65 nm).</s></p><p><s>The isotropic nature of information provided by PXCT (given a sufficient number of angular projections) ensures that the same spatial resolution is obtained along orthogonal directions, as is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> exhibiting some examples of the fine detail of the 3D data.</s><s>Orthogonal views of the sample are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (a) and (b) (see also supplementary Movies 1 to 3) while panels (c) to (e) show 3D color renderings of the reconstructed volume (see also supplementary Movie 4).</s><s>We observe that the thickness of the PTD cuffs varies greatly around each tubule, ranging from 2 mm (see white arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (b)</ref>) to below 200 nm.</s><s>The PTD appears to be thicker where branching is seen (see Movie 3), and some of the fine branches are seen to enter the ITD matrix and connect to neighbouring tubules.</s><s>In the supplementary Movies 1 to 3 it can also be seen that some of the finer branches of tubules in the ITD regions are surrounded by a mineralized sheath with a density similar to the density of PTD.</s></p><p><s>Density fluctuations can be observed in the ITD matrix, possibly corresponding to variations in mineral density observed on 2D sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>To better understand the distribution of densities in the tissue, a histogram of the data is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Four distinct peaks, labeled (I) to (IV) can be seen, corresponding to different materials present in the specimen.</s><s>To precisely quantify the mass density of the main mineralized components in the sample, we have fitted peaks (I), (III) and (IV) with Gaussian functions.</s><s>The first peak arises from air outside the sample and inside the tubules and has been used to calibrate the density values of our measurements.</s><s>The width of the air peak (I) is due to noise and measurement errors, which are stronger outside the specimen than inside it.</s><s>Thus, the full-width at half maximum of the air peak, equal to 0.15 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , provides an estimate of the lowest limit of the density sensitivity of our data.</s><s>The central small peak marked II (encircled in green) corresponds to a material that is less dense than the ITD, possibly the lamina-limitans soft-tissue, that lines the interior of the tubules <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>The presence of this layer is especially visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (a) and (b), e.g., within the tubule at the bottom of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> (a) indicated by the arrow.</s><s>Its density of approximately 1.35 g/cm 3 corresponds to the density of typical organic materials such as collagen <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The two other peaks are associated with ITD (III) and PTD (IV).</s><s>Fits of these peaks yield density values of r ITD 5 2.13 6 0.09 g/cm 3 and r PTD 5 2.59 6 0.08 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> for the ITD and the PTD respectively  (mean 6 standard deviation).</s><s>The density of the ITD falls within the range of values previously reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>The density of PTD in our specimen is higher than the interval of 2.16-2.28</s><s>g/cm 3 reported from measurements obtained using density fractionation of disaggregated bovine specimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>We cannot rule out the possibility that human PTD may indeed have a higher density than bovine PTD or that, conversely, some ITD or demineralization may affect results of density fractionation PTD measurements.</s><s>We stress that PXCT requires no chemical sample preparation, circumventing any risks of demineralization.</s><s>Furthermore, the true 3D nature of our data makes it possible to precisely pick out the tissue type of interest and to quantitatively separate the different mineralization densities at the nanometre scale, with no need for calibration by chemical standards.</s></p><p><s>With precise estimates of the densities of the main dentine tissue components, it is possible to derive the volume and mass fractions of ITD and PTD (see Methods section).</s><s>In our air-dried samples, ITD is composed of collagen and mineral.</s><s>Consequently and based on the mass density measurements known for each component, we find that the ITD mineral volume fraction is w m ITD ~45% and the mineral mass fraction is m m ITD ~63%, as reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>These estimates obtained from the 3D PXCT data are in agreement with the literature, e.g., Refs.</s><s>5,7.</s></p><p><s>For PTD known to include proteolipid-phospholipid complexes 23 and no collagen, we obtain a mineral volume fraction of w m ITD ~73% with a mineral mass fraction of m m ITD ~86%, in agreement with results reported in Ref. 23.</s></p><p><s>From our ultra high resolution, volumetric data by PXCT, it is thus possible to obtain quantitative 3D measurements of mass density in mineralized bony tissues such as those found in human teeth, with an isotropic spatial resolution of less than 200 nm and a density sensitivity of 0.15 g/cm <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Such information makes it possible to identify small but important differences in the distribution of mineral within the same specimen and also between different samples.</s><s>Recent developments in PXCT show that it is possible to achieve resolutions down to 16 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> thus opening the way to study even finer bone microstructures such as collagen bundles embedded in the mineralized matrix.</s><s>Our results reveal 20% mineral density differences between PTD and ITD in human dentine, exemplifying the strength of the method to spatially separate juxtaposed differing mineral densities at the micrometre length-scale.</s><s>PXCT thus combines the advantages of the techniques commonly used to investigate mineralized specimens, i.e.</s><s>BSE and X-ray absorption microCT, with minimal sample preparation and is likely to forward our understanding of structural variability, bone density variations and bone-tissue mineralization dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s></p></div>
