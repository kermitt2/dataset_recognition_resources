<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure and ultrastructure of the Mts in the early first instar larva</head><p><s>The excretory organs of the early first larval instar consist of a dozen or so Malpighian tubules which arise from the intestine at the midgut-hindgut junction.</s><s>The highly elongated, tangled, and blindly ending distal segments of the tubules lie freely in the hemocoel.</s><s>The external diameter of Mts is about 40 μm, and narrows toward a blind tip of the tubule.</s><s>The analysis of cross sections revealed that the tubules are morphologically complex and built of four layers (from inside out) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a, f):</ref> (1) a ring of cuboidal cells forming a single-layered epithelium lining a tubule lumen; (2) relatively thick mat of extracellular matrix forming a basal lamina which supports the epithelium;</s></p><p><s>(3) a thin external sheath composed of striated muscle fibers and single tracheoblasts, the progenitor of tracheoles; and (4) a layer of basal lamina covering the external sheath.</s></p><p><s>The epithelial cells are morphologically similar and polarized along the apical-basal axis.</s><s>Their apical plasma membranes, facing the tubule lumen, are furnished with relatively short (around 0.5 μm in length) and irregularly spaced microvilli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>The lateral membranes run wavy but are tightly apposed to each other (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f, g</ref>).</s><s>They are held together by parallel rows of junctional structures arranged with a regular periodicity, features typical of a septate junction or septate desmosome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s><s>The lateral membranes close to the basal region (roughly up to a third of the cell height) are convoluted and separated by a narrow intercellular space (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>).</s><s>The basal membranes (facing the hemocoel) are flat and run parallel to the basal lamina (see below) to which are fastened by hemidesmosomes (not shown).</s></p><p><s>Each epithelial cell contains a large, ovoid nucleus which is clearly shifted toward the apical plasma membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a, f</ref>).</s><s>The nuclear envelope is mostly regular except for the segment directed toward the cell apex where it deeply invaginates into the nucleoplasm.</s><s>Each nucleus contains 2-3 prominent nucleoli and largely dispersed chromatin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The cytoplasm comprises numerous mitochondria, cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and Golgi complexes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f-h</ref>).</s><s>Single multivesicular bodies as well as characteristic spherical vacuoles reside preferentially in the basal region of the epithelial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f, h</ref>).</s><s>The spherical vacuoles contain flocculent material of low or medium electron density, and electron dense material forming a peripheral rim (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f, h</ref>).</s><s>We interpret these vacuoles as an initial stage in the formation of spheroids (see the next paragraph).</s></p><p><s>Structure and ultrastructure of the Mts in the late first instar larva (just before larviposition) At this developmental stage, the diameter of the Mts increases considerably to around 110 μm (± 5 μm) and the internal lumen expands up to 40 μm (± 4 μm) in diameter (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a, b</ref>).</s><s>The analysis of Mts in cross sections revealed that the size increase is brought about by a significant enlargement of individual cells and their divisions.</s><s>The average length of the cell apico-basal axis is 35 μm (versus 10 μm in the early first instar larva).</s><s>In the late larva, cells of the Mt's epithelial lining protrude more into the tubule lumen that gives the lumen a characteristic star-shaped appearance in cross sections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Within the lumen, numerous dense structures are often present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b, d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Striking differences are also evident in the ultrastructural features of the epithelial cells of Mts when compared to the earlier developmental stage.</s><s>First of all, the apical-basal polarity of the epithelial cells is even more pronounced.</s><s>The apical surface, facing the lumen, is convex and extends into numerous slender and densely packed microvilli (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b and  2a, b</ref>).</s><s>The most characteristic feature of these microvilli is that each one of them contains a highly elongated mitochondrion, aligned parallel to a long axis of the microvillus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a, b</ref>).</s><s>The cytoplasm just beneath the microvilli stains more intensely with methylene blue in semi-thin sections and the electron microscopy analysis revealed that this region of cytoplasm is densely packed with mitochondria, which form a crescent-shaped zone above the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a, b</ref>).</s><s>Many mitochondria in this cytoplasmic region are irregular or elongated, oriented parallel to the long axis of the microvilli, and/ or wedged into their base indicating transition steps necessary for entering the lumen of a microvillus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Similarly to Mts of the early larval instar, the apical regions of the neighboring cells are fastened by intercellular junctions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to the apical region, the basal cell membranes are extensively infolded (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>As a result, the basal cytoplasm is partitioned into irregular segments/compartments separated by narrow extracellular spaces.</s><s>Typically, the cytoplasm of the basal segments is enriched in mitochondria (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>There is no much difference in general structure and location of a nucleus in the epithelial cells of Mts in the early and late first instar larvae.</s><s>However, the organization of the cytoplasm is markedly different.</s><s>In the late first instar larva, the epithelial cells contain numerous, variably sized vesicles comprising spherical or ovoid granules with a distinct ultrastructural organization: concentrically arranged opaque and transparent zones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c, d</ref>).</s><s>These granules will be referred to as the spheroids because of their morphological similarity to such structures described in Mts of other insects.</s><s>The limiting membrane surrounding spheroids is covered with ribosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) and in some sections is continued with membranes of RER elements (not shown).</s><s>This observation suggests that spheroids are formed within expanded cisternae of RER.</s><s>Although the spheroids are distributed throughout the cytoplasm, they are mostly concentrated in the basal half of the epithelial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>In a single cell, the population of spheroids is highly heterogeneous with individual spheroids differing in size (from 100 nm up to 1.5 μm in diameter) and the extent of the concentric lamination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c, d</ref>).</s><s>Serial section analyses have indicated that smaller vesicles contain material of lower electron density, more diffuse, and with a lower degree of lamination than the larger ones.</s><s>Beside spheroids, multivesicular bodies are also present in the cytoplasm (not shown).</s></p><p><s>In the late first instar larva, each Mt is accompanied externally by a single unbranched tracheole which runs parallel to the long axis of the tubule (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b, d, e</ref>).</s><s>The analysis of the tracheoles in both cross and longitudinal sections revealed that they have a well-developed cuticular intima, which is annularly or helically folded to form a taenidium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure and ultrastructure of the Mts in the adult</head><p><s>We have also analyzed the structure of Mts in adult specimens of A. esau.</s><s>We found that there is a great deal of similarity between the cell architecture of the late first larval instar and adult Mts, including their size and apico-basal polarity of the epithelial cells (compare Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b, c</ref>).</s><s>The only noticeable ultrastructural differences are larger (up to 3 μm in diameter) and more numerous spheroids dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (not shown).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alimentary system</head><p><s>Although a detailed characteristic of the alimentary system in A. esau is beyond the scope of this study, here we present a brief description of the first instar larval gut only focusing on aspects relevant to the excretion and viviparity.</s></p><p><s>The alimentary systems of both the early and late first instar larvae are morphologically similar and comprise a foregut, midgut, and hindgut.</s><s>In these larval stages, the most striking feature of the intestinal tract is occlusion of its lumen by a cellular diaphragm at the midgut-hindgut junction (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The serial section analysis revealed that the diaphragm is a continuous solid cellular layer and is formed by adjacent blind ends of the midgut and hindgut tubes.</s><s>Significantly, there is no muscle lining associated with this structure (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The muscle layers form a sheath surrounding externally both the midgut and hindgut but they do not penetrate into the diaphragm region.</s><s>Such an arrangement allows to hold the gut parts together even though their cavities remain separated (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Another indication of the gut discontinuity is the observed disparity in the staining properties of the midgut and hindgut lumens (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), confirming that the diaphragm forms a tight diffusion barrier between these two gut compartments.</s></p><p><s>In the Arixenia first instar larvae, a clear morphological distinction exists between midgut and hindgut cells.</s><s>The wall of the midgut is relatively thick (approximately 50 μm in diameter) and consists of a thin outer muscular layer and a well-developed inner epithelial lining of the gut (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>The apical membranes of the midgut epithelial cells (exposed to the gut lumen) are furnished with multiple microvilli (about 100 nm in diameter and more than 5 μm in length) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>), whereas the lateral ones are connected by extensive continuous junctions, or zonulae continuae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a, b</ref>).</s><s>The cytoplasm of these cells contains irregular aggregates of electron dense granules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a, b</ref>).</s><s>Both the shape and size of these granules suggest that they may represent glycogen particles.</s><s>Similar aggregates are also present in the endodermal cells of the diaphragm (facing the midgut lumen), where they intermingle with large vacuoles filled with a heterogeneous content, which will be referred to as the heterogeneous vacuoles (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 and 4c</ref>).</s><s>The aggregates and vacuoles present in the diaphragm cells often form massive accumulations filling most of the cell's interior.</s><s>Some cells of the diaphragm are distended and distorted by these accumulations and stick out into the otherwise empty midgut cavity (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The lining of the hindgut is organized in a single-layered epithelium.</s><s>The hindgut epithelial cells are highly elongated or columnar (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 and 4d</ref>); in contrast to midgut cells, their apices form only a small number of short microvilli (about 70 nm in diameter and 250 nm in length) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>).</s><s>Characteristically, the apices of these microvilli are covered by a delicate layer of cuticle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>).</s><s>The apical domains of the hindgut epithelial cells are fastened by the adherens junctions, which are accompanied on either side by microtubules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electron probe microanalyses</head><p><s>To better characterize vacuoles and spheroids present in the epithelial cells of the Mt and midgut and to determine their chemical composition, we have analyzed their contents with the EDS system.</s><s>Exemplary images of the Mt sections used for the microanalyses are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e, f</ref>.</s><s>These analyses revealed that the vacuoles found in the Mt epithelial cells of the early first instar larvae contain no measurable amount of elements such as nitrogen, calcium, or phosphorus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the spheroids in the late instar larval Mts contain variable but significant amount of calcium and phosphorus, Higher magnification reveals that these junctions are of the septate junction type (g, arrowheads).</s><s>h The basal part of Mt epithelial cell.</s><s>Note that the cell membrane is flat and runs parallel to the basal lamina (bl).</s><s>Asterisks spheroids, double asterisks primordial spheroids, bl basal lamina, es epithelial sheath, Gc Golgi complex, lm layer of microvilli, lu Mt lumen, m mitochondria, mb multivesicular body, mv microvilli, n epithelial cell nucleus, rer elements of rough endoplasmic reticulum, tb tracheoblast, tr tracheole, a-d Semithin section stained with methylene blue, LM. e SEM.</s><s>f-h TEM i.e., around 14 wt% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>).</s><s>These amounts were well above the content of these elements in the cytoplasm surrounding spheroids and on a tissue-free area of the same section (not shown).</s><s>The obtained calcium/phosphorus ratio close to 1 suggests that these elements may form compounds, e.g., calcium phosphate, within the spheroids.</s><s>We have also analyzed the composition of the heterogeneous vacuoles present in cells of the gut diaphragm and found that at least some of them have a slightly elevated amount of calcium (2.5 ± 0.44 wt%).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>As in other animals, excretion in insects is necessary to maintain proper intracellular environment and homeostasis of the entire organism.</s><s>Excretion relays on the elimination of metabolic waste, excess water and ions from the hemolymph, which is the reservoir of the extracellular fluids (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bradley 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Metabolic waste produced during various cellular activities is transported into the hemolymph and removed from it primarily by Mts (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pannabecker 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bradley 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beyenbach et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In viviparous mode of reproduction, several excretory scenarios are possible, including a total dependence of the progeny on the excretory system of the mother (as it is in hemocelic viviparity), a partial contribution on mother's side, or a total excretory independence of progeny <ref type="bibr">(Clutton-Brock 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Blackburn 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Our results indicate that the last scenario is likely to operate in the studied viviparous dermapteran.</s><s>The excretory system develops in concert with the overall development of the Arixenia larva and appears to act independently of the mother's excretory system.</s></p><p><s>The ultrastructural analysis of Mts in two successive developmental stages revealed that the epithelial cells gradually acquire distinct apico-basal polarity, increase in size, and progressively differentiate into a secretory epithelium.</s><s>These results combined with the expansion of the lumen of Mts and the rising number of vesicles containing spheroids within the cytoplasm of the Mt epithelial cells strongly indicate that the larval Mts become gradually functional during in utero development.</s></p><p><s>The presence of spheroids, also termed urospheroids, spherocrystals, concentric concretions, and crystalloid bodies, are of special interest.</s><s>These structures are thought to be depots of insoluble form of salts containing different ions (calcium, copper, magnesium, cadmium, manganese, and zinc) embedded in organic, mostly proteinaceous matrix (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martoja and Ballan-Dufrançais, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chapman 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bradley 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Although, the exact role of the mineralized concretions may depend on a species, it has been suggested that they store the ions either for subsequent use by the organism or as a means of sequestrating and eliminating of ions from the body.</s><s>Elements of RER are usually implicated in the origin of spheroids, which is in line with our findings.</s><s>There is very little variability in mature spheroids among insect species: they are always roughly spherical and have a characteristic concentric pattern of transparent and opaque rings (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martoja and Ballan-Dufrançais, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chapman 1985)</ref>.</s><s>This may suggest that similar mechanisms are responsible for their formation throughout Hexapoda.</s></p><p><s>Morphologically similar structures to spheroids have been also reported in midgut cells in various hexapods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Humbert 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chapman 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Xue et al. 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pigino et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rost-Roszkowska et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rost-Roszkowska and Undrul 2008</ref>).</s><s>Although we have not observed canonical spheroids in the midgut cells of Arixenia, we have found large heterogeneous vacuoles in their cytoplasm.</s><s>The electron probe microanalysis revealed the presence of calcium in at least some of these structures.</s><s>Calcium, in turn, is considered to be the most typical and ubiquitous constituents of the spheroid-like structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chapman 1985)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several lines of evidence indicate that insect Mts are involved in primary urine formation (for reviews, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martoja and Ballan-Dufrançais, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bradley 1985</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bradley , 2003;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pannabecker 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Beyenbach et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s>We believe that Arixenia larval Mts participate in the same process.</s><s>This Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Longitudinal section of the fragment of the alimentary track in the late first instar larva.</s><s>The continuity of the lumen is disrupted, at the midgut-hindgut junction, by a presence of the cellular diaphragm (dph) which is devoid of any muscle layers.</s><s>Note large heterogeneous vacuoles (v) sticking out into the midgut lumen (ml) and a difference in staining between the midgut and hindgut lumens.</s><s>hl hindgut lumen, hge hindgut epithelium, mge midgut epithelium, ms muscle fibers.</s><s>LM notion is supported by remarkable similarity of the ultrastructure of the Arixenia larval epithelial cells to the ultrastructural organization of such cells in many insects (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ryerse 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hanrahan and Nicolson 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arab and Caetano 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Goncalves et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lipovsek et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu and Hua 2018)</ref>.</s><s>It should be mentioned here that in larvae of some holometabolous insects, e.g., Apis mellifera, differences in Mt organization may occur that are associated with substantial remodeling of the internal organs accompanying complete metamorphosis (for further details, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Goncalves et al. 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In Arixenia, both the apical and basal surface modifications (microvilli and basal infoldings, respectively) greatly increase the effective transport area of the Mts across which metabolites may pass between the hemolymph cytoplasm and between the cytoplasm and the excretory space.</s><s>The septate junctions between the cell lateral membranes provide structural strength as well as a barrier to ion and solute diffusion through the intercellular space <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lane 1982)</ref>.</s><s>The observed juxtaposition of mitochondria and the cell membranes, either in the form of the apical microvilli or basal infoldings, suggests the presence of an active transport mechanism, requiring energy provided by the abundant mitochondria.</s><s>Such ultrastructural organization is characteristic of transporting epithelia involved in osmotic and ionic regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berridge and Oschman, 1972)</ref>.</s><s>Similar associations of mitochondria with microvilli-like projections have also been reported in goblet cells, present in the midgut of some insects (e.g., Ephemeroptera, Lepidoptera), and implicated in the regulation  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>The accompanying tables show the elemental composition (compound %) of these organelles of potassium titers within the hemolymph (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Martoja and Ballan-Dufrançais, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chapman 1985)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, the results obtained with the EDS system indicate that Mts of the early and late larvae differ in concentration of calcium and phosphorus.</s><s>These results strongly suggest that as the Arixenia first instar larva develops, the Mts become progressively more involved in regulation and elimination of excess ions and water.</s><s>The surplus of ions is apparently sequestered (probably in the form of calcium phosphates) in the spheroids gradually arising in the cytoplasm of the Mt epithelial cells.</s><s>Our results suggest additionally that the epithelial cells forming the diaphragm may support the excretion.</s><s>We speculate that heterogeneous vacuoles present in these cells may act as storage depots for wasteful byproducts of metabolism generated by a developing in the mother's uterus larva.</s><s>This hypothesis is reinforced by the observed higher calcium content in these vacuoles.</s></p><p><s>Our microscopic analyses indicate that the gut in the Arixenia first instar larvae is discontinuous, does not function in the canonical way, and that the epithelial cells of the diaphragm accumulate metabolic compounds.</s><s>We interpret such unusual modification of the alimentary system as an adaptation for viviparity.</s><s>Because the larva develops inside the mother's uterus, the occlusion of the gut lumen may prevent polluting the environment (i.e., the uterus lumen) with the metabolic waste.</s><s>We believe that the gut becomes patent after larva deposition either as a result of rupturing the cellular diaphragm by passing food or at the first molt.</s></p><p><s>In many insects, the midgut/hindgut junction is equipped with pyloric valves.</s><s>However, several lines of evidence indicate that the diaphragm in the Arixenia first instar larvae is a different structure.</s><s>First, the pyloric valves are always associated with a thick muscle layers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chapman 1985</ref> for further discussion), while the diaphragm is completely devoid of musculature.</s><s>Second, in contrast to pyloric valves, the diaphragm is a solid cellular layer, as indicated by a serial section analysis.</s><s>Third, different staining properties of the midgut and hindgut lumens argue that the diaphragm provides a tight diffusion barrier, which would not be the case with the pyloric valves.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, an occlusion at the midgut/hindgut junction has been also reported in larvae of neuropterans, most hymenopterans and viviparous dipterans (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chapman 1985)</ref>.</s><s>At least in the case of viviparous dipterans and social hymenopterans, the gut discontinuity may play a similar role as suggested for Arixenia.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.
