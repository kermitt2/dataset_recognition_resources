primary AML or AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome, as defined by the World Health Organization criteria and confirmed by pathology review at the treating institution.</s><s>Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing regimens with quizartinib dihydrochloride monotherapy: a 30-mg once-daily starting-dose group (equivalent to 26.5 mg free base) or a 60-mg once-daily starting-dose group (equivalent to 53 mg free base).</s><s>Each group allowed protocol-specified dose escalation for lack/ loss of response and dose reduction/interruption for adverse events (AEs).</s><s>Patients received quizartinib oral solution daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression, intolerance, or HSCT.</s><s>Quizartinib dihydrochloride powder was reconstituted in sterile water at a concentration of 5 mg/mL with a final volume of 6 or 12 mL (for 30-and 60-mg doses, respectively).</s></p><p><s>The study was conducted per the Declarations of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent.</s></p><p><s>Eligibility criteria Patients were required to have been refractory to or relapsed after HSCT or 1 second-line salvage regimen and were required to have FLT3-ITD-activating mutation in bone marrow or peripheral blood.</s><s>Patients were deemed eligible on the basis of local laboratory results, with all samples subsequently tested at a central laboratory to confirm FLT3 mutation status using a previously published method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>The FLT3-ITD allelic burden was calculated as the percentage of FLT3-ITD-mutated (dominant allele) to total FLT3 (wild type 1 FLT3-ITD-mutated) in samples sent to the central laboratory.</s><s>Patients with an allelic frequency of at least 10% were considered to have FLT3-ITDmutated disease.</s><s>Allelic frequencies were not corrected for blast percentages.</s><s>Patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated allelic ratio lower than 10% identified in the confirmatory FLT3 testing at the central laboratory were allowed to remain in the study and were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.</s><s>The decision to keep these patients on study was at the discretion of the investigators if they felt the treatment could offer benefit.</s><s>Patients who had received prior FLT3 inhibitor therapy were allowed.</s><s>Additional inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate renal, hepatic, and coagulation parameters, as indicated by the following laboratory values: aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase #2.5 3 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin #1.5 3 institutional ULN, serum creatinine #1.5 3 institutional ULN, and glomerular filtration rate .30</s><s>mL/min (calculated by Cockcroft and Gault formula).</s><s>Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, clinically active central nervous system leukemia, or

separately.</s><s>Definitions of efficacy endpoints are presented in supplemental Appendix 1, supplemental Methods.</s><s>Study assessments Electrocardiograms were obtained at screening, predose, and 2, 4, and 6 hours postdose on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1; predose and 2 hours postdose on day 8 of cycle 1; predose on day 22 of cycle 1; and predose on day 1 of all subsequent cycles and were centrally
