<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study aimed to test the feasibility and predictive validity of a novel assessment to measure food-related social cognitions in young children.</s><s>To date, social cognitions have been assessed through self-reports on Likert scales and that procedure excluded children younger than eight years old from studies investigating personal cognitions about feed choices (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bazillier et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The present study showed that a measurement procedure based on sorting cards representing the most frequently eaten food options in a choice paradigm was acceptable and feasible to children.</s><s>Moreover, correlations between constructs and path analysis results were in line with theoretical assumptions of the RAA.</s><s>The relationships found in the inter-correlation analyses showed that the variables were related in accordance with theoretical assumptions and previous research in older children and adolescents (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bazillier et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Berg et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hewitt &amp; Stephens, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Regarding the path analysis; attitudes, subjective norms relating to the mother and PBC were associated with intention, and, in turn, PBC was also related to the food choice.</s><s>In the multivariate path model PBC rather than intention showed the strongest relationship with behaviour.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, children's intentions were related to their attitude and subjective norms relating to their mother.</s><s>These results highlight the role of the mother at this stage of life, indicating that in younger children the mother may be perceived as an important model for food choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Birch &amp; Fisher, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Savage, Fisher, &amp; Birch, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, friends' norms were found to show stronger relationships with intentions in older children aged eight to nine years <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bazillier et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Overall, this study suggests that children's social cognitions towards food can be measured with a simple choice paradigm based on sorting cards representing food choice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations:</head><p><s>The sample size is sufficient to test for the substantial relationships usually found between RAA variables, but limits the statistical power so that analyses by subgroups, such as sex or BMI, are not feasible.</s><s>The key purpose of this study was to show that the rank order in which children sorted the options when asked for their liking (attitudes), perceptions of what others would prefer them to choose (subjective norms relating to friends, parents, and teachers), easy to eat (PBC), and intentions to eat, were sufficiently different; related to each other in plausible ways; and correlated with an observational measure of behaviour.</s></p><p><s>Practical Implications and Future Studies: A better understanding of social cognitive factors in young children might help future health promotion and prevention programmes.</s><s>Current interventions based on parents' perceptions and changes in the environment frequently ignore children's perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dennison &amp; Edmunds, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Halford et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kröller &amp; Warschburger, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wardle et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Adding a new focus to future interventions programmes, namely influencing children's social cognitions, will involve the child as an agent of their own behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bandura, 2001)</ref>, or, at least, help clarifying from what age onwards such agency can be expected.</s><s>In addition to these first insights obtained from this study, further studies amongst children are needed to explore the predictive capability, the retest-reliability, and other measurement aspects of this assessment tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Araujo-Soares et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, testing the predictive validity of the tool in a longitudinal study design will be an important future step.</s><s>This study evaluated direct measures of attitudes, subjective norms and PBC.</s><s>These measures have utility for description and prediction, but they do not reveal the underlying specific behavioural, normative and control beliefs the children referred to when creating the rank orders.</s><s>For example, given the behavioural choice task offering convenient and easily accessible options without major external barriers, it is not certain what caused the children to perceive some options as easier to consume than others.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Ajzen (2002)</ref> proposes measurement procedure to assess these specific beliefs in order to explain the direct RAA measures and future research is needed to develop and evaluate methods of assessing these specific beliefs in children to add an explanatory level to the assessment of direct RAA social cognitions about food choice.</s><s>In the present study, food choice was not balanced in terms of weight and / or energy content.</s><s>It might be useful to consider the choices offered in terms of their content in studies which seek to predict ad libitum behaviour relevant for energy balance or health.</s></p></div>
