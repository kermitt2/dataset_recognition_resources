<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Recently, an alternative renin-angiotensin system pathway has been described, which involves binding of angiotensin-(1-7) to its receptor Mas.</s><s>The Mas axis may counterbalance angiotensin-II-mediated proinflammatory effects, likely by affecting macrophage function.</s></p><p><s>Here we investigate the role of Mas in murine models of autoimmune neuroinflammation and atherosclerosis, which both involve macrophage-driven pathomechanisms.</s><s>Mas signaling affected macrophage polarization, migration, and macrophage-mediated T-cell activation.</s><s>Mas deficiency exacerbated the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and increased macrophage infiltration as well as proinflammatory gene expression in the spleen and spinal cord.</s><s>Furthermore, Mas deficiency promoted atherosclerosis by affecting macrophage infiltration and migration and led to increased oxidative stress as well as impaired endothelial function in ApoE-deficient mice.</s><s>In summary, we identified the Mas axis as an important factor in macrophage function during inflammation of the central nervous and vascular system in vivo.</s><s>Modulating the Mas axis may constitute an interesting therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis and/or atherosclerosis.</s><s>T he renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with its active metabolite angiotensin (Ang) II is involved in the control of blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and sympathetic nerve activity and plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>Ang II mediates the majority of its effects via the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor.</s><s>Blockade of the AT1 receptor reduces blood pressure and decelerates the progression of atherosclerosis.</s><s>In addition to its well-defined hemodynamic effects, studies have indicated that AT1 receptor activation also contributes to target organ damage involving proinflammatory pathways.</s><s>Thus, it has been shown that deletion of immune cells or immune suppression therapy reduces Ang II-dependent hypertension and hypertensive end organ damage, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>.</s><s>In line with these results, recent studies have provided profound evidence that AT1 receptor inhibition directly affects immune cell function and thereby ameliorates the clinical course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref> or systemic lupus erythematosus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recently, growing evidence suggests that Ang II is not the only active peptide of the RAS.</s><s>A particular example is the heptapeptide Ang-(1-7), which is derived from Ang I and Ang II by several metalloproteinases and endopeptidases including ACE2 and neprilysin.</s><s>Ang-(1-7) has been shown to activate its own seventransmembrane G protein-coupled receptor called Mas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>Mas is expressed on various tissues of the central nervous (CNS) and cardiovascular system <ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, deletion of the receptor Mas resulted in blood pressure increase and endothelial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> whereas Ang-(1-7) infusion improved vascular function by inducing nitric oxide and prostaglandin release <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Ang-(1-7) has been shown to reduce reactive oxygen species production and vascular inflammation, thereby slowing down the progression of atherosclerosis in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Although many studies have indicated a clear role of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in vascular inflammation, not much is known about the influence of Mas on immune cells and their function during inflammatory processes.</s><s>However, Mas transcripts are up-regulated in macrophages after LPS exposure, and the Ang-(1-7) peptide drives an anti-inflammatory response in LPS-induced macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the role of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis on macrophages in vivo, we used two different animal models: EAE, a mouse model for multiple sclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here we investigate potential effects of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis on macrophage function using MOG-EAE mice as a model of multiple sclerosis and hypercholesterinemic ApoEKO mice as a model of atherosclerosis.</s><s>Both animal models are characterized by macrophage-mediated inflammation.</s><s>In the present study, we show that Mas deficiency affects macrophage phenotypes and function, thereby aggravating the disease course in both settings.</s><s>At first glance, an autoimmune disease model like MOG-EAE and a cardiovascular disease model like atherosclerosis may not have much in common.</s><s>However, our data strikingly show that disruption of the alternative renin-angiotensin system pathway at the receptor level similarly affects macrophage function and phenotype independently of the underlying phagocyte stimulus.</s></p><p><s>Specifically, deletion of the receptor Mas enhances the migratory capacity and induces a proinflammatory phenotype of macrophages in MOG-EAE as well as ApoEKO mice, leading to an increased immune cell infiltration in the spinal cord or in atherosclerotic plaques, respectively.</s><s>Previously, several studies have shown that deletion of ACE2, one of the key enzymes in Ang II degradation and a member of the alternative RAS pathway with its ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, results in increased vascular inflammation leading to a progression of atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>However, as ACE2 deficiency also leads to an accumulation of the proinflammatory metabolite Ang II, the role of the alternative pathway in the regulation of these effects was unclear.</s><s>Here, we definitely show that the Ang-(1-7)/ Mas axis influences the inflammatory capacity of immune cells in two different, yet distinct, chronic inflammatory diseases.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, we specify the immune cell subset with a prevailing role of Mas.</s><s>Although Mas is expressed on different cell types, Mas deficiency particularly affects CD11b + macrophages in vitro and in vivo by interfering with cytokine expression and activation capacities of different macrophage subtypes.</s><s>Well in line with our in vitro data, previous studies on the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in peritoneal macrophages also implied a role of Mas in cell migration.</s><s>Additionally, enhanced T-cell proliferation in in vitro coculture experiments with Mas-deficient macrophages may be explained by a lack of inhibitory Ang-(1-7) signaling, which is known to suppress T-cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>This effect may be governed by a role of endogenous Mas in inhibiting M(LPS+IFNγ)-like polarization and proinflammatory cytokine expression.</s><s>Previous work by Souza et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> showed that Mas-signaling pathways rather exert anti-inflammatory effects: Treatment with Ang-(1-7) led to decreased il6 and tnfa mRNA levels in peritoneal macrophages.</s><s>Here, we extend these observations to in vivo models of macrophage dysfunction and show consistent data: Mas deficiency may drive proinflammatory M(LPS+IFNγ)-like responses and play a role in diminishing anti-inflammatory M (IL-4+IL-13)-like polarization in our animal models, in which the progression of the diseases is significantly characterized by macrophage-mediated inflammation.</s></p><p><s>In EAE, Mas deficiency enhances the frequency of macrophages in the spinal cord, the presence of which in the CNS is crucial for the local activation of infiltrating T cells and, thus, the initiation and progression of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>The enhanced Th1 frequencies found in the spinal cord of diseased Mas-deficient mice may be a downstream consequence of the increased CD11b + cell infiltration because these macrophages actually produce higher levels of chemoattractants, allowing T cells to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).</s></p><p><s>In models of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, an influence of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis on migration of CD11b + monocytes has already been shown.</s><s>Here, chemokines and their receptors, such as CCL2 and CCR5, may play a crucial role <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the increase of antigen-presenting cell migration into atherosclerotic plaques as well as the enhanced plaque size, which we observed in our ApoEKO mouse model, may be mediated by an effect of Mas on chemokine expression.</s><s>Well in line with this observation, Mas deficiency enhances the expression of the chemokine CCL2 in vitro and in vivo with NF-κB as a key regulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our data support the concept of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis as anti-inflammatory pathway in different macrophage-mediated disease models in vivo.</s><s>Signaling via Mas modulates the delicate balance between M(LPS+IFNγ)-like and M(IL-4+IL-13)like macrophages, pushing it toward the M(IL-4+IL-13)-like phenotype, which is an important regulator controlling inflammation and autoimmunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the receptor Mas may be an interesting therapeutic target to treat autoimmune diseases via regulating inflammatory processes.</s><s>A specific activation of Mas, e.g., via agonists like AVE 0991, may impair macrophage migration through the BBB or in the vessel wall, thus limiting inflammation in the CNS or the vascular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr"
