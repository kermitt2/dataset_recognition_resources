<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods</head><p><s>This study was a multicenter, open, prospective, observational trial (ISRCTN Registry identifier: ISRCTN92716512).</s><s>The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by all local ethics committees.</s><s>The names of the ethical bodies that approved the study in the centers involved are listed in the Acknowledgments section.</s><s>All consecutive patients treated with RCA-CVVHD between January 2008 and February 2010 were considered for study participation.</s><s>They were included if written informed consent was provided by themselves or by their legal representatives until at least 40 patients in each group were reached.</s><s>All participating centers were university hospitals.</s><s>All patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: age ≥18 years and prescription of RCA-CVVHD for renal replacement therapy.</s><s>The exclusion criteria were former use of RCA within 72 h before the study start, concomitant participation in another clinical trial, and previous participation in the same study.</s></p><p><s>A total of 133 patients were included in the study.</s><s>Patients were stratified into three groups according to their liver function level, as defined by total serum bilirubin: normal liver function with bilirubin ≤2 mg/dl, mild LF with bilirubin &gt;2 and ≤7 mg/dl, and severe LF with bilirubin &gt;7 mg/dl.</s></p><p><s>All patients were treated with RCA-CVVHD using the multiFiltrate device (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany).</s><s>The treatment protocol published by Morgera et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> with a calcium-free and bicarbonatereduced dialysate (Ci-Ca Dialysate K2 Plus; Fresenius Medical Care) was used.</s><s>The dialysate flow was initially set as indicated by clinical needs.</s><s>The blood flow was set at three times the dialysate flow.</s><s>For anticoagulation, 4 % trisodium citrate solution was infused into the arterial line of the extracorporeal circuit with an initial dose of 4 mmol/L blood.</s><s>The citrate dose was stepwise adapted to achieve a target postfilter iCa range of 0.25-0.35</s><s>mmol/L.</s><s>Calcium chloride solution was infused into the venous line of the extracorporeal circuit at an initial dose of 1.7 mmol/L effluent and was adjusted to keep iCa within the physiologic range of 1.12-1.20 mmol/L.</s><s>The ratio of dialysate flow to blood flow was increased in stepwise fashion in cases of metabolic alkalosis and likewise decreased in cases of acidosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The observation period included the first 72 h of the RCA-CVVHD treatment, which corresponded to the time point of a regular filter exchange as specified by the manufacturer.</s></p><p><s>Blood samples for arterial and postfilter analysis of pH, blood gases, and electrolytes (iCa, potassium, sodium) were taken and analyzed immediately on a bedside automated analyzer.</s><s>All other laboratory parameters were analyzed in the central laboratories of the participating centers (all accredited according to the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation).</s></p><p><s>All measurements of arterial iCa and postfilter iCa, as well as arterial pH and actual bicarbonate, within the first 72 h of treatment were considered for analysis.</s><s>Measurements of other serum electrolytes and total serum protein were analyzed at baseline and after 12, 24, 48, and 72 h.</s><s>Additional laboratory parameters were analyzed at baseline and at the end of the observation period.</s></p><p><s>Endpoints for safety evaluation were occurrence of severe alkalosis or acidosis (pH ≥7.55 or ≤7.20, respectively) and severe hyper-or hypocalcemia (iCa ≥1.5 or ≤0.9 mmol/L, respectively) of any cause.</s><s>The endpoint for efficacy was filter lifetime.</s></p></div>
