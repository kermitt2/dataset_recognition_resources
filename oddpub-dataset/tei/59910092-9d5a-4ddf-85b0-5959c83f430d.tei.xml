<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>There were 76 patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer enrolled in the study.</s><s>Of them 35 had oropharyngeal and 41 oral cavity cancer, 50 were male and 26 female.</s><s>Mean age was 57.2 years (standard deviation -11.45 years), with youngest and oldest participant were 26 and 79 respectively.</s><s>Patients characteristics presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Of the 76 patients, 14 cases were positive for HPV by PCR and 15 by P16 IHC.</s><s>One patient had positive p16 IHC and negative PCR test.</s><s>Of the 35 oropharyngeal tumors, nine were HPV DNA and p16 IHC positive, giving the rate of 25.7%.</s><s>Out of nine positive cases, four are tonsillar cancers and two base of tongue cancers, what corresponds with the distribution of the whole group of oropharyngeal tumors.</s></p><p><s>Of the 41 oral tumors, five were HPV DNA positive and six patients were p16 IHC positive, giving the rate of 12.2% (excluding the P16 only positive case).</s><s>Three of them are tongue cancer, one floor of the mouth and one alveolar ridge tumors.</s><s>All three tongue cancers were located closer to posterior third of the tongue and even with extension to the base of the tongue.</s></p><p><s>HPV 16 was the most prevalent type in both the oropharyngeal and oral cavity cases, other types found were 18 and 56, one case each (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Smoking was less prevalent in the group of HPV positive patients, two had a history of smoking out of 14, comparing 40 out of 62 in the HPV negative group of patients.</s><s>The difference is statistically significant with p = 0.0018 (Chi-squared test).</s></p><p><s>In the oropharyngeal cancer group, 25 patients had advanced tumors stage III and IV.</s><s>Patients with oropharyngeal cancer received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) according to the local standards.</s><s>The local CRT standard includes delivering IMRT radiotherapy to tumor and neck with a concurrent infusion of platinumbased agent weekly or every three weeks.</s></p><p><s>In the group of oral cancers, 29 out of 41 had advanced oral cancer stage III IV.</s><s>They were treated mostly by surgery and adjuvant RT or CRT for non-operable cases.</s><s>Adjuvant CRT in the oral cavity cancer group is used only for cases with adverse features on permanent pathology.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Cancers of the head and neck is a heterogeneous group of tumors with various anatomic sites with different etiologic factors.</s><s>Tobacco exposure (either via active or passive smoking as well as consumption of smokeless tobacco) is the leading risk factor for head and neck cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>But in many developed nations with decreasing tobacco usage and consequently decreasing the incidence of tobacco induced cancers the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is rising.</s><s>This development attributed to the spread of HR HPV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>The data gathered in different multinational trials confirms the need for evaluation of HPV prevalence by region and country, as there are important differences between patient groups from Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>As mentioned in many systematic reviews and meta-analysis one of the main limitations for comparing different studies was the lack of uniformity of the tests used <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we attempt to overcome this limitation by the use of commercial kits for both the p16 ICH and HPV DNA detection and type determination.</s></p><p><s>Kazakhstan is a partly Eastern European, partially Asian state with a mixed population.</s><s>The primary risk factor for the local population is the smoking, as there is no or very low level of smokeless tobacco consumption prevalent in other Asian countries.</s><s>The incidence of HNC is low in Kazakhstan when compared with, e.g., Europe.</s><s>However, we can follow similar trends.</s><s>There is rising agestandardized incidence rate of oral and oropharyngeal cancer from 3.8 in 2004 to 4.7 in 2015 per 100,000.</s><s>In the same time incidence of laryngeal cancer mostly attributed to smoking has decreased from 2.6 in 2004 to 2.3 in 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, as in other countries this trend can be attributed to rising number of HPV induced oropharyngeal cancer, but further studies needed to establish the liaison, as some trials show the stable percentage of HPV positive oropharyngeal cancers over a decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, most of the positive cases are from the oropharynx.</s><s>Even several cases from oral cavity are from sites anatomically closer to  the oropharynx, like the posterior third of the tongue or mandibular alveolar ridge.</s><s>This site dependence is the same as described in many trials performed worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In summary in this first study in the Central Asian region the prevalence of HPV induced oral and oropharyngeal cancer is lower than in Europe and North America, but higher than in other Asian countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>In concordance with European and American results, the rate of HPV positivity was higher in oropharyngeal than in oral cancer, the nonsmokers were significantly more frequent in the HPV positive group and HPV 16 was by far the most frequent type.</s><s>Further studies are needed to establish a better understanding of HPV prevalence and time trends in head and neck cancers in Kazakhstan.</s><s>This trial provides the first valuable information for public policy and healthcare workers to plan screening, awareness campaigns, vaccination and in the future also the treatment of these tumors.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Patients characteristics</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Primary Site</cell><cell>II stage</cell><cell>III stage</cell><cell>IV stage</cell><cell>Male</cell><cell>Female</cell><cell>Total</cell></row><row><cell>Oropharyngeal cancer</cell><cell>10 (28.6%)</cell><cell>19 (54.3%)</cell><cell>6 (17.1%)</cell><cell>25 (71.4%)</cell><cell>10 (28.6%)</cell><cell>35 (46.1%)</cell></row><row><cell>Tonsillar</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>13</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>18 (51.4%)</cell></row><row><cell>Base of tongue</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6 (17.1%)</cell></row><row><cell>Other</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>11 (31.4%)</cell></row><row><cell>Oral cavity cancer</cell><cell>12 (29.3%)</cell><cell>25 (61.0%)</cell><cell>4 (9.8%)</cell><cell>25 (61%)</cell><cell>16 (39%)</cell><cell>41 (53.9%)</cell></row><row><cell>Floor of mouth</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>13 (31.7%)</cell></row><row><cell>Tongue</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>16</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>14</cell><cell>9</cell><cell>23 (56.1%)</cell></row><row><cell>Buccal mucosa</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2 (4.9%)</cell></row><row><cell>Alveolar ridge, retromolar trigone</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>3 (7.3%)</cell></row></table></figure>
