<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Maternal obesity is a worldwide problem associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases in the offspring.</s><s>Genetic deletion of the gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) receptor (GIPR) prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in mice due to specific changes in energy and fat cell metabolism.</s><s>We investigated whether GIP-associated pathways may be targeted by fetal programming and mimicked the situation by exposing pregnant mice to control or HFD during pregnancy (intrauterine <ref type="bibr">[IU]</ref>) and lactation (L).</s><s>Male wild-type (WT) and Gipr 2/2 offspring received control chow until 25 weeks of age followed by 20 weeks of HFD.</s><s>Gipr 2/2 offspring of mice exposed to HFD during IU/L became insulin resistant and obese and exhibited increased adipose tissue inflammation and decreased peripheral tissue substrate utilization after being reintroduced to HFD, similar to WT mice on regular chow during IU/L.</s><s>They showed decreased hypothalamic insulin sensitivity compared with Gipr 2/2 mice on control diet during IU/L.</s><s>DNA methylation analysis revealed increased methylation of CpG dinucleotides and differential transcription factor binding of promoter regions of genes involved in lipid oxidation in the muscle of Gipr 2/2 offspring on HFD during IU/L, which were inversely correlated with gene expression levels.</s><s>Our data identify GIP-regulated metabolic pathways that are targeted by fetal programming.</s></p><p><s>Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is released from the duodenum after nutrient intake and regulates postprandial insulin secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>GIP is known for its anabolic effects in adipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and has been shown to stimulate the activity of lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue in vitro (3) (4).</s><s>Genetic ablation of the GIP receptor (GIPR) protects from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(5)</ref>.</s><s>GIPR knockout (Gipr 2/2 ) mice use fat as energy substrate rather than storing it in adipocytes.</s><s>Moreover, central appetite-regulating pathways are downregulated in ovariectomized female Gipr 2/2 mice (6), and energy expenditure is increased in Gipr 2/2 mice exposed to a high-glycemic index diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7)</ref> or an HFD <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(8)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since Gipr 2/2 mice are protected from obesity when exposed to a postweaning HFD, we hypothesized that this phenotype may be lost when these mice were exposed to the same HFD during pregnancy (intrauterine <ref type="bibr">[IU]</ref>) and lactation (L).</s><s>The IU milieu has a persisting influence on the development of adult diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10)</ref>.</s><s>Maternal caloric malnutrition as well as overnutrition during IU and L can induce metabolic disturbances later in life in offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12)</ref>.</s><s>Animal studies have shown that mice exposed to a maternal HFD during IU/L and weaned onto a standard chow developed adiposity, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis later in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14)</ref>.</s><s>Not only the diet during IU/L but also the postweaning diet is important for the manifestation of metabolic diseases.</s><s>Studies investigating the interaction of an HFD during IU/L and postweaning usually apply the HFD continuously from premating throughout the end of the study in adulthood.</s></p><p><s>However, in terms of programming effects of metabolic diseases, studies investigating a "second hit" later in life (e.g., a HFD) after a time frame of regular diet might better reflect the adult onset of obesity, as shown recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(15)</ref>.</s><s>Recent work suggests that the IU milieu induces epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, which affect gene transcription that persists throughout life <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Pathways targeted by epigenetic programming are of eminent importance to develop strategies to reduce the metabolic risks faced by offspring of obese mothers.</s><s>We therefore chose a model in which extensive research has already identified some pathways involved in the protection from obesity, the Gipr 2/2 mouse.</s></p><p><s>Our results demonstrate that Gipr 2/2 mice exposed to an HFD during IU/L, weaned onto a regular chow for 22 weeks, and then reexposed to the HFD lose their metabolic protection, which is associated with hypermethylation of certain CpG dinucleotides in the promoter regions of genes involved in energy balance and with changes in central insulin sensitivity.</s><s>This phenotype was similar to wild-type (WT) mice that were exposed to a control chow during IU/L but also challenged with an HFD later in life.</s><s>We therefore conclude that the protection from diet-induced obesity in Gipr 2/2 mice is "overruled" by deleterious and persistent fetal programming effects of an HFD up to at least 45 weeks of life and identify metabolic pathways addressed by GIP.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study shows that Gipr 2/2 mice are no longer protected from the adverse effects of an HFD in early adulthood when this diet was applied during IU and L. The phenotypic alterations were evident by increased adiposity, enlarged adipocytes, impaired glucose tolerance, and increased proinflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue in KO H-C-H compared with KO C-C-H mice.</s><s>KO H-C-H mice behaved similar to WT mice on a normal chow during IU/L and exposed to an HFD later in life.</s><s>Mechanistically, this phenotype is most likely due to central inhibition of PI3K causing decreased insulin sensitivity in the hypothalamus and to decreased peripheral fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle.</s><s>Moreover, our study suggests that alterations in DNA methylation might be at least partially responsible for the changes in energy consumption.</s><s>WT mice on HFD during IU/L and reexposed to this diet later in life (WT H-C-H) showed a metabolic phenotype similar to that of WT C-C-H.</s><s>Results are shown in Supplementary Figs.</s><s><ref type="bibr">6-11.</ref></s><s>We did not see a relevant difference in body weight or body fat between KO H-C and KO C-C mice up to the age of 25 weeks.</s><s>After the HFD was started at the age of 25 weeks, differences for genotypes and maternal diet became evident.</s><s>KO C-C-H showed significantly lower body weight and total body fat compared with WT C-C-H as shown previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8)</ref>.</s><s>The growth curve of KO H-C-H mice was in between the WT C-C-H and KO C-C-H mice, but KO H-C-H mice had significantly increased total body fat after 6 and 12 weeks upon reexposure to an HFD compared with KO C-C-H mice.</s><s>We show that even after a time window of 22 weeks on the C diet, Gipr 2/2 mice on an HFD during IU/L ("first hit") are programmed to overreact toward the "second hit" of the HFD compared with Gipr 2/2 mice on a C diet during IU/L.</s><s>This is also reflected by the increased size of adipocytes in KO H-C-H compared with KO C-C-H mice, which is important, since the size of adipocytes is correlated with adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance (22).</s><s>This strong programming phenomenon was shown recently in a CID1 mouse model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr">22)</ref>: WT male offspring of damns fed an HFD during IU/L were kept on normal chow after weaning until the age of 25 weeks and then reintroduced to the HFD for 19 weeks.</s><s>These mice showed higher body weight, larger adipocytes, and reduced glucose tolerance compared with mice exposed to the HFD at 25 weeks of age only.</s></p><p><s>The GIP signaling pathway is necessary for adipocyte development <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(23)</ref>.</s><s>This might explain why lacking the GIPR protects Gipr 2/2 mice from diet-induced obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24)</ref>.</s><s>However, if the HFD appears as a "second hit" later in life, this protection disappears and the fetal programming effect of an HFD overrules the Gipr 2/2 phenotype.</s><s>Nevertheless, there was less weight gain in the KO H-C-H mice than in WT controls suggesting that some protection remained despite fetal programming effects of an HFD.</s><s>One possible component might relate to the moderate impairment of insulin release in the Gipr 2/2 mice, which reduces the obesogenic effect of insulin.</s><s>It is most likely that KO H-C-H as well as WT C-C-H mice have severe b-cell damage, since serum insulin concentrations were dramatically reduced during the intraperitoneal GTT, whereas KO C-C-H were able to minimally increase insulin release at the beginning of the intraperitoneal GTT.</s></p><p><s>Obesity is associated with increased gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines or MCP-1 <ref type="bibr"

muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">31)</ref>, genes involved in fatty acid oxidation were significantly upregulated in KO C-C-H compared with WT C-C-H but were downregulated in KO H-C-H.</s><s>DNA methylation analysis correlated with the transcription data and indicated the induction of epigenetic changes in Gipr 2/2 mice in muscle for Cpt1b and Ppara once they are exposed to an HFD during IU/L.</s><s>EMSA experiments suggest a functional relevance of the identified Ppara CpG 2140 site for transcriptional regulation.</s></p><p><s>It has been shown that the IU milieu is able to induce epigenetic changes.</s><s>A study in rats demonstrated that an HFD during IU/L resulted in DNA hypomethylation in liver in young male offspring that seemed to be

over a period of 4 days.</s><s>We clearly see an increased cumulative food intake in KO C-C-H compared with WT C-C-H, which matches the observation that Gipr 2/2 mice use fat for energy metabolism rather than storing it in adipose tissue (5).</s><s>This phenomenon was reversed when Gipr 2/2 mice were placed on an HFD during IU/L, indicating that GIP physiologically prevents increased energy expenditure in response to increased energy intake as shown earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Energy intake is regulated in the hypothalamus, and hypothalamic insulin sensitivity is necessary for balanced food consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(33)</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that a reduction in the catalytic subunit p85a of PI3K enhances

throughout IU/L and the first 120 days of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(35)</ref>.</s><s>HFD-induced obesity was shown to require activation of PI3K-dependent hypothalamic pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(36)</ref>.</s><s>Our results indicate that KO C-C-H mice have enhanced hypothalamic insulin sensitivity compared with WT C-C-H mice, since we saw a significant reduction of hypothalamic p85a PI3K gene expression in the former, which correlated with the glucose challenge test.</s><s>This was reversed in KO H-C-H mice similar to WT C-C-H mice.</s><s>These results were further supported by increased phosphorylation of the hypothalamic kinase mTOR and S6 protein in the mTOR signaling pathway downstream of Akt.</s><s>Increased mTOR signaling in the hypothalamus is associated with decreased food intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(37)</ref>, which was also observed in our study.</s><s>Thus, central modulation of insulin sensitivity is proposed as a novel mechanism involved in GIP action.</s><s>However, we could not detect any DNA methylation changes in the p85a PI3K gene promoter.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we used the approach of fetal programming by HFD to identify GIP-regulated metabolic pathways that alter hypothalamic insulin sensitivity and the PGC-1a-driven and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a-driven fat oxidation in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue inflammation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>High-Fat Diet During Mouse Pregnancy and
