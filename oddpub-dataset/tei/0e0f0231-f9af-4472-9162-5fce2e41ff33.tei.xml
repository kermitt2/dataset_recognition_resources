<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample collection and handling</head><p><s>PB specimens (≥3 mL EDTA-PB) were investigated at predefined time points including weekly intervals between days +7 and +49, followed by 2-week intervals until day +100, and four additional time points on days +120, +150, +180 and +360, whenever possible.</s><s>Eight or more consecutive PB specimens were available for chimerism analysis in the majority of transplant recipients studied, with a mean of 8.6 samples per patient (median 8; range, 2-20).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation of specific leukocyte subsets by flow-sorting</head><p><s>The post-transplant PB samples were analyzed by four-color quantitative fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) as described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>All cell types forming ≥1% of nucleated cells were targets for cell sorting.</s><s>Routinely sorted cells comprised CD33 + monocytes, CD15 + granulocytes, CD3 + /CD4 + helper T cells, CD3 + /CD8 + cytotoxic T cells, CD19 + /CD34mature B cells, CD3 -/CD56 + natural killer cells and CD34 + early hematopoietic progenitor cells (also including CD34 + /CD19 + cells).</s><s>The targeted number of cells sorted for subsequent analysis of chimerism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> was 4 000 per cell population, and ranged between 1 000 and 15 000.</s><s>The purity of the sorted leukocyte fractions was &gt;98%.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of donor/recipient chimerism and minimal residual disease</head><p><s>DNA was extracted from nucleated cells using the QIAamp Blood kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).</s><s>Chimerism was evaluated using the EuroChimerism approach, an internationally validated assay for quantitative analysis of donor and recipient cells after transplantation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Data from PCR-based MRD analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> were available at similar time points to chimerism testing in ten patients, thereby permitting a limited direct comparison between the methodological approaches.</s></p></div>
