<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Alopecia areata (AA) is a prevalent autoimmune disease with 10 known susceptibility loci.</s></p><p><s>Here we perform the first meta-analysis of research on AA by combining data from two genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and replication with supplemented ImmunoChip data for a total of 3,253 cases and 7,543 controls.</s><s>The strongest region of association is the major histocompatibility complex, where we fine-map four independent effects, all implicating human leukocyte antigen-DR as a key aetiologic driver.</s><s>Outside the major histocompatibility complex, we identify two novel loci that exceed the threshold of statistical significance, containing ACOXL/BCL2L11(BIM) (2q13); GARP (LRRC32) (11q13.5),</s><s>as well as a third nominally significant region SH2B3(LNK)/ATXN2 (12q24.12).</s><s>Candidate susceptibility gene expression analysis in these regions demonstrates expression in relevant immune cells and the hair follicle.</s><s>We integrate our results with data from seven other autoimmune diseases and provide insight into the alignment of AA within these disorders.</s><s>Our findings uncover new molecular pathways disrupted in AA, including autophagy/apoptosis, transforming growth factor beta/Tregs and JAK kinase signalling, and support the causal role of aberrant immune processes in AA.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>In this study, we have increased our cohort size and performed a combined analysis of two GWAS using Illumina Human660Wand Omni1-Quad BeadChips, analysing a total of 2,489 cases and 5,287 controls ascertained in the US and Central Europe (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Association analyses are performed with logistic regression.</s><s>In a meta-analysis of these data, nine of the previously implicated regions exceeded statistical significance (Po5 Â 10 À 8 ), with STX17 achieving nominal significance (rs10124366; P ¼ 1.09 Â 10 À 5 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; Supplementary Data 1).</s></p><p><s>First, to resolve the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) association signal (P ¼ 4.91 Â 10 À 58 for the best single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9275516), we used a published imputation and analysis protocol to perform fine-mapping (Supplementary Data 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8</ref> .</s><s>Conditional analysis revealed four independent variants located at the classical HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 genes.</s><s>The most significant variant was amino-acid position 37 in HLA-DRb1 (omnibus P value ¼ 4.99 Â 10 À 73 ).</s><s>Of the five possible amino acids at this position, Leu (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.56), Tyr (OR ¼ 1.54) and Phe (OR ¼ 1.19) conferred a higher risk of AA, whereas the other residues conferred lower risk (OR for Asn ¼ 0.42; OR for Ser ¼ 0.74).</s><s>Adjusting for the effects of HLA-DRb1 amino-acid position 37, we found an independent association due to an intronic SNP of HLA-DRA, rs9268657 (OR ¼ 0.63, P value ¼ 4.48E <ref type="bibr">À 41</ref> ).</s><s>Functional annotation of this SNP and its close proxies (R 2 40.9) reveal that they influence expression levels of HLA-DRB1 (ref.</s><s>9).</s><s>Adjusting for both HLA-DRb1 amino-acid position 37 and rs9268657, we identified another independent association for the classical allele HLA-DRB1*04:01 (OR ¼ 1.64, P value ¼ 1.76 Â 10 À 12 ), confirming previous associations in candidate gene studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11</ref> .</s><s>Finally, adjusting for HLA-DRb1 amino-acid position 37, rs9268657 and HLA-DRB1*04:01, amino-acid position 13 in HLA-DRb1 was also significant (P value ¼ 4.57 Â 10 À 16 ).</s><s>Of the six possible alleles at this position, three increased risk (Tyr, OR ¼ 1.41; Ser, OR ¼ 1.35; Phe, OR ¼ 1.09), two are protective (His, OR ¼ 0.57; Gly, OR ¼ 0.50) and one demonstrated no effect (Arg, OR ¼ 0.98) (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Further rounds of conditional analyses yielded no additional significant results (P42.11</s><s>Â 10 À 6 ).</s></p><p><s>Collectively, these four independent associations in the MHC implicate HLA-DR as the primary risk factor in AA, presumably through antigen presentation, similar to other immune-mediated diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12</ref> .</s><s>For example, HLA-DRb1 amino-acid positions 13 and 37 contribute to P4 and P9 peptide-binding pockets, respectively; the disease associations of HLA-DRB1*04:01 are thought to be driven by the shared epitope (amino-acid residues 70-74) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12</ref> , which also occur within the peptide-binding cleft (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Polymorphic residues within peptide-binding pockets of HLA-DR influence binding affinities of peptides, and thus may shape the repertoire of autoantigens capable of triggering or perpetuating disease.</s></p><p><s>Next, we performed replication of SNPs in functionally relevant loci that achieved suggestive evidence for association in the meta-analysis (5 Â 10 À 8 4P41 Â 10 À 5 ), utilizing an independent cohort of Central European ancestry.</s><s>The Immunochip was used to genotype 318 cases and 1,688 controls and a Sequenom assay was used to genotype 85 SNPs not included on the Immunochip in a cohort of 764 cases and 568 controls.</s><s>This analysis identified statistically significant associations in two novel genomic regions:

<ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; Supplementary Data 3).</s></p><p><s>The association signal at chromosome 2q13 is located within an intron of ACOXL, and the region of association extends to include BCL2L11 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>This region has been implicated in GWAS for two other autoimmune diseases: immunoglobulin-A nephropathy and primary sclerosing cholangitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> .</s><s>ACOXL belongs to the acyl-coenzyme A oxidase gene family.</s><s>While other family members play well-studied roles in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, very little is known about the function of this gene.</s><s>BCL-2-like 11, also known as BIM, is a member of the BCL-2 protein family and contains a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) that interacts with other members to act as a pro-apoptotic factor.</s><s>BIM has been widely studied in the context of apoptosis of immune cells, and has also been implicated in apoptosis of melanocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref> .</s><s>More recently, data have emerged that implicate BIM in the destruction of some end-organs in autoimmune diseases, such as pancreatic beta cells in type 1 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, BIM has also been shown to regulate autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref> , adding to growing evidence for the importance of this process in AA as recently shown by functional studies of STX17 (refs 17,18).</s><s>BIM is widely expressed in multiple cell types, including immune-related, epithelial and hair follicle cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref> .</s><s>We first performed reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of BIM expression in immune cells and scalp hair follicles (SHFs).</s><s>We detected BIM transcript in whole-peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including T, natural killer and B cells, and monocytes (MCs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>In plucked human SHFs, we observed expression of an alternative splice isoform, BIM-S, the most pro-apoptotic variant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref> .</s><s>To characterize protein localization within hair follicles, we performed immunofluorescence staining on both human and mouse hair follicles.</s><s>In the human hair follicle, BIM is highly expressed in the bulb of the hair follicle, especially within the matrix cells, in a pattern strikingly restricted to early catagen, but not anagen or telogen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>The hair bulb matrix is the principal location of differentiated, pigment-producing melanocytes, which are postulated to undergo apoptosis during catagen <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22</ref> .</s><s>In mouse hair follicles, BIM localized to the apoptosing strand and lower portion of the catagen hair follicle, consistent with its expression in human hairs.</s><s>Remarkably, BIM expression was restricted to catagen hair follicles, where immunofluorescence staining performed on anagen or telogen hairs produced no signal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>, upper panel).</s><s>Finally, to investigate a possible role of BIM in AA pathogenesis, we used a mouse model that recapitulates genetic and molecular profiles of human AA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23</ref> .</s><s>C3H/HeJ spontaneously develops AA, and we performed immunofluorescence staining on affected and unaffected skin.</s><s>We observed a striking and widespread increase in BIM expression throughout affected skin and hair follicles, which was not restricted to catagen hair follicles and appeared further upregulated in lesional skin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>, lower panel).</s><s>The regression stage of a normal cycling hair follicle, catagen, is characterized by apoptosis and cell death.</s><s>We postulate that dysregulation of BIM in hair-matrix keratinocytes and/or hair follicle melanocytes contributes to the early entry into dystrophic catagen in AA hair follicles in active disease.</s></p><p><s>The second novel region that exceeded statistical significance at chromosome 11q13.5</s><s>(rs2155219, P ¼ 1.25 Â 10 À 8 ) contains three gene transcripts, including

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expression of GARP on activated human Treg cells correlates with</head><p><s>A third novel region on chromosome 12q24.12</s><s>that achieved suggestive evidence for association (P ¼ 1.3 Â 10 À 7 ) is of interest, because several genes harboured within the region functionally align with other associated genes.</s><s>This region has demonstrated associations with multiple autoimmune diseases, and contains 10 genes including SH2B adaptor protein 3 (SH2B3) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family (ALDH2).</s><s>SH2B3, also known as LNK, is a key negative regulator of cytokine signalling via receptor tyrosine kinases and JAK signalling.</s><s>Two missense variants that confer increased cytokine production and enhanced signalling have been reported in the literature (rs3184504 and rs72650673) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">29</ref> .</s><s>We genotyped these two functional polymorphisms in a sample of 96 chromosomes from AA patients carrying the AA-associated risk allele (rs653178*G), and found that 93 chromosomes also carried the rs3184504*T risk allele (f ¼ 0.97).</s><s>This increase in allele frequency over what would be expected among a sample of European Americans (f ¼ 0.51 in Exome Variant Server ESP6500) indicates that there is strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the AA-associated risk variant and this functional polymorphism, and suggests that R262W could be contributing to AA pathogenesis.</s><s>The rs72650673*A allele was not found in our sample, consistent with its low allele frequency among European Americans (f ¼ 0.002 in Exome Variant Server ESP6500).</s><s>We found by RT-PCR analysis that LNK is highly expressed in whole PBMCs, as well as T cells, natural killer, B cells and MCs, but did not detect expression in plucked SHFs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>ALDH2 has been identified as a citrullinated antigen in rheumatoid arthritis patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">30</ref> .</s><s>This gene has been studied in the skin, with expression localizing to epidermis, sebaceous glands and hair follicles, where it is hypothesized to reduce the accumulation of oxidative stress-induced aldehydes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The strong association with HLA class II in AA points towards the involvement of CD4 þ T cells in the pathogenesis.</s><s>The importance of this T-cell subset is supported by the presence of perifollicular CD4 þ T cells in addition to intrabulbar CD8 þ T cells in human AA.</s><s>Finally, we analysed these data in the context of other autoimmune diseases by performing CPMA using the 107 SNPs used in the original description of the analysis and data from seven other autoimmune diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">32</ref> .</s><s>We found 50 SNPs that are associated at or near significance across two or more diseases, and clustering of these according to their association with disease identified five groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a,b</ref>).</s><s>Protein-protein interaction graphs of each SNP cluster demonstrate that for several of the groups, the proteins coded from these regions interact either directly or via an intermediary to a significant degree (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref>).</s><s>Integration of AA into the CPMA demonstrates mechanistic alignment with coeliac disease, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease, with most of the overlap coming from the first cluster of genes.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, this meta-analysis for the first time resolves HLA associations and demonstrates the pivotal aetiological role of HLA-DR.</s><s>Furthermore, the identification of specific residues in HLA-DRb1 that are over-represented among AA patients will allow us to better model peptide class II MHC interactions and thus predict autoantigens in AA.</s><s>Associations outside HLA provide new evidence for the importance of Treg maintenance and immune response pathways in AA.</s><s>Furthermore, autophagy and apoptosis are emerging as processes of aetiologic importance in AA.</s><s>These insights will allow us to better understand the molecular taxonomy of autoimmune diseases and the alignment of AA within this class of disorders.</s><s>Importantly, as GWAS help to resolve disease mechanisms and identify pathogenic pathways perturbed in AA and autoimmunity in general, these approaches advance the field towards precision medicine in autoimmunity.</s></p></div>
