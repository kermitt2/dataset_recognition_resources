<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Maternal smoking during pregnancy increases childhood asthma risk, but health effects in children of nonsmoking mothers passively exposed to tobacco smoke during pregnancy are unclear.</s><s>We examined the association of maternal passive smoking during pregnancy and wheeze in children aged ⩽2 years.</s></p><p><s>Individual data of 27 993 mother-child pairs from 15 European birth cohorts were combined in pooled analyses taking into consideration potential confounders.</s></p><p><s>Children with maternal exposure to passive smoking during pregnancy and no other smoking exposure were more likely to develop wheeze up to the age of 2 years (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03-1.20)</s><s>compared with unexposed children.</s><s>Risk of wheeze was further increased by children's postnatal passive smoke exposure in addition to their mothers' passive exposure during pregnancy (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.19-1.40)</s><s>and highest in children with both sources of passive exposure and mothers who smoked actively during pregnancy (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.59-1.88).</s><s>Risk of wheeze associated with tobacco smoke exposure was higher in children with an allergic versus nonallergic family history.</s></p><p><s>Maternal passive smoking exposure during pregnancy is an independent risk factor for wheeze in children up to the age of 2 years.</s><s>Pregnant females should avoid active and passive exposure to tobacco smoke for the benefit of their children's health.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This large European Union-wide pooled analysis of cohort studies demonstrates that maternal passive smoking during pregnancy is an independent risk factor for wheeze in children in the first 2 years of life.</s><s>Prenatal active smoking of the mother and postnatal passive smoking of the child pose additional threats to the child, with each timeframe of exposure adding an additional risk towards the development of wheeze before the age of 2 years.</s><s>Notably, both prenatal maternal and postnatal infant passive smoke exposure were found to have an effect on the risk of developing wheeze, with a higher effect observed for prenatal maternal passive smoking than postnatal infant passive smoking; their combined exposure was associated with an even higher increase in risk.</s><s>This effect was higher among children of parents with allergy than among children of parents without allergy.</s></p><p><s>Parental prenatal and postnatal active smoking has been shown to increase the risk for the development of asthma and wheeze later in life, a finding that has been previously identified by individual ENRIECO cohorts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr"

of five cohorts from northern Europe and Japan identified that any prenatal maternal smoking was associated with an increase in risk of wheeze in children aged ⩽2 years (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.67)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, when we assessed the role of active maternal smoking during pregnancy alone (excluding any prenatal maternal passive smoking or postnatal infant passive smoke exposure) a lower risk (OR 1.33) was noted, although this estimate was based on small numbers.</s><s>Combining active maternal prenatal smoking with passive smoking exposure led to higher risks for its combination with prenatal maternal passive smoking (OR 1.51), postnatal infant passive smoking (OR 1.74) and combined prenatal/postnatal exposure to passive smoking (OR 1.73).</s><s>A potential explanation for the relatively modest although statistically significant risk associated with active smoking without passive smoking could be that this small group of mothers could be selected and perhaps quit smoking during pregnancy.</s></p><p><s>The significant shift that these analyses provide from the existing literature is the investigation between different timeframes of exposure on the risk of developing wheeze.</s><s>Exposure to passive smoking alone was identified to increase the risk of developing wheeze if passive smoking exposure is persistent during the prenatal and postnatal period, while an increased risk for wheeze was noted among children who were only exposed to passive smoking prenatally.</s><s>This latter risk of ∼10% could, in part, be due to residual confounding, but is still relevant for public health because exposure in many countries is very common.</s><s>More importantly, as this study has shown, prenatal passive smoking exposure combined with other smoking exposures adds to the overall risk.</s><s>These findings further stress the importance of protecting Cohort-specific odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and meta-analysis using random effects, adjusted for sex of the child, siblings, birthweight, parental atopic status and gestational age.</s></p><p><s>pregnant females and infants from passive smoke exposure, in both public and private areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Exposure to passive smoking in public places has been substantially regulated over the past decade with significant health gains for children <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>While increased population awareness and the adoption of smoke-free environments have been found to reduce exposure inside the home <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, further action is needed to reduce exposure in other private areas that have been identified to contribute significantly to overall passive smoke exposure during the gestational period, such as exposure within the family car <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The association of smoking and wheeze may differ depending on familial history of allergy, although findings are inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>However, our stratified analysis indicated a substantial increase in the risk of developing wheeze among both those exposed to SHS and those who had a familial history of allergy and were exposed to prenatal active smoking.</s><s>Furthermore, the possible higher risk of developing wheeze among northern European participants may be attributable to higher exposure to smoke indoors in the north compared to the south because of better ventilation of indoor air in the south due to warmer climate and having open windows more frequently.</s><s>It could also be attributable to other contributing factors that predispose to the development of wheeze, such as the role of viral respiratory tract infections, which we could not investigate, or, less likely, to possible genetic variances between European populations.</s></p><p><s>Possible explanations for the increased risk of wheeze caused by passive tobacco smoke exposure in young children are proinflammatory mediator release, stimulation of inflammatory cells in the respiratory system, oxidative stress and increased cysteinyl leukotrienes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, in recent years there has been an increase in the evidence for the effect of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of action, through which maternal exposures may affect allergies and asthma in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One of the main strengths of the current analysis is the birth cohort study design of all studies included, which allowed us to assess temporal relationships between exposure to active and passive smoking and the development of wheeze.</s><s>Although we did not have the exact timing of postnatal passive smoke in relation to timing of wheezing symptoms during the first 2 years it seems very unlikely that parents would start smoking in front of their children after, rather than before their children had a wheezing episode.</s><s>Our large sample size provided a robust dataset that permitted the investigation of the independent role of each window of exposure ( prenatal versus postnatal) and exposure type (active smoking versus passive) on the development of wheeze before the age of 2 years.</s><s>Cohort-specific odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and meta-analysis using random effects, adjusted for sex of the child, siblings, birthweight, parental atopic status and gestational age.</s></p><p><s>main limitation of our study was that we relied on parental report for both the exposure and the outcome, which may be subject to underreporting, recall and report bias.</s><s>However, numerous studies have shown that participants (usually mothers) answer reliably about childhood exposure to SHS by their mother or their father <ref type="bibr"

respiratory symptoms or chronic diseases based on self-reported exposure to passive smoking are frequently equally strong, if not stronger, than those based on cotinine or other biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>Other limitations include the lack of information on other potential confounders (such as daycare attendance, social class and infections) and the inclusion only of studies participating in this large European project.</s><s>Within our study, household and workplace passive smoking were used as a proxy for overall exposure to passive smoking, since a detailed evaluation for exposure in other locations was not available for several cohorts.</s><s>It is possible that females who reported no passive smoking exposure at work or in their homes might have been exposed from other sources (i.e.</s><s>cafes and bars); however, such misclassification of exposure is likely to have been nondifferential and thus would have been likely to attenuate the
