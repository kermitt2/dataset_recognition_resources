<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p><s>Study Design.</s><s>The WASH Benefits trial was conducted in four districts (Gazipur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, Tangail) in central rural Bangladesh.</s><s>Groundwater in parts of Bangladesh contains high levels of naturally occurring arsenic and iron. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s>tudy districts were chosen to have low concentrations of these groundwater chemicals because the trial's chlorine-based microbiological water quality intervention was not designed to remove arsenic and also because the chlorine demand exerted by iron limits the effectiveness of chlorination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>The areas were also chosen to not have any major water, sanitation and hygiene programs that would interfere with study activities.</s></p><p><s>The parent WASH Benefits trial enrolled pregnant women with the objective of following their birth cohort (referred to as "index children" hereinafter).</s><s>Field staff screened the study area for eligible women and recorded their global positioning system (GPS) coordinates.</s><s>Neighboring groups of eight eligible women were grouped into clusters based on their coordinates.</s><s>Cluster dimensions were chosen such that one field worker could visit all cluster participants in 1 day.</s><s>A minimum 1 km buffer was enforced between clusters to minimize spillovers of intervention effects and/ or intervention messages between study arms.</s><s>Every eight adjacent clusters formed a geographic block.</s><s>An off-site investigator (BFA) block-randomized clusters into study arms using a random number generator, providing geographically pair-matched randomization.</s><s>The trial arms included individual and combined water, sanitation, handwashing and nutrition interventions and a double-sized control arm which received no intervention.</s><s>Details of the trial design have been reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref></s><s>−26 Measures of environmental contamination were prespecified intermediate outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref></s><s>e conducted an environmental assessment among the control, sanitation and combined water, sanitation and handwashing (WSH) arms of the trial (see Supporting Information (SI) Text S1 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> for details of all environmental assessments nested within WASH Benefits).</s><s>The sanitation intervention included upgrades to concrete-lined double-pit latrines, and provision of child potties and scoops for the disposal of human and animal feces.</s><s>Households in Bangladesh are clustered in multifamily compounds.</s><s>All households in the compound where the enrolled women and their newborns lived received latrine upgrades, potties and scoops in order to reduce fecal contamination in the shared compound environment.</s><s>Enrolled compounds made up &lt;10% of a given geographical area because of the eligibility criterion of having a pregnant woman.</s><s>As such, the trial did not provide community-wide sanitation coverage.</s><s>The water treatment and handwashing interventions targeted the household where the enrolled women lived and included (1) point-of-use water treatment with sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC, Aquatabs) (Medentech, Wexford, Ireland) and safe storage in a narrow-mouth, lidded container with spigot and (2) provision of handwashing stations in the kitchen and latrine areas with a water reservoir, a bottle containing a soapy water mixture and a basin to catch the rinsewater.</s></p><p><s>Community health promoters hired from among local women and trained specifically for the study visited intervention households on average six times per month throughout the trial to provide intervention products for free, replenish supplies as needed throughout the study period and encourage user adherence.</s><s>Intervention adherence, measured objectively with unannounced spot-check and structured observations as an independent investigation from the study activities reported here, was high throughout the study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">27</ref></s><s>Households in the intervention arms retained the intervention hardware (e.g., latrines, potties, safe storage container) but the supply of consumables (chlorine tablets, soapy water solution) was discontinued after the end of the trial.</s><s>Control households did not receive any interventions or health promoter visits during or after the trial.</s><s>No compensation was offered for participation.</s><s>−29 Procedures.</s><s>We conducted the environmental assessment after roughly 4 months of intervention.</s><s>In the three study arms selected for the environmental assessment, field staff from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) trained specifically for this study conducted household visits to assess indicators of household water, sanitation and hygiene practices through spot-check observations and a structured questionnaire.</s><s>They collected samples of source and stored drinking water, ambient water from ponds adjacent to enrolled households and used for bathing and domestic chores, hand rinses from index children, food given to young children, courtyard soil and flies captured near the kitchen to quantify fecal indicator bacteria in the domestic environment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>They also enumerated and speciated synanthropic flies in the kitchen area.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</head><p><s>Article Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Indicators.</s><s>Field workers observed drinking water storage conditions and recorded userreported water treatment practices.</s><s>In households reporting chlorination, they measured the free chlorine residual in stored drinking water with a digital colorimeter (Hach Pocket Colorimeter II).</s><s>They inspected the compounds for latrine access, presence of an improved latrine as defined by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, <ref type="bibr">30</ref> and latrine functionality and condition.</s><s>They recorded caregiverreported child defecation and child feces handling practices.</s><s>Field staff also examined caregiver and index child hands (fingernails, fingerpads, palms) for visible dirt as a proxy for handwashing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref> and checked for the presence of water and soap within six steps of the latrine and kitchen.</s><s>Finally, they observed food storage conditions such as whether the storage container was covered or elevated to assess if these were indirectly affected by the interventions even though the intervention packages did not entail any materials and behavioral messages for hygienic storage of food.</s></p><p><s>Sample Collection.</s><s>Samples were collected using sterile Whirlpak bags (Nasco Modesto, Salida, CA).</s><s>Clean gloves were worn while collecting pond, hand rinse, food and soil samples.</s><s>To sample tubewells, field workers removed fabric or other materials from the tubewell mouth and flushed the well by pumping five times before collecting 250 mL of water.</s><s>To collect stored water, field workers asked the respondent to provide a glass of drinking water from the primary storage container in the same manner they would give it to their children and pour approximately 150 mL into the Whirlpak.</s><s>If the respondent reported using chlorine, sodium thiosulfate was used to neutralize residual chlorine.</s><s>Ponds were sampled by dipping a Whirlpak into the pond and collecting 250 mL of water from the pond surface in the area where the household reported most commonly accessing the pond.</s><s>Hand rinse samples were collected from the index child (aged 1−14 months), and if not available, from the next youngest child in the household.</s><s>To sample child hands, field workers asked the respondent to place the child's left-hand into a Whirlpak prefilled with 250 mL of distilled water.</s><s>The hand was massaged from outside the bag for 15 s and shaken for 15 s.</s><s>The procedure was repeated with the right-hand in the same bag, and the rinsewater was preserved in the Whirlpak.</s><s>To sample food given to young children, field workers identified stored food prepared to be served to children &lt;5 years and asked the respondent to provide a small amount in the same manner they would serve it to their children.</s><s>They prioritized sampling rice if available.</s><s>Field staff scooped the food from the dish it was provided in into a 50 mL sterile tube using a sterile spoon.</s><s>To sample soil, the respondent was asked to identify the outdoor area where young children had most recently spent time.</s><s>Field workers marked a 30 × 30 cm area using a stencil sterilized with ethanol between each household and scraped the top layer of soil within the stencil into a Whirlpak using a sterile scoop; the area was scraped once vertically and once horizontally to collect approximately 50 g of soil.</s><s>To enumerate and sample flies, field workers identified a suitable location in the kitchen area (away from the stove smoke, under a roof or protected from rain) and horizontally hung three 1.5-foot strips of nonbaited sticky fly tape.</s><s>They returned to the household 3−6 h later to count the captured synanthropic flies and speciate them according to a visual identification chart. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref></s><s>hey removed one fly from the center of the strip with the most flies using sterile tweezers and placed it into a Whirlpak.</s><s>Samples were transported to the icddr,b field laboratory on ice at 2−8 °C.</s></p><p><s>Sample Processing.</s><s>Samples were analyzed in 100 mL aliquots using IDEXX Quantitray (IDEXX Laboratories, Maine, USA) within 12 h of collection.</s><s>Tubewell and stored water was analyzed undiluted.</s><s>Pond samples were diluted 1:100 (1 mL of sample +99 mL of distilled water) and hand rinses 1:2 (50 mL of sample +50 mL of distilled water).</s><s>Food and soil were homogenized with distilled water in a sterile blending bag (Interscience, Saint Nom, France) using a laboratory-scale food processer (Interscience, Saint Nom, France).</s><s>A 10 g food aliquot was homogenized with 100 mL water; 10 mL of homogenate was then mixed with 90 mL of distilled water.</s><s>A 20 g soil aliquot was homogenized with 200 mL water; 1 mL of homogenate was mixed with 99 mL of distilled water, serially repeated twice, to generate a final 100 mL aliquot.</s><s>Additional 5 g aliquots of food and soil were oven-dried overnight to determine moisture content.</s><s>Flies were homogenized with a pestle from outside the Whirlpak and mixed with 100 mL of distilled water;

and our measurements (4 months on average) was not enough time for water, sanitation and hygiene practices to change or for environmental reservoirs to respond to any reductions in fecal input.</s><s>While the water quality improvements indicate that water treatment practices had taken hold, sanitation behaviors might not have changed sufficiently to impact environmental contamination.</s><s>Additionally, subsurface infiltration from new pit latrines is higher during the initial few months and diminishes afterward, potentially due to the formation of a layer (like the schmutzdecke on biosand filters) that attenuates contamination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47</ref></s><s>Finally, while E. coli typically survives &lt;20 days in soil, <ref type="bibr"
