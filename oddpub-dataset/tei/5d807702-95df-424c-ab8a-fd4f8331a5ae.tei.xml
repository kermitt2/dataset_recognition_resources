<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>This retrospective study examined 114 VLBW infants (birth weight &lt; 1500 g) who had hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA) and underwent LFT during early infancy.</s><s>All patients initially received pharmacological treatment; this initial treatment failed in 40 patients, who then underwent PDA ligation.</s><s>We used the clinical risk index for babies (CRIB) score to assess initial neonatal risk of hospital mortality.</s><s>This scoring system considers birth weight, gestational age, maximum and minimum fraction of inspired oxygen, maximum base excess during the first 12 h of life, and presence of congenital malformations.</s><s>Infants were assessed between November 2004 and February 2014 at a median postmenstrual age of 48 weeks.</s><s>LFT is a part of our routine follow-up care of infants after neonatal intensive care.</s><s>Infants with congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disease, or thoracic wall deformities were excluded.</s></p><p><s>An hsPDA was defined by the following criteria: (i) respiratory set-back with supplemental oxygen requirement of more than 30% and/or mechanical ventilation and/or (ii) left atrium to aortic root ratio of at least 1.4 in the echocardiogram, (iii) ductal size (&gt;1.5 mm) and flow pattern, and/or (iv) decreased end-diastolic flow in the anterior cerebral artery with a resistance index of at least 0.85 based on cerebral ultrasound.</s><s>Therapy was initiated according to a previously published algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>When the PDA persisted despite pharmacological treatment and infants could not be weaned from mechanical ventilation, surgical closure with a vascular clip or suture was performed via a posterolateral thoracotomy.</s></p><p><s>Enrolled infants were classified into two groups according to treatment: (i) no PDA ligation (pharmacological closure with intravenous indomethacin or intravenous or oral ibuprofen, N = 74), and (ii) surgical closure by PDA ligation (N = 40).</s><s>All parents provided written informed consent before LFT, and the Institutional Data Safety Committee approved this study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lung function testing</head><p><s>LFT was performed in clinically stable children who had no lower airway infections in the preceding 3 weeks.</s><s>The departmental protocol for LTF has previously been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, prior to testing, body weight and body length (crown to heel) were measured.</s><s>At 15-30 min before LFT, sleep was induced by oral administration of chloral hydrate (50 mg•kg −1 ).</s><s>Sleeping infants were measured while in a supine position, with the neck supported by a neck roll in a neutral position.</s><s>A compliant silicon infant mask (size 1, 2 or 3 as appropriate; Vital Signs Inc., Totowa, NJ, USA) was tightly placed over the nose and mouth.</s></p><p><s>Tidal breathing parameters (tidal volume [V T ], respiratory rate [RR], minute ventilation [V' E ], peak tidal inspiratory flow [PTIF], peak tidal expiratory flow [PTEF], and the ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow to expiratory time [t ptef /t e ]) were initially measured by the deadspace free flow-through technique using custommade equipment as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>This technique allows long-term measurements in preterm infants because the face mask and flow sensor are continuously and thoroughly rinsed by a constant background flow which virtually eliminates dead space in the apparatus.</s><s>The flow-through technique also allows continuous monitoring of mask leaks.</s><s>After these initial measurements, respiratory lung mechanics (respiratory compliance [C rs ] and respiratory resistance [R rs ]) were measured by the occlusion technique using a balloon shutter.</s><s>These measurements were performed using the MasterScreen™ BabyBody Plethysmograph (CareFusion, Höchberg, Germany), which also provides measurements of respiratory mechanics, whole-body plethysmography, and forced expiratory flow.</s><s>Airway resistance (R aw ) and functional residual capacity (FRC pleth ) were also measured using the constant-volume baby body plethysmograph.</s><s>The maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (V'max FRC ) was measured using the rapid thoraco-abdominal compression technique with the same equipment according to international guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Finally a multiple breath washout (MBW) technique was performed, with 4% sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as a tracer gas, using the EXHALYZER D (EcoMedics AG, Duernten, Switzerland) to determine the lung volume involved in gas exchange (FRC SF6 ) and the lung clearance index (LCI) as a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity.</s><s>Use of the same equipment in combination with the fast chemiluminescence NO-analyzer CLD 88 (EcoMedics AG, Duernten, Switzerland) allowed measurement of exhaled nitric oxide concentration (FeNO) and NO production (V'NO).</s></p><p><s>All flow and volume values were related to the body weight on the day of measurement to reduce the intersubject variability.</s><s>V'max FRC was also expressed in standard deviation scores (Z-scores) that were based on sex, corrected age, and height-specific reference values of healthy infants published by Hoo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and adjusted for the MasterScreen™ BabyBody by Lum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An arterialized capillary blood gas sample was taken at the end of LFT and analyzed using an ABL800 FLEX (Radiometer, Denmark).</s><s>Heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored continuously by a pulse oximeter (N-200; Nellcor, Hayward, California, USA) during the LFT.</s><s>Complete data were obtained from almost all of the 114 infants regarding patient characteristics, occlusion test results, whole-body plethysmography, and blood gas analysis.</s><s>The equipment for tidal breathing measurements was not available in 7 (6%) cases due to unplanned maintenance work.</s><s>The rapid thoraco-abdominal compression technique for measurement of V'maxFRC (N = 95) and the SF 6 MBW for measurement of FRC SF6 and LCI (N = 76) were added later in our lung function laboratory.</s><s>The last added device (smallest number of measurements) was the Analyzer CLD 88 for measurement of FeNO (N = 45).</s></p></div>

the only difference was a reduced V T relative to body weight in the PDA ligation group.</s><s>There were no significant differences in PTEF and respiratory rate, probably due to the high inter-subject variability of tidal breathing at this age <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> Also, the two groups had no significant differences in lung volume relative to body weight, lung clearance index, or in an inflammatory marker (exhaled FeNO).</s></p><p><s>In general, data on LFT in infants after PDA treatment, especially after ligation, is sparse.</s><s>Only a few studies assessed the short-term effects of PDA ligation on pulmonary function in ventilated patients, and the results were contradictory.</s><s>Two early case series from the late 1970s showed increased pulmonary compliance after surgical PDA closure in ventilated preterm infants <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, and a more recent prospective study of 16 ventilated VLBW infants demonstrated improvements of dynamic compliance (C dyn ), V T , and V' E after PDA ligation, although R aw , mean airway pressure, and peak inspiratory pressure remained unchanged <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, McCurnin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> investigated the effect of PDA ligation in a premature baboon model and found no significant differences in C dyn , oxygenation index, or ventilation index (VI), but a trend towards higher Cdyn and lower VI in ligated animals.</s><s>The post mortem static lung compliance was similar in both groups of baboons.</s><s>Another study by the same group confirmed the modest effects of ligation on lung function parameters, but reported no improvement in alveolar surface area <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our data shows that, compared to infants after successful pharmacological PDA treatment, patients after PDA ligation exhibited an increase in upper airway resistance and a decreased respiratory compliance at a postconceptional age of 48 weeks.</s><s>The increased upper airway resistance seems to be associated with PDA surgery itself.</s><s>In contrast, all the other impairments in pulmonary mechanics observed in ligated infants were due to the patient characteristics, and, despite all the heterogeneity between groups, several LFT parameters showed no significant differences.</s><s>The differences in the LFT parameters were also reflected by blood gas analysis.</s><s>We used arterialized capillary rather than arterial blood gas analysis because it is less invasive, easier to perform, and shows a good correlation with arterial blood gas analysis for most parameters.</s></p><p><s>There is an ongoing controversy regarding the indications and protocols for treatment of PDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>Herein, we provide data that might support an adverse association between some LFT parameters and PDA ligation.</s><s>It is nonetheless unclear if this is a causal relationship or just an epiphenomenon due to the more severe illness of infants who required surgery.</s><s>A recent study by Schena et al. found a higher incidence of BPD in infants after PDA ligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, but their multivariate analysis showed that a longer duration of hsPDAnot surgery itselfwas an independent risk factor for BPD.</s></p><p><s>In addition, there are contradictory results on the effects of pharmacological PDA treatment on BPD rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, hsPDA and its treatment influences parameters that affect pulmonary outcome, but cannot be assessed by LFT, such as the pulmonary vasculature.</s></p><p><s>Prospective trials that include a non-treatment arm are needed to address these issues.</s></p></div>
