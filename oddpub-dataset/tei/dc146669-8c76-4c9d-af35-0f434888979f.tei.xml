<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analytical phase.</head><p><s>Of the four swab types to be compared, swab 4 (a calcium alginate tipped swab) had to be excluded because the stabilizing gel interfered with cell lysis and thus caused DNA extraction problems.</s><s>The following data were therefore obtained with swab types 1, 2 and 3.</s></p><p><s>Comparison of anterior nasal vs. oropharyngeal microbial communities.</s><s>The microbial community structure analysis of the two tested ecological niches, the human oropharynx and the human anterior nares, revealed the presence of 846 phylotypes (PT) (see supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), 46 of which were exclusively found in oropharyngeal communities and 164 exclusively in nasal communities (see supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>The communities of these two habitats differed drastically, forming two separate clusters in the non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) plot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>The oropharyngeal communities tended to cluster more tightly together than the nasal communities; in agreement with, multivariate dispersion analysis showed that the index of dispersion was higher for anterior nasal communities (1.09) than for oropharyngeal communities (0.73).</s><s>This is in accordance with the higher average similarity between all pairs of oropharyngeal communities of 34.8%, compared to only 26.5% between all pairs of anterior nasal communities.</s></p><p><s>The anterior nasal communities were dominated by Actinobacteria (mean abundance of 45% in a total of 195 samples analyzed), Firmicutes (40%) and Proteobacteria (12%), along with minor amounts of Bacteroidetes (2%).</s><s>Consistent with a previous report by Camarinha-Silva et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , the most abundant species were Corynebacterium accolens/segmentosum (PT1, 17%), Propionibacterium acnes (PT2, 12%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (PT3, 10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (PT5, 8%), which sum up to an average abundance of 47%.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, the oropharyngeal communities were not dominated by just a few species: the most abundant phylotypes (PT15, Leptotrichia sp.; PT12, Fusobacterium periodonticum; PT16, Streptococcus salivarius/vestibularis; PT19, Veillonella atypical; PT20, Prevotella melaninogenica; and PT21, Prevotella histicola) were observed at an average abundance of only 3.3-5.1%.</s><s>Members of five phyla were abundant in the oropharyngeal communities (38% Firmicutes, 22% Bacteroidetes, 18% Fusobacteria, 11% Actinobacteria and 10% Proteobacteria).</s><s>Thus, the overall microbial community observed here resembles that reported previously for oropharyngeal swabs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Notably, the oropharyngeal communities were richer in species (average number of phylotypes per sample: 201 ± 41) than the anterior nasal communities (87 ± 37 phylotypes per sample).</s><s>They also showed higher species diversity using both Shannon and Simpson Diversity Indices (H′ = 3.86 ± 0.33 for oropharyngeal vs. 2.17 ± 0.60 for nasal communities and 1-D = 0.96 ± 0.02 for oropharyngeal vs. 0.76 ± 0.14 for nasal communities) but higher species evenness (J′ = 0.73 ± 0.04 for oropharyngeal vs. 0.49 ± 0.11 for nasal communities).</s></p><p><s>Comparison of swab types 1, 2 and 3.</s><s>The analysis of diversity indices did not suggest any differences in microbial communities when sampling had been performed by each of the three swab types included in this analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>For instance, Simpson's Diversity Index of oropharyngeal communities was close to 1 for all three swab types; nasal communities had significantly lower diversity indices but, again, there were no differences across swab types.</s><s>Similarly, Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) and Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variation (PERMANOVA) gave no evidence for overall differences in the communities detected by the different swab types (ANOSIM: global R = 0.001 for nasal and 0.015 for oropharyngal communities while PERMANOVA: Pseudo-F = 1.4522, p = 0.131 for nasal and Pseudo-F = 1.4383, p = 0.129 for oropharyngal communities).</s></p><p><s>The abundances of genera detected with each of the three swab types were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test on standardized abundance data of 148 anterior nares and 110 oropharyngeal samples obtained from 258 participants.</s><s>In anterior nares, out of the 95 detected genera only Methylobacterium spp.</s><s>differed in abundance across swab types in that it was more frequently detected with swab 2 (p = 0.0077, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>In oropharynx all genera were detected with equal frequency by all three swab types.</s></p><p><s>Comparison of staff-collection vs. self-collection at home of anterior nasal swabs.</s><s>We then tested whether, for the purpose of microbiome determination, nasal self-swabbing at home is as suitable as swabbing by the certified personnel in the study centers.</s><s>The communities of 54 nasal swabs self-collected by the participants at home were compared to 54 age and sex matched staff-collected swabs taken at the study centers.</s><s>As observed above in the comparison of the three swab types, there were no differences in the overall communities (ANOSIM: global R = 0.019, PERMANOVA: Pseudo-F = 1.909,</s><s>P = 0.061) nor were there any differences in diversity indices between the self-collected and the staff-collected swabs.</s><s>Only members of the genus Lactobacillus were distributed differentially (p = 0.0222;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This is the first study that formally examined acceptance and feasibility of nasal and oropharyngeal swabbing in a multicenter population-based epidemiological study, and coupled this with detailed characterizations of microbial communities in these two ecological niches of great importance to human health.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feasibility of integrating anterior nasal microbiome analyses into population-based studies.</head><p><s>As expected, acceptance of nasal swabbing by both study personnel and study participants was very high in all study centers, and the short time required for swab collection and processing is well within the range that can be easily integrated into large human studies.</s><s>Of note, our results also clearly show the equivalence of staff-collected and self-collected nasal swabs.</s><s>In particular, the data demonstrate the robustness of microbiome determinations from nasal swabs to differences in temperature after collection when RNAlater is used as a preservative: whereas the staff-collected swabs were frozen shortly after collection, the self-collected swabs were not frozen until receipt in the study center (usually 1 or 2 days after collection).</s><s>The observed high feasibility of nasal self-swabbing at home agrees well with previous results obtained in somewhat different settings, where self-collection of nasal swabs was found to be feasible for capturing viral pathogens causing acute respiratory infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and for the serial determination of S. aureus colonization in a population-based setting 2 .</s><s>Self-swabbing is a highly cost-effective method, particularly when serial swabs are to be collected, which would normally require multiple visits to the study center.</s><s>Our data indicate that it can be used as an alternative to staff-collection in population-based studies featuring NGS-based analyses of anterior nasal microbiomes (next-generation sequencing).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Particular aspects of oropharyngeal swabbing.</head><p><s>There is a common opinion that oropharyngeal swabbing might have negative effects on acceptance and compliance in prospective population-based studies due to the difficulties of the swabbing procedure in this anatomical location, and that this may result in poor response rates and/or high attrition rates.</s><s>The observed high acceptance of oropharyngeal swabbing by the participants and their stated willingness to participate in future studies featuring oropharyngeal swabbing suggest that this may not be the case, at least if swabbing is performed by trained personnel (as was the case in our study).</s><s>Nonetheless, despite the training provided to the study personnel before study start, completeness of oropharyngeal swabbing (as measured by the fraction of the anatomical structures swabbed successfully) varied among the study centers, and the degree of participants' discomfort was clearly higher than in the case of nasal swabbing.</s><s>Thus, particular attention should be paid to training study personnel in technique that aims to maximize completeness of swabbing of oropharyngeal structures, while minimizing discomfort.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microbiological validation.</head><p><s>The microbial community structure analyses largely agree with previous studies of anterior nasal and oropharyngeal microbiomes, thus underscoring the microbiological validity of our approach.</s><s>Of note, despite the difficulties encountered with oropharyngeal swabbing discussed above, representative The number of swabs analyzed were 54 (swab 1), 52 (swab 2) and 44 (swab 3) nasal swabs and 39 (swab 1), 34 (swab 2) and 37 (swab 3) oropharyngeal swabs.</s><s>There was no statistically significant difference in the diversity observed in communities obtained with the different swabs, whereas communities taken from the nares or the oropharynx were significantly different (p &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>microbial communities were detected with nearly all oropharyngeal swabs, underscoring the analytical robustness of this method.</s><s>The swab comparison showed that all three swab types included in the laboratory analyses are suited equally well for determination of nasal and oropharyngeal microbiomes in population-based settings.</s><s>This is particularly important because the choice of swab may vary among future studies in other locations; our data suggest that comparability of data should be good if one of these three swab types is used.</s></p><p><s>Limitation of the study.</s><s>Due to the design of the Pretest 1 studies across all study centers, it was not possible to apply culture-dependent microbiological methods at the time of swabbing, and we therefore do not have data from this classical approach about the presence of lead organisms such as Streptococcus spp.</s><s>and Staphylococcus spp. in parallel with the NGS-based microbiome data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions.</head><p><s>Nasal and oropharyngeal swabbing turned out to be highly accepted and feasible methods to collect NGS-based data on bacterial microbiomes in these two ecological niches in population-based studies.</s><s>They can thus be used in larger-scale population-based studies on nasal and oropharyngeal microbiomes and their effects on health and disease of the host.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nasal and oropharyngeal swabbing.</head><p><s>Training of study personnel.</s><s>The local study teams consisted of 2-4 individuals (both physicians and study nurses) and were trained and certified on site by the coordinator of the presented study, who is a licensed physician and has extensive personal experience in obtaining nasal and pharyngeal swabs according to internationally accepted Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).</s><s>Training sessions consisted of three parts: (a) a Powerpoint presentation (reviewing the aims of the study, relevant anatomy, sampling technique and sample preservation), (b) demonstration and hands-on training, and (c) certification (each trainee had to demonstrate three correctly executed swabs).</s></p><p><s>Swabbing procedure.</s><s>In the study center, the certified personnel explained the study aims to the participant and then collected from him/her one anterior nasal swab from each nostril and one oropharyngeal swab.</s><s>For nasal swabbing, the swab was inserted into the nostril to a depth of 1-1.5 cm and rotated three times on the nasal lining under constant pressure.</s><s>This procedure was repeated for the other nostril.</s><s>Both swabs were then placed into one 1.5 ml storage tube (Micro tube, Sarstedt, no.</s><s>72.694.005)</s><s>containing 1 ml RNAlater ® Stabilization Reagent (QIAGEN, Austin, Texas, USA).</s><s>Furthermore, the study personnel swiped the oropharyngeal swab over the tonsils (or "tonsillar areas" if tonsils were atrophied or had been removed) and pharyngopalatine arches bilaterally.</s><s>The fraction of these anatomical structures that was swabbed successfully was recorded in the biosample protocol and was used as a proxy for completeness of the pharyngeal swabbing procedure.</s><s>After completing the swabbing procedure, the swab tip was clipped off and placed in a 1.5 ml storage tube containing 1 ml RNAlater ® .</s><s>After collection, the swabs were placed on dry ice and transferred to −80 °C storage by the end of the day.</s></p><p><s>Lastly, in three study centers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), the participants were instructed how to self-collect nasal swabs.</s><s>Four weeks later, a swabbing kit containing two nasal swabs, a transport tube containing 2 ml RNAlater, a small bottle containing 2 ml NaCl, a questionnaire, instructions how to self-collect a nasal swab, and gloves were sent to the participants.</s><s>They were asked to self-collect one nasal swab from each nostril, complete a questionnaire and mail everything to the laboratory within 24 h.</s><s>The swabbing procedure at home was described in a manner similar to that in the study center.</s><s>In brief, the nasal swab was to be inserted into the nostril to a depth of approx.</s><s>1.5 cm, rotated three times on the nasal lining under constant pressure and placed into RNAlater.</s><s>The participants were instructed to keep the swabs in the refrigerator overnight if they were collected the day before shipping.</s><s>The swabs were shipped at ambient temperature and placed at −80 °C upon arrival in the study center.</s></p><p><s>Swab types.</s><s>The following four swab types were compared: swab 1-flocked nylon swab (Nr.</s><s>502CS01, Hain Lifescience), swab 2-rayon swab (Nr.</s><s>30MW112, Check Diagnostics GmbH), swab 3-polyurethane tipped swab (Nr.</s><s>30MW940/125, Check Diagnostics GmbH), and swab 4-calcium alginate tipped swab (Nr.</s><s>25-806 1 Pa, Check Diagnostics GmbH).</s><s>The study participants were randomized by block randomization to one of the four swab types.</s><s>In a given participant, the same swab type was used for nasal and oropharyngeal swabbing and for nasal self-swabbing.</s></p><p><s>Acceptance.</s><s>After completing the swabbing procedure, the participants were asked to fill in separate acceptance questionnaires for nasal and oropharyngeal swabbing at the study center and nasal self-swabbing at home.</s><s>Acceptance was assessed with questions on a five-point Likert scale.</s><s>Participants rated each item with 1 (strong disagreement), 2 (disagreement), 3 (neither agreement nor disagreement), 4 (agreement), or 5 (strong agreement).</s><s>Some of the items were reverse-phrased to reduce response bias.</s></p></div>
