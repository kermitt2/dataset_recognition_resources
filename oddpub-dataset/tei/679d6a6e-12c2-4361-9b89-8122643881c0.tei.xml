radiotherapeutic agents to GBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(58)</ref>.</s><s>While the classic ligand for TLR4, LPS, triggers the release of several proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-a, we thus assume that the ligand released from glioma CD133 þ cells triggers a selective release of IL-6.</s><s>It is possible that other factors such as epigenetic regulations like miRNA deregulation, histone modification, or DNA methylation specifically suppress the transcription of other proinflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(59)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, it was shown that an miR-142-3p-driven autocrine and paracrine positive loop epigenetically regulates the progression and cancer stem-like property of glioblastoma by targeting the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref>.</s><s>The exact mechanism of how tumor cells educate bulk cells to serve in favor of tumor growth and invasiveness remains to be elucidated.</s><s>At this point we like to stress that, due to the global deletion of IL-6 in our mouse model, we cannot exclude primary or secondary effects of IL-6 on tumor growth apart from the microglia/ macrophage population.</s><s>However, our in vitro data strongly support the importance of the CD133-TLR4-IL6 pathway.</s></p><p><s>Zhang et al describe another mode of interaction between glioma and microglia mediated by IL-6 independent of TLR4.</s><s>They used human glioma lines and nontransformed human microglia isolated from surgically resected epileptic brain tissue and described that gliomas release the chemokine CCL2.</s><s>Overexpression of CCL2 in the U87 glioma line stimulated microglia to release IL-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results are in line with a study where it was demonstrated that interfering with IL-6 signaling in GSCs led to reduced growth and neurosphere formation capacity and to an increase in the apoptosis rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>.</s><s>From a clinical perspective, the expression of IL-6 and its receptors in the human glioma tissues is inversely correlated to patient survival.</s><s>The median survival times were 16 months in patients with negative IL-6 expression and 7 months in those with positive IL-6 expression ( <ref type="formula">61</ref>).</s><s>An IL-6 neutralizing antibody attenuated microglia-stimulated glioma invasiveness and reduced glioma growth in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30)</ref>.</s><s>Our data further corroborate the important role of microglial IL-6 in glioma growth.</s><s>Specifically, we propose that TLR4 signaling is an important component of GSC-microglia crosstalk and propose tenascin-C released by glioma CD133 þ cells as a regulator of this pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
