<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study aimed to further explore a potential influence of genetic variants on the risk of developing toxic maculopathy after prolonged CQ treatment.</s><s>First, we evaluated a possible association of known AMD-associated variants on disease risk but found no statistically significant evidence for this hypothesis.</s><s>However, our analysis can not exclude that other as yet unknown AMDassociated variants may play a role in the etiology of toxic maculopathy or that our patient cohort may lack statistical power to detect significant differences with minor effects.</s></p><p><s>We then assessed the ABCA4 gene and identified genetic variants significantly associated with CQ-induced maculopathy.</s><s>This association is mainly driven by three common variants (c.5682G &gt; C, c.5814A &gt; G and c.5844A &gt; G), whose minor alleles confer increased protection from the toxic maculopathy.</s><s>While the study provides robust and significant association data, the sample size of 37 patients is relatively small in principle due to the rarity of toxic maculopathy but also to the fact that nowadays CQ is less frequently used for therapeutic purposes than HCQ which possible shows reduced side effects with regard to treatment-induced pathology.</s><s>Even more challenging is the recruitment of control subjects who received CQ but never developed maculopathy under this treatment.</s><s>Considering the limited number of available cases and controls in this study, it is obvious that our statistical evaluation had to be limited to common variants while rare variant analysis would have lacked sufficient statistical power.</s><s>In fact, our study design would theoretically require at least 200 cases and controls to obtain a moderate power of 21% to detect a significant association with a set of rare variants (P SKAT &lt; 0.05 with a minor allele frequency below 0.03).</s></p><p><s>A comparison to Shroyer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, a study which included a total of only 8 patients suffering from toxic maculopathy upon CQ treatment, showed a deleterious effect of ABCA4 variants on disease risk and appears to suggest a contradiction to our findings.</s><s>In this report, however, patient #7 carried three pathologic mutations known to be associated with Stargardt disease (Arg2107His and Leu1201Arg/Arg2107His in a cis configuration).</s><s>As a consequence, this patient may rather be appreciated as manifesting Stargardt disease than toxic CQ-associated maculopathy.</s><s>Considering the remaining 7 CQ-related maculopathy patients, the frequencies of the minor (in our study protective) ABCA4 variants are 0.29, 0.14 and 0.14 for c.5682G &gt; C, c.5814A &gt; G and c.5844A &gt; G, respectively.</s><s>These frequencies are higher than those in our data set in the CQ-associated maculopathy cases but clearly lower than our controls and thus reveal a similar orientation of effect for these three polymorphic alleles.</s></p><p><s>The odds ratios per ABCA4 risk allele indicate a strong risk reduction of risk-altering allele carriers towards toxic maculopathy.</s><s>Two variants in ABCA4 (c.5814A &gt; G and c.5844A &gt; G) are in close proximity to each other demonstrating strong linkage disequilibrium.</s><s>It is therefore likely that the two variants represent a common associated (protective) haplotype.</s><s>A larger patient sample size will be needed to statistically determine the true toxic maculopathy-associated variant, c.5814A &gt; G or c.5844A &gt; G.</s><s>It should be emphasized that the range of risk reduction of the toxic maculopathyassociated ABCA4 variants is well comparable to odds ratios of non-risk alleles at the CFH or ARMS2/HTRA1 loci, two genomic regions which are considered to be strongly associated with large effect sizes with the development of AMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although synonymous variants are commonly regarded as benign in their effects towards disease, they have the potential to affect RNA stability and RNA splicing and can influence the rate of protein translation and thus protein conformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Associations of synonymous variants with complex phenotypes are not unusual and this could call for a paradigm shift when considering the functional impact of these variants on disease and complex traits.</s><s>Alternatively, other so far unknown variants in linkage disequilibrium with the identified synonymous variants may influence disease risk by altering splicing or by influencing transcription levels due to reduced transcription factor (enhancer) binding.</s><s>Ultimately, to determine the functional variants at the ABCA4 locus which could be responsible for a protective effect on toxic maculopathy, more in-depth studies in cellular or animal model systems will be required.</s></p><p><s>Since our study lacks sample size to reliably evaluate risk scores and project absolute risk estimates, we cannot at present evaluate the combined effect of these genetic variants with or without other risk factors like age or duration of treatment.</s><s>However, it is expected that these factors together with genetic data will result in an excellent risk prediction accuracy and therefore be deemed important to be evaluated in a larger study despite the given constraints on patient recruitment as discussed above.</s><s>For instance, the National Eye Institute (NEI) is currently recruiting patients for a clinical trial (NCT01145196) to assess the impact of ABCA4 mutations on toxic maculopathy risk.</s></p><p><s>Should this knowledge of protective genetic variants have an influence on clinical practice?</s><s>The ABCA4-analysis in any patient who is about to receive CQ would generally be desirable.</s><s>As this analysis is not covered by the health insurance the patient himself has to bear the financial burden.</s><s>Therefore, if recommended, it should most likely be done primarily in CQ patients with a non-genetic high-risk profile, i.e. in older patients with a high dose per body weight, high body mass index, restriction of excretory liver and renal function or in patients whose eyesight is reduced due to other reasons.</s><s>If the combined genetic and non-genetic profile indicates a high risk, another disease-modifying drug might be preferred.</s><s>In principle, phenotypes and non-genetic risk factors of CQ and HCQ maculopathy are similar.</s><s>Therefore, the results of the present study may be projected onto HCQ maculopathy.</s><s>A recent study found an overall prevalence of 7.5% for HCQ-induced maculopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, which further emphasizes the medical need to treat patients based on an individual risk profil for possible side effects.</s><s>Further and larger sized studies will be needed to replicate the current findings, specifically in patients treated with HCQ, a drug nowadays replacing CQ.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Taken together, our findings demonstrate that minor alleles of common genetic variants in ABCA4 significantly reduce susceptibility to develop toxic maculopathy under CQ treatment.</s><s>A refined risk profile based on genetic and environmental factors may have implications for revised recommendations in CQ as well as HCQ treatment.</s><s>As our approach was targeted to include candidate genes upon a sophisticated guess as to their possible relation with the disease, it would be desirable to extend the genetic analyses to a genome-wide unbiased screening approach.</s><s>This would allow to decipher the full genetic spectrum of CQ-and hopefully HCQ-induced maculopathy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Summary characteristics of CQ-treated patients</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Cases*</cell><cell>Controls  †</cell><cell>p-value (two-sided t-test)</cell></row></table><note><p><s>*Patients treated with CQ and affected with toxic maculopathy.</s><s>† Patients treated with CQ and no signs of toxic maculopathy.</s></p></note></figure>
