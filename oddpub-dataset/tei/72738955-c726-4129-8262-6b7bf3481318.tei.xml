it is indicated as an additional therapeutic measure for patients with high disease activity studies, it will be highly relevant for the management of SLE patients, especially for those who do not cope well with the side effects of corticosteroids and/or who could not achieve a dose within an acceptable range before.</s><s>In contrast to the corticosteroid intake, the use of other concomitant medications was not reduced in this study.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the extent of utilization of healthcare resources was evaluated for the study population.</s><s>As an innovative antibody therapy, belimumab treatment is more costly than other SLE medications.</s><s>However, its benefits appear to impact other healthcare resources in routine clinical care.</s><s>In the OBSErve Germany study, the patients required fewer SLE-related emergency room visits and fewer SLE-related hospitalizations in the 6 months of belimumab therapy than in the 6 months before.</s><s>The number of scheduled visits of patients at their physician's practice increased on average, as expected during the course of belimumab, which requires administration as monthly infusions.</s><s>The number of unscheduled visits, on the other hand, was reduced.</s><s>Overall, it appears that belimumab-treated patients have fewer SLE-related emergencies and that their SLE activity management is improved within the first 6 months of the treatment.</s></p><p><s>OBSErve Germany was a non-interventional study.</s><s>Such investigations have certain inherent strengths (e.g., the real-world perspective, potentially large patient populations, longer investigation periods) as well as limitations (e.g., no stringent evaluation of efficacy, no source data verification, possible issues with availability and comparability of diagnostic data, limited control of confounding effects) in comparison to clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>As discussed above, the real-world setting provided insights into how belimumab is used in routine care, when no protocol or monitoring is required.</s><s>Interference with the physicians' procedures was impossible because of the retrospective data collection.</s><s>The data provided by the physicians were checked for plausibility but not verified in the source documents.</s><s>No control group was set up.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, no direct conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of belimumab can be drawn.</s><s>Nevertheless, the results of the OBSErve Germany study do indicate good effectiveness and the low number of discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) indicates good tolerability, in line with the clinical trials where efficacy and safety were confirmed previously.</s></p><p><s>OBSErve Germany was designed with a different focus; complementary to the pivotal studies it is important to understand the practicalities of belimumab treatment, outcomes, and discontinuations under real-world conditions to determine the clinical value of this new therapy and its potential impact on SLE management <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>A detailed profile of those patients that respond particularly well to belimumab treatment can shape future treatment guidelines and help physicians identify the right treatment for a patient.</s><s>SLE is a disease where many patients rely on a combination of two or three medications to manage disease activity.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, the effect of belimumab on the concomitant SLE medication may be of interest in further investigations covering a longer time period.</s><s>Compared to the patient population in the BLISS studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, the patients documented in the OBSErve Germany study had a higher mean disease activity.</s><s>The observations described here are highly consistent with a subgroup analysis of the BLISS patients which shows that patients with higher disease activity are the ones responding best to belimumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>On the basis of these results, further SLE subgroups may be of interest for assessing the risks and benefits of belimumab treatment.</s><s>For example, a large clinical trial is currently ongoing to investigate belimumab treatment outcomes specifically for adult patients with active lupus nephritis.</s><s>As a result of the retrospective and observational nature of the OBSErve study, safety data were not collected in detail.</s><s>However, the data on discontinuations may provide some insight into safety aspects.</s><s>Six of the 102 study patients discontinued belimumab treatment within 6 months.</s><s>For three of these patients, their physicians documented ''disease progression'' and ''ineffective medication'' as the reasons for withdrawing belimumab.</s><s>In these patients, treatment was discontinued after 16, 35, and 68 days, respectively, i.e., within the first 10 weeks.</s><s>This is a point in time where the full clinical effect of belimumab cannot yet be expected.</s><s>As s result of its mode of action and supported by the clinical study results, a minimum treatment period of 6 months is recommended in the summary of product characteristics for belimumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, to allow full efficacy to develop before a decision regarding further therapy is made.</s><s>In the three patients described here, the constellation of their course of disease and their concomitant corticosteroid doses at least leaves some questions open, one of them being whether more patience regarding the development of the therapeutic effects could have led to different treatment results.</s><s>Two of the patients discontinued because of an adverse event, one of which was an allergic reaction.</s><s>This is consistent with the summary of product characteristic for belimumab, which describes that 1% of belimumab study patients are withdrawn from the treatment because of an allergic reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>For the one patient who died, no causal relationship to belimumab was suspected.</s></p><p><s>These results are consistent with the conclusion from the clinical trials that belimumab is generally well tolerated although this study did not collect safety data besides those leading to withdrawal <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>As with other immunomodulatory drugs or antibody therapies, patient monitoring remains important, however, especially during and after the first exposures.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the effectiveness of belimumab seen in the OBSErve Germany study exceeded the expectations from the pivotal trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> with regards to the extent of clinical improvement and to its onset.</s><s>Whether this is a real effect or a methodological bias due to the high hurdles to achieve the primary endpoints in clinical studies needs to be evaluated further.</s><s>Very similar results have been presented for patients in Spain and in the USA (OBSErve Spain, published in an abstract <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>; OBSErve US <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>).</s><s>Other, smaller-scale studies assessing the effectiveness of belimumab in a real-world setting have also confirmed belimumab as an option for patients not sufficiently controlled by conventional therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Physicians' evaluation of clinical response of their systemic lupus erythematosus patients (N = 96) after 6 months of belimumab therapy, compared to status at start of belimumab treatment</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
