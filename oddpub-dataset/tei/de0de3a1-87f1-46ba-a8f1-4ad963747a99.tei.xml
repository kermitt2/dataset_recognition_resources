in Europe for patients who have clinically active inflammatory bowel disease, previous intolerance to oral iron, severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL), and/or a need for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>owever, intravenous administration of iron is associated with a small but significant risk of anaphylactic reactions, such that specific safety

clinically meaningful increases (+2 g/dL) and/or achievement of normal haemoglobin by study end. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>Crucially, ferric maltol was associated with a low incidence of treatmentrelated gastrointestinal adverse events that was similar to placebo, irrespective of disease aetiology.</s><s>Furthermore, ferric maltol had no impact on inflammatory bowel

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This long-term study demonstrated that, after significant improvements in haemoglobin during the initial 12 weeks of randomised ferric maltol treatment, continued treatment with this novel oral iron therapy maintained or further improved haemoglobin up to 64 weeks without substantial numbers of adverse events.</s><s>It was not possible to demonstrate a significant increase in haemoglobin between Weeks 12 and 52 as the study was not powered to show a further increase during open-label treatment.</s><s>Nevertheless, it is important to note that increases in haemoglobin during the initial 12 weeks of active treatment in patients switched from 12-week placebo to ferric maltol treatment paralleled those seen over Weeks 1-12 in patients who received ferric maltol from baseline to Week 64.</s><s>In addition, it is notable that no patients in this longterm study discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy.</s></p><p><s>Overall, approximately one-third of patients achieved normal haemoglobin by Week 4, and this proportion increased to three-quarters by Week 12.

indicating that premature discontinuation of ferric maltol treatment should be considered carefully in order to avoid recurrence of iron deficiency.</s><s>It is also important to highlight that replenishment of iron stores can vary considerably from patient to patient, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> as exemplified in this study.</s><s>Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have several risk factors for iron deficiency anaemia, including gastrointestinal bleeding and inadequate dietary iron intake and/or absorption, which can result in recurrence of iron deficiency anaemia even when the disease appears to be under control. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>For this reason it has been noted that in inflammatory bowel disease patients with iron deficiency anaemia treated with oral iron preparations, oral iron therapy should be continued for ≥3 months after iron deficiency has been corrected so that stores are adequately replenished. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31</ref></s><s>Among inflammatory bowel disease patients treated with intravenous therapy, iron deficiency and anaemia can also recur frequently and rapidly after treatment, and has been reported in up to 50% of patients within 10 months of infusion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32</ref> </s><s>he speed of iron deficiency anaemia recurrence in such cases has been shown to relate to the magnitude of post-treatment iron stores, with iron deficiency being less likely in patients with higher post-treatment ferritin levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> </s><s>atients treated with intravenous iron preparations therefore require regular monitoring (e.g., every 3 months), and may require repeated intravenous infusions over a prolonged period. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref> M</s><s>y inflammatory bowel disease patients demonstrate poor gastrointestinal tolerability to oral ferrous compounds (e.g., ferrous sulphate). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> </s><s>he most important finding in the current study was that the safety and tolerability profile of ferric maltol during extension treatment (Weeks 12-64) was similar to that seen during initial randomised treatment (Weeks 0-12). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>The incidence and type of gastrointestinal adverse events among ferric maltol-treated patients in the cumulative long-term safety set in this study (57%) were similar to those observed in the placebo group (40%) during the 12-week randomised trial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>No treatment-related serious adverse events were recorded during 12-week randomised ferric maltol treatment, and only one serious adverse event (abdominal pain) was considered possibly related to study treatment throughout 52 weeks of extension treatment.</s><s>It is also notable that while several patients had mild-to-moderate inflammatory bowel disease at baseline, worsening of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease was recorded as an adverse event in &lt;10% of patients overall, and only one patient was withdrawn due to exacerbation of existing ulcerative colitis (SCCAI score ≥5) based on physician judgement.</s></p><p><s>36]<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref> Similarly, there are few previous studies that allow comparison of the current long-term ferric maltol data with other oral iron compounds.</s></p><p><s>A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials reported increased gastrointestinal side-effects with ferrous sulphate in adults, regardless of either patient population or specific formulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">38</ref></s><s>he duration of all except two of the identified trials in inflammatory bowel disease was 6-12 weeks.</s><s>In a 20week randomised trial comparing oral ferrous sulphate with intravenous iron sucrose in 91 patients with anaemia (haemoglobin &lt;11.5 g/dL), <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">39</ref> only 22 patients (48%) tolerated the prescribed oral ferrous sulphate dose, and 52% reduced the dose or discontinued ferrous sulphate because of poor tolerability.</s><s>Consequently, haemoglobin increased by ≥2 g/dL in only 47% of patients on oral iron, compared with 66% of patients given intravenous iron sucrose. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">39</ref></s><s>In a 6-month open-label trial that also compared oral ferrous sulphate with intravenous iron sucrose, this time in 100 patients with iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin &gt;10 g/dL), <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">40</ref> only 4/78 (5%) patients who received ferrous sulphate discontinued treatment due to 'medication intolerance'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">40</ref></s><s>Extrapolation of findings from this latter study to match the duration of the current study gives an estimated 1-year discontinuation rate of approximately 10%, which is surprisingly low given the well-known poor tolerability of oral ferrous iron. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">38</ref></s><s>Nevertheless, the current data still compare favourably with this previous report, with only 7.2% of patients discontinuing due to treatment-related adverse events up to Week 64.</s></p><p><s>In considering the safety and tolerability data from the current study, it is important to bear in mind that the current study population was sensitive to the adverse effects of oral iron therapy as it only included patients with a documented history of treatment failure with oral ferrous products.</s><s>Reasons for previous failure of oral ferrous iron treatment (recorded at screening) included poor gastrointestinal tolerability in approximately twothirds of patients and lack of efficacy in approximately one-third.</s><s>The data on discontinuations due to treatment-related gastrointestinal adverse events are therefore open to a degree of positive historical bias, with patients more likely to discontinue than would otherwise be observed with ferric maltol in a standard inflammatory bowel disease population including treatment-na€ ıve patients and those who are able to tolerate oral ferrous iron.</s></p><p><s>It is likely that, overall, the patient population of this study was too mildly affected by iron deficiency anaemia to show discernible improvements in disease-specific or general patient QoL, even over the long-term, based on the quality-of-life parameters employed (IBDQ and SF-36, respectively).</s><s>Nevertheless, the quality-of-life data indicate that long-term treatment with ferric maltol did not have any detrimental impact on QoL.</s><s>This finding is considered at least in part attributable to the favourable safety and tolerability profile of ferric maltol.</s><s>In addition, the fact that no patients in this study discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy indicates potential benefits for prolonged ferric maltol maintenance treatment.</s><s>However, it should be borne in mind that other relevant factors, such as iron storage indices, vary a great deal from patient to patient.</s><s>Follow-up assessments with appropriate testing should therefore be scheduled during longterm therapy in order to ensure maintained iron balance.</s></p><p><s>The limitations of our study are as follows.</s><s>The lack of an active oral comparator arm, which is due to (i) the placebo-controlled design of the initial randomised trial and (ii) the fact that the initial randomised trial was the first trial reported to date that included only patients in whom oral ferrous products had previously failed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> precludes direct comparison of ferric maltol with other iron formulations.</s><s>Furthermore, the open-label nature of this extension study confers a number of inherent difficulties in terms of avoiding patient selection bias and limiting analyses to purely descriptive data assessments.</s><s>In addition, the study design did not allow an assessment of the possibility of whether the absence of a sustained deficit of iron balance might have influenced the haemoglobin results: future subgroup analyses may help to address this.</s><s>While the initial randomised trial was adequately powered to discern statistically significant differences between ferric maltol and placebo, this long-term openlabel analysis was not powered to demonstrate additional statistically significant improvement of iron deficiency anaemia parameters, and no comparable untreated cohort data are available.</s><s>Based on the absence of an untreated cohort, maintained levels of haemoglobin could be associated either with sustained efficacy of ferric maltol or to the absence of sustained deficit of iron balance.</s><s>Finally, while no evidence of significant worsening of (subclinical) mucosal inflammation was observed, the size of this study population did not enable us to rule out the possibility of such effects.</s><s>Similarly, the study was not powered to exclude the possibility that long-term ferric maltol treatment for &gt;12 months could increase the risk of IBD reactivation.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the current findings substantially extend knowledge gained from the initial randomised trial with ferric maltol <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and the early proof-of-concept study with a ferric iron compound. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">41</ref></s><s>Long-term ferric maltol treatment beyond 12 weeks increased or maintaining haemoglobin concentration, allowing sustained normal haemoglobin in a high proportion of patients throughout 64 weeks of treatment.</s><s>Ferric maltol also increased the proportion of patients with corrected ferritin and transferrin saturation.</s><s>Future analyses will be required to define which patients benefitted most from long-term ferric maltol treatment and which patients did not need long-term treatment.</s><s>Such analysis will need to discern long-term improvements in haemoglobin and iron parameters that related to treatment from those related to reductions in underlying inflammatory bowel disease severity.</s><s>The tolerability of this novel ferric iron formulation remained favourable throughout this longterm (64-week) study, with few patients withdrawing due to medication-related effects.</s><s>Overall, ferric maltol shows promise as a new option for the long-term treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Among all ferric maltol-treated ulcerative colitis patients (N = 58),
