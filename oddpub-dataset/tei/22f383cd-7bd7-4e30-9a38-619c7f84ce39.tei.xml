loss can be explained by the presence of HLA Ab even when there are histological findings consistent with AMR, and subsequently, other antibodies have emerged as plausible causative

mechanism of autoantibody development is probably multifactorial and not well understood.</s><s>One hypothesis is that patients develop autoantibodies to AT 1 polymorphisms via the usual routes of allosensitization, both as a consequence of blood transfusion and as a transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> To what extent they are responsible for injury to the microcirculation and further amplification of cell damage still has to be clarified <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The pathophysiological role of AT 1 RAb is unknown, but in a rat model, purified AT 1 RAb from patients with vascular rejection induced renal artery muscular contractions after renal ischemia and allogeneic transplantation.</s><s>Pretreatment with a pharmacological ATR1 blocker only partially inhibited the AT 1 RAb-mediated contraction, which was almost completely abolished by neutralizing peptides targeting epitopes on the ATR 1 receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, it is known that the autoantibodies stimulate the receptor in an agonistic way and contribute to vascular and perivascular inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>According to in vitro studies, the AT 1 Rab may contribute to inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The human gene for AT 1 R is located on chromosome 3 and so far several polymorphisms have been identified, either mediating "loss of function" or "gain of function."</s><s>Among these, the A1166C polymorphism is associated with increased responsiveness to AngII and various cardiovascular and renal pathologies (2).</s><s>In the previously described

cross-sectional study, with blood sampling at different time points after transplantation.</s><s>Second, data were not collected at the time of rejection and information rejection was sampled from the NRR and from searches in medical reports and journals.</s><s>As some data regarding rejections were historical, not all rejections episodes could be clinically categorized in details.</s><s>None the less, even if the rejection rate in the adult group was significantly higher than in the pediatric group (50% vs. 17%, resp), the AT 1 RAb levels in adults were significantly lower than in the ped-tx cohort at HENT inclusion.</s><s>The longer interval from rejection may be a plausible explanation for the adults having lower IgG levels than the children with rejections previously, but even so, the levels in the pediatric control group were similar to the adult-tx group, suggesting that the time from tx was not the only relevant factor.</s><s>Third, our samples sizes were small and the groups
