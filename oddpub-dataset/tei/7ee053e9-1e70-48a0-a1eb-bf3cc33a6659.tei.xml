<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background 2.1 Model misspecification</head><p><s>For almost every psychological paradigm that can be implemented as an fMRI experiment, there exist several plausible ways to model it in a GLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Monti, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carp, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Typical questions that occur in setting up the analysis include: Should one include this regressor of no interest or not?</s><s>Does this cognitive process represent the baseline or must it be considered activation?</s><s>What is the duration of the underlying neuronal process?</s><s>Should one model cue stimuli, button presses, error trials or feedback screens?</s><s>How should the hemodynamic response be modeled?</s><s>etc.</s><s>If decisions are made that do not satisfy the data, this leads to a misspecified model.</s><s>Two basic forms of mismodelling are underfitting and overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Guyon and Yao, 1999</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">MacKay, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bishop, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In the first case, a necessary regressor is omitted from the model which reduces the model's descriptive power with respect to the given data (increasing the in-sample error).</s><s>For example, the subject's reaction times (RT) in task-based fMRI experiments can account for a considerable amount of signal variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Grinband et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Yeung et al., 2011)</ref> so that omitting an RT regressor from the GLM would cause underfitting.</s><s>In the second case, unnecessary regressors are included in the model, which are then just fitted to noise and thereby reduce the model's descriptive power with respect to other data of the same kind (increasing the generalization error).</s><s>For example, global signal regression (GSR) in resting-state fMRI might induce spurious anti-correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Murphy et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chai et al., 2012</ref>) so that including it in the model would cause overfitting.</s><s>It is also possible that a relevant effect is modeled, but the regressor does not have the optimal shape, e.g. because the assumed hemodynamic response function (HRF) does not reflect the actual hemodynamic response <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Monti, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Since this can be seen as omitting the correct regressor but including a wrong one, in this case overfitting and underfitting occur at the same time.</s><s>From the the perspective of a hypothesis test based on the respective model, underfitting increases the residual error while overfitting decreases the error degrees of freedom which is why in consequence both reduce the sensitivity (power) of the test.</s><s>These theoretical considerations are supported by empirical evidence of potential underfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009)</ref>, potential overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eklund et al., 2012)</ref> and potential p-hacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Vul et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It has also been demonstrated that activations detected using GLM-based fMRI analysis substantially depend on the model which is employed and its particular assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Carp, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Since these are only rarely scrutinized during GLM specification, mismodelling can be considered a serious problem in fMRI data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Monti, 2011</ref>).</s><s>An alternative way to describe under-and overfitting is through the concepts of accuracy and complexity.</s><s>An underfitted model does not have sufficient accuracy (too large in-sample error or residual variance), an overfitted model is too complex (has more parameters than can be well estimated from the given data).</s><s>In the following, we will mainly use this latter terminology.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Previous measures against model misspecification</head><p><s>In practice, when faced with the question whether a particular regressor should be included in a model, sometimes a null hypothesis test is performed to make this decision (see e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Henson et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>A statistical parametric map for the corresponding parameter is computed at the group level, and the regressor is included if there are significant effects in brain areas that are thought to be relevant for the paradigm.</s><s>There are several disadvantages to this approach: First, it is restricted to nested model comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Penny, 2012)</ref>, i.e. choosing between two models that only differ by including or not including a regressor (or a set of regressors).</s><s>Second, it only measures the gain in model accuracy through better fit (lower residual variance), but not model complexity and how well it generalizes to other data <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Oaksford, 2002)</ref> which is only indirectly accounted for via e.g.</s><s>numerator degrees of freedom in the F-statistic.</s><s>Third, it also fails to detect the relevance of regressors that have a non-significant effect at the group level, but still contribute to model fit on the level of individual subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Rigoux et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Beyond this naïve approach, the problem of model misspecification in fMRI analysis has been recognized by researchers and a number of strategies have been developed to deal with potential mismodelling.</s><s>Kherif and Loh have proposed algorithms for model optimization, but they only allow inference pertaining to nested model comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kherif et al., 2002)</ref> and condition regressor timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Loh et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Razavi et al., 2003</ref> investigated model accuracy based on the goodness of fit, but do not consider model complexity.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Luo and Nichols, 2003</ref> have supplied a range of frequentist methods for the diagnosis of a given model and exploratory data analysis.</s><s>Measures against overfitting were proposed for certain situations, e.g.</s><s>noise-model selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Penny et al., 2007b)</ref> and hemodynamic response modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kay et al. 2008a</ref>).</s><s>In addition, there are some recommendations regarding the temporal specification of experimental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Josephs and Henson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Yarkoni et al., 2009)</ref>, orthogonalisation of regressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mumford et al., 2015)</ref> and modelling of non-white noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lund et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>However, none of these methods and recommendations provide a general remedy for all possible forms of model misspecification and they are not based on systematic model comparison.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">General linear model selection for fMRI data analysis</head><p><s>An approach that avoids these shortcomings is Bayesian model selection (BMS).</s><s>One reason for this is that it uses the Bayesian log model evidence (LME) as a measure of model quality, a measure which accounts for both model accuracy and model complexity, so that maximizing it avoids both underfitting and overfitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(MacKay, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bishop, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, it attaches a model quality to any GLM and therefore enables nonnested model comparison, i.e. comparing more than two models that do not just differ by one or more regressors but in arbitrary ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Penny, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The concept of Bayesian model selection is not new to neuroimaging.</s><s>In dynamic causal modelling (DCM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Friston et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Stephan et al., 2008)</ref>, the free energy, a variational approximation to the log model evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Friston et al., 2007)</ref> is an established measure to quantify model quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Penny et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>For the GLM, the past has seen Variational Bayesian <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Penny et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Penny et al., , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Penny et al., , 2007a) )</ref> and Empirical Bayesian <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Friston et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Penny and Ridgway, 2013)</ref> methods to calculate the log model evidence.</s><s>In this work, we introduce a number of methodological improvements which address shortcomings of these approaches and increase the usability of BMS across GLMs for fMRI.</s><s>First, a practical problem for the use of BMS is that it requires prior distributions on the model parameters.</s><s>Using too wide priors will exaggerate the complexity of models which include more regressors while too narrow priors will underestimate it.</s><s>Optimally, priors should be informed by previous experience about typical parameter values <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Stephan, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>However, such numeric information is normally not included in neuroimaging papers and concrete values strongly depend, among others, on scanner technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Triantafyllou et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>We here solve this problem by using part of the available data to obtain an informative prior and another part to calculate the log model evidence, leading to the cross-validated log model evidence (cvLME).</s><s>BMS based on this quantity is referred to as cross-validated Bayesian model selection (cvBMS).</s><s>Second, as opposed to previous Bayesian analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Penny et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Penny et al., , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Penny et al., , 2007a))</ref>, we use a simple, but reasonable model structure which exactly corresponds to the model underlying standard first-level fMRI data analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Friston et al., 1994)</ref> as performed e.g. by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).</s><s>This enables an Analytical Bayesian computation for the Bayesian GLM with normal-gamma priors (GLM-NG) which makes our method both fast and precise.</s><s>The cvLME for the GLM-NG is combined with a voxel-wise implementation of randomeffects Bayesian model selection (RFX BMS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Stephan et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Rosa et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Penny et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Rigoux et al., 2014)</ref>, a common procedure for second-level model inference that accounts for the optimal model to vary across voxels as well as subjects.</s><s>This allows for spatially heterogeneous modelling, i.e. using different models for different areas of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Razavi et al., 2003)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Application of the method</head><p><s>On the first level, once a model is specified and estimated for a given subject, cvBMS calculates a cross-validated version of the log model evidence (cvLME) for each voxel in the brain.</s><s>This results in a cvLME map which quantifies the model's performance in different parts of the brain (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>The cvLME is a relative measure of model quality and its absolute value has no direct interpretation.</s><s>For a single subject, two or more models are compared by converting the log model evidences jointly into posterior model probabilities.</s><s>If the models fall into one or more model families, where models of a family have a particular modelling decision in common, log model evidences can be first aggregated into log family evidences which are then converted into posterior family probabilities.</s><s>The optimal model or model family is the one with the largest posterior probability.</s><s>On the second level, cvBMS accounts for the fact that different models may be optimal in different subjects.</s><s>Using the first-level log model (or family) evidences for all models (or families) in all subjects, it estimates how frequently each model is optimal in the population of subjects.</s><s>The results are brain maps of estimated model frequencies (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) or, alternatively, maps of the posterior probability that a given model is more frequent than all others, the so-called exceedance probability.</s><s>The optimal model or model family is the one with the largest estimated frequency.</s><s>Just as log model evidences, posterior probabilities and model frequencies are voxel-wise and have the form of brain maps.</s><s>Selecting models on a voxel-by-voxel basis results in a selected-model map (SMM) which can then be used to restrict GLM-based analyses to those voxels where the corresponding model is optimal.</s></p></div>
