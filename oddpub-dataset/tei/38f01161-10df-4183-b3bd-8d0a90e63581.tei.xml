The high value reflects a strong deviation from evenness despite pure randomness.</s><s>Others have noted the problem of small unit size in the measurement of segregation; see, e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carrington and Troske (1997)</ref>.</s><s>They proposed an adjustment to segregation indices that has since been used by researchers measuring workplace segregation where small units are particularly likely (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hellerstein and Neumark, 2008)</ref> and measuring school segregation (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Söderström and Uusitalo, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In comparing segregation across areas or time, small unit bias should be of concern to researchers for two reasons.</s><s>First, the size of the bias will differ across comparison areas, potentially leading to an incorrect ranking of levels of segregation across areas.</s><s>Second, the presence of small unit bias makes a correlation between measured segregation index values and a potentially causal variable, say X, difficult to interpret.</s><s>It will impact on the estimated effect of X on measured segregation, even if the parameters of the problem (unit size, minority fraction and population) do not vary across areas.</s><s>In addition, it is likely that the bias as a function of these parameters will be correlated with X, making the true relationship between X and D difficult to identify.</s></p><p><s>The variable X could, for example, be income differentials.</s><s>If one were to investigate racial segregation in schools in an area, then one explanation of racial segregation, as indicated by a high value of D, could be income inequality between the two groups.</s><s>Income inequality could be the cause of neighbourhood and hence school segregation.</s><s>If there is no income inequality between the two groups in the area, then this could be indicative of behaviour due to other preferences.</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we propose an inferential framework for the canonical segregation measure, D, based on an underlying statistical model.</s><s>This set-up is related to, but different from, that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ransom (2000)</ref>.</s><s>He derives (asymptotic) inference procedures for D by specifying the sampling variation of a multinomial distribution.</s><s>In Section 2, we specify the assignment problem in a very general way, and set out the difference in assignment probabilities that underlies the resulting segregation.</s><s>From this, we derive bias adjustments to D in Section 3, and a likelihood ratio test for the presence of any systematic segregation in Section 4. One of our bias adjustments is based on a simple bootstrap bias correction; other adjustments use the asymptotic normal distribution of the observed frequencies.</s><s>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ransom (2000)</ref>, in Sections 5 and 6, we further develop the asymptotic distribution theory for testing hypotheses concerning the magnitude of the segregation index and we show that use of bootstrap methods can improve the size and power properties of test procedures considerably.</s><s>As in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ransom (2000)</ref>, our asymptotic distribution theory relies on the number of units being fixed, with unit sizes going to infinity.</s><s>Our results indicate that our methods work well in settings such as our analysis of social segregation in English schools, where the average number of units (schools) in the local authorities are about 55, with the average number of pupils per school equal to 38.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rathelot (2012)</ref> recently proposed a Beta-Binomial mixture model to describe segregation and has shown that it performs well in a setting with many small units (i.e.</s><s>under asymptotics where the number of units goes to infinity); see also d <ref type="bibr">'Haultfoeuille and Rathelot (2011)</ref>.</s><s>In Section 7, we present a brief discussion of the measure proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rathelot (2012)</ref> and also the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carrington and Troske (1997)</ref>.</s><s>In Section 8, we illustrate our methods in an example of social segregation in schools in England.</s><s>We conclude in Section 9.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>To make statements about the true underlying degree of segregation, or to understand the processes causing segregation, it is desirable to measure the level of systematic segregation.</s><s>However, where minority proportions and unit sizes are small, the level of segregation observed by researchers in their data is known to be significantly greater than systematic segregation.</s><s>Furthermore, because the size of the bias of observed segregation over systematic segregation is known to be a function of minority proportion, unit sizes and systematic segregation, differences in any of these parameters between areas or over time may lead to incorrect inferences.</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we have proposed and tested procedures for adjusting the dissimilarity index of segregation for this bias.</s><s>Our corrections work well, provided both the minority proportion and unit size are not very small.</s><s>Where very small minority proportions and unit sizes render our corrections useless, we show that levels of segregation are often not statistically distinguishable from zero.</s><s>We have developed and tested our statistical framework using the index of dissimilarity, D, but it can, in principle, be extended to other segregation indices.</s></p><p><s>From our statistical framework, we have developed tests for a null of no systematic segregation and a null of equal segregation in two areas, and we have established confidence intervals for levels of systematic segregation.</s><s>In tests using unit sizes, minority proportions and underlying segregation levels similar to those encountered by social scientists, the Wald statistics using the bootstrap variance estimate for the bias-corrected estimators and the test based on the equal-tail bootstrap P -value for the t-test (T pb ) are found to perform best.</s><s>The methods proposed in this paper provide a framework for more reliable inference as to levels of segregation, which will aid the further investigation of the causes of segregation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rathelot (2012)</ref> and d <ref type="bibr">'Haultfoeuille and Rathelot (2011)</ref> have also considered the problem of measuring segregation when units are small.</s><s>In their set-up, the number of individuals in units is small at around 5 or 10, whereas the number of units is large.</s><s>Indeed, the methods in these papers rely on large-number-of-units asymptotics.</s><s>Both papers show that the parametric method proposed by Rathelot performs well in the estimation of the dissimilarity index and other measures of inequality, such as the Gini and the Theil indices.</s><s>In this set-up, the number of individuals in unit j , n j , is drawn from a given, unknown distribution.</s><s>Then, the number of individuals in unit j having status c, n c j , is distributed as Binomial(n j , π c j ), and π c j = n c j /n j is an unbiased estimate of π c j .</s><s>The parametric method of Rathelot ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) is then to assume that π c j is distributed as a mixture of Beta distributions, leading to the Beta-Binomial model.</s><s>In the simulations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rathelot (2012)</ref>, it is shown that estimates of the dissimilarity index from this Beta-Binomial model have better properties in terms of smaller bias than the bootstrap bias correction in the setting of a large number of small units.</s><s>We have tried to analyse the behaviour of this estimator in our set-up, but found in the simulations of our design of Section 3.1 that the Beta-Binomial estimation procedure often did not converge, making it difficult to compare the performance of this estimator with the others in our set-up. 4</s><s>For larger minority fractions and values of D pop , convergence of the ML estimator is easier to obtain in our design.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">5</ref> shows the estimation results for D beta1 , which is the Beta-Binomial estimator with a one-component Beta distribution, for E[n j ] = 30, J = 50, p = 0.20, where we obtained valid Monte Carlo results for D pop = 0.127 and larger.</s><s>The results show that in this design, D beta1 behaves similarly to D dc for D pop = 0.127, but has a substantially larger bias and/or rmse for larger values of D pop .</s><s>For this design, increasing the number of mixtures of beta distributions to two does not change the results, because in almost all cases this model converges to the one-component model.</s><s>The Beta-Binomial estimator is not consistent for a fixed number of units and unit sizes going to infinity.</s><s>For example, when we increase the expected sample size to E[n j ] = 100, the bias and rmse of D beta1 increases to −0.042 and 0.044, respectively, when D pop = 0.382.</s><s>The bias and rmse of D itself in that case are 0.009 and 0.018, respectively.</s></p></div>			</div>
