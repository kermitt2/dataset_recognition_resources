<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background-Aversion to the orosensory properties of concentrated ethanol solutions is often cited as a primary barrier to initiation of drinking and may contribute to abstention.</s><s>These aversive properties include gustatory processes which encompass both bitter-like taste qualities and trigeminal-mediated irritation.</s><s>Chronic-intermittent ethanol access (CIA) results in substantial and persistent increases in ethanol consumption, but the degree to which this facilitation involves sensory responding to ethanol and other bitter stimuli is currently undetermined.</s></p><p><s>Methods-Long-Evans rats were given brief-access licking tests designed to examine the immediate, taste-guided assessment of the palatability of ethanol and quinine solutions.</s><s>Rats were assessed once in a naïve state and again following previous brief-access exposure, or following four weeks of CIA.</s><s>The relationship between the sensitivity to the aversive orosensory properties of ethanol and quinine following ethanol access and the impact of antecedent quinine exposure on the acceptance of ethanol were determined in two parallel studies.</s></p><p><s>Results-Both brief-access to ethanol and four-week CIA resulted in substantial rightward shifts in the concentration-response function of brief-access ethanol licking indicating that ethanol exposure increased acceptance of the taste of ethanol.</s><s>The initial sensitivity to the aversive orosensory properties of ethanol and quinine were positively correlated in naïve rats, such that rats that were initially more accepting of quinine were also more accepting of ethanol.</s><s>Rats that sampled quinine immediately prior to tasting ethanol exhibited successive positive contrast in that they were more accepting of highly concentrated ethanol, relative to a water-control group.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions-Increased ethanol acceptance following exposure is, at least in part, facilitated by a decrease in its aversive sensory properties.</s><s>Both long and short term access increases the palatability of the taste of ethanol in brief-access licking tests.</s><s>Moreover, the sensitivity to the bitterness of quinine was predictive of acceptance of ethanol indicating some commonality in the sensory mechanisms that mediate the initial acceptance of the two stimuli.</s><s>Accordingly, immediate prior exposure to quinine results in increased acceptance of ethanol suggesting that successive positive contrast between oral stimuli may contribute to increased alcohol consumption.</s></p></div>

rapid increase in the acceptance of ethanol, relative to QHCl, following repeated exposure in adulthood remain to be determined.</s><s>However, these data suggest that the rapid increase in acceptance of ethanol following exposure in adulthood is likely not simply due to a generalized increased in the acceptance of bitter-like taste stimuli or necessarily dependent on substantial experience with the postingestive consequences of ethanol.</s><s>While more extensive access ultimately resulted in a larger shift in the acceptance of ethanol (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), these data demonstrate that simply being repeatedly exposed to the taste of ethanol is sufficient to increase the acceptance of its taste.</s><s>Because we did not measure blood ethanol concentrations in this study we cannot be certain that the rats were not experiencing any postingestive consequences of brief-access ethanol exposure, albeit similarly designed brief-access licking tests in a previous report have shown that the marginal volume of ethanol consumed in these tests does not result in measurable changes in blood ethanol concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Brasser et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>With that being said, the substantially larger increases in the acceptance of the taste of ethanol seen following a free-access drinking paradigm (CIA), relative to brief-access alone, are likely the result of a combination of the rapid increases in acceptance seen following brief-access ethanol access and conditioning effects due to the reinforcing pharmacological and caloric postingestive consequences of ethanol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackroff and Sclafani, 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in the present study, rats that were placed on the CIA procedure following brief-access to the taste of ethanol did not show the gradual increase in either the free-access consumption of, or the preference for, ethanol that is typical of these

the brief-access exposures to ethanol in the Davis rig were sufficient to familiarize the animals with ethanol in a manner that may potentially ameliorate the aversive orosensory properties of

decrease in responsiveness to QHCl.</s><s>This could mean that the developmental changes that drive the increased acceptance observed in adolescence are lost by adulthood.</s><s>Another potential explanation is that the effects may be lost in the absence of subsequent ethanol exposures, because all adults in these previous studies were abstinent with regards to ethanol prior to testing,

ethanol and QHCl that serves to limit the avidity for the tastes of two stimuli, but that these overlapping mechanisms are not substantially impacted by repeated ethanol exposure in

serve to facilitate ongoing drinking and that these sensitivities are likely more influential in the initiation of drinking as was observed during the various brief-access tests.</s><s>Regardless, Experiment 2 was conducted to further explore any potential interaction between the bitter taste system and palatability for concentrated ethanol solutions.</s></p><p><s>Rinsing with QHCl prior to ethanol resulted in a substantial increase in the initial acceptance of the taste of ethanol further suggesting that ethanol and QHCl share some physiological mechanisms that contribute to the hedonic evaluation of their tastes.</s><s>One such mechanism could be that the two substances share a receptor responsible for transduction of their respective taste signals.</s><s>The TAS2R family of mammalian genes encode ~30 broadly tuned receptors that respond to a wide variety of bitter tasting compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Meyerhof, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>If the T2Rs responsible for the transduction of the bitter taste of ethanol are the same as those of QHCl then rinsing the oral cavity with QHCl may contribute to receptor adaptation or some other form of competitive inhibition

not bind overlapping T2Rs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nolden et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Allen et al., 2014)</ref>; though, to the best of our knowledge, there is not adequate information regarding the potential receptors of ethanol and QHCl in rodents to make such a claim.</s><s>Regardless, reducing any bitter component of the taste of ethanol would likely increase its palatability through enhancement of the salience of the established sweet-like component in the taste of ethanol <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lemon et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Such an outcome would likely result in a behavioral profile similar to that observed in the present study.</s><s>Because brief-access exposure alone was sufficient to increase the acceptance of the orosensory properties of ethanol upon a second test, we cannot make a direct claim that the increase in acceptance following a QHCl oral rinse was concentration dependent.</s><s>Rather, simply exposing the rats to the taste of QHCl prior to ethanol was sufficient to increase the acceptance of ethanol, relative to rats tasting H 2 O, and this was true for both concentrations of QHCl tested (0.03 &amp; 0.3 mM;
