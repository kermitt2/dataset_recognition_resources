<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Questionnaire</head><p><s>All athletes were asked to complete the Allergy Questionnaire for Athletes (AQUA © ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) screening questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Both questionnaires were validated [28e31].</s><s>The aim of our analyses was to assess asthma in athletes.</s><s>We therefore focused on the validated ECRHS questions for outcome assessment.</s></p><p><s>In order to assess training intensity, athletes were asked about their number of training sessions per week, accumulated duration of the weekly training sessions, location of training (mainly indoor vs. outdoor), and if they had competed earlier in another sport discipline.</s><s>Sport disciplines were classified in three groups (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>): 1) Low ventilation sports, 2) intermediate ventilation sports, and 3) high ventilation sports, applying a sports classification published previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Ventilation needs were based on characteristics of the sport during competition.</s><s>In this way, 143 athletes were classified as participating in low, 53 athletes in intermediate and 352 athletes in high ventilation sports.</s></p><p><s>The potential confounders age, sex, level of education, smoking, and frequency of exercise were considered.</s><s>Athletes were classified as either smoker (current smoker and ex-smoker) or non-smoker (never-smoker).</s><s>Level of education was divided into less than 12 years of education versus 12 or more years of education.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Clinical measurements</head><p><s>The clinical measurements consisted of exhaled nitric oxide (FE NO ) measurements, followed by spirometry.</s><s>Asthmatic athletes continued to take their asthma medication during the clinical measurements.</s><s>It had been shown in previous studies that different factors might influence the result of the FE NO -measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, athletes who had exercised within the last 2 h (12 athletes), smoked during the last four weeks (2 athletes), had a respiratory infection during the last four weeks (5 athletes), or spirometry performed prior to the FE NO -measurements (2 athletes) were excluded from the FE NO -measurements.</s><s>FE NO -measurements were performed with a portable measurement device (NIOX MINO ® , Aerocrine, Bad Homburg, Germany) according to international guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Afterwards, pulmonary function testing was performed using a bodyplethysmograph (ZAN 500 Plethysmograph, nSpire Health GmbH, Oberthulba), following the established guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>At least three technically acceptable flow-volume manoeuvres were performed and the highest values were recorded.</s><s>Predicted values were based on the reference values of the European Respiratory Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, the prevalence of asthma in a representative sample of German elite winter and summer athletes engaged in different sport disciplines and representative of an entire country has been assessed using standardized instruments.</s><s>The study allowed the assessment of differences in asthma prevalence between elite winter and summer athletes from a wide range of sport disciplines.</s><s>Additionally, the asthma risk according to level of ventilation achieved during competition was investigated.</s></p></div>

target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>There are other studies which suggest that athletes who participate in winter sports suffer more frequently from asthma than those who are active in summer sports <ref type="bibr">[8,9,39e44</ref>].</s><s>However, it should be noted that these studies are based on different sports and there are also studies demonstrating a high prevalence of asthma in summer athletes <ref type="bibr">[5,14,22,45e47]</ref>.</s><s>For example, swimmers seem to be more likely to have asthma than other competitive athletes, with up to 70% of elite swimmers diagnosed with asthma <ref type="bibr">[42,48e50]</ref>.</s><s>In our study 37% of the swimmers reported doctors' diagnosed asthma.</s><s>Ventilation rate achieved during competition: Considering the different sport disciplines, our study confirmed that athletes engaged in high ventilation sports have a higher prevalence of asthma in comparison with athletes engaged in low ventilation sports.</s><s>An approximate two-fold increased risk of doctors' diagnosed asthma, three-fold increased risk of current wheezing or asthma medication and an even four-fold increased risk of asthma medication were detected for athletes performing at the highest ventilation level.</s><s>Similar results have been reported by other authors: consistently, the same sport disciplines appear to have an increased risk of asthma <ref type="bibr">[17,21,51e54</ref>].</s><s>An advantage of our study was that the ventilation rate achieved during competition e which is known to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of asthma in athletes -was directly taken for classification of sport disciplines.</s><s>Most other studies used endurance level for classification.</s><s>Since the World Anti-Doping Committee (WADA) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) removed the need to document asthma by lung function tests before the use of the inhaled b2-agonists salbutamol, salmeterol, formoterol and inhaled corticosteroids between 2010 and 2012, incongruence of asthma treatment with asthma diagnosis might be an issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is high evidence that b2-agonists within the controlled concentrations do not improve exercise performance in highly trained athletes <ref type="bibr">[42,55e64]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, in recreational athletes there seems to be an effect on performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study shows that especially athletes performing high ventilation sports are at an increased risk of having asthma.</s><s>There was no statistically significant difference between winter and summer athletes.</s><s>These findings might be explained by the pathogenesis of asthma in athletes <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>.</s><s>During exercise, ventilation rises considerably, reaching up to 280 L per minute.</s><s>Both winter and summer athletes are exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions that may aggravate the effects of intense exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</s><s>Winter athletes are exposed to large volumes of cold air, summer athletes to allergens in the air and high levels of ozone, and swimmers to chlorine and its metabolites [70e72].</s><s>In low ventilation sports, ventilation is increased for only short periods of time, but in high ventilation sports this occurs over longer periods.</s><s>When the ventilation level exceeds about 30 L per minute there is a shift from nasal breathing to combined mouth and nasal breathing, which leads to incompletely conditioned and cleaned air reaching lower airways <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s>This results in mucosal injury which may lead to chronic inflammation and thus contribute to the development of asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, intense exercise leads to the activation of the parasympathic nerve system -especially in endurance athletes -which aggravates bronchoconstriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>.</s><s>Suppression of the immunological protection might lead to recurrent infections of the upper airway.</s><s>This could contribute to the development of asthma

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Clinical measurements</head><p><s>Despite a relatively large sample of winter athletes additionally examined with FE NO -levels and lung function (N ¼ 174) the number of athletes with doctors' diagnosed asthma (n ¼ 16) in this subgroup was small.</s><s>Thus, the interpretation of these results remains speculative.</s><s>In our study, there was no statistically significant difference in the lung function test results between asthmatic and non-asthmatic athletes at rest.</s><s>The aim of the clinical measurements was to assess asthma control rather than verify the reported diagnosis.</s><s>The asthmatic athletes studied continued to take their asthma medication.</s><s>Stenfors et al. have reported that lung function testing shows a quick decrease if asthmatic athletes stop taking their asthma medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Our study has found asthmatic athletes demonstrate no impaired pulmonary function at rest.</s><s>One might argue that the cut-off point for the spirometry was not adequate.</s><s>However, the use of continuous data did not change the results.</s><s>On the other hand, our study showed an approximate fourfold increased risk for elevated FE NO -values for asthmatic athletes.</s><s>This might suggest an insufficient control of the asthma status and might explain asthma symptoms during exercise despite normal lung function test results at rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, we did not implement an asthma control questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</s><s>This suboptimal asthma control might be due to insufficient medication or insufficient compliance.</s></p><p><s>Some limitations of our study should be mentioned: Diagnosis of asthma relied on what was self-reported, no objective measurement of asthma was made.</s><s>The majority of athletes included in this study were medically taken care of at the Department for Prevention, Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, Technical University of Munich.</s><s>This is why we assume that the self-reported outcomes in our study are reliable.</s><s>The obtained data neither showed whether athletes already suffered from asthma when starting their career, nor whether asthma was developed by exercising at a higher performance level.</s><s>In our study, conditions during competition were used for classification (i.e.</s><s>competition season and ventilation rate achieved during competition).</s><s>Interpreting our data, it should be considered that conditions during competition often differ from conditions during training, elite athletes perform training in winter as well as in summer, and the requirement concerning ventilation differs between training sessions.</s><s>The present study did not incorporate objective measurements of specific environmental conditions related to each type of sport <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</s><s>Further studies should include these measurements in order to define further risk factors for the development of asthma in athletes.</s><s>A differentiation between chronic asthma and exercise induced bronchoconstriction was not made.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>In conclusion, our study supports earlier evidence that athletes involved in high ventilation sports are at an increased risk to suffer from asthma.</s><s>In contrast the competition season (winter vs. summer) had no impact on the frequency of asthma in our study.</s><s>This knowledge should be used when working with elite athletes.</s><s>Especially for athletes involved in high ventilation sports, asthma prevention should be performed from the beginning of their career.</s><s>This could be practiced during training sessions.</s><s>Airway-irritating environmental conditions should be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>.</s><s>Among winter athletes elevated FE NO -values suggested suboptimal control of the disease.</s><s>Currently used methods such as spirometry may not be sensitive enough to assess asthma control in athletes during activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>.</s></p></div>
