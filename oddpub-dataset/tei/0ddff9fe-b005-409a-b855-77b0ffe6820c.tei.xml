target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>We hypothesized that the identification of brain-specific B cells in RRMS patients is as crucial at an early stage of the disease as the identification of treatment responders at the onset of GA therapy.</s><s>GA treatment does not only induce antibodies against GA, but it also increases anti-histone antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s></p><p><s>There have been several efforts to identify drug responders and non-responders by using a standard proliferation assay combined with ELISPOT <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>The immunological response profile, including the ELISPOT response to IFN-γ and IL-4, correlated with the clinical response to GA treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>More importantly, an increased IL-4/IFN-γ ratio was associated with a milder clinical response in stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of GA-treated patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In this report, the major new observation is that the presence of brain-specific B cells is a categorical variable to identify GA responders.</s><s>First, we found that the therapeutic benefit from GA treatment was greater in RRMS patients who displayed brain antigen-reactive B cells in the blood compared to patients without.</s><s>Second, a brain-antigen specific response in our bioassay was associated with drug responsiveness only in GA-treated patients, while this association was absent in the IFN-β -treated cohort.</s><s>Interestingly, in the IFN-β -treated group the patients characterized by the absence of brain-reactive B cells showed a benefit from the treatment, suggesting that IFN-β effectiveness might be compromised in patients with brain-reactive B cells.</s><s>We assume that the B cells that produce brain-reactive antibodies are distinct from the B cell subpopulations that are susceptible to IFN-β treatment.</s><s>One mechanism of action of IFN-β on B cells is the downregulation of CD40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> resulting in impaired cognate B-T cell interaction.</s><s>It is conceivable that the brain-reactive B cells as detected by our assay are not affected by this mechanism, while they are modulated by GA treatment.</s></p><p><s>Overall, our data also strongly support the concept of heterogeneity in the immunopathology of MS as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Histological analysis revealed that lesions within one patient were similarly composed, while four general subtypes were identified among different patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Patients with the most frequent lesion pattern that was characterized by antibody deposition and complement activation positively responded to therapeutic plasma exchange in acute relapses, whereas patients without antibody deposition failed to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>These findings imply that the heterogeneity found histologically reflected a similar heterogeneity in the pathophysiology of the disease.</s><s>Conversely, recent studies suggested that heterogeneity of the disease was mostly found in the early stages of lesion formation, while being absent in established MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Third, we focused on the disability status and compared patients with a mild and severe disability status.</s><s>Our data may provide evidence that once a clinical threshold of irreversible disability has been reached GA does not have the same benefit as for patients at an early stage of disease.</s><s>In this context it is of note that in two former trials in RRMS GA was more effective in patients with an EDSS score between 0 and 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>GA efficacy in patients with more severe disease might indeed be affected by the natural history and progression of the disease.</s><s>We do not question this possibility.</s><s>However, it was our aim to show that treatment with GA at an early disease stage is very important for its clinical efficacy, while the EDSS is not as suitable to categorize drug responsiveness as our B cell ELISPOT.</s><s>Yet, we are aware of the fact that the assumption of a correlation between GA responsiveness, the brain-reactive B cell response and disease activity is not necessarily a causal one.</s><s>At this point, our data are limited in that they do not show a direct effect of GA on B cells.</s><s>Nevertheless, the B cell response should still be a discriminating factor for treatment responsiveness as demonstrated in this study and not solely an indicator of disease activity, while the EDSS will be useful to investigate the two-stage history of RRMS.</s><s>We suggest that combining the information on both the disease stage and responsiveness to brain antigens will be crucial for an accurate and individual MS therapy.</s><s>Our data support the notion of a two-stage disability process as suggested by Leray et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>We hypothesize that B cells could play a role in a more progressive disease as reported before <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and one could hypothesize that MS patients who display brain antigen-reactive B cells in the blood are more likely to show disease progression.</s><s>We also suggest that B cells from patients with a more severe disability status are less likely to be remodelled in contrast to B cells from patients with a milder disability status.</s><s>In addition, we postulate that RRMS patients displaying brain-reactive B cells are likely to benefit from GA treatment through a novel recently described mechanism of action that targets anti-inflammatory B cell properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>In summary, we have introduced a simple bioassay to identify GA-treated MS patients that show B cell responsiveness to brain antigens in the blood.</s><s>These results could have far-reaching implications for future treatment strategies of MS.</s></p></div>
