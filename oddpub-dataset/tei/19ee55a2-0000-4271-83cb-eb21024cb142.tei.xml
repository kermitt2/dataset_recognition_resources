<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Instrumental decision-making requires learning and executing adequate behavior efficiently in relevant situations in order to obtain desired outcomes.</s><s>Based on an extensive body of animal research, this ability is thought to rely on the functioning of two parallel systems: a reflexive habitual system and a deliberate goal-directed system <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dickinson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998a</ref>).</s><s>The habit system is believed to be an evolutionary basal system, suggested to mainly rely on dorsolateral striatal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Yin et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Yin et al., , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Tricomi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wunderlich et al., 2012a)</ref>.</s><s>Habits are ''stamped in'' by past reinforcements until they are performed in an automatic routine.</s><s>The habit system is inflexible and suboptimal in changing environments, but it offers the advantage to free up cognitive resources, allowing the allocation of attention to parallel tasks.</s><s>In contrast, goal-directed behavior has shown to largely involve prefrontal cortical and dorsomedial striatal brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Corbit and Balleine, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Killcross and Coutureau, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Yin et al., 2005a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Valentin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">de Wit et al., 2009</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Jonkman et al., 2009)</ref>, and is characterized by flexible behavior, which is more easily adaptable in the face of changing contingencies.</s><s>However, it is thought to be computationally more demanding than the habit system, and the ability to engage the goal-directed system effectively seems to depend on trait factors such as healthy aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eppinger et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">de Wit et al., 2014)</ref> and cognitive capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Otto et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Smittenaar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schad et al., 2014)</ref> or state conditions, including stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Schwabe and Wolf, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Otto et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Radenbach et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>There is growing evidence that deficient instrumental decision-making based on the dual-systems theory is implicated in multiple disorders (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gillan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sjoerds et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Horstmann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Voon et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">McKim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Reiter et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Human behavior, however, might be influenced by a wide variety of unrelated external or internal factors (i.e., social conventions, cultural context or financial situations), rendering it more noisy than e.g., rodent behavior despite the large overlap between human and rodent instrumental systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Balleine and O'Doherty, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>This increases the complexity to measure individual constructs in humans.</s><s>Together with the need to apply cognitive measurements in pathological samples, this advances the prerequisite to optimize the assessment of these instrumental behaviors.</s></p><p><s>To adequately assess the degree to which the two proposed systems are used in instrumental choices, it is essential to ensure suitable instruments that objectively assess covert sub-processes contributing to the constructs and that are simultaneously straightforward for intuitive analyses and application in patient samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Huys et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Throughout the past decade, distinct paradigms to study the two systems in humans have been operationalized based on different methodological and historical perspectives of habitual vs. goal-directed behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Doll et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dolan and Dayan, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>They can be distinguished by whether the paradigm captures the ongoing contingency updating process or largely established behavioral schemata, processes that are not necessarily independent of each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gillan et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Further variations lie in the focus on central sub-processes underlying habitual and goal-directed choices.</s><s>For example, goal-directed behavior is complex and involves multiple sub-processes including forward planning, outcome contingency weighting, search processes and abstract inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hampton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abe and Lee, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Doll et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Change in outcome value or contingencies (e.g., outcome devaluation or changes in outcome probabilities) provides the canonical assay of behavioral flexibility as related to the balance between goal-directed vs. habitual control.</s><s>Frequently used tasks, such as a slips-of-action paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(de Wit et al., 2012b)</ref> and sequential decision-making paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref> assess the ability to rapidly adjust behavior to changes in outcome value.</s></p><p><s>Classically, the relative involvement of the goal-directed and habitual systems in instrumental choices has been studied in animals by (selective) outcome devaluation procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams and Dickinson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998b)</ref>, a method that has been adapted to human research <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Valentin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Tricomi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Horstmann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Devaluation of an outcome (O) that has been associated with a stimulus (S) will change response (R) behavior when under control of the goal-directed system, as R-O contingencies are represented in the goal-directed system.</s><s>However, once S-R habitual responding to a stimulus is established, the outcome is no longer taken into account in the choice behavior; therefore, devaluation of the outcome will not immediately influence habitual responding to the stimulus but only after gradual update of the stimulus value after repeated outcome feedback.</s><s>Following the same line of reasoning, a slips-of-action paradigm was developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(de Wit et al., 2012b)</ref>, in which participants learn stimulusreward contingencies.</s><s>After training, an instructed devaluation phase assesses whether participants can suppress previously learned responses that yield no-longer-valuable outcomes, while continuing to respond for still-valuable outcomes.</s><s>A failure to do so, as reflected in ''slips of action'' towards devalued outcomes, is interpreted as relative reliance on S-R habitual-as opposed to goal-directed-control.</s><s>Crucially, a devaluation sensitivity index (DSI) is calculated based on the difference in responding between these two trial types, providing a single parameter that represents the relative involvement of the habit vs. goal-directed system in action control.</s><s>This task has been used extensively to study goal-directed and habitual action control in healthy participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(de Wit et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(de Wit et al., , 2012b) )</ref> following dopamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(de Wit et al., 2012a)</ref> and serotonin level reductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Worbe et al., 2015)</ref> and in patient samples, including obsessive-compulsive disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gillan et al., 2011)</ref>, alcohol dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sjoerds et al., 2013)</ref>, Gille de La Tourette syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delorme et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr">), Parkinson's Disease (de Wit et al.,

however, how devaluation sensitivity, as assessed with this task, relates to other paradigms assessing goal-directed and habitual control, such as the model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms used during sequential decision making.</s></p><p><s>RL theory aims to formalize decision-making processes such as goal-directed and habitual learning by describing distinct underlying computational mechanisms.</s><s>To this end, in addition to analyzing observable behavior such as accuracy, reaction times and win-stay probabilities, generative models are implemented to infer parameters that underlie the observed behavior.</s><s>One of the frequently used RL models follows the temporal difference (TD) theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sutton and Barto, 1998)</ref>, which is closely linked to habitual learning.</s><s>It provides a ''MF'' update rule to learn action values based on past reinforcements.</s><s>Goal-directed instrumental learning has also been proposed to have a formal counterpart in RL, in a family of algorithms known as ''MB'' RL <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Daw et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rangel et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Redish et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The MB system uses a model of the environment for flexible forward planning.</s><s>Resembling the goal-directed system, it contains knowledge on the causal relationship between actions and outcomes.</s><s>In the context of RL theory, one task to study goal-directed vs. habitual responding with the MB and MF algortihms, respectively is the two-step sequential decision making task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref> in combination with computational modeling of decision making using MB and MF algorithms.</s><s>This two-step task has been extensively used in the past years to study MB vs. MF learning in healthy and diseased samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wunderlich et al., 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Eppinger et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Otto et al., 2013;</ref><ref

2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The increasing availability of instruments measuring goal-directed and habitual behavior increases the necessity for cross-validation of different paradigms on the assessment of the two central constructs.</s><s>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Friedel et al. (2014)</ref> have performed a valuable cross-validation study on the goal-directed and habit constructs assessed by a selective devaluation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Valentin et al., 2007)</ref> and the two-step sequential decisionmaking task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>They found specific crosscorrelation between MB choices during sequential decisions and goal-directed behavior after devaluation.</s><s>This suggests a single framework underlying both task measures, speaking in favor of construct validity of both measurement approaches.</s><s>However, further comparable research on cross-validation of instrumental decision-making between other tasks is needed.</s><s>Another recent study directly manipulated MB learning with habitual responding within one paradigm: they used an adjusted two-step sequential decision-making task, including a later phase that provided a DSI <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gillan et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>By using a median split on this DSI, they defined groups of participants using predominantly goal-directed or habitual responding.</s><s>They found that MB control during the first phase of the task protected from established habitual responding during the last phase measured by devaluation sensitivity.</s><s>This further indicates an overlap between MB learning and established goal-directed behavior.</s></p><p><s>We would like to extend this line of research by crossvalidating MB control and goal-directed responding between two different tasks that have been most commonly used in the recent body of literature.</s><s>We will correlate parameters describing MB and MF control from the two-step sequential decision-making task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref> with a DSI from the slips-of-action paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(de Wit et al., 2012b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Worbe et al., 2015)</ref>, which measures the relative balance of goal-directed and habitual choices on a gradual scale.</s><s>We hypothesize a positive association between the measure of MB behavior and the DSI.</s><s>In other words, participants who show more MB behavior in the two-step task are expected to be better able to respond selectively for still-valuable outcomes, while suppressing slips of action towards no-longer valuable outcomes in the slips-of-action paradigm.</s><s>We additionally explore a possible association between the tasks on the habit system, expecting a negative correlation between MF behavior and the DSI.</s><s>We furthermore assess the role of higher-order cognitive capacities, measured by widely used neuropsychological tests, in the recruitment of the goal-directed/MB and habitual/MF systems.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The aim of the current study was to cross-validate instrumental behavior from the goal-directed and habit systems assessed by two frequently used tasks.</s><s>To this end, we correlated parameters assessing the involvement of the two systems from an instrumental learning task with an instructed devaluation slips-of-action phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(de Wit et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(de Wit et al., , 2012b</ref>) and a two-step sequential decision-making task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Partly conforming to our hypothesis, we see that MB control in the two-step task is moderately associated with goal-directed behavior in the slips-of-action paradigm, as β MB correlated with the DSI.</s><s>This effect of the DSI seemed mainly driven by responding to still valuable trials, and not by responding to devalued trials.</s><s>An association between MB control and devaluation sensitivity was also partly captured by a moderate, albeit only trendwise significant, correlation between DSI and the balance parameter of the two-step task (ω), which assesses a relative involvement of the MB and MF systems in choice behavior.</s><s>MF control did not seem to be significantly associated with devaluation sensitivity, which could have attenuated the association between the two balance parameters including ω of the two-step task.</s><s>Ergo, we find a very moderate cross-validation between these tasks on the assessment of behavior within the goal-directed system, whereas behavior within habit-like systems did not seem overtly related between the tasks.</s></p><p><s>A moderate correlation between MB learning and goal-directed devaluation sensitivity seems in agreement with a common framework to describe goal-directed behavior, as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Dolan and Dayan (2013)</ref> and would indeed support common definitions of (aspects of) goal-directed behavior between the different task operationalizations.</s><s>Comparably, in a previous construct validity study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">, Friedel et al. (2014)</ref> also found MB and goal-directed behavioral control to be positively correlated between the two-step sequential decision-making task <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2011)</ref> and a selective devaluation paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Valentin et al., 2007)</ref>, respectively.</s><s>Furthermore, MB learning has been positively associated with goal-directed responding within one paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gillan et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>This is in line with the results in the current study, where we associated MB control with devaluation sensitivity between two separate paradigms.</s><s>This suggests that computational accounts of MB control mirror, at least partly, one of the many aspects of (established) goal-directed behavior as measured with a selective devaluation paradigm.</s></p><p><s>However, we do have to caution that the amount of shared variance between both tasks was rather low.</s><s>Moreover, it seems that MB behavior predicts performance on valued trials rather than responses towards devalued items, as it was mainly responding to still valuable trials on the slips-of-action phase that drove the association between devaluation sensitivity and MB behavior.</s><s>Together, this suggests that each task does pick up distinct additional aspects of goal-directed behavior.</s><s>It could be conceivable that the DSI more captures sensitivity to outcome value, whereas the two-step task (additionally) seizes sensitivity to outcome contingency; both part of the definition of goal-directed behavior.</s><s>These distinct aspects of goal-directed behavior may be differently processed in the brain (however, for a study in primates, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Izquierdo et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, considering the association between MB behavior and responses to still valuable items specifically, a part of the variance that is shared between the two constructs in this study might also be driven by performance more in general.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, and in this line, both goal-directed and MB parameters were positively related to higher-order cognitive measures including visual short-term memory.</s><s>Goal-directed behavioral control has been repeatedly shown to rely on higherorder cognitive measures, an effect most pronounced with working-memory capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Eppinger et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Otto et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schad et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Culbreth et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Working memory capacity has even been shown to influence effects of detrimental environmental factors, such as stress on MB control <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Otto et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Although we did not directly measure workingmemory capacity, we did have information on neurocognitive capacities in other cognitive domains.</s><s>An exploratory mediation analysis indicated that short-term memory partly mediated the correlation between goal-directed and MB behavior in the two tasks, indicating that the tendency to be MB/goal-directed in each of the tasks depends on higher-order cognitive capacities, which could be part of the explanation of a moderate overlap between the two constructs.</s></p><p><s>Although negative results should be interpreted carefully, we would like to comment on the complete absence of a significant association between MF learning and habitual behavior in the two tasks, even when including the three participants that were regarded outliers on task behavior.</s><s>We would like to discuss three possible explanations: (1) the assessments of the habitual system in the two tasks are unrelated; (2) habitual responding is the predominant mode of control leading to little variability, and thus correlation between paradigms; and (3) alternatively, the explanation might not lie at the level of construct, but in the (very goal-directed) sample tested.</s><s>We discuss these explanations more in detail below.</s></p><p><s>The first intuitive explanation is that the differently measured aspects of habitual behavior are unrelated, either at the level of the two used paradigms, or more general at the level of construct definition.</s><s>It is possible that the degree of MF control is not directly related to the propensity to form habits, but that the formation of action sequences might explain habitual actions, as suggested before <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dezfouli and Balleine (2013)</ref>.</s><s>Contributing to this might be the distinction between assessing ongoing updating processes during the two-step vs. amount of slips of action as the expression of previously learned S-R associations.</s><s>This might specifically be crucial for the assessment of the habit system.</s><s>The acquisition vs. expression of habitual control is thought to be represented in distinct neural systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Liljeholm et al., 2015</ref>; although integrative views have also been proposed), advancing the belief that behavioral acquisition vs. expression of habits is distinctively assessed.</s><s>The two-step task has changing reward contingencies throughout the task and measures an ongoing (MF) TD learning process without reaching an asymptote, forming MF habit-like behavior by repeating previously rewarded choices without considering the task structure.</s><s>A habit is thought to represent an automatized end-point of learning, while TD learning is, although slowly, still sensitive to changes in the environment.</s><s>Conversely, the slips-of-action task evaluates the degree to which habitual behavior is expressed during an extinction test probing previously deterministically learned S-R associations.</s><s>Therefore, it is possible that expressed behavior during an ongoing (MF) learning process differs from behavior observed during testing of established S-R associations.</s><s>In comparison, the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gillan et al. (2015)</ref> associated MB and MF control within the same task with an instructed devaluation test assessing goal-directed and habitual behavior.</s><s>In line with our findings they found that the degree of MB learning was also associated with devaluation sensitivity after the learning phase.</s><s>MF learning however, was not associated with devaluation sensitivity, comparable to our results.</s></p><p><s>Second, an absent association between the tasks on the assessment of the habitual system might also reflect the robustness of the habitual/MF system, forming a predominant default mode of response <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wood and Rünger, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The variability in the balance between the two decision-making systems might be predominantly driven by variability in the MB system, thus allowing cross-validation between paradigms in the goal-directed system specifically, but not the habit system.</s><s>The ubiquity of the goal-directed system (but not the habit system) has been acknowledged previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Doll et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, it remains to be established how variability vs. stability in both systems constitutes a balance between goal-directed and habitual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Lee et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>A default mode of response from the habit system would explain why an imbalance between the two systems in e.g., addiction seems to be driven by decreased goal-directed behavior as opposed to increased habitual responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sebold et al., 2014)</ref>, although the opposite has also been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gillan and Robbins, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Devaluation insensitivity after overtraining would then result from impaired goal-directed control instead of heightened habit formation.</s><s>Of course, the strongest evidence for the notion that not either one, but a balance between two systems determines outcome devaluation sensitivity, comes from animal research, where a double dissociations is described: animals with lesions to dorsolateral striatum and infralimbic cortex are perpetually goaldirected, even after extensive training, whereas animals with dorsomedial striatal and prelimbic cortical lesions are habitual even after only minimal training <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Yin et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Yin et al., , 2005b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Yin et al., , 2006))</ref>.</s><s>It remains possible that the currently availably human tasks do not offer an adequate translation from the animal paradigms, and that the two tasks under scrutiny may not be optimally tailored to assess the contribution of habits in instrumental behavior.</s><s>Importantly, neither of the paradigms compared in this study assesses full ''end-stage'' habits, which are typically manifest only after extensive overtraining <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Colwill and Rescorla, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dickinson, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dickinson, , 2015))</ref>.</s><s>Training in the current tasks lasts ten to 20 min, specifically the training phase of the instrumental learning task takes 16 encounters of every possible S-R-O association, which is more than the minimally needed amount to establish stable stimulus-based R-O associations, but less than some other studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Tricomi et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It therefore seems likely that these tasks fail to induce full end-stage habits.</s><s>This complicates the discussion of habits for these tasks, and could further explain a lack of commonalities between the MF/habit constructs of the tasks.</s><s>This end-stage phenomenon might not apply to the goal-directed system, as it is by definition more flexible and updated continuously, even after overtraining.</s><s>The question further rises how these tasks under scrutiny relate to other tasks used to measure habit strength or related constructs, such as S-R instrumental learning tasks employing overtraining, skill learning tasks, spatial navigation tasks, the weather prediction task measuring implicit habit-like learning, and many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Knowlton et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b43">Marchette et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Wood and Rünger, 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As a third possibility for the absent association, it should be noted that the currently tested young and highly educated sample shows relatively dominant goal-directed (MB) behavior, which could (further) contribute to the fact that the current study only captures correlations between the tasks on the goal-directed systems.</s><s>The average weighting parameter ω from the two-step task lies around 0.70, which is high compared to previous studies using the two-step task in healthy samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Schad et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Deserno et al., 2015a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Voon et al., 2015a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Morris et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Worbe et al., 2016)</ref> and quantitatively indicates high involvement of the MB system.</s><s>A predominant involvement of the MB system within this highly educated sample could lead to low variability or even a bottom-effect in the habitual system, rendering it harder to capture correlations between the MF/habit systems.</s><s>Indeed, we see lower variability in the MF system than in the MB system, expressed by a lower variance of the β MF parameter (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, and affirmatively, on the slips-of-action phase we see a relatively low percentage of responses to devalued trials (∼15% slips-of-actions), compared with existing literature, where the percentage slips-of-actions in healthy samples on averages lies around ∼30%-50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Delorme et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ersche et al., 2016)</ref>, indicating that in the current sample the habitual mode of control is relatively low in the slips-of-action phase.</s><s>In line with the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gillan et al. (2015)</ref>, this could be directly related to the relatively high involvement of the MB system during learning, as they have shown that MB learning protects against forming habits.</s></p><p><s>A limitation to this study is that due to the correlational associations between the tasks, we cannot elaborate on possible causal relationships between MB/MF learning and the expression of goal-directed/habitual responding during a devaluation test.</s><s>The post hoc mediation analysis we performed did suggest directionality between MB control in the two-step task and devaluation sensitivity in the slips-of-action paradigm.</s><s>This matches the directional association between MB control and devaluation sensitivity as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gillan et al. (2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, in the current study set-up we can only refrain from further elucidations on this directionality.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the current study partly confirms a common framework between assessments of goal-directed and MB behavior, but we do not find such commonalities amongst the MF and habit system.</s><s>However, the evidence is not strong: it should be acknowledged that the effects were only moderate, and the found associations explained only a small part of the shared variance, indicating there are still different aspects of goal-directed/MB behavior being picked up by the two tasks.</s><s>Future studies should further elucidate these aspects, and the role of MF learning in forming habits.</s><s>Moreover, systematic crossvalidation on neural correlates of both instrumental decisionmaking systems is needed to further promote definition and adequate assessment of goal-directed and habitual behavior in healthy and diseased samples.</s></p></div>
