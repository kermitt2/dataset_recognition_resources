<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sec and Cys insertion in native human SelP</head><p><s>Our previous data revealed that TR1 isolated from mouse liver had 10% Cys in place of Sec, even under conditions when mouse diets were supplemented with 0.1 ppm Se <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>To examine Cys insertion into native SelP, we analyzed Sec to Cys replacement in SelP isolated from human donor plasma (S1 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Here, Sec and Cys could be quantified at Sec positions two, three, four and five (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, Cys insertion was unequal among Sec positions.</s><s>Depending on position, up to 8% Sec residues were replaced with Cys, with an average of 4.1% Cys in place of Sec.</s><s>Thus, Cys is present naturally in SelP under common dietary conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Sec insertion at UGA codons is known to be at competition with termination of protein synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>However, the levels of full-length selenoproteins are often viewed as being equivalent with their selenium content.</s><s>Although quantification of Se content in selenoproteins pointed out that it is lower than one atom per Sec site per selenoprotein, it has been assumed that a fraction of Se is lost from selenoproteins under physiological conditions or during protein preparation.</s><s>However, we recently showed that Cys can be inserted into TR1 and that up to 10% Sec sites are occupied by Cys in this selenoprotein in mice fed common rodent chow containing normal amounts of dietary selenium <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A key finding of the present study is that SelP also contains Cys in place of Sec.</s><s>This is particularly relevant since SelP is a protein that largely regulates organismal Se homeostasis.</s><s>This selenoprotein of exceptional significance has emerged as a biomarker of Se status based on both animal and human studies.</s><s>SelP has also been suggested to be a biomarker for prostate cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies revealed the Se content of only 7.5 +/-1.0 atoms/SelP polypeptide that contains 10 predicted Sec sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, consistent with the idea that at least some of the previous discrepancy between the predicted and observed Se content of the protein may be explained by Cys insertion at the Sec sites.</s></p><p><s>Depending on the location of Sec within SelP, up to 8% of Sec sites were occupied by Cys in the selenoprotein isolated from plasma of five healthy donors (S1 Fig), with the average of 4% Cys across Sec positions.</s><s>Spectral counts were sufficient to quantify only 4 sites in SelP.</s><s>Thus, these numbers represent approximate Cys content of Sec at specific sites.</s><s>We further found that this Sec/Cys ratio can both decrease and increase depending on the availability of Se and the selenophosphate antagonist, thiophosphate, because treatment of HepG2 hepatocytes with thiophosphate completely reversed the ratio such that only Cys was detected at certain Sec positions.</s><s>This is also consistent with the previously observed regulation of Cys insertion at the Sec site in TR1.</s><s>The cell culture conditions used in the current study represent the proof of principle with regard to Cys insertion at Sec positions in SelP, but do not correspond to physiological conditions, especially when high levels of thiophosphate were used.</s><s>However, these studies provide a foundation for further analyses of Cys and Sec in SelP isolated from human subjects.</s></p><p><s>The finding of Cys at Sec positions in a key regulator of organismal Se homeostasis is noteworthy, as Se status may be influenced by dietary status, disease, age and other factors.</s><s>Thus, Se availability may be affected, not only at the levels of SelP, but also at the level of Sec insertion into this protein.</s><s>This effect will be most pronounced under conditions of Se deficiency, when the percent of Cys insertion into SelP is higher.</s><s>It appears that, depending on the abundance of the non-Sec fraction, the levels of Se provided by SelP may be significantly overestimated in nutrition research.</s><s>This raises issues with regard to the analysis and use of SelP as a marker Se status in human populations.</s><s>Quantitative assessment of the degree of Sec replacement with Cys in human subjects differing in genotype, diet, disease status, sex and age would be informative for further application of this major Se biomarker.</s></p></div>
