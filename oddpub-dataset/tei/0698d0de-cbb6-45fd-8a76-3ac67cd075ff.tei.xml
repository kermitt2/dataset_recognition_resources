several biologically relevant pathways are affected in the investigated glioblastoma cohort, and in many patients at least one potential treatment biomarker was identified.</s><s>Since targeted approaches are under consideration for clinical trials in glioblastoma, molecular profiling at diagnosis can serve as a basis for allocation of patients to biomarker-driven clinical trials.</s></p><p><s>One example is the upcoming N 2 M 2 clinical trial that includes patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter and allocates these patients according to their molecular profile to

2 M 2 provides a useful structure to test the translation of molecular diagnostics into clinical decisions as well as safety and efficacy evaluations.</s><s>One problem is the allocation of patients with tumors harboring 2 or more potentially druggable targets to the best specific treatment.</s><s>Since combined treatments often result in severe side effects and cannot be analyzed in clinical trials due to their complexity, we developed a prioritization algorithm based on clinical and preclinical evidence in glioblastoma and other cancer indications.</s><s>The algorithm yields the most

patients with such large numbers of genetic alterations related to a single event should be excluded from study entry.</s><s>However, genomic instability may also drive senescence and may enhance dependence on growth-promoting pathways, therefore we plan not to exclude such patients, but to specifically follow up on the disease course.</s></p><p><s>Certainly, inter-as well as intratumoral heterogeneity remain an extreme challenge for the design of biomarkerdriven clinical trials, and the full spectrum is not addressed in this study.</s><s>Several examples are presented which suggest that parallel, complementary analyses from different tumor pieces may be a rational strategy.</s><s>Future studies will also have to take into account that biomarkers might be unevenly distributed both spatially and temporally within one and between different tumors, which is an important consideration for maximizing the predictive value of biomarkers.</s></p><p><s>A further practical problem is the low frequency of some of the alterations.</s><s>N 2 M 2 will assess each subtrial individually and only use the temozolomide subtrial as a contemporary reassurance for the validity of the assumptions of progression-free survival.</s><s>As a next step, randomized, controlled trials will be performed for successful arms with high-frequency molecular lesions like the CDK4/6 amplification (CDKN2A loss) or the mTOR Ser-2448 phosphorylation or for yet-to-be-discovered parameters for the APG101 or atezolizumab subtrials.</s><s>The lesions with lower frequency will need more time for accrual, a preselection, or different efficacy assessments like objective response rates.</s></p><p><s>In summary, with this feasibility study, we present a comprehensive molecular profiling approach for glioblastoma without MGMT promoter hypermethylation, which can be applied at diagnosis in a clinically relevant timeframe.</s><s>Knowing the molecular characteristics of the individual tumor
