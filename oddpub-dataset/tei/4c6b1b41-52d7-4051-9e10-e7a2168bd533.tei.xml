<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of the personality trait alexithymia with implicit and explicit positive and negative affectivity in healthy adults.</s><s>We applied an indirect (IPANAT) and direct tests (PANAS, BDI-II and STAI) to assess implicit and explicit affectivity in a sample of young adults and conducted correlation analyses for all alexithymia components of the TAS-20.</s><s>As hypothesized, the participants of our study reported much more positive state and trait affect than negative state and trait affect.</s><s>This is not surprising but confirms the observation that there is a clear preponderance of positive affect in healthy people <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Diener and Diener, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Zelenski and Larsen, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, a prevalence of positive affect was also observed at an implicit affect level: our study participants were characterized by higher implicit positive than implicit negative affect scores.</s><s>As could be expected, implicit positive affect showed a small to medium correlation with explicit positive trait affect in our sample.</s></p><p><s>Contrary to our hypothesis, none of the alexithymia components was negatively correlated with positive affect.</s><s>We found no correlations between the different facets of alexithymia and implicit or explicit (state and trait) positive affect.</s><s>Thus, our findings contrast with those of previous research based on a student sample <ref type="bibr">(Swinkels and Giuliano, 1995, study 3)</ref> or an outpatient sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(de Gucht et al., 2004)</ref> but are similar to those of other studies based primarily on samples of the general population suggesting no <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Palmer et al., 2002)</ref> or only a negative correlation of difficulties identifying feelings and positive affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Henry et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The small correlation between externally oriented thinking and explicit positive state affect (r = −0.12)</s><s>was the highest observed in the present sample between alexithymia components and positive affect scales.</s><s>According to our findings, there is no substantial relationship between the facets of alexithymia as assessed by the TAS-20 and the actual or habitual experience of positive affect.</s><s>It is possible that individuals with clinically relevant degrees of alexithymia might manifest tendencies to experience less positive affects and might thus appear anhedonic.</s><s>However, our null findings challenge the idea that alexithymic features go along with a reduced experience of positive affect, at least in healthy and educated young adults.</s></p><p><s>The present results confirm our hypothesis that the alexithymia components difficulties identifying feelings and difficulties describing feelings are positively associated with negative affect.</s><s>We observed significant positive correlations of difficulties identifying feelings with explicit negative trait affect (PANAS), depressive mood and trait anxiety.</s><s>The alexithymia component difficulties describing feelings was not found to be significantly correlated with explicit negative state and trait affect as assessed by the PANAS but correlated positively with depressive mood and trait anxiety.</s><s>However, when controlling for difficulties identifying feelings difficulties describing feelings was not any more significantly related to depressive mood and trait anxiety.</s><s>According to our findings, the alexithymia component difficulties identifying feelings is more strongly associated with negative affect than difficulties describing feelings which is consistent with results from other studies administering the PANAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Swinkels and Giuliano, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Palmer et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">de Gucht et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Our data are also in line with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berthoz et al., 1999)</ref> indicating stronger relations of difficulties identifying feelings with depression and trait anxiety compared to those of difficulties describing feelings.</s><s>In clear contrast to difficulties identifying feelings, externally oriented thinking was not related to any of the negative affectivity measures administered in our study which is consistent with the results of previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hendryx et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Swinkels and Giuliano, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berthoz et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Palmer et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">de Gucht et al., 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An important focus of the present investigation was to examine for the first time implicit affectivity as a function of alexithymia.</s><s>According to our data, none of the alexithymia components of the TAS-20 was related to implicit positive or implicit negative affect.</s><s>Thus, administering an indirect measure of affectivity we found no evidence for correlations between alexithymia facets and implicit affect.</s><s>Implicit affect is thought to be related to processes of the impulsive system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Quirin et al., 2009a)</ref>.</s><s>It has been found to predict endocrine stress reactions in everyday life as well as cardiovascular and endocrine responses to acute stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Quirin et al., 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mossink et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">van der Ploeg et al., 2016)</ref> as well as brain activation to subtle threat stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Suslow et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that for externally oriented thinking and difficulties describing feelings non-correlations with positive and negative affectivity could be observed for the indirect (IPANAT) as well as the direct measure (PANAS).</s><s>Based on our data it can be concluded that in healthy and educated adults the alexithymia facet externally oriented thinking is independent from dispositions to develop positive or negative affects.</s></p><p><s>Difficulties identifying feelings was also not correlated with implicit or explicit positive affect in our sample but it showed substantial correlations with explicit negative trait affect (and depression and trait anxiety) but not with implicit negative affect.</s><s>Thus, it can be concluded that difficulties identifying feelings seem to be associated with an increased conscious experience of negative affects but not with a heightened disposition to develop negative affects at an automatic response level.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lumley (2000)</ref> proposed an explanation for the overlap of difficulties identifying feelings and depression suggesting that negative affect could promote critical perceptions of the self thereby increasing the probability that individuals report that they are poor at detecting their emotions.</s><s>As has been pointed out above, implicit affectivity has been found to predict psychophysiological response to stressors and threat <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Quirin et al., 2009b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mossink et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Suslow et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>It is interesting to note in this context that research on the psychophysiological responsivity to stressors or aversive stimuli in alexithymia has not produced clear results.</s><s>Previous research has found hyper-responsivity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Martin and Pihl, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Infrasca, 1997)</ref>, hyporesponsivity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Linden et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pollatos et al., 2008)</ref> or non-significant changes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Friedlander et al., 1997)</ref> in physiological parameters in response to stressors in alexithymic compared to nonalexithymic individuals.</s><s>Thus, all in all there appears not to exist a robust (positive) relationship between alexithymia and spontaneous physiological reactivity to stressors or aversive stimuli.</s></p><p><s>The constellation of high explicit negative affect and normal implicit negative affect in individuals with difficulties identifying feelings could alternately be explained by deficits in down-regulating negative affective experiences.</s><s>This means, even though these individuals are characterized by a normal (not heightened) disposition to develop negative affects at an automatic response level they could have problems in controlling negative affects and therefore consciously experience and report these affects for a longer time.</s><s>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Lumley (2000)</ref>, in persons with difficulties in identifying feelings because of their limited ability to regulate and resolve negative affects negative affectivity remains unmodulated yielding a chronic, undifferentiated dysphoria (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Taylor et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The exclusive use of a self-report measure to assess alexithymia could be criticized as a limitation of our study.</s><s>Concerns have been raised that individuals with impaired affect awareness can accurately rate themselves on this lack of awareness on a selfreport scale (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lane et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, it is conceivable that high alexithymic individuals get negative feedback from the social environment about their deficits in perceiving, feeling and communicating emotions, and their superficial ways of thinking and talking.</s><s>For example, the TAS-20 item "People tell me to describe my feelings more" which assesses difficulties describing feelings refers to a critical comment or request of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bagby et al., 1994a)</ref>.</s><s>Against this background, alexithymic individuals might become aware of and be able to report on their own inabilities due to the integration of interpersonal feedback into their self-concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Günther et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, findings from recent studies on deficits in affect perception in alexithymia in which self-report and objective measures were administered indicate that self-reported alexithymia (i.e., TAS-20) could be a better predictor of affect recognition performance than observer-rated alexithymia <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ihme et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brandt et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To sum up, the data of the present investigation suggest that when examining the relationship between alexithymia and affectivity one should not focus on total or summary scores but should take into consideration the different facets of alexithymia and administer direct as well as indirect measures of affectivity.</s><s>Alexithymic characteristics and experience of affects appear to be largely independent of each other.</s><s>In our study, alexithymia components were found to be differentially related to explicit negative affect but not associated with explicit positive affect or implicit affectivity.</s><s>Based on our findings, it can be concluded that in healthy young adults an externally oriented, concrete way of thinking is unrelated to dispositions for positive or negative affects.</s><s>Instead, difficulties identifying feelings appear to be associated with an increased conscious experience of negative affects but not with a heightened disposition for negative affects at an automatic response level.</s><s>Clearly, the generalizability of our findings is limited, as we recruited primarily female university students as participants.</s><s>Therefore, it is necessary that future research on this topic includes also samples of men, elderly people and individuals with less education.</s><s>It appears promising to administer the IPANAT in psycho-physiological research on affective responsivity in alexithymia along with direct measures of affectivity.</s><s>Longitudinal experiments examining the recovery from (implicit and explicit) negative affects over time as a function of alexithymia components could give more detailed insights into the emotion regulation deficits associated with difficulties identifying feelings.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>TABLE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Product moment
