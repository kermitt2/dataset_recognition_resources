however, staining of the hyaloid artery and its branches was observed in retinal flat mounts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Sparse staining for netrin-4 in the larger vessels of the retinal vasculature was found beginning at P10 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>There was a notable regression of the hyaloid artery from P10 to P17.</s><s>While the peripheral retina was already fully vascularized at P10, there was netrin-4 staining initially only in large vessels.</s><s>At P17, netrin-4 staining was visible throughout the retinal vasculature up to the capillary level; staining in superficial layers of the arterial side in the vascular tree was prominent, but absent from deeper layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>At P21 Netrin-4 expression was also present in the deep capillaries and the ocular basement membranes, including Bruch´s membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>These observations indicate netrin-4 expression is associated with the maturation of postnatal blood vessels and is preferentially concentrated in the arterial and micro vessel basement membranes during vessel development.</s><s>In the adult retina, netrin-4 expression was more evident on arterioles than on veins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, insert and Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Identification of retinal arteries and veins was done morphologically as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Effect of netrin-4 on the postnatal development of the retinal vasculature in Ntn-4 −/− mice.</s><s>The differential netrin-4 expression might indicate a minor role of netrin-4 in the early formation of blood vessels which is in accordance with Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , who suggested that netrin-4 plays a very minor role in normal eye development.</s><s>Thus, we investigated the effect of netrin-4 deficiency on retinal vasculature and studied the formation of retinal blood vessels in netrin-4 deficient mice (Ntn-4 −/− ) at various time points of postnatal development (P6-P21), again using immunostaining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, right panel).</s><s>Lack of netrin-4 staining of Ntn-4 −/− retinal flat mounts at P6 and in adult mice confirmed the absence of netrin-4 in this mouse line (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The retinal vasculature remained largely unaltered exhibiting, as in WT mice, incomplete vascularization at P6 (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and fully vascularized retinas from P10 on.</s><s>Branching of the vessels as well as capillary formation appeared as in the wild type (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, right panel).</s></p><p><s>In both mice genotypes, co-staining of neovascular tufts (Isolectin-IB 4 ) and pericytes (NG2) revealed a normal pericyte distribution in the retinal vessels during physiological conditions.</s><s>We detected a pronounced pericyte staining in the neovascular tufts (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Significant differences between the two genotypes were not detected.</s><s>Moreover, partial co-staining of isolectin IB 4 and laminin γ 3 in the WT also showed only limited association between laminin γ 3 and the pathological vessels (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Thus we confirmed that netrin-4 is not required for physiological development of retinal blood vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Faster recovery from OIR vascular damage in Ntn4 −/− mice.</s><s>The developmental sequence of netrin-4 expression and its restricted spatial expression suggests that it might play a role in the stabilisation of mature blood vessels and perhaps vascular remodelling.</s><s>Therefore, we undertook an analysis of the role of netrin-4 in pathological blood vessel formation using an oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Retina flat-mounts at P10, P14 and P17 demonstrated a similar time course of netrin-4 expression as at normoxia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition, immunostaining revealed netrin-4 expression in the large tortuous retinal vessels on P14 and P17 with prominent staining of the areas of retinal neovascularization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Especially the neovascular tufts exhibit a prominent co-staining of netrin-4 and Isolectin-IB 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, insert) at a time point when at normoxia only the superficial capillaries are stained.</s><s>Compared to wild-type mice, Ntn4 −/− mice exhibited similar neovascular tufts at P17 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, lower row).</s><s>By P28, the pathological tufts and vascularization vanished both in WT as well as in Ntn-4 −/− mice.</s></p><p><s>As an indicator of blood vessel development, the size of the avascular zone was measured in retina flat-mount preparations.</s><s>The avascular zone in P10 WT was significantly smaller compared to that in Ntn-4 −/− mice (30.9% ± 1.2%;

p = 0.926), but at later time points was significantly reduced in size in Ntn-4 −/− mice: At P14 the mean avascular zone in the WT was 26.5% ± 1.8% (N = 6) compared to 17.4% ± 1% (N = 3) in Ntn-4 −/− mice (p = 0.013).</s><s>At P17 the mean avascular zone in WT animals measured 18.8% ± 1.3% (N = 17) of total retina surface area compared to 14.6% ± 0.8% (N = 22) in Ntn-4 −/− mice (p = 0.009) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Thus in the absence of netrin-4, closure of the avascular area by new vessels is accelerated.</s></p><p><s>Since in the Ntn-4 −/− mice this occurred faster, we also analysed the neovascular tufts in more detail.</s><s>Neovascular retinal tufts were identified as hyper fluorescent irregular formed vessels at P17 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>) as indicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Some neovascular vessels in Ntn-4 −/− mice appear as large branched pathological vessels compared to the more circumscribed neovascular tufts in WT and showed a tendency to be more reduced in Ntn-4 −/− mice compared to WT;

anti-angiogenic and enriched in adult blood vessel basal lamina to maintain blood vessel stability.</s></p><p><s>During postnatal development of the WT retina, netrin-4 and netrin receptors are differentially expressed depending on the developmental status of the vasculature.</s><s>Close to the time-point of blood vessel maturation, netrin-4 staining was found throughout the retinal vasculature up to the capillary level, but was more prominent in superficial layers of the arterial side in the vascular tree, albeit not in the deeper layers.</s><s>These findings on a protein level are in line with the progression of netrin-4 mRNA-expression during vessel development.</s><s>A constant netrin-4 mRNA levels are found at the late phase of retinal vessel formation (P14-P21).</s><s>In accordance, analysis of retinal vascularization in netrin-4 deficient mice revealed that vessels and capillaries developed normally.</s><s>Thus, netrin-4 expression is not associated with the early stages of postnatal blood vessel development, but instead with the termination of their development and is likely to be involved in stabilizing mature blood vessels.</s><s>This implies, however, that there is no active role for netrin-4 in normal vascular development but is involved with neovascular events as predicted by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Analysis of potential netrin-4 receptors also revealed a possible functional correlation with a role in stabilisation.</s><s>Although it is not fully established that netrin-4 binds to the known receptors of the netrin family (e.g.</s><s>Unc5H2 and DCC), data obtained here suggest that retinal glial cells, Müller cells and astrocytes, express these proteins indicating that netrin-4 plays a role in mediating interactions between the vascular and the neuronal system, as is assumed for the other members of the netrin protein family.</s><s>This result is a good starting point for further exploring neurovascular coupling in Ntn-4 −/− retina undergoing vascular pathogenesis scenarios.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, to the minor role during retinal development, netrin-4 expression may, however, have a major impact on pathological blood vessel formation.</s><s>The role of netrin-4 in hypoxia-driven pathologic neovascularization in the OIR model was investigated in Ntn-4 −/− and WT mice.</s><s>After OIR the avascular zone was more rapidly closed in Ntn-4 −/− mice as compared to WT.</s><s>Moreover, in this sequel, the Ntn-4 −/− retina showed faster functional recovery after OIR.</s><s>At P17 rod function was similar in Ntn-4 −/− and WT.</s><s>On the other hand, Ntn-4 −/− mice displayed reduced functionality of bipolar and Müller cells at this time point.</s><s>In contrast, at P28 Ntn-4 −/− mice displayed higher rod activity and comparable bipolar and Müller function to WT.</s><s>However, the faster functional recovery in knock-out mice may not be solely due to vascular normalization.</s><s>Directly improving neuronal cells functions cannot be ruled out, although it is difficult to separate them due to the intensive interaction between the nerve system and the vascular system.</s></p><p><s>Thus, absence of netrin-4 accelerates the hypoxia-driven blood vessel regression during the time of oxygen exposure but also the recovery from OIR, indicating netrin-4 is an anti-angiogenic factor.</s><s>The latter conclusion was supported by analysing of time-dependent netrin-4 expression in OIR.</s><s>After oxygen exposure, an increase in netrin-4 expression was observed at the mRNA at P17, as compared to controls.</s><s>Since P17 in OIR is the period of highest pathological angiogenic activity, up-regulation of netrin-4 is likely one of the prerequisites for maturing vessels and thus normalisation of angiogenesis.</s><s>Therefore, in the Ntn-4 −/− mice the complete absence of netrin-4 permits the faster recovery of the avascular area after OIR by allowing the faster sprouting of new and outgrowth of immature vessels, because maturation is delayed in this genotype.</s></p><p><s>The increased vessel loss in Ntn-4 −/− mice at P10 may suggest that netrin-4 has an anti-apoptotic function.</s><s>To date, only for netrin-1 in combination with its receptor UNC5B there is an anti-apoptotic function described <ref

would be an interesting topic for a further analysis of its function in the eye.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of time-dependent VEGF-A expression in Ntn-4 −/− further supports the idea that netrin-4 expression plays a role in establishing an anti-angiogenic environment.</s><s>During physiological postnatal development, expression of both netrin-4 and VEGF-A is constant from P14 to P21.</s><s>As

oxygen challenge, the expression dynamics of netrin-4 and VEGF-A are quite similar.</s><s>VEGF-A expression peaks at a time point (P14) when netrin-4 expression is also high.</s><s>Thus, in OIR both VEGF-A and netrin-4 show a high and balanced expression to help normalizing angiogenesis.</s><s>Netrin-4 may have a specific anti-angiogenic function as Netrin-1 does not show any compensatory regulation in Ntn4 −/− mice.</s></p><p><s>Netrin-4 is required for maintenance of mature blood vessels and its expression needs to be balanced with the expression of VEGF in physiological as well as pathological angiogenesis.</s></p><p><s>Actually, in Ntn-4 −/− retinas, the pathological vessels at P17 showed partly a different morphology than the WT.</s><s>In Ntn-4 −/− , some neovascular vessels appear as large branched pathological vessels compared to the more circumscribed neovascular tufts in WT, with decreased cell numbers but with similar tuft area; highlighting a possible altered proliferation activity of endothelial cells during angiogenesis when netrin-4 is absent but VEGF-A level is still high.</s><s>The similar pericyte distribution in neovascular tufts of WT and Ntn-4 −/− indicates no direct influence of Netrin-4 on the interaction of pericyte and endothelial cells.</s></p><p><s>As discussed above, netrin-4 plays a role in physiological vascular stability and in the recovery of pathologic neovascularization after hyperoxic challenge.</s><s>In order to analyse whether netrin-4 has a more general role in the regulation of neo-angiogenesis, we employed another model for neovascularization, the laser-induced CNV in both WT and Ntn-4 −/− mice.</s><s>The finding that the leakage area and the integrated leakage density of Ntn-4 −/− mice was significantly increased (as compared to WT mice) only two weeks after photocoagulation but with no associated differences in the laser area, indicates a minor role for netrin-4 in laser-induced choroidal neovascularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , a model in which neovascularization is strongly driven by inflammation rather than hypoxia.</s></p><p><s>The temporal and spatial expression pattern of netrin-4 and its receptors in relation to VEGF-A expression together with the faster recovery after oxygen challenge in Ntn-4 −/− mice allow us to postulate a model of netrin-4 action in the retina.</s><s>Results from the OIR model, in accordance with previous work in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , suggest expression of netrin-4 is regulated by changes in oxygen tension.</s><s>Furthermore, we suggested both Müller cells and astrocytes as sites of DCC and Unc5H2 expression, which would enable interaction with netrin-4 positive basement membranes.</s><s>Again, although the cognate receptors for netrin-1 are not yet established as receptors for netrin-4, their expression in Müller cells and astrocytes and perhaps retinal neurons, propose they have an interacting role in retinal angiogenesis.</s><s>We postulate that smooth muscle and endothelial cells are the major source for netrin-4, as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Taken these key observations together, we think that these cells enrich the basal membranes with netrin-4 to stabilise the mature vessels at the end of their development.</s></p><p><s>The
