<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-ROSC rSO 2</head><p><s>The very low regional frontal brain oxygen saturation observed in our study is in line with previous reports.</s><s>For example, in an early report with NIRS during CPR, Newman and coworkers found no detectable cerebral oxygen saturation during CPR in all of sixteen subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Parnia and coworkers also found very low initial rSO 2 (15-21 %) determined by NIRS during CPR in 15 cardiac arrest patients.</s><s>Increasing rSO 2 with ongoing CPR was observed which was associated with ROSC in their study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In another trial, Parnia and coworkers demonstrated low rSO 2 during manual chest compression (median rSO 2 24 %) and significantly higher values in patients treated with an automated chest compression device (median rSO 2 53 %) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Schewe and coworkers reported similar results <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Kämäräinen also demonstrated very low rSO 2 during manual CPR which did not substantially increase by improving manual CPR technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In line with our results, Genbrugge et al. reported no significant difference between initial 2 in patients achieving ROSC compared to those who did not when NIRS was started during CPR on scene <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, these studies consistently show a very low cerebral oxygen saturation as measured by commercially available NIRS monitors during cardiac arrest and CPR.</s><s>Clearly, brain hypoxia during CPR causes severe hypoxic encephalopathy in many patients.</s><s>However, when interpreting rSO 2 measurements during CPR it needs to be kept in mind that compared to the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen in an awake state the brain needs much less oxygen to simply maintain cell viability.</s><s>Furthermore, regional brain rSO 2 does not directly inform on the amount of oxygen delivered to the brain and thus low rSO 2 obtained at a single time point cannot predict the extent of hypoxic encephalopathy.</s><s>It may be, however, that integrating information on duration and extent of hypoxia measured by NIRS may allow for a largely reliable prediction of outcome and may be used in the future among other parameters in the decision to continue or stop resucitation efforts.</s></p></div>
