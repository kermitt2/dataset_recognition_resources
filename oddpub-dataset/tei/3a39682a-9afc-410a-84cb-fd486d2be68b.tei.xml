target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>According to the reports, about 6% (4 million, 562 thousand) of the total population of Iran includes the elderly over 60 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>It is predicted that by 2050, this rate will reach to 25 million, 912 thousand people which is equivalent to 24.62% of the total population of the country <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Statistics indicate that the proportion of elderly women is significantly higher than elderly men in most developed and developing countries.</s><s>In Iran, the population of elderly women has been increased and it is predicted to increase over the next decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>One of the consequences of the elderly population in many countries is the problems caused by chronic diseases and the burden of inability on health and social systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>, consequences which, can be reduced through self-care programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>A broad look at the situation of elderly women in various aspects including physical, psychological, familial, and social health reveals that despite the efforts and advances in health, social and economic status, there are differences in social and demographic health indicators of Iranian elderly women than elderly men that could be due to the unequal health and social status of women and men, including the prevalence of heart disease and hypertension, drug consumption, and literacy rate, which is lower in older women than older men.</s><s>Also, the rate of being admitted to a nursing home is lower in older men than older women (4).</s><s>Self-care is one of the important aspects of healthy lifestyle.</s><s>People with a high degree of self-care pay attention to their health care, and try to be less patient and if they become patient, they try to regain their health as soon as possible.</s><s>Self-care improves quality of life and reduces the cost.</s><s>Continuous follow-up of self-care can prevent acute and chronic complications of disease or delay its onset <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Inadequate health literacy is a potential barrier that prevents from obtaining health-related information and skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Health literacy is the result of a collaboration of social and individual factors which pays to the aspects and concerns of literacy in the field of health.</s><s>Today, health literacy is known as a critical and important indicator in the results and the cost of health care, and the lack of its improvement causes an increased mortality rate and increased hospitalization and use of health services in the elderly, and imposes huge sums annually on the public health system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Health customers encountered with many challenges, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, need to participate in their care, and increase the available data from multiple and different sources.</s><s>People should be able to accept the new role for seeking information, advocating for rights and privacy issues, understanding the responsibilities, measuring and monitoring health, and choosing the type of their care <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>Inadequate health literacy among the elderly is a global problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>In a national survey, it was revealed that about 70% of adults in North American have no health literacy skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>In a study by Chen et al. it was shown that health literacy has a positive impact on the use of preventive care <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>Tiller et al. in their study, found that women had a lower level of health literacy than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Geboers et al.</ref> showed that a low level of health literacy was associated with reduced self-management abilities in the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>In a study it was shown that people who had a low level of health literacy on adherence to self-care behaviors were unsuccessful and had twice the risk of hospitalization compared to other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Another study indicated that healthy behavior is not suitable in elderly in Iran (3).</s><s>Among the determinants of health, self-care behavior is the most important way to prevent chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>The elderly are faced with a shortage of basic needs for health <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>A systematic review study highlighted that health literacy is evaluated according to demographics factors, health outcomes, treatment adherence, mortality and cognitive health <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Despite growing interest among health professionals for promoting health literacy among the population in Iran <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and other countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, information on health literacy and its relationship with other factors is low especially in the elderly, who are a vulnerable group <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>The results of one study in three states (Massachusetts, Boston and Chicago) in the US showed that literacy could increase self-care behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>According to the World Health Organization, a high percentage of health services use is related to the elderly compared to the total population <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Results indicate that the elderly population in the world is increasing so that, according to the World Health Organization between 2015 and 2050, elderly population worldwide almost doubled from 12% to 22%.</s><s>In 2050, 80%

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>This study demonstrated that health literacy is low in Iranian elderly women, and a high percentage of people have inadequate health literacy, which is an important problem among this group for health promotion.</s><s>In the study of Reisi et al., similarly, it reported functional health literacy in the elderly.</s><s>In their study, most of the elderly had inadequate health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>In the study of Slonska et al., more than half of older people in Poland had low health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, and in the study of Smith et al., about half of the elderly had borderline and inadequate health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, which is consistent with the findings of the present study.</s><s>In this study, age, education, and health information seeking were directly correlated with health literacy.</s><s>These results have also been reported in other studies in which the incidence of inadequate health literacy were more frequent in older people with less education.</s><s>In a study of Chin et al, findings showed health literacy is related to the recall of health information and knowledge modifies the effect of the processing capacity limitation, which is likely to be related to the call for information and supports understanding of health information among elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s><s>With increasing age, cognitive and perceptual problems increase, which is a major obstacle in gaining information and health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, health literacy was related to self-care behaviors adoption, and was the most effective predictor of self-care behaviors in the elderly women.</s><s>In other studies also, health literacy was an important factor on self-care behaviors and adherence to healthrelated behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, health risk behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, and adherence to treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, which is consistent with the findings of the present study.</s><s>Health literacy increases self-efficacy and use of preventive care in the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The study of Park reported that age and health status, and chronic diseases and basic literacy predicted 33% of the variance of elderly health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>The difference observed in the findings of their study and the present study may be due to the use of different tools to measure health literacy that is used with different numbers of questions and dimensions or more independent variables which have entered to the regression equation.</s><s>Other studies have indicated that people with adequate health literacy had higher frequency of self-care behaviors, compliance in treatment and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, health information seeking was of the other important variables predicting self-care behavior in elderly women.</s><s>Studies have shown that people who had low health literacy and searched health information, had better health status than those who did not use health information resources.</s><s>Those who actively seek health information are more active participants in their own health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>In a study of Kim et al., functional health literacy had positive impact on intention of searching for health information and health information resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Nasrabadi and colleagues, in a qualitative study, stated that inadequate health literacy is one of the barriers for health information seeking in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>People with inadequate health literacy are less likely to seek health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>There is a mutual relationship between health problems and health information seeking.</s><s>Demographic factors such as higher education level and higher income are related to health literacy and the frequency of health information seeking.</s><s>Also, female gender, aging, adopting healthy behaviors such as not smoking, and regular physical activity are associated with health information seeking <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, there was an inverse correlation between age and health information seeking, and more participants obtained their health information through physicians and other health professionals, and then through television, print resources, and a small number of them sought health information through Internet and mobile phone.</s><s>These findings suggest that those who have most need for health information, had the least use of health resources and information.</s></p><p><s>For the elderly population, there is need to adopt efficient strategies to develop their skills to use these resources and improve the communication of health professionals with patients, and designing and delivering the messages.</s><s>Attention to the special needs of the elderly are important for improving the health status and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Gavgani in his study showed that most Iranian people receive their health information from television <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>The results of this study are different from the results of the present study, which may be due to having no similar demographic variables such as age in the studied groups.</s><s>In the study of Jamal et al., most participants reported that their main source of health information was through a physician and then, television, family, newspapers, and Internet, respectively, and the health-related information seekers were better in doing self-care behaviors such as regular testing of blood sugar, appropriate action to control blood sugar, and the adoption of non-pharmacological management <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, which is consistent with the findings of this study.</s><s>In the study performed by Wang et al., the elderly, compared with younger people, used less Internet to search for information <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>Levy et al. also reported that only 7% of American elderly who had low health literacy have used the Internet for obtaining health information <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s><s>In the study of Lubetkin et al., the participants with lower health literacy receive health-related information from their family and friends and religious leaders <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>These results demonstrate the importance of designing interventions appropriate to culture in order to promote health, according to understanding how to receive and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Limitation of the Study</head><p><s>Our study had some limitations; first, the data related to the section of demographic characteristics and doing selfcare behaviors was self-report, of course, there was an effort to adapt as much as possible with the existing data in the file of the elderly in health care centers.</s><s>Also, the findings can not be generalized to other age groups and men.</s><s>This study did not evaluate all dimensions of health literacy as communication and critical health literacy.</s><s>In this study, the direct impact of health literacy, demographic variables and information seeking about heath on self-care behaviors was determined.</s><s>It is recommended that in future studies with statistical methods of structural equation, the direct and indirect effects between the variables of health literacy and information seeking about health and other factors affecting self-care behaviors and health outcomes in the elderly be evaluated.</s><s>This study has some strengths, including a large population with a wide randomly distribution that minimizes the presence of bias.</s><s>The factors other than health literacy, which were effective on self-care behaviors of elderly were studied, which provides a good insight to consider other factors in designing, implementation and evaluation of interventions to health promotion of elderly women.</s></p></div>
