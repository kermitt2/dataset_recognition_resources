the oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group can then produce FDCA via 5-formyl-2-furancaboxylic acid (FFCA) intermediate formation.</s><s>Moreover, the formation of 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) can also be observed, mainly in the absence of an added base and with metals other than Au <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Some HMF derivatives characterised by diols or diacid double functionalities are used in the polymer industry for bio polyester production <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>As an example, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), produced from HMF oxidation, is one of the most promising intermediates for the production of poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF), the furan-based analogue to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which is the dominant polymer in beverage packaging industries.</s><s>Recent results have demonstrated that poly(ethylene furanoate), when manufactured with bio-sourced ethylene glycol, provides a 100% renewable polymer with an enhanced oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability compared to PET, despite the fact that an increase in CO2 solubility is observed for PEF polymer <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the chain mobility, reduced due to the suppression of the furan ring-flipping-because of an increased furan ring hindrance, which is characteristic for the bio-based polymer-affects the overall CO2 transportation properties.</s><s>A decrease of the oxygen permeability and higher glass transition temperature are present in PEF with respect to its terephtalic acid counterpart <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, recent studies on the enzymatic hydrolysis of PEF powder highlighted the possibility of both surface functionalization and the polymer recycling process, thus opening up the prospects for a highervalue application of this material <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Today many companies are very interested in developing processes for production of FDCA to be used as a monomer for polyester, polyamide, and polyurethane synthesis.</s><s>As a result, several patents have been recently published on this subject;
