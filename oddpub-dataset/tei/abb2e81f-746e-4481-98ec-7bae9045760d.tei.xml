<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study shows for the first time that EGCG is most likely not involved in tea-induced improvement of endothelial function in humans.</s><s>Although EGCG plasma levels were highest after intake of EGCG and lowest after consumption of green tea, only green tea improved FMD.</s><s>It has been consistently demonstrated that green tea improves endothelial function in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>The results of our study confirmed these findings.</s><s>Although not statistically significant, a minor effect on FMD was also observed for GTE in our study.</s><s>Green tea and EGCG stimulated NO production in endothelial cells by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and induced vasodilation in aortic rings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>However, the contribution of EGCG to the effects of green tea in vivo remains elusive.</s><s>In our study, we observed no effect of 200 mg isolated EGCG on endothelial function in humans.</s><s>Widlansky et al. found an acute (but not long-term) improvement in FMD with 300 mg EGCG in patients with coronary artery disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>However, apart from different EGCG doses used, in contrast Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

numerical lower baseline FMD before EGCG as compared to before placebo could have contributed to their results.</s><s>In vitro, significant effects of EGCG on NO production and vasodilation were obtained only at concentrations of 1 µM or higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> , concentrations that were not achieved in plasma in our study and in Widlansky et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Surprisingly, mean plasma levels of EGCG in our study were inversely associated with changes in FMD between interventions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</s><s>All of the above results make a substantial contribution of EGCG to the vasodilating effects of green tea in vivo very unlikely.</s></p><p><s>Stimulation of endothelial NO production and vasodilation in isolated vessels have also been described for EC <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>In a small study by Schroeter et al., the administration of 1-2 mg/kg body weight of EC resulted in improved FMD in three subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>However, EC supplementation for 4 weeks (100 mg/d) had no significant effects on FMD in 35 subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Consumption of 442 ml green tea in our study resulted in the intake of 23 mg EC, which is much less than the amount of EC ingested in the study by Schroeter et al.</s><s>EC plasma levels in our study were very low and did not parallel changes in FMD between interventions.</s><s>In line with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , EC was fully conjugated and not present in the free form in plasma.</s><s>Therefore, the involvement of EC in the effects of green tea on FMD is rather unlikely.</s><s>Mean plasma levels of the other catechins ECG and EGC were also very low and showed no correlations with FMD, indicating that both catechins are in all likelihood not involved in the improvement of FMD by green tea.</s><s>Also, the sum of all catechins showed no correlation with FMD.</s></p><p><s>What other compounds could potentially contribute to the effects of green tea?</s><s>Caffeine is present in high amounts in green and black tea.</s><s>Consequently, plasma levels of caffeine substantially increased after consumption Correlations of catechin plasma levels with FMD changes after tea consumption (b).</s><s>Non-significant negative correlations were observed between catechin plasma levels and FMD changes (Spearman's).</s><s>Data are from n = 50 subjects.</s><s>of green tea in our study.</s><s>However, the published data on the role of caffeine on flow-mediated dilation are conflicting.</s><s>A cup of decaffeinated coffee had no effect on FMD in healthy adults, whereas caffeinated coffee (with 80 mg of caffeine) even declined FMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>In a similar study, decaffeinated coffee resulted in a slight increase in FMD, whereas caffeinated coffee significantly decreased FMD in healthy subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Consumption of green tea significantly improved FMD, however, the corresponding amount of caffeine contained in this tea (125 mg) did only slightly increase FMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Likewise, a significant improvement of FMD was observed two hours after consumption of black tea, but an equivalent dose of 200 mg caffeine had no effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>But there is also evidence that caffeine exerts beneficial effects on endothelial function.</s><s>A single dose of caffeine acutely improved FMD in patients with stable CAD, and increased forearm blood flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Chronic coffee consumption was associated with higher FMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , and moderate coffee consumption resulted in a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>An improved FMD was also observed after administration of a green tea extract containing caffeine <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>In addition, an inverse association with risk of CVD and stroke was shown for higher coffee and green tea consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Tea (mainly black) as well as moderate coffee consumption have been shown to decrease the risk for coronary heart disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, these studies point to a cardiovascular risk reduction for both tea and coffee.</s></p><p><s>In black tea, the amount of EGCG (and of other catechins) is much lower compared to green tea, depending on the degree of fermentation.</s><s>Theaflavins and thearubigins, the major polyphenolic compounds in black tea, are too large for substantial absorption into the circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Green and black tea are, however, equally effective in the improvement of FMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , and both teas contain a similar amount of caffeine.</s><s>However, other compounds including plasma metabolites of tea polyphenols, such as methylated compounds/phase I-breakdown or gut microbial metabolites (in addition to glucuronidated and sulphated substances), could also be involved.</s><s>Although EGCG can be methylated <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , very low <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , or no methylated (or otherwise metabolised) EGCG <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> was found in human plasma after consumption of a green tea extract or green tea.</s><s>An inverse association between the degree of urinary flavonoid O-methylation (4OMGA) and FMD after consumption of black tea indicates that methylation of tea flavonoids could rather affect endothelial function <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>However, the influence of other (as yet unknown) phase I-breakdown or gut microbial metabolites on tea-induced FMD cannot be fully excluded.</s></p><p><s>Some study limitations should be acknowledged.</s><s>The observed correlation between caffeine plasma levels and FMD is only weak and does not prove a role of caffeine in tea-induced endothelial function.</s><s>A study with caffeine and hot water, EGCG and green tea or with caffeinated and decaffeinated green tea would be required to verify the role of caffeine in tea-induced FMD.</s><s>Although EGCG did not mediate the effects of green tea on FMD in our study with healthy subjects, a contribution of EGCG to tea-mediated improvements of endothelial dysfunction cannot be fully excluded.</s><s>Even though the amount of EGCG used in our study (200 mg) corresponds to a nutritionally relevant dose that can be consumed by drinking tea, it does not necessarily reflect habitual tea drinking of several cups per day.</s><s>Also, it should be noted that the contributions of single tea compounds to tea-induced FMD cannot be generalised for other cardiovascular, neurological, or anti-tumor effects of green tea.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our data indicate that EGCG is not involved in changes of FMD by green tea.</s><s>The lack of an impact of EGCG on tea-induced improvements in endothelial function clearly points out that caution is indicated when translating promising in vitro
