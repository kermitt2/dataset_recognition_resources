<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The high-dose hook effect (also called prozone effect) refers to the observation that if a multivalent protein acts as a linker between two parts of a protein complex, then increasing the amount of linker protein in the mixture does not always increase the amount of fully formed complex.</s><s>On the contrary, at a high enough concentration range the amount of fully formed complex actually decreases.</s><s>It has been observed that allosterically regulated proteins seem less susceptible to this effect.</s><s>The aim of this study was two-fold: First, to investigate the mathematical basis of how allostery mitigates the prozone effect.</s><s>And second, to explore the consequences of allostery and the high-dose hook effect using the example of calmodulin, a calcium-sensing protein that regulates the switch between long-term potentiation and long-term depression in neurons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>We use a combinatorial model of a "perfect linker protein" (with infinite binding affinity) to mathematically describe the hook effect and its behaviour under allosteric conditions.</s><s>We show that allosteric regulation does indeed mitigate the high-dose hook effect.</s><s>We then turn to calmodulin as a real-life example of an allosteric protein.</s><s>Using kinetic simulations, we show that calmodulin is indeed subject to a hook effect.</s><s>We also show that this effect is stronger in the presence of the allosteric activator Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), because it reduces the overall cooperativity of the calcium-calmodulin system.</s><s>It follows that, surprisingly, there are conditions where increased amounts of allosteric activator actually decrease the activity of a protein.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p><s>We show that cooperative binding can indeed act as a protective mechanism against the hook effect.</s><s>This will have implications in vivo where the extent of cooperativity of a protein can be modulated, for instance, by allosteric activators or inhibitors.</s><s>This can result in counterintuitive effects of decreased activity with increased concentrations of both the allosteric protein itself and its allosteric activators.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Since the early 20 th century, immunologists have noted that more is not always better: Increasing the amount of antibody in an antibody-antigen reaction could reduce, instead of increase, the amount of precipitating antibodyantigen complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, mice receiving larger doses of anti-pneumococcus horse serum were not more, but less protected against pneumococcus infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>There was clearly a range of antibody concentrations above the optimum at which no effects (or negative by Bobrovnik <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and in a DNA-binding experiment by Ha et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The hook effect thus results from partially bound forms of the "linker" proteins competing with each other for binding partners, and as a consequence, there is a regime of concentrations where adding more linker protein will decrease the amount of fully formed complexes, rather than increase it (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Are all complexes with a central multivalent "linker" protein equally susceptible to the hook effect?</s><s>Based on simulation of allosterically regulated proteins using the Allosteric Network Compiler (ANC), Ollivier and colleagues suggested that allostery can mitigate the prozone effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this case, ligand binding to the linker protein is cooperative (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>), and the simulations by Ollivier et al. showed that the higher the cooperativity, the less pronounced the hook effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This agrees with what we know about cooperative binding: If ligand binding to one site is conducive to ligand binding to other sites, this will favour the formation of fully assembled complex over partial complexes, and thus increase the total amount of fully formed complex at a given linker concentration, compared to the noncooperative case.</s><s>In other words, partially bound forms of the linker protein still compete among themselves for binding partner, but cooperative binding skews the competition in favour of the forms that have more binding sites occupied and are thus closer to the fully bound form.</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we formalise and further develop these ideas.</s><s>We first provide a mathematical description of the principle behind the high-dose hook effect and show that it is indeed smaller for proteins that display cooperative ligand binding.</s></p><p><s>We then go on to examine how this applies to allosteric proteins.</s><s>We have decided to investigate the case of calmodulin, an allosteric tetra-valent calcium binding protein that is present in many tissues of the human body.</s><s>In neurons, calmodulin acts as a switch between longterm potentiation and long-term depression of a synaptic connection in response to the frequency, duration and amplitude of a calcium signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>We investigate the effects of both the hook effect itself and the allosteric nature of calmodulin under conditions comparable to its cellular environment.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Allostery mitigates the high-dose hook effect in calmdoulin</head><p><s>If it is true that cooperativity helps mitigate the prozone effect, then a non-cooperative protein with similar properties to calmodulin would show a higher hook effect than calmodulin itself.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we created an artificial in silico variant of calmodulin that binds to calcium in a non-cooperative way.</s><s>This was done by abolishing R to T state transitions in the model, so that calmodulin could exist in the R state only.</s><s>It is important at this point to differentiate between affinity and cooperativity: The R state only version of calmodulin has higher calcium affinity than the "wildtype" version (which can exist in the R state or the T state).</s><s>But the R state only version has itself no cooperativity, because cooperativity arises from the possibility of transitioning between the T and R states <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the results of two simulations run on wildtype calmodulin and an R-state-only in silico mutant, respectively.</s><s>Plotting fully bound calmodulin as a function of calcium concentration reveals a high-dose hook effect in both cases.</s><s>However, despite the R-state only variant reaching a higher peak (due to its higher overall affinity), it also shows a more pronounced hook effect, with lower absolute levels of fully bound complex at higher calmodulin concentrations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular environment modulates calmodulin cooperativity and hence, susceptibility to the high-dose hook effect</head><p><s>We have shown that calmodulin binding to calcium can be affected by the hook effect, and that this hook effect Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Reduced hook effect in cooperative (wt) calmodulin.</s><s>This figure shows the results of simulations on wildtype calmodulin (which is allosterically regulated, in black) compared to a non-cooperative in silico mutant (R state only, in red).</s><s>The plot of fully bound calmodulin as a function of initial calmodulin concentration shows a prozone effect in both cases, but it is more pronounced in the non-cooperative version is stronger in non-cooperative versions of calmodulin.</s><s>In order to assess the relevance of these findings for the cellular function fo calmodulin, we need to answer two questions: First, are the concentration regimes under which this system displays a hook effect ever found under physiological conditions?</s><s>And second, are there existing forms of calmodulin that resemble our "R state only" in silico mutation and are therefore non-cooperative?</s></p><p><s>Calmodulin is found in various concentrations in various tissues of the body, from micromolar concentrations in erythrocytes to tens of micromolar concentrations in some areas of the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The calmodulin concentrations used in our simulations are therefore physiologically relevant, especially in the higher range, where the prozone effect is most pronounced.</s></p><p><s>Our mathematical treatment and simulations have shown that allosteric regulation mitigates the hook effect.</s><s>But what is the relevance of this for calmodulin?</s><s>After all, there is no known variant of calmodulin that exists only in the R state or only in the T state.</s><s>However, there are allosteric modulators that will stabilise one of the two states, and they can exist in high concentrations.</s><s>To investigate the effect of the presence of an allosteric modulator, we repeated the above simulations in the presence of 140 μM CaMKII.</s><s>This number is consistent with the number of CaMKII holoenzymes found in post-synaptic densities in labelling studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The results of our simulations in the presence of 140 μM CaMKII are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5a</ref>.</s><s>Since CaMKII is an allosteric activator, it stabilises the R state of calmodulin over the T state.</s><s>At such high concentrations of CaMKII, the R state dominates, and calmodulin behaves almost like the theoretical R-state-only form.</s><s>In particular, the hook effect is exacerbated at high calmodulin concentrations.</s></p><p><s>To assess the effect of concentration of the allosteric activator, we compared this scenario with one where the CaMKII concentration was reduced to 1, μM.</s><s>In this case (shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5b</ref>) the R state is stabilised to some extent, but R and T states still co-exist, and cooperativity is therefore preserved.</s><s>While the initial peak of fully bound complex is higher than for wildtype calmodulin in the absence of any allosteric effectors, the prozone effect is reduced.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, this indicates that under conditions that render a protein susceptible to the high-dose hook effect, higher concentrations of an allosteric activator result in less activity than lower concentrations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperativity gives partially bound linkers a competitive edge</head><p><s>In this study we asked whether there is a general principle by which allosterically regulated proteins such as calmodulin are -to some extent -protected from the high-dose hook effect.</s><s>To mathematically examine this question, we have used combinatorics to show how the high-dose hook effect arises in a simple trimolecular complex with perfect binding affinities.</s><s>This is, in essence, due to the linker protein competing with other instances of itself for full complex formation.</s><s>This result reproduces the one found by Ha and colleagues, who derived algebraic expressions for all concentrations in a similar system and systematically varied dissociation constants and concentrations of components to explore the prozone effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, we also show that cooperative binding mitigates the high-dose hook effect.</s><s>It does so by essentially giving partially bound versions of the linker protein a competitive advantage, so that the population is skewed towards either fully bound forms or fully unbound forms, at the expense of partially bound forms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cooperativity can protect calmodulin from the high-dose hook effect under physiological conditions</head><p><s>Calcium binding to calmodulin is cooperative, and this suggests that calmodulin would be protected, to some extent, from the high-dose hook effect.</s><s>Indeed, we could show that is the case for physiological ranges of calmodulin concentration.</s><s>However, the cooperative nature of calmodulin binding to calcium itself is not a fixed property, but can vary according to the cellular environment.</s><s>Cooperativity can be reduced under conditions of ligand depletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, which are also the concentration regimes where the hook effect becomes noticeable.</s><s>In addition, high concentrations of an allosteric modulator can reduce cooperativity.</s><s>Thus, the susceptibility of a protein to the high-dose hook effect depends not only on intrinsic properties of the protein and its ligand, but also on the cellular context.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>More is not always better</head><p><s>As we have seen, the presence of an allosteric activator can reduce cooperativity.</s><s>This is because cooperativity in allosteric molecules arises, fundamentally, from the ability of the molecule to transition between T and R states, which have different ligand affinities.</s><s>By pulling all of the allosteric protein towards either the T or the R state, cooperativity is reduced, and the high-dose hook effect becomes more pronounced.</s><s>Interestingly, this is true no matter whether it is the T state or the R state that is stabilised or, in other words, whether the allosteric modulator is an inhibitor or an activator.</s><s>Thus, under conditions where the hook effect is noticeable, allosteric activation behaves counterintuitively: There is less activity in the absence of the allosteric activator than in its presence, and less activity when the levels of allosteric activator are high than when they are low.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible experimental validation</head><p><s>Our model predicts that the presence of cooperativity protects, to some extent, against the high-dose hook effect.</s></p><p><s>Ha and Ferrell <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> have investigated the link between cooperativity and the high-dose hook effect using a binding system composed fo three DNA strands: One strand can bind to two others, and cooperativity can be engineered by tweaking the amount of overlap.</s><s>Indeed, the construct identified as positively cooperative showed a less pronounced hook effect than the construct identified as non-cooperative <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>This corroborates our ideas in a synthetic binding system.</s></p><p><s>In order to assess whether this is also the case for systems with more than two binding sites, and in particular for multivalent proteins, one would need to be able to do two things: First, to be able to measure full occupancy of some multivalent protein (without measuring partially occupied states).</s><s>Second, this would need to be done on a linker protein of which there are two related forms, one of which shows cooperative binding and the other does not.</s></p><p><s>For calmodulin, as we have seen, a non-cooperative (or less cooperative) state can be obtained by adding a large concentration of CaMKII.</s><s>This will stabilise the R state, which is not itself cooperative.</s><s>In contrast, in the absence of allosteric modulators, both the R and T states are populated, and the transition between them is what confers cooperativity to calmodulin.</s><s>Thus, creating a less cooperative form of calmodulin in vitro is easy.</s><s>However, measuring full saturation of calmodulin is not.</s><s>Fractional saturation (i.e. the ratio of occupied binding sites) cannot serve as a proxy, because it does not show a Hook effect, instead monotonically going down as calmodulin concentration increases, as expected.</s><s>In addition, fractional occupancy profiles in the absence and presence of CaMKII do not show a big difference (see Additional file 1).</s><s>Thus, fractional occupancy is not a good proxy for full saturation.</s><s>Instead, is it possible to measure conformational state?</s><s>Moree et al. have shown that it is possible to measure conformational change in calmodulin that occurs with Calcium binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>However, conformational state and full saturation do not directly translate into each other, as can be seen in Additional file 1, where we plotted R for calmodulin in the absence and presence of CaMKII.</s><s>Thus, measuring fully saturated calmodulin (and therefore assessing the magnitude of the high-dose hook effect in vitro) is non-trivial.</s><s>As molecular measurement techniques develop in the coming years, though, this work provides a hypothesis that will be amenable to testing.</s></p><p><s>Another possibility would be to compare hemoglobin and myoglobin.</s><s>Both have similar properties, but hemoglobin exists as tetramer exhibiting cooperative binding to oxygen, while myoglobin is monomeric and therefore non-cooperative (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>).</s><s>Obviously, since myoglobin has only one oxygen-binding site, it does not itself display a high-dose hook effect.</s><s>Instead, it could be used as a proxy for what a non-cooperative version of hemoglobin would look like.</s><s>The fraction of fully occupied "non-cooperative hemoglobin" can simply be computed by taking the fractional saturation of myoglobin to the fourth power (essentially grouping free myoglobin molecules into groups of four and declaring full occupation if all four are bound).</s><s>The prediction is that this would show a stronger high-dose hook effect than hemoglobin itself.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relevance to other systems</head><p><s>These results are likely to be relevant in a wide range of biological systems.</s><s>For instance, neuronal signalling depends on a number of proteins with multiple ligand binding sites, including membrane receptors such as the AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors or other postsynaptic calcium sensors such as calbindin.</s><s>The existence of multiple ligand binding sites and, under some conditions, the relative scarcity of ligands (e.g. of glutamate in the synaptic cleft, and of calcium in the postsynaptic neuron) makes those proteins, in principle, prone to the hook effect.</s><s>Interestingly, several of these proteins are allosterically regulated (this is the case, for instance, for AMPA receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and for NMDA receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), which could confer a sensitivity advantage at high receptor-to-ligand ratios <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The hook effect is also a frequently discussed problem in medical diagnostics, because it can lead to falsenegative effects if the levels of analyte to be detected are too high.</s><s>Recent examples of this effect have been reported in the diagnosis of meningitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, and even in pregnancy tests <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>To avoid such cases, systematic dilution of the sample (and thus a reduction of analyte concentration) can help <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, but is not always practicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Given our results, another way to reduce the risk of false-negative results due to the hook effect would be to somehow make analyte binding to the reporter in the assay cooperative.</s><s>One way of achieving this in a sandwich immunoassay by making one of the receptors multimeric has been patented in 2001 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>If a protein acts as a linker between different parts of a multimolecular complex, then there are concentration regimes where adding more of the linker protein to the mixture will result in less overall complex formation.</s><s>This phenomenon is called the high-dose hook effect or prozone effect.</s></p><p><s>We have provided an idealised mathematical description of the hook effect and shown that allosteric regulation does indeed mitigate the hook effect, as has been predicted before <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Whilst this means that allosteric proteins such as calmodulin are, to some extent, protected from the highdose hook effect, the presence of allosteric modulators can increase susceptibility to the high-dose hook effect.</s><s>The extent of the hook effect is therefore strongly dependent on the cellular microenvironment.</s><s>Assuming perfect binding and no cooperativity, the molecules of A and B will be distributed randomly across molecules of L. At the end of the binding phase, any given molecule of L will be either free, bound to A only, bound to B only, or part of a complete LAB complex.</s><s>Clearly, this is a combinatorial problem that can have a variety of possible outcomes in terms of the numbers of complete LAB complex, partial complexes (LA or LB) and free (unbound) L.</s></p></div>
