<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical manifestation of syphilis in HIV-positives and -negatives</head><p><s>In our cohort HIV-coinfected patients had more often a primary lesion than HIV-negatives.</s><s>Unfortunately we cannot evaluate the frequent occurrence of multiple chancres and their persistence in HIV-positives retrospectively which was described in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Although we found no difference between HIVcoinfected patients and HIV-negatives concerning the spectrum of neurological symptoms, we detected that HIV-negatives always presented with neurological symptoms, while HIV-positives have been also asymptomatic.</s><s>Altogether 8.6 % of the HIV-positives had a neurologically asymptomatic neurosyphilis which matches with the results of Holtom et al. who found 9 % of the HIVpositive patients to have an asymptomatic neurosyphilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>All in all our results show that clinical symptoms do not differ as much between HIV-positives and -negatives as we would have expected.</s><s>But still the higher incidence of neurologically asymptomatic neurosyphilis during HIVcoinfection shows that these patients are at risk to miss a lumbar puncture to provide the right diagnosis and to undergo the necessary therapy.</s></p><p><s>Neuroimaging is also very important as a diagnostic parameter for neurosyphilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately we were not able to analyse imaging data since two-thirds of the patients in our study have not received neuroimaging.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neurosyphilis, HIV immune status and predictive parameters</head><p><s>We tried to ascertain whether a poor or good immune status in HIV-coinfected patients, which we defined by a number of CD4+ T cells &lt; or ≥350/μl, increases the risk for neurosyphilis or not.</s><s>Our results show no difference in these two groups concerning the diagnostic parameters but we found out that patients with poor immune status had a higher incidence of probable neurosyphilis while patients with better immune status were more likely to have a neurologically asymptomatic neurosyphilis.</s><s>Unfortunately a good or poor immune status does not help to predict or exclude the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.</s><s>It is rather apparent that HIV-coinfected patients are generally more likely to have neurosyphilis and maybe they are even more likely to have an asymptomatically proceeding disease which should not be missed by the physician.</s><s>The role of a good or poor immune status should be explored in further studies.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore we found neither a correlation between immune status and neurosyphilis nor between RPR-titre and neurosyphilis.</s><s>The combination of both parameters also only had a predictive value of 66.7 %.</s><s>This matches with the study of Wang et al. who showed that patients who did not meet the criteria of poor CD4+ T cells or RPR-titre ≥1:32 still had neurosyphilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>We admit that the difference between our results and those suggesting that poor CD4+ T cells or high serum-RPR-titre are predictive for neurosyphilis might be due to the fact that we used other criteria for the definition of neurosyphilis.</s></p><p><s>Altogether our results show that more research concerning diagnostic parameters in serum and cerebrospinal fluid is necessary.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>This study indicates that neurosyphilis is still difficult to diagnose particularly in asymptomatic patients and patients with HIV-coinfection.</s><s>A spinal tap should be an essential part of the diagnostic workup in any patient especially in those with HIV coinfection.</s><s>Our data show that a pleocytosis and an elevated albumin quotient correlate with neurosyphilis.</s><s>However, standard diagnostic tests such as the CSF-RPR have a sensitivity that is far too low to be reliable in clinical settings.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 Treponema pallidum testing and CSF characteristics in individuals with a retrospectively definite or probable neurosyphilis divided according to HIV status</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Neurosyphilis+</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Neurosyphilis−</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>N = 38</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>N = 29</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>HIV+</cell><cell></cell><cell>HIV−</cell><cell></cell><cell>HIV+</cell><cell></cell><cell>HIV−</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>N = 23</cell><cell></cell><cell>N = 15</cell><cell></cell><cell>N = 12</cell><cell></cell><cell>N = 17</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>n</cell><cell></cell><cell>n</cell><cell></cell><cell>n</cell><cell></cell><cell>n</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CSF cell count in cells/µl (mean/range) 87 (1-511)</cell><cell>23</cell><cell>32 (4-165)</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>9 (0-33)</cell><cell>11</cell><cell>9 (1-50)</cell><cell>16</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell>CSF Protein in mg/dl (mean/range)</cell><cell>129 (40-928)</cell><cell>23</cell><cell>86 (14-437)</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>145 (23-650)</cell><cell>11</cell><cell>43 (25-60)</cell><cell>16</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>1</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell>Albumin quotient in (mean/range)</cell><cell>12 (3.2-31.4)</cell><cell>20</cell><cell>8.4 (2.7-15.9)</cell><cell>14</cell><cell>6.1 (3.1-15.7)</cell><cell>11</cell><cell>6.4 (3.6-10.7)</cell><cell>14</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>Oligoclonal bands in CSF</cell><cell>pos.</cell><cell>11</cell><cell>pos.</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>pos.</cell><cell>9</cell><cell>pos.</cell><cell>6</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>3</cell></row><row><cell>Serum RPR (median/range)</cell><cell cols="2">1:32 (1:1-1:1024) 21</cell><cell cols="2">1:16 (1:2-1:512) 13</cell><cell cols="2">1:32 (1:4-1:128) 11</cell><cell cols="2">1:16 (1:2-1:256) 14</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>2 neg.</cell><cell></cell><cell>2 neg.</cell><cell></cell><cell>1 neg.</cell><cell></cell><cell>2 neg.</cell></row><row><cell>CSF RPR (median/range)</cell><cell>1:8 (1:8-1:512)</cell><cell>5</cell><cell cols="2">1:2/1:4 (1:1-1:4) 4</cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>16</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>18</cell><cell>neg.</cell><cell>11</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>pos.</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell>ITPA index (mean/range)</cell><cell>4.1 (0-30.9)</cell><cell>21</cell><cell>5 (0.1-15.2)</cell><cell>13</cell><cell>0.9 (0-5.8)</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>1 (0.1-3.7)</cell><cell>16</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>2</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">CD4 cell count in cells/µl (mean/range) 333 (60-780)</cell><cell>18</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>320 (41-611)</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>-</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>5</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>n.a.</cell><cell>2</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note><p><s>neg. negative, pos.</s><s>positive, n.a.</s><s>not available</s></p></note></figure>
