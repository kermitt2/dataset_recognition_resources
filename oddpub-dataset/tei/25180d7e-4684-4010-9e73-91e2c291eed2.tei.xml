<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective: Recent studies have suggested that the enteric nervous system can modulate gut immunity.</s><s>Ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases [E-NTPDases] regulate purinergic signalling by sequential phosphohydrolysis of pro-inflammatory extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate [ATP].</s><s>Herein, we test the hypothesis that E-NTPDases modulate gut inflammation via neuro-immune crosstalk.</s><s>Design: We determined expression patterns of NTPDase2 and NTPDase3 in murine and human colon.</s><s>Experimental colitis was induced by dextran sodium sulphate [DSS] in genetically engineered mice deficient in NTPDase2 or NTPDase3.</s><s>We compared plasma adenosine diphosphatase [ADPase] activity from Crohn's patients and healthy controls, and linked the enzyme activity to Crohn's disease activity.</s><s>Results: NTPDase2 and -3 were chiefly expressed in cells of the enteric nervous system in both murine and human colon.</s><s>When compared with wild type, DSS-induced colitis was exacerbated in Entpd2, and to a lesser extent, Entpd3 null mice as measured by disease activity score and histology, and marked anaemia was seen in both.</s><s>Colonic macrophages isolated from Entpd2 null mice displayed a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared with wild type.</s><s>In human plasma, Crohn's patients had decreases in ADPase activity when compared with healthy controls.</s><s>The drop in ADPase activity was likely associated with changes in NTPDase2 and -3, as suggested by inhibitor studies, and were correlated with Crohn's disease activity.</s><s>1114 L.
