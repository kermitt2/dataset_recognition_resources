<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Demographic and Clinical Participant Characteristics.</s><s>Twenty-two of thirty-six patients and 13 of 21 controls were female (χ 2 = 0.00, P &gt; 0.999).</s><s>Twenty-one of thirty-six patients and 16 of 21 controls had at least a high school diploma (χ 2 = 1.86,</s><s>P = 0.250).</s><s>The mean age (±SD) of patients was 47.4 (±9.1) y and of controls was 49.1 (±11.7)</s><s>y (t = −0.59;</s><s>P = 0.547).</s><s>Eight of 36 patients were treated with fumarate, 7 with β-interferons, 7 with glatiramer acetate, 6 with fingolimod, and finally 2 with teriflunomide.</s><s>For a subgroup of 22 patients, a T2-weighted (T2w) brain MRI scan acquired within a time period of roughly 1 y before participation in our study was available [median = 293 d before participation; range, 132-435 d].</s><s>Comparing these images with T2w images acquired during study participation revealed that only 7 of 22 patients had developed new lesions in this period (median = 0 new lesions; range, 0-4 new lesions).</s><s>Consistently, the median number of days since the end of the last relapse across all 36 patients was 654 d (range, 22-3,550 d).</s><s>Together, these findings suggest that disease activity at or around the time of our study was fairly small.</s><s>See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref> for further patient characteristics.</s></p><p><s>Psychophysiological Stress Responses, Mental Arithmetic Performance, and Cognitive Load.</s><s>As expected because of the performancedependent adjustments in task frequency in the stress paradigm, the link between performance (the number of correct trials during the last 8 min of stage IVb) and cognitive load (the mean duration of intertrial intervals during that period) across participants was strong (t = −18.89;</s><s>P &lt; 10 −4 ).</s><s>Please note that only trials in the last 8 min of IVb were evaluated to control for measurement duration across conditions and equal feedback settings (Materials and Methods, Experimental Design).</s><s>Patients performed worse than controls (t = −2.16;</s><s>P = 0.019) and had a lower cognitive task load (t = 2.10; P = 0.021).</s><s>The paradigm induced a fast psychological stress response (i.e., a significant positive difference in stress ratings for stage V vs. stage III: t = 6.20;</s><s>P &lt; 10 −6 ) and a fast response of SNS-related measures (i.e., the difference between the average heart rate in the last 8 min of stage IVb and the average rate across stage II; t = 7.20; P &lt; 10 −7 ).</s><s>For salivary cortisol, no fast stress response was observed.</s><s>The paradigm did not induce a slow or lasting stress response in any of the three response measures (heart rate: differences between stages VI and II; perceived stress and cortisol: differences between stages VII and III).</s><s>None of the stress responses (i.e., fast increases in perceived stress and heart rate) was (linearly) related to cognitive task load.</s><s>Please also see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>  , an initial salivary cortisol sample was taken, and participants were asked questions related to their currently perceived stress level (referred to as 'rating' in the following).</s><s>These questions were presented on a projection screen and answered with MRI-compatible button boxes.</s><s>In the next stage (stage II, baseline 1), the first ASL fMRI measurement was conducted; patients were asked to fixate on a crosshair.</s><s>In stage III, pre-stress, a second rating and cortisol measurement were performed.</s><s>In stage IV (stress), the fMRI stress measurement was conducted.</s><s>The participant was asked to perform repeated subtraction tasks having the form operand X minus operand Y.</s><s>The participant had to select the correct answer from a set of four answers shown on the screen below the operands.</s><s>The task started with a constant value of X, 43,521, for all subjects.</s><s>Operand Y ranged from 1 to 99 and was determined randomly in each trial.</s><s>If a patient gave the correct answer, the difference between the two operands was used as operand X in the next trial.</s><s>The course of the stress task was divided into two substages, an adaptation stage (stage IVa, duration ≤4 min) and a performance stage (stage IVb, lasting for the remainder of the total 12-min duration of stage IV).</s><s>In each trial in stage IVa, participants had 8 s to select the response, and response times were recorded.</s><s>Stage IVa ended either when the participant made 10 correct answers or when a 4-min period had elapsed.</s><s>Stage IVb began without a break.</s><s>Stage IVb differed from stage IVa in three aspects.</s><s>First, the calculation times for correct trials determined during the adaptation stage were used to provide performance feedback in terms of school grades ranging from 1 [Sehr gut (very good)] to 5 [Ungenügend (insufficient)].</s><s>Second, if the answers were incorrect or too slow, the subject had to begin again with the initial starting value for X.</s><s>Third, the time provided for subtraction was adjusted (only) in IVb based on the subject's performance (i.e., starting with 8 s after the transition from IVa to IVb, this time was decreased or increased by ten percent in a given trial based on the correctness or incorrectness in the preceding trial).</s><s>Finally, a third rating and cortisol measurement (stage V, post-stress), a second resting fMRI measurement (stage VI, baseline 2), and a fourth rating and cortisol measurement (stage VII, post-baseline 2) were performed.</s></p><p><s>Stress-Induced Brain Activity and MS Disease Parameters.</s><s>Four fMRI analyses were conducted to investigate mechanisms of fast and slow neural stress responses and their link to MS disease parameters.</s><s>Specifically, subject-specific voxel contrast maps denoting the difference in local cerebral blood flow (CBF, measured in milliliters per 100 g per minute) averaged across the last 8 min of stage IVb (the mental arithmetic task with feedback) minus the CBF averaged across stage II (baseline 1) were used as parameters of fast neural stress effects.</s><s>Maps assessing this difference between stages VI and II were used as indicators of slow stress effects.</s><s>We report coordinates significant on a familywise error (FWE)-corrected level (α FWE = 0.05).</s><s>fMRI analysis 1: Neural stress response.</s><s>In analysis 1a, one-sample t tests were conducted on the voxel level across all participants to identify brain areas showing fast or slow neural stress responses (i.e., stress-induced increases in activity).</s><s>In analysis 1b, we tested for differences between MS patients and controls in these responses using two-sample t tests.</s><s>Both analyses were restricted to coordinates located in a GM group mask (see Materials and Methods, MRI Preprocessing and SI Materials and Methods, MRI Preprocessing), and in both analyses gender and age were modeled as covariates of no interest.</s><s>Analysis 1a identified a variety of brain areas showing a fast generic stress response across MS patients and controls, primarily in visual, insular, and cerebellar cortex areas.</s><s>See Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref> for further details.</s><s>No slow neural stress responses were found.</s><s>Analysis 1b showed that fast and slow neural stress responses do not differ in patients and controls.</s><s>fMRI analysis 2: Clinical disability.</s><s>In fMRI analysis 2 (and in fMRI analyses 3, and 4) we searched for brain activity that is linked to MS disease parameters using voxelwise regression analyses modeling gender, age, and a constant term as covariates of no interest.</s><s>Because we were particularly interested in the link between neural stress responses and disease parameters, we restricted these analyses to regions identified in analysis 1a.</s><s>Because no slow neural stress effects were found in analysis 1a, we analyzed the link between alterations in the slow neural signal and disease parameters across all areas located in GM (SI Materials and Methods, fMRI analysis S4).</s><s>We report effect size measures (r) for significant associations (weak effect: 0.1 ≤ r &lt; 0.3; moderate effect: 0.3 ≤ r &lt; 0.5; strong effect: r ≥ 0.5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the link between fast neural stress responses and clinical disability, we tested the association between the respective activity changes and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores in analysis 2a and the Functional System Scores (FSS) subscales in analyses 2b-2h (2b, bowel and bladder;

This analysis revealed a consistent negative link between fast neural stress responses and three disability markers (i.e., the EDSS and the cerebral and the pyramidal FSS subscales) in overlapping left anterior insular areas and thus might suggest an important association between insula functioning and MS disability, in general.</s><s>At this point, it must be noted that the interrelatedness among EDSS scores and FSS subscales might have contributed to these consistent associations (cf.</s><s>ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref>).</s><s>However, because the functions underlying these scales are realized by distributed networks, and MS neuropathology typically evolves in distributed regions across the disease course <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>, activity in a single region very well might be coupled to different but interrelated disability markers via a single functional mechanism.</s><s>Thus, the interrelatedness among clinical scales does not severely affect the validity of this finding.</s></p><p><s>Findings made in an fMRI study investigating neural foundations of so-called "sickness behavior" in healthy subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> may help explain the functional link between insular activity and disability in MS.</s><s>Specifically, sickness behavior denotes a group of symptoms observed during the course of systemic infections including fatigue, depression, reduced exploratory behaviors, fever, and impaired cognitive performance (e.g., ref. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">31</ref>).</s><s>Sickness behavior is understood as an adaptive mechanism aiming to suppress nonimmunologically relevant behaviors during infections to reserve metabolic resources for immunological processes (30; see ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> for further details on the complex interplay between immune processes and biologically relevant behaviors such as eating).</s><s>In ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref>, either a typhoid vaccination or placebo was applied on one of two measurement days.</s><s>Subsequently, inflammation, self-report variables (including fatigue), and cognitive performance were measured in an fMRI Stroop task.</s><s>As expected, vaccination induced a marked inflammatory response and simultaneously induced fatigue.</s><s>Neural activity in the insular cortex was of outstanding importance because it increased in response to vaccination, and inflammation-induced activity in the insula correlated positively with fatigue.</s><s>Consequently, the insular cortex may be understood as a region monitoring inflammation and (directly or as part of a larger network) inducing sickness behavior (e.g., fatigue) in response to inflammation.</s></p><p><s>To investigate whether similar mechanisms might contribute to findings made in analysis 2, we tested whether the insular activity related to clinical disability in the peak voxel coordinates identified in analyses 2a, 2e, and 2f was also related to patients' fatigue (measured with the MFIS).</s><s>These analyses revealed a significant link between fatigue and EDSS-related activity (t = −2.38;</s><s>P = 0.021) and activity related to the FSS pyramidal scale (t = −2.50;</s><s>P = 0.017) and thus supported the relevance of the findings in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref>.</s><s>However, contrary to the findings in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref>, the link was negative.</s><s>Interestingly, such a negative association is consistent with inverse associations of other stress-related parameters and inflammatory processes in MS [e.g., elevated glucocorticoid activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and reduced glucocorticoid suppression of inflammatory cytokine production <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>] and thus might indicate the existence of a depleted neuroimmunological process.</s><s>Speculatively, this depletion might result from the immune system being confronted with a type of inflammation that it cannot cope with adequately (i.e., inflammation driven by autoimmune processes rather than by external pathogens) and that leads to continuous but ineffective neuroimmunological activity.</s><s>As a consequence, the immune system triggers sustained fatigue in a misguided attempt to save metabolic resources for a process falsely assumed to be of a short, temporary nature.</s><s>Please note, however, that other MS studies found a link between fatigue and HPA-axis hyperactivity (34), regional GM and WM atrophy, and lower fractional anisotropy in several WM areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, dysregulated and inflammation-triggered sickness behavior might be considered as only one among several complex factors contributing to fatigue in MS.</s></p><p><s>To determine the relevance of the covariation between activity and fatigue for the covariation of activity and disability, we conducted voxelwise analyses modeling the MFIS as an additional covariate of no interest in analysis 2. Importantly, the link between both the FSS subscales and fast insular stress responses remained significant under these circumstances.</s><s>These findings clearly argue that the link between disability and activity must be driven by further processes in addition to fatigue, an assumption that is consistent with other immunity-related processes regulated by the insula such as autonomic nervous system activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In analysis 3, we investigated the link between stress-induced activity and clinico-radiographic measures of disease severity, i.e., T2w lesion volume, the number of relapses, and disease duration.</s><s>However these analyses failed to identify such associations.</s><s>Speculatively, this lack of association can explained in part be by the rather weak link between brain lesions and clinical disability in MS (e.g., ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In analysis 4 we investigated the associations between fast neural stress responses and GM (analysis 4a) and WM volume (analysis 4b).</s><s>In 4a, a positive association between stress-induced activity and GM volume (i.e., a negative association between activity and atrophy) was found in the SMA and the left cerebellum in MS patients.</s><s>The latter finding is compatible with the observations that the cerebellum receives major

type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, given that inflammation is a source of GM atrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, which is pronounced in the cerebellum <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>, one might conclude that the negative link of stress-induced brain activity and GM atrophy might be mediated by the NE system.</s><s>Importantly, analysis 4a also showed that stress-induced activity is positively related to GM volume in overlapping cerebellar areas of controls.</s><s>Thus, contrary to the conclusions that might be derived using only patient data (and supported by the absence of a link between stressinduced activity and disease duration), the association between stress-induced activity and GM volume cannot reflect only heightened stress sensitivity in response to MS.</s><s>Instead, it might be at least partly indicative of a generic mechanism of neurodegeneration.</s></p><p><s>We conducted several supplementary analyses in addition to those described above.</s><s>In these analyses, we found GMF and WMF were lower in patients than in controls, as is compatible with neurodegeneration being a key feature of MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, in fMRI analysis S2 we evaluated whether the associations between brain activity and MS disease parameters tested in analyses 2-4 depend on task load and found that they did not.</s><s>Thus, together with the findings on fast generic stress responses, analysis S2 strongly suggests that the associations between neural signals and MS severity are driven by psychological stress.</s><s>fMRI analysis S3 evaluated the specificity of the link between areas showing a fast neural stress response and MS disease parameters by repeating fMRI analyses 2-4 across all GM areas and revealed results very similar to those of analyses 2-4.</s><s>Thus, fMRI analysis S3 nicely confirmed the functional relatedness of neural stress signals and MS disease parameters.</s><s>Finally, in analysis S4 we tested the association between slow neural signal alterations and MS disease parameters across all GM areas in the brain and found links to the FSS cerebellar scale, the number of relapses, and WMF.</s><s>However, given the absence of a slow generic neural stress response, the nature of these slow signal alterations and their link to MS disease parameters must be clarified in future studies.</s></p><p><s>Further explanations are required for the lack of stress-induced increases in cortisol in our study even though we used an experimental protocol almost identical to that described in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref>.</s><s>A possible explanation is that, unlike the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, our protocol did not include a free speech task and that the induced stress level is lower under these conditions.</s><s>Alternatively, the delay between the stress task and the last cortisol measurement might have been too short to account for the slow temporal characteristics of the salivary cortisol response <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>, and thus a longer interval should be chosen in future studies.</s><s>However, given the findings we made and that our task is less burdensome than the TSST (an important consideration in a study involving patients), we believe our task is well suited for addressing the research objectives we investigated.</s></p></div>
