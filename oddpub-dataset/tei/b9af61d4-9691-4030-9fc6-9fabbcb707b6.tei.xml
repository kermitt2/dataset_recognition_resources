<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Synaptosomal-associated protein of 47 kDa (SNAP47) isoform is an atypical member of the SNAP family, which does not contribute directly to exocytosis and synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling.</s><s>Initial characterization of SNAP47 revealed a widespread expression in nervous tissue, but little is known about its cellular and subcellular localization in hippocampal neurons.</s><s>Therefore, in the present study we applied multipleimmunofluorescence labeling, immuno-electron microscopy and in situ hybridization (ISH) and analyzed the localization of SNAP47 in pre-and postsynaptic compartments of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the mouse and rat hippocampus.</s><s>While the immunofluorescence signal for SNAP47 showed a widespread distribution in both mouse and rat, the labeling pattern was complementary in the two species: in the mouse the immunolabeling was higher over the CA3 stratum radiatum, oriens and cell body layer.</s><s>In contrast, in the rat the labeling was stronger over the CA1 neuropil and in the CA3 stratum lucidum.</s><s>Furthermore, in the mouse high somatic labeling for SNAP47 was observed in GABAergic interneurons (INs).</s><s>On the contrary, in the rat, while most INs were positive, they blended in with the high neuropil labeling.</s><s>ISH confirmed the high expression of SNAP47 RNA in INs in the mouse.</s><s>Co-staining for SNAP47 and pre-and postsynaptic markers in the rat revealed a strong co-localization postsynaptically with PSD95 in dendritic spines of pyramidal cells and, to a lesser extent, presynaptically, with ZnT3 and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in glutamatergic terminals such as mossy fiber (MF) boutons.</s><s>Ultrastructural analysis confirmed the pre-and postsynaptic localization at glutamatergic synapses.</s><s>Furthermore, in the mouse hippocampus SNAP47 was found to be localized at low levels to dendritic shafts and axon terminals of putative INs forming symmetric synapses, indicating that this protein could be trafficked to both post-and presynaptic sites in both major cell types.</s><s>These results reveal divergent localization of SNAP47 protein in mouse and rat hippocampus indicating species-and cell type-specific differences.</s><s>SNAP47 is likely to be involved in unique fusion machinery which is distinct from the one involved in presynaptic neurotransmitter release.</s><s>Nonetheless, our data suggest that SNAP47 may be involved not only postsynaptic, but also in presynaptic function.</s></p></div>

(2006)</ref> reported a high expression of SNAP25 in GABAergic terminals (gt) of the hippocampus and the thalamus, however this finding was contrasted by several reports suggesting the lack of SNAP25 in hippocampal GABAergic axon terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Verderio et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bragina et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Matteoli et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, SNAP23 has been reported to be highly and selectively expressed in at least a subset of hippocampal and neocortical inhibitory axon terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Verderio et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bragina et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Our results indicate that GABAergic neurons in the mouse hippocampus synthesize SNAP47 at high levels and the functional protein can be localized both postsynaptically in somato-dendritic compartments and presynaptically in axon terminals.</s><s>In the rat somatic expression levels were markedly lower than in the mouse, albeit not absent, suggesting that the storage and trafficking of this SNAP isoform underlies species-dependent regulatory mechanisms.</s><s>Further investigations are necessary to identify the precise localization and role of the functional protein in diverse IN populations and whether, despite a low presynaptic expression, it can participate in the SNARE complexes involved in supporting vesicle fusion in GABAergic boutons.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-and Presynaptic Expression of SNAP47 at Glutamatergic Synapses</head><p><s>In the rat hippocampus, SNAP47 immunolabeling of the cell body layers was weak, whereas the neuropil, in particular the CA3 stratum lucidum where MFs terminate showed strong staining.</s><s>We could detect SNAP47 at high level in subset of dendritic spines, and showed localization similar to the postsynaptic marker.</s><s>This finding is consistent with the conclusion from a previous study demonstrating that SNAP47 is present in postsynaptic compartments and an essential component of the fusion machinery required for regulated AMPAR insertion to the membrane during the expression of LTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jurado et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, the protein does not contribute to the regulation of basal AMPAR-or NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses or basal AMPAR surface expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jurado et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jurado et al. (2013)</ref> did not allow any conclusions about the specific dendritic nanodomains at which AMPAR exocytosis occurs during LTP or about the specific timing of these events.</s><s>Other studies have found that following NMDAR activation, recombinant AMPAR subunits are inserted into perisynaptic membranes, either adjacent to the PSD or adjacent to the base of dendritic spines, from where they can laterally diffuse into the PSD to increase synaptic strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Petrini et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Opazo et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The sources of the AMPARs that are exocytosed during LTP have been suggested to be recycling endosomes containing transferrin receptors (TfRs) in dendrite spines <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jurado et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>As there is a close correlation between dendritic spine size and PSD size <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harris and Stevens, 1989)</ref> and between PSD size and AMPAR density at synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Takumi et al., 1999)</ref>, small spines in the stratum radiatum are likely to contain lower numbers of AMPARs.</s><s>Assuming that SNAP47 expression is proportional to AMPAR numbers, this could explain the higher intensity of SNAP47 labeling in complex spines in CA3 stratum lucidum in comparison to spines in CA3 stratum radiatum in rat hippocampus, as observed in our study.</s><s>In general, predominant localization of SNAP47 to the postsynaptic elements supports role of this protein in the control of receptor trafficking.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we could also confirm presynaptic localization of SNAP47 in glutamatergic synapses.</s><s>The labeling intensity was particularly high in MFBs in CA3 stratum lucidum in the rat.</s><s>We could detect co-localization of SNAP47 immunofluorescence signal with both VGLUT1and ZnT3 in MFBs, but not all MFBs were labeled and the overlap was weaker than with the postsynaptic marker.</s><s>In fact, postembedding immunogold-labeling confirmed these findings and demonstrated that SNAP47 immunogold particles were present presynaptically in the majority of MFBs however at substantially lower densities than postsynaptically in the complex spines of CA3 pyramidal cells.</s></p><p><s>The presynaptic localization of SNAP47 in MFBs may have important implications in vesicular exocytosis of BDNF <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Shimojo et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>BDNF is stored in discrete vesicles within MFBs and some MFB-filopodia <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Danzer et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dieni et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>BDNF-containing clusters co-localize neither with SV markers such as synaptophysin or VGLUT1, nor with proteins that are stored in dense core vesicle fractions.</s><s>In good agreement, the staining pattern for SNAP47 was different from established markers for synapses.</s><s>Furthermore, the co-fractionation pattern indicates that a pool of SNAP47 resides on a subpopulation of small vesicles, but the nature and origin of these vesicles remains to be established <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Holt et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Synaptic BDNF is not uniquely stored in MFBs, but was generally found in discrete synaptic granules/vesicles in majority of glutamatergic axon terminals in cultured hippocampal neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andreska et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Based on our results which show irregular, clustered localization of SNAP47 within glutamatergic presynaptic boutons, different from the homogenous vesicular labeling for VGLUT1, we hypothesize a co-localization of BDNF and SNAP47.</s><s>Moreover, as BDNF protein is further localized in cell bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Conner et al., 1997)</ref> and SNAP47 protein is also accumulated in neuronal (glutamatergic and GABAergic) cell bodies.</s><s>This co-localization pattern seems not to be restricted to MFBs, but may be a general principal for all neuronal compartments.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our work shows that SNAP47 is present postsynaptically at high levels in a subset of postsynaptic elements, including CA3 complex spines in the stratum lucidum and small spines in the CA1 and CA3 stratum radiatum.</s><s>However, SNAP47 is also present presynaptically at lower levels in subsets of axon terminals, including MFBs and small excitatory axon terminals in the stratum radiatum.</s><s>Concluding, our data suggest that SNAP47 may be involved not only in postsynaptic function but also in unique fusion machinery, distinct from the one involved in neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic sites.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Perspectives</head><p><s>With respect to the strong accumulation of SNAP47 in GABAergic cell bodies and the co-localization of GABA pre-and postsynaptic markers with this SNAP isoform examined in the present study, it will be of interest to clarify its precise cellular and subcellular expression in various types of inhibitory neurons and to identify the mechanisms that regulate its intracellular distribution and trafficking and will helps us better understand the functions of SNAP47 protein in GABAergic neurons.</s><s>The preferential localization of SNAP47 to the postsynaptic components in the rat at physiological conditions raises the question whether the trafficking of this protein, in terms of favored localization to the presynaptic terminals and/or postsynaptic sites, could be changed dynamically during development or brain disorders.</s></p></div>
