HFpEF.</s><s>We report novel data that provides mechanistic insights regarding the changes in heart and lung structure and function in this HFpEF animal model.</s><s>We found that slow-progressive pressure overload in cats resulted in progressive increases in concentric LV hypertrophy, LA enlargement and dysfunction, and LV diastolic dysfunction without LV dilation, which subsequently led to elevated LV filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension with impaired oxygenation and stiffening of the lungs.</s><s>LV diastolic dysfunction was associated with increased LV fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, elevated NT-proBNP plasma levels, perivascular cuff formation, impaired lung expansion, and alveolar-capillary membrane thickening.</s><s>According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, this model meets all criteria necessary for a HFpEF diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> and corresponds to ACCF/AHA stage B/C of HF <ref type="bibr"

matured.</s><s>In contrast to most available transverse aortic constriction (TAC) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , which causes an immediate and severe pressure overload, our approach allows the heart to slowly adjust to the increased afterload and does not result in LV dilation and systolic dysfunction.</s><s>The slow-progressive overload model takes longer to develop but produces a phenotype that more closely mimics the human conditions that can lead to HPpEF.</s><s>Rodent HFpEF models generally progress to HFrEF over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , which means that HFpEF is just a transient stage in the development of HFrEF.</s><s>In addition, myocyte properties of rodents, such as regulation of [Ca 2+ ] are fundamentally different than in large mammals

the Echocardiographic and hemodynamic features are the most important components for a HFpEF diagnosis, both of which can be performed in a comprehensive and highly translational fashion in

banded cats.</s><s>LA EF was positively correlated with respiratory compliance and PaO 2 .</s><s>ECHO revealed impaired diastolic function after aortic banding, reflected in abnormal transmitral

decrease in t-dia/ τ ratio and dP/dt min ) at rest, which is defined as the inability to fill the LV to an adequate volume at acceptable low pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</s><s>Elevated LV filling pressures are the ultimate downstream expression of LV diastolic dysfunction and provide sufficient evidence to secure a HFpEF diagnosis in symptomatic patients <ref

microvascular dysfunction could have caused prolongation of τ in banded cats with significant LV hypertrophy.</s></p><p><s>Exercise intolerance is one of the hallmark clinical features of HFpEF and is attributed to impairments in systolic and diastolic reserve, chronotropic incompetence and peripheral autonomic and vascular dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62</ref> .</s><s>Although, full exercise stress testing was beyond the scope of the current study, some insight about native activity can be appreciated from observation of the unrestrained cats who were group housed in rooms allowing free movement and social interaction.</s><s>In this regard, banded cats presented signs and symptoms of HF such as abnormal breathing patterns (abdominal efforts, diaphragmatic breathing) and higher respiratory rates, particularly after physical exertion.</s><s>As an alternative to controlled exercise, we used pharmacologic stress testing.</s><s>Dobutamine infusion did not cause the hemodynamic profiles in banded cats to decline.</s><s>LVEDP and mPAP did not change and active relaxation improved in response to dobutamine, which is not surprising since ß-adrenoreceptor signaling accelerates relaxation and therefore counteracts acquired diastolic dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref> .</s><s>Our findings are also consistent with the results of a hemodynamic study performed in human HFpEF patients.</s><s>Penicka et al. reported a decrease in both LVEDP and τ, and an increase in dP/dt min after dobutamine infusion, while performing hand-grip exercises increased LVEDP and caused a prolongation of τ <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64</ref> .</s></p><p><s>HFpEF is associated with interstitial fibrosis, which is mostly reactive <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65</ref> and a result of fibroblast activity and extracellular matrix remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66</ref> .</s><s>We consistently found that both lateral and septal LV walls of the banded group had a higher percentage of fibrosis compared to the sham group.</s><s>Interestingly, the fibrosis was diffuse, and more pronounced in the lateral free wall compared to septal wall in banded cats.</s><s>This difference in fibrosis between the LV walls in HFpEF has not to our knowledge been reported elsewhere.</s><s>Furthermore, the LV fibrosis was more pronounced in the subendocardium vs the subepicardium.</s><s>A similar pattern was observed in dogs with LV hypertrophy and failure induced by chronic pressure-overload and related to a limited subendocardial coronary reserve <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67</ref> and latent ischemia during adrenergic stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68</ref> .</s><s>In line with that, isovolumic relaxation is prolonged in banded cats, which could relate to less potential recoil energy stored in the damaged matrix of the subendocardium during systole <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69</ref> .</s><s>It is likely that latent myocardial ischemia during pressure-overload is a major trigger for primarily subendocardial fibrosis also in our HFPEF model.</s><s>We speculate that LV fibrosis in HFpEF might evolve with a subendo-to subepicardial gradient, similar to the wavefront of myocardial infarction during acute coronary occlusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70</ref> .</s><s>NT-proBNP, a surrogate marker for

to the high LV filling pressures and significant LA enlargement in banded cats, it was not surprising that we found elevated NT-proBNP levels at 4-months post-banding, which further correlated positively with LA size.</s><s>Oyama et al. reported that in cats with respiratory symptoms, plasma NT-proBNP levels &gt; 270 pmol/L are suggestive of HF as the likely cause with high sensitivity and

Slow-progressive pressure overload in cats led to LVH, LV fibrosis and LV diastolic impairment, which caused elevated LVEDP and LA enlargement.</s><s>Backwards transmission of elevated left-sided filling pressures caused an increase in hydrostatic venous pulmonary pressure and pulmonary arterial hypertension (increased mPAP), ostensibly due to approaching the elastic limits of the compliant pulmonary vasculature.</s><s>According to the most recent PH guidelines, the combination of elevated LVEDP ( &gt; 15 mmHg) and mPAP ( ≥ 25 mmHg) is classified as post-capillary PH, which is further subdivided into isolated post-capillary PH (Ipc-PH) and combined post-and pre-capillary PH (Cpc-PH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>The observed increase in wet/dry lung weight ratio and the elevated protein content following aortic banding are suggestive of capillary endothelial disruption and impaired permeability due to increased hydrostatic pressure with subsequent interstitial edema and protein loss from the vasculature into the lung tissue proper.</s><s>These reversible changes have been described in Ipc-PH and are summarized under the term 'alveolar-capillary stress failure' <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In addition, we found extra-alveolar vessel abnormalities including perivascular fluid cuff formation, impaired expansion of the lung (decreased expansion index), smaller alveolar areas, and thickening of alveolar-capillary membrane in banded cats.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time perivascular cuff formation has been described in HFpEF PH.</s><s>Lowe et al. reported perivascular fluid cuff formation along extra-alveolar vessels without alveolar flooding or blood gas abnormalities in a lung injury model with thapsigargin.</s><s>The authors showed that perivascular fluid cuffs reduced lung compliance by increasing tissue resistance and impairing mechanical coupling between bronchovascular bundle and the lung parenchyma <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">75</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with these findings, we also observed cuff formation and stiffening of the lungs.</s><s>Finally, these changes led to an increase in intrapulmonary shunt fraction and impaired oxygenation.</s></p></div>
