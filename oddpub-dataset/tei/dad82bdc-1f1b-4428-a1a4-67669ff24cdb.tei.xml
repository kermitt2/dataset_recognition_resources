<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>113</head><p><s>Extraction and Quantification of PHA.</s><s>Extraction and 114 characterization of PHA from the batch-reactor biomass were 115 performed following the method proposed by Venkateswar Reddy 116 et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> A hydroxybutyrate−hydroxyvalerate (HB−HV) copolymer 117 with a purity of 96% and a molar relation 95:5 HB−HV was obtained.</s><s>118 Film Preparation.</s><s>The films were prepared by dissolving PHA 119 and PLA in chloroform at 1 and 2% (w/v), respectively, under stirring 120 for 3 h.</s><s>PLA/PHA mixtures were prepared in the following 121 proportions: 20/80, 40/60, 60/40, and 80/20 (w/w).</s><s>They were 122 stirred for 30 min at 60 °C.</s></p><p><s>123 Filmogenic solutions of PLA, PHA, and their blends were cast into 124 glass Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) that were left under a fume hood.</s><s>125 Later, the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C to ensure 126 solvent removal from the matrices.</s><s>When the solutions were cast, 127 constant mass−molding-area ratios were maintained in order to 128 ensure uniform thicknesses in the different samples, because the 129 control solutions (PLA and PHA) had different concentrations.</s><s>130 Film thickness was measured by means of a coating-thickness gauge 131 (Check Line DCN-900) for nonconductive materials on nonferrous 132 substrates.</s><s>For each specimen, at least 14 measurements at different 133 positions were taken.</s></p></div>

recorded.</s><s>Informed results were the averages of two replicates to ensure reproducibility of the results.</s></p><p><s>The results were analyzed by using the Universal Analysis V1.7F software (TA

Spectroscopy.</s><s>The interactions between the system components were analyzed using the ATR-FTIR technique.</s><s>Spectra of the samples were registered by using the Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 FT-IR Spectrometer in the wavenumber region of 4000−400 cm −1 , performing 64 scans at a 4 cm −1 resolution.</s><s>Specimens were placed onto the diamond ATR crystal (Smart iTX accessory), and the

Diffraction.</s><s>X-ray diffractograms of individual PVA and PLA films and their blends were evaluated by using an X'Pert Pro P Analytical Model PW 3040/60 (Almelo) operated at room

crystallinity degree (CD) was calculated following the procedure described in previous works. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref></s><s>ructural Studies by SEM.</s><s>The microstructures of the matrices were examined by using an FEI model Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope.</s><s>Individual films and blend matrices were immersed in liquid nitrogen and fractured cryogenically.</s><s>Samples were mounted onto metal stubs by using double-sided tape and observed at low pressure and an acceleration voltage of 12.5 kV, without any metal or carbon coating.</s><s>Biodegradation Test.</s><s>A series of plastic pots (400 cm 3 ) were used as soil containers, and the microflora present was used as a degrading medium.</s><s>Square specimens of 3 × 3 cm with a thickness of approximately 25 μm on average were put into a plastic mesh to allow the access of moisture and microorganisms and the retrieval of degraded specimens.</s><s>In order to guarantee aerobic degradation, the film samples were buried.</s><s>The samples were conditioned at a relative humidity of 50% and a temperature of 20 °C.</s><s>Containers were sprayed regularly with a defined and constant amount of water.</s><s>Similar conditions were employed by Rivero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> At specific time intervals, specimens were recovered from the soil and cleaned with a brush to avoid any possible damage of the structure.</s></p><p><s>In accordance with the described methodology in ASTM D5988-03, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref>   <ref

intensity of the melting peak is related to the number of crystals or crystalline populations (crystalline fraction) that exist in the material when the melting occurs.</s><s>Using MDSC, Thellen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> reported that crystal melting is produced at higher temperatures in samples of PHA containing lower percentages of valerate, because as the valerate content increases, the onset of crystal melting occurs at lower temperatures.</s><s>In the present study, the PHA thermograms evidenced the presence of a peak with a shoulder, which could represent the melting of crystal lamellae, as was reported by Thellen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> for extruded PHA.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, PHA films exhibited a T g at −4.7 °C, whereas PLA showed a marked transition at 58.1 °C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s><s>Glass-transition temperatures ranging from 2.7 to −4.4 °C for a PHA matrix obtained by casting were reported by da Silva et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> The thermograms of all the mixtures exhibited PLArecrystallization peaks at 107 °C; this transition was more evident with higher PLA proportions in the mixture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that the incorporation of PHA contributes to the process of recrystallization of PLA in all the blend formulations.</s><s>This effect was more marked in the 80/20 blend, a behavior that could be explained by bearing in mind that a low proportion of crystalline domains of PHA dispersed in a continuous matrix of PLA induced the phenomenon of nucleation of this latter polymer.</s><s>The presence of double melting temperatures in the PLA/PHA blends corresponds to the melting of both the "as formed" and recrystallized polymer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref></s><s>cording to Abdelwahab et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10</ref> and Ikehara et al., <ref type="bibr">23</ref> recrystallization strongly depends on the melting-temperature differences among the components of the mixture.</s><s>When the T m difference is very large, the component with the higher melting temperature crystallizes first, and its spherulites contribute to fill all the volume.</s><s>The 20/80 blend exhibited a peak at 171.9 °C because of the melting of the PHA crystalline fraction and a shoulder at 148.4</s></p><p><s>°C corresponding to the melting of PLA.</s><s>The 80/20, 60/40, and 40/60 blends exhibited two endothermic transitions; the enthalpy associated with the first event diminished with the incorporation of a higher proportion of PHA to the blend, whereas the enthalpy of the endothermic peak, characteristic of the PHA-crystalline phase, became more prominent (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>These findings were in accordance with a higher crystalline degree.</s></p><p><s>From the obtained DSC curves,
