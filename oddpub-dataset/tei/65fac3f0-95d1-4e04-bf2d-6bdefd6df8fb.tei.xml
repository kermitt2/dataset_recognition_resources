b 1 , 17.86%; b 2 , 39.0%) (31), 64 Cu could play a dual role in the development of molecular agents for PET imaging and in oncologic therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>The additional emission of Auger electrons associated with the electron capture decay canal (electron capture, 43.075%) might considerably contribute to the possible therapeutic effectiveness of this radionuclide.</s><s>Auger electrons have low kinetic energies and short-range penetration but concomitantly high linear-energy transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, like heavier particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>.</s><s>The present study might provide the basis for evaluating the radiation safety of 64 CuCl 2 and estimating the dose absorbed by organs at risk in the case of theranostic application.</s></p><p><s>Our study demonstrated that 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT could detect local recurrence and lymph node and bone metastases in PCa patients with biochemical relapse and was the first to prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT with those of 18 F-choline PET/CT and mpMRI.</s></p><p><s>In our patient-based analysis, the DR of 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT was significantly higher than that of 18 F-choline PET/CT.</s><s>This difference stems from the high DR of 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT in identifying local recurrence, which is often undetected by 18 F-choline PET/ CT.</s><s>In this analysis, no difference emerged between 64 CuCl 2 PET/ CT and mpMRI.</s><s>This is in line with the well-known high sensitivity of mpMRI in detecting local recurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Indeed, 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT detected more patients with PCa relapse than did 18 F-choline PET/CT in each PSA cohort, except for a PSA level of more than 4 ng/mL.</s><s>These data demonstrate the high DR of 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT even in patients with a PSA level of less than 1 ng/mL.</s><s>In this subgroup, more than 70% of patients presented a positive 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT, which was often consistent with local relapse.</s><s>In other words, these patients may still benefit from salvage, PET-guided RT <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the lesion-based analysis, 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT had a significantly higher DR than did 18 F-choline PET/CT and mpMRI.</s><s>We found that the significant difference in DR was due to the greater ability of 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT to detect both local recurrence and lymph node metastases (especially in small lymph nodes; i.e., those with a short axis diameter of ,7 mm).</s></p><p><s>These findings open a door to the possibility of using 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT in cases of suspected local PCa relapse when mpMRI remains inconclusive.</s></p><p><s>Despite our encouraging results, some important limitations should be noted.</s><s>First, we assessed only the DRs of the diagnostic techniques mentioned, assuming a priori that all patients were true-positives, in that they presented with biochemical relapse.</s><s>Indeed, we introduced a descriptive standard of reference, which was used only to confirm the sites of disease without providing information on the diagnostic accuracy of 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT.</s><s>Second, only a few cases of local findings were confirmed histopathologically.</s><s>Histopathology was performed on transrectal ultrasoundguided biopsy in 7 of 25 patients (28%) showing only local recurrence; this confirmed the presence of disease.</s><s>In addition, undetectable PSA values were found after salvage EBRT in another 4 of the 11 patients with only local recurrence and not previously treated with EBRT.</s><s>Generally, we found a high concordance between positive findings on 64 CuCl 2 PET/CT, 18 F-choline PET/CT, and mpMRI.</s></p><p><s>However, the lack of proper histopathologic confirmation is common in most articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref> comparing different PET tracers in the detection of PCa recurrence.</s><s>Indeed, the aim of these studies, as in our case, was not to determine the diagnostic accuracy but to assess and compare the DRs of the tracers.</s></p></div>
