neuroscience, where they are used to manipulate the membrane voltage of neurons and to noninvasively evoke or inhibit action potentials with high spatial and temporal precision <ref type="bibr"

<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, which are excited most effectively with blue light of 460 nm.</s><s>However, due to deeper penetration and reduced scattering in tissues, the use of yellow or even red light would be advantageous.</s><s>This holds particularly true for in vivo application in rodents, where noninvasive delivery of weakly scattered light is a demanding challenge.</s><s>Over the last few years, a couple of red-shifted ChRs were discovered, modified, and established as optogenetic tools.</s><s>In 2008, the native green-absorbing channelrhodopsin-1 from Volvox carteri (VcChR1) with l max ¼ 535 nm was used to trigger action potentials in neurons as a response to orange light <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Subsequent mutational and helix shuffling approaches produced variants with improved expression, larger photocurrents in mammalian cells, and action spectra that were red-shifted compared with ChR2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s><s>One of the chimeric constructs was the CrChR1/VcChR1 hybrid C1V1 ET (E122T) enabling fast AP firing even upon stimulation with 630 nm light <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In 2013, the red-activatable ChR (ReaChR) was introduced as an improved VcChR1 variant with the N-terminus of CrChR1 (amino acid 1-94), helix 6 from VcChR2, and the L171I mutation in helix 3 (CrChR2 I131) to reduce desensitization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A</ref>).</s><s>In comparison with C1V1 ET , ReaChR shows improved expression, faster channel closing rates, and larger stationary currents with an action spectrum that substantially deviates from rhodopsin absorption respective shape and side maximum at 630 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, the authors demonstrated deep brain tissue activation through the intact skull of awake mice without removal or surgical thinning of the cranium.</s><s>In a subsequent study, ReaChR was employed to excite central nervous system neurons of Drosophila melanogaster to study behavior of freely moving flies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Remarkably, ReaChR possesses a significant propensity for two-photon absorption most likely due to a high 2P cross section, which was exploited for in-depth excitation of acute brain slices <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and manipulation of transgenic D. melanogaster with near-infrared light <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Sengupta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> highlighted the enormous potential of ReaChR to restore vision in blind retinitis pigmentosa mice.</s><s>Its superior properties mentioned before render ReaChR a versatile and frequently used red-light-activated optogenetic tool for in vitro and in vivo applications.</s></p><p><s>Although ReaChR is successfully used in optogenetic experiments, many aspects of its basic photochemistry were not reported in the initial publication and are still unknown, representing the starting point for this investigation.</s><s>Within the last decade, photochemical reactions as they occur in ChRs have been studied in great detail with different spectroscopic and electrophysiological methods leading to the development of complex photocycle models.</s><s>Spectroscopic data of ChR2 under single-turnover conditions could be properly described by a single reaction cascade comprising one dark state and four spectrally distinct intermediates (P500, P390, P520, P480) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>However, explanation of photocurrents under extended illumination demands a more complex two-cycle model with at least two closed and two open states with different conductances and ion selectivities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>More recently, spectroscopic data of various recombinant ChRs supported the two-cycle-model <ref type="bibr"

The deprotonated M-state decays biexponentially (M 1 and M 2 ) and is reprotonated during N-state formation.</s><s>N decays to an intermediate that is spectrally not distinguishable from the dark state (O-state).</s><s>(Colored arrows) Proposed photoinduced pathways between the intermediates and both cycles; (black arrows) thermal conversions.</s><s>The conducting states are assigned to the M 2 -and N-equilibrium (red box).</s><s>The syn-cycle consists of the same spectral states marked by a hyphen and undergoes the same protonations; corresponding shortcuts and the M-substates are omitted for clarity.</s><s>Upon prolonged illumination of slow-cycling mutants, side-products (P420/460) are accumulated, which could be photoconverted by UV-light (data not shown).</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
