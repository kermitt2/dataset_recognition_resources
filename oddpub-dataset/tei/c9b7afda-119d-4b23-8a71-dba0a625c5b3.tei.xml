<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In a genome-wide, time-resolved profiling study initially designed to improve human and mouse hepatocyte in vitro systems we made the surprizing observation that expression changes induced by hepatocyte isolation and cultivation resemble expression alterations in liver diseases.</s><s>We demonstrate by genome-wide analysis that gene cluster responses in vitro, i.e., upregulation of inflammation/RNA processing and migration/cell cycle genes, downregulation of mature liver functions genes, also occurred in human HBV-infected liver tissue, cirrhosis and HCC, as well as CCl 4 intoxication, partial hepatectomy, LPS intoxication and HCC in mouse, although the intensity varied and was generally weaker in diseased liver than in vitro.</s><s>Our observations are in agreement with previous reports that also identified components of the acute phase response among the top upregulated genes in cultivated hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boess et al. 2003)</ref>.</s><s>However, our study goes beyond those observations because we establish precise correlations to disease models in vivo, and unravel control mechanisms responsible for the altered gene expression in vitro, allowing the design of molecular interventions.</s><s>Gene network analysis identified a low HNF4 signature as one of the major reasons for loss of mature liver functions.</s><s>Gain of inflammation/RNA processing was mostly driven by Klf6 and interaction partners, Cebp and ATF stress factors.</s><s>Central control factors for the migration/cell cycle cluster include E2F family members.</s></p><p><s>Possible reasons for gene expression alterations in cultured primary hepatocytes are contamination with nonparenchymal cells, unphysiological extracellular matrix (ECM) or lacking soluble environmental cues present in normal liver such as bile salts.</s><s>In our study, we addressed all these aspects individually.</s><s>First, a strong reduction of NPCs contamination by Percoll gradient resulted in partial suppression of genes from the inflammation/RNA processing cluster.</s><s>Second, different types of ECM were tested.</s><s>We have previously observed that recombinant extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., laminins) significantly improve hepatocyte differentiation of HLCs compared to cancer-derived matrix (e.g., matrigel) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cameron et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In primary hepatocytes, however, matrigel or laminin ECM did not provide significant improvements in expression of either 'inflammation' or 'mature liver function' genes compared to collagen I cultures.</s><s>Interestingly in hepatocyte spheroids, where cultivated hepatocytes generate their own matrix, a significant increase in genes from the 'mature liver functions' cluster was seen.</s><s>Nonetheless, this increase is small when comparing to expression levels of healthy liver.</s><s>Addition of bile salts increased expression of mature liver function genes (e.g., Bsep) although the achieved levels were again far below those of healthy liver.</s><s>Interestingly, all tested bile salts decreased inflammation cluster genes.</s><s>Knockdown of Klf6 and MafF, central transcription factors of the inflammation/RNA processing cluster, led only to a small decrease in inflammation cluster genes, suggesting that manipulation of only single transcription factors is not sufficient to tip the balance from inflamed livers back to the normal situation.</s><s>Taken together, this illustrates that several mechanisms contribute to the altered cell state; hence, none of the individual interventions can result in a full rescue.</s><s>However, the results strongly suggest that Percoll gradient purification and bile acid supplementation should be done routinely.</s><s>Also, further factors of influence such as LPS contamination of collagenase or the strong induction of several signaling pathways in response to the isolation stress ('burning hepatocyte phenomenon') were individually not sufficient to explain the altered state of cultivated hepatocytes.</s><s>In conclusion, the transcriptional state of hepatocytes in culture represents a multifactorial phenomenon that closely resembles gene expression patterns and transcriptional regulatory networks in liver disease.</s><s>For pharmacological and toxicological routine work, this means that we should be aware that the frequently applied cultivated hepatocyte systems represent an inflamed liver.</s><s>Importantly, this represents a disease model that can be exploited to develop anti-inflammatory strategies for liver disease.</s><s>It is of interest that cultivated stellate cells, even when isolated from healthy livers, have been widely used as a model of liver fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Friedman 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, cultivated primary hepatocytes represent an inflammatory model in vitro.</s></p><p><s>A question of high practical relevance is mouse-tohuman extrapolation, since most therapeutic concepts are initially tested in rodents.</s><s>However, the relevance of mouse inflammation data for humans has been challenged up to the extreme position that there are no relevant similarities at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Leist and Hartung 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The present study using mouse and human hepatocytes under identical proinflammatory culture conditions offers a blueprint for rational interspecies extrapolation.</s><s>Qualitatively similar is the inflammation/RNA processing response that in both species is driven by increased Krüppel-like factors, Sox4, Myc, Tead2 (ETF) and ELK1.</s><s>It should be considered that despite of this overall correlation, important differences can be identified, such as the key inflammation-associated transcription factor Cebpd which is upregulated in mouse, but repressed in human primary hepatocyte cultures.</s><s>A further common feature of both species is downregulation of mature liver function genes such as Pck1, Adh4 and G6pc that are more than tenfold downregulated in both species, with HNF4 as a dominant control factor.</s><s>In conclusion, the knowledge of interspecies conserved versus distinct transcriptional networks allows predicting which features observed in mice can or cannot be extrapolated to humans.</s></p><p><s>The present study leads to the following practical recommendations: (1) Sandwich cultures or spheroids provide the most effective culture conditions to sustain expression of genes associated with mature liver functions.</s><s>However, when an in vivo-like metabolism is critical, for instance in the study of metabolism-associated toxicity, compound exposures should be performed within the first 24 h of cultivation, due the time-dependent suppression of mature liver function genes.</s><s>This is even more critical for mouse than human hepatocytes.</s><s>(2) Collagen monolayers provide a system where proliferation-associated genes can be induced.</s><s>This feature is also more substantial in mouse hepatocytes which can engage in cell proliferation.</s><s>(3) When primary hepatocytes are cultivated over longer periods, they approach transcriptional states of hepatocyte cell lines and stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells.</s><s>In conclusion, the present genome-wide study of primary human and mouse hepatocytes demonstrates that the broadly applied culture systems represent models of inflamed livers.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Transcriptional alterations induced by cultivation of primary hepatocytes.</s><s>a, b Principal component analysis representing the 1000 genes with highest variance in primary mouse (a) and human (b) hepatocytes.</s><s>The top two principal components (PC1 and PC2) represent 61.2 % of the variance in a and 60.5 % in b.</s><s>The graph includes primary hepatocytes in 2D monolayer confluent (M C ) or subconfluent (M S ), and 3D (sandwich;
