<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The corrected prevalence rates derived from KiGGS Wave 1 for overweight, including obesity, in adolescents aged 11 to 17 years in Germany was 18.9 % (boys: 19.8 %; girls: 17.9 %).</s><s>In comparison to the prevalence from the KiGGS baseline survey (2003-2006) (total: 18.8 %), a stagnation in the prevalence of overweight, including obesity, has been reached.</s><s>Thus the previously reported plateauing of the prevalence of overweight, including obesity, in adolescents living in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> can be confirmed by this current nationwide sample.</s><s>However, there is still a slight tendency for increases (n.s.) in the obesity prevalence in both boys and girls.</s><s>This indicates that in this age group, a higher percentage of those with overweight are obese compared to the rates from the KiGGS baseline survey, emphasising the significance of this health issue.</s></p><p><s>Similar results have been seen in the "German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults" (DEGS1), conducted in 2008-2011.</s><s>DEGS1 showed, in comparison to studies from the 1990s, no further increase in the prevalence of overweight in women, whereas for men, a slight increase could be seen.</s><s>However, the prevalence rates for obesity increased remarkably in both men and women, especially in young adults (aged 25 to 34 years) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Similar trends have also been reported both for  children and adults on an international level <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>.</s><s>The growing number of obese adolescents and young adults is alarming.</s><s>Overweight and obese adolescents are more likely to stay obese into adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26]</ref> and when they themselves become parents and stay overweight or obese, their children are again more likely to be overweight or obese <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref>.</s><s>This cycle of the obesity epidemic needs to be interrupted since overweight and obesity is often accompanied by an increased risk for noncommunicable diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and mental health problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>.</s><s>This indicates a need for the prevention of overweight and

target="#b33">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32]</ref>, early childhood offers an effective starting point for preventive interventions.</s><s>To avoid the increase in the prevalence rate of overweight after school entry, prevention should take place, at the latest, during the kindergarten years <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>.</s><s>On a national level, the action plan "IN FORM -German national initiative to promote healthy diets and physical activity" was implemented with the aim of achieving lasting improvements with regard to the health behaviour of the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>.</s><s>For 2016, a law for the enhancement of health promotion and prevention is planned by the Federal Ministry of Health <ref type="bibr"

actions.</s></p><p><s>This study has strengths and limitations.</s><s>Strengths include the large sample size, the wide age range covered <ref type="bibr">(11-17 years)</ref> and the fact that the study was based on a nationwide sample.</s><s>A further strength is that a correction procedure was applied instead of the uncritical use of selfreported values.</s><s>The comparison of corrected with uncorrected rates of KiGGS Wave 1 emphasises the need for a correction (e.g. after correction, the obesity rates in boys doubled and in girls, tripled).</s><s>Due to the time lag and different interview modes between KiGGS baseline and KiGGS Wave 1, the method of the correction procedure Kurth and Ellert <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> developed was replicated with the self-reports derived from telephone-based KiGGS Wave 1 and the data of the measured values of a subsample.</s><s>Furthermore, the existing correction procedure was extended to include missing values on self-reported height and/or weight, which occurred in 8 % of the study population, and confidence intervals were added to the corrected prevalence rates.</s></p><p><s>One important limitation of this study is the time lag between the telephone interview where self-reported data of height and weight were collected and the physical examination of MoMo, where measurements were obtained.</s><s>For the derivation of the correction factors, the sample was restricted to participants with a time lag of less than 3 months.</s><s>A further limitation could be that KiGGS Wave 1 was based on a longitudinal sample, thus the adolescents interviewed were part of the KiGGS cohort and were thus asked to participate in KiGGS for a second time.</s><s>This could lead to a selection bias.</s><s>However, the sample weights used in the analyses include a correction for the dropout probability.</s><s>In the MoMo subsample, there might also be a selection bias that might even be stronger compared to the data of KiGGS Wave 1.</s><s>Therefore, it was preferred to correct self-reports of KiGGS Wave 1 instead of using the measured values from the MoMo subsample.</s><s>Still, there might be some selection bias left in the corrected prevalence rates, even after taking body perception and weight status based on selfreported values into account, so that the corrected prevalence rates for overweight and obesity might still be somewhat too low, but much less so than uncorrected rates.</s><s>A further advantage of the larger sample size of KiGGS Wave 1 is increased stability of the estimated rates.</s></p></div>
