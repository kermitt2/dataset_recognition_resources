Moreover, a reduction in pH decreases the adsorption of peptides to other surfaces and therefore also reduces the risk of peptide loss.</s><s>The protease inhibitors used here were chosen in order to cover a broad spectrum of endogenous peptidases: diprotin A as an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, E-64-d as an inhibitor for thiol proteases (e.g.</s><s>cathepsin B/H), antipain as an inhibitor for trypsin, papain and cathepsin A/B, leupeptin as an inhibitor for trypsin, plasmin, papain and cathepsin and chymostatin as an inhibitor for chymotrypsin, papain and cathepsin B/G.</s><s>Moreover, isotopic peptides are useful in order to assess the improvement of recovery by the method.</s><s>Lastly, as the rate of the enzymesubstrate complex formation depends on the concentration of the enzyme (peptidase) and the substrate (peptide hormone) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> dilution of the plasma reduces the rate of formation and therefore degradation (a tenfold dilution reduces the rate a hundredfold according to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics).</s></p><p><s>Despite the advantages of the RAPID method, several limitations of the method should be acknowledged as well.</s><s>The most critical step of the protocol is time.</s><s>Blood samples should be diluted in the RAPID buffer immediately after blood withdrawal which may be difficult in the clinical setting.</s><s>Moreover, the method is more time consuming, requires a higher level of training and is also more expensive than standard blood processing.</s><s>Although it may be challenging to implement in clinical routine, it will be helpful for research purposes, especially when only subtle differences are expected and therefore a high yield of the peptide is desirable.</s></p><p><s>Although the RAPID method is described and recommended with all its components (Reduced temperatures, Acidification, Protease inhibition, Isotopic exogenous controls and Dilution) in the present paper, future studies may use modifications of this technique.</s><s>The use of isotopic exogenous controls may not be mandatory and therefore restricted to pilot studies in order to assess which peptides show the greatest improvement in recovery using RAPID processing.</s><s>Moreover, also the composition of the protease inhibitor cocktail may be modified when other peptides are assessed.</s><s>However, this should be tested when a new peptide is measured.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the RAPID method of blood processing can be used for human blood and greatly improved the recovery of 9/9 peptides tested compared to standard blood processing.</s><s>Since for some peptides only a small to moderate improvement of recovery was observed, the necessity of the method may have to be tested when a new peptide is analyzed.</s><s>Moreover, the RAPID method allows for the detection of the correct molecular form as shown for acyl ghrelin and also considerably increases the yield of endogenous circulating levels of peptides such as kisspeptin compared to standard blood processing.</s><s>Therefore, this method should be a useful tool in human studies assessing circulating peptide levels, e.g.</s><s>those involved in the regulation of hunger and satiety.</s></p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">, Therefore, in studies investigating the regulatory mechanisms of hunger and satiety peptide levels are often assessed and at the same time, it is assumed that the peptide studied is stable and recovered at high yields during plasma formation. However, very often this is not the case due to rapid endogenous breakdown as shown before for e.g. ghrelin which is degraded from acyl to desacyl ghrelin</note>
