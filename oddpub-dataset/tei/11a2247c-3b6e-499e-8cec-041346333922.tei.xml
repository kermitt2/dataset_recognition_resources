<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This multicentre, phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (Clinicaltrials.</s><s>gov trial registration number: NCT00645788; EudraCT number: 2008-008314-40) was conducted at 73 centres: USA (51), Canada (3), Germany (4), Sweden (3), Denmark (1), Israel (4), UK (1) and Australia (6).</s><s>All study personnel and participants were blinded with respect to active treatment (ciprofloxacin DPI, formulated by Novartis' PulmoSphere technology, or placebo), but not to dose.</s><s>The study protocol was amended several times after enrolment started; the most important changes were the inclusion of children aged 12-17 years on availability of safety and pharmacokinetic data, and the addition of a higher ciprofloxacin DPI dose group (48.75 mg) approximately 1 year after the first participants were enrolled.</s><s>The decision to add the higher dose was based on the good safety results with the 32.5 mg dose and the desire to investigate more than one dose in the phase II trial.</s><s>Investigation of the higher dose was also recommended by regulatory authorities to help to determine the most appropriate doses to carry forward into the phase III programme.</s></p><p><s>Participants were stratified according to maintenance macrolide usage (ie, participants currently treated with macrolide vs participants not currently treated with macrolide), and randomised 2:2:2:1 to 32.5 mg ciprofloxacin DPI (corresponding to 50 mg dry powder); placebo corresponding to 32.5 mg ciprofloxacin DPI; 48.75 mg ciprofloxacin DPI (corresponding to 75 mg dry powder); or placebo corresponding to 48.75 mg ciprofloxacin DPI (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>All treatments were given twice daily for 29 days (±1 day).</s><s>Global Biostatistics, Bayer Pharma AG, assigned the randomisation and drug pack numbers using a central, secure randomisation system.</s><s>These assignments were then communicated via an interactive voice-response system.</s><s>All patients maintained their standard treatment, which may have included Pulmozyme (dornase α), albuterol, inhaled steroids, macrolides, saline inhalation and β-agonists (long-acting and short-acting) (stable regimen ≥30 days prior to study drug administration).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility</head><p><s>Participants with a documented diagnosis of CF and chronic colonisation with P. aeruginosa, who were in a stable clinical condition and on a stable treatment regimen, were eligible for inclusion in the trial.</s><s>The main inclusion criteria were age ≥12 years and CF diagnosed by clinical findings and one of the following: a positive sweat chloride test; homozygosity for ΔF508 genetic mutation or a compound heterogeneous genotype for two known CF mutations; a positive sputum or throat swab culture for P. aeruginosa within the previous 12 months.</s><s>Participants were also required to meet specific entry criteria at the screening visit, specifically: a stable pulmonary status with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) ≥35% to ≤75%; room air oximetry ≥88% saturation; absence of antibiotic treatment (with the exception of macrolides, which were allowed concomitantly as part of the standard treatment regimen) for pulmonary exacerbation within 30 days before study drug administration (non-antipseudomonal antibiotics were allowed for other indications); or a stable treatment regimen for 30 days before and throughout the study duration.</s><s>Patients on long-term on-off cycles of tobramycin or colistin treatment for CF were enrolled in their month off, and visits were scheduled to ensure that the start of study treatment was not delayed beyond the minimum 30-day washout period.</s></p><p><s>The main exclusion criteria included: findings on screening history and physical examination unrelated to CF that could affect efficacy measurements; colonisation with P. aeruginosa and a ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≥256 µg/mL; respiratory tract colonisation with Burkholderia cepacia complex within the preceding 12 months; symptomatic aspergillosis; haemoptysis ≥300 mL or requiring blood transfusion within the preceding 4 weeks; a history of severe allergies; pregnancy; and participants &lt;18 years with chronic musculoskeletal disease or abnormal musculoskeletal evaluation at baseline, a high risk of chronic or recurrent arthritis or tendonitis, or a history of quinolone-related arthropathy.</s></p><p><s>All participants (or legal representatives) gave written informed consent and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and with local legal and regulatory requirements.</s></p></div>

p=0.068).</s><s>This finding has been noted in trials of other therapeutic agents, such as colistin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">26</ref></s><s>ignificant improvements in health-related quality of life, assessed with the CFQ-R, were observed in the ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg treatment group versus placebo as well as in pooled analyses at EOT ( p=0.007 in the 32.5 mg ciprofloxacin DPI group vs matching placebo), although these improvements were not sustained at the 4-week follow-up visit ( p=0.935 in the 32.5 mg ciprofloxacin DPI group vs matching placebo).</s></p><p><s>Several factors may have contributed to the primary end point not being met.</s><s>Overall, the patients represented a heavily managed older population: approximately 77% of patients had received prior antipseudomonal maintenance therapy and mean age was 29.3 years; (16.8% of patients were aged ≤20 years), indicating a relatively advanced disease state in most patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">27</ref></s><s>The limited progress in treatment over the last decade has reduced the potential to see clinically meaningful improvements in FEV1.</s><s>Additionally, the lungs of older patients with CF are damaged to the point that significant improvements in FEV1 are less likely.</s><s>Although suboptimal drug delivery or penetration could potentially have influenced the results of our study, data from phase I studies in CF participants indicate that twice daily ciprofloxacin DPI administration results in mean sputum ciprofloxacin concentrations of 34.9-149.7 mg/L, which are well above plasma levels achieved by systemic ciprofloxacin use (1.2-3.0 mg/L). <ref type="bibr">28 29</ref></s><s>In addition, scintigraphic data support high and reproducible lung deposition of approximately 50% in healthy study participants and in patients with non-CF bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30</ref></s><s>We therefore believe it is unlikely that poor drug delivery or penetration influenced the results.</s><s>The overall reason for lack of FEV1 improvement in patients with CF treated with ciprofloxacin DPI is unknown, but this result demonstrates the complexity of CF inhalation studies and the possible need to consider alternative clinical end points in this population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref></s><s>mall airway occlusion by purulent mucus is common in the lungs of patients with CF, and this is likely to be more severe in patients with advanced disease.</s><s>Disease severity may therefore influence distribution and location of the inhaled drug, as with any inhaled antibiotic.</s><s>This, in turn, can affect the local concentration of ciprofloxacin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref></s><s>In addition to improved airway clearance before DPI administration, altering the dosing frequency may help to mitigate these challenges.</s><s>In a study of levofloxacin inhalation solution, improved outcomes were observed with higher doses (240 mg twice daily vs 120 mg twice daily). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref></s><s>In our study, however, there was no statistically significant difference between doses for the primary end point.</s><s>The reasons for this are unclear, but may relate to a limited potential for improvement in this heavily pretreated patient population.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the safety parameters-type of TEAEs and their intensity, relationship to the study drug, seriousness and outcome-remained similar in all groups.</s><s>There were three cases of haemoptysis considered to be related to the study drug, two of which were serious.</s><s>However, it should be noted that haemoptysis is not an uncommon manifestation of pulmonary disease in CF.</s><s>The 32.5 mg ciprofloxacin DPI seemed to be slightly better tolerated than the 48.75 mg ciprofloxacin DPI, with fewer cases of discontinuation due to AEs and fewer drug-related TEAEs.</s><s>In both treatment groups, the incidence of cough was low.</s><s>Inhalation of dry powder can result in cough, owing to the nature of the dosage form <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> ; however, in this study, although the inhaled mass was greater than that inhaled with the TOBI Podhaler, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> a low incidence of cough was reported.</s><s>This may be due to the fact that ciprofloxacin DPI is less osmotic than tobramycin; therefore, a lesser effect is being exerted on the lung epithelium.</s></p><p><s>Because of the short-term nature of this study, we are unable to speculate on the impact of ciprofloxacin DPI therapy on the effectiveness of future oral ciprofloxacin in this patient population.</s><s>Studies with tobramycin solution for inhalation indicate that intermittent use in patients with CF results in modest increases in P. aeruginosa MIC values, but the increased MICs are not associated with clinically relevant effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34</ref></s><s>However, to date, no study has specifically examined the effect of inhaled antibiotics on subsequent systemic therapy with the same drug or drug class.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, in patients with CF, twice daily treatment with ciprofloxacin DPI (32.5 or 48.75 mg) for 28 days did not result in significant improvements versus placebo in change in FEV1 from baseline to EOT, although some encouraging signs of efficacy were observed.</s><s>It is possible that FEV1 is not the best end point for evaluating the efficacy of a short-term treatment on lung function in such a patient population.</s><s>Ciprofloxacin DPI was safe and well tolerated; the 32.5 mg dose had a slightly more favourable overall tolerability profile than the 48.75 mg ciprofloxacin DPI dose.</s><s>Additional studies assessing the efficacy of longer term (&gt;28 days) treatment as indicated by alternative end points, as well as further investigations on optimal delivery of ciprofloxacin DPI in stable patients with CF, may be worth pursuing.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Study design (A) and subject disposition (B).</s><s>(A) Subjects were stratified based on maintenance macrolide usage and randomised 2:2:2:1 to receive twice daily: 32.5 mg ciprofloxacin DPI (corresponding to 50 mg dry powder);
