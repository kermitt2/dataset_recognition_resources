<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (EARTH EXPLORER 1; NCT01706926) was conducted in 48 specialist sites (14 countries; Europe, South America, South Africa) (see online supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Population pharmacokinetic efficacy modelling and stochastic clinical trial simulations facilitated selection of the optimal dose range for the study.</s></p><p><s>Due to the theoretical risk associated with GM−CSF inhibition and data from non-clinical (animal toxicology) studies of mavrilimumab, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">21</ref> standardised pulmonary monitoring with independent expert adjudication was undertaken. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">22</ref></s><s>he study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Guidance for Good Clinical Practice and approved by appropriate institutional review boards or independent ethics committees at each site.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Patients were 18-80 years with moderate-to-severe, adult-onset RA, 23 DAS28−C reactive protein (CRP) ≥3.2 at screening and DAS28−ESR ≥3.2 at day 1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">24</ref> and ≥4 swollen joints at screening and day 1, and were receiving stable dosages of MTX (7.5-25.0</s><s>mg/week).</s><s>Patients were required to have received treatment with ≥1 traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) prior to screening.</s><s>Previous treatment with any biological DMARD discontinued because of lack of efficacy; recent treatment with any investigational drug, alkylating agents or parenteral steroids; and concurrent treatment with DMARDs other than MTX were not permitted.</s><s>Changes in background RA treatment were not allowed for the first 12 weeks of the study, other than for safety reasons.</s><s>Patients with clinically uncontrolled respiratory disease, active infection or high infection risk, and active or untreated latent tuberculosis were excluded.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent and were enrolled by the investigator or qualified designee.</s><s>Study-stopping criteria are listed in the online supplementary material.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomisation and masking</head><p><s>Patients were randomised (interactive web response system) 1:1:1:1 to 150, 100 or 30 mg subcutaneous mavrilimumab or placebo eow in combination with stable dosages of MTX (7.5-25.0</s><s>mg/week) for 24 weeks, followed by transfer to a longterm, open-label extension (OLE) (NCT01712399) or a 12-week safety follow-up period.</s><s>Study patients, investigators and sponsors were blinded to study treatment (see online supplementary material).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p><s>During the 24-week treatment period, there were 14 scheduled visits (weeks 0, 1, 2 and eow until week 24).</s><s>The safety follow-up period included visits at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the last dose.</s><s>Twelve weeks after treatment initiation, patients without adequate response (&lt;20% improvement in both swollen and tender joint counts vs day 1) were eligible for early OLE entry.</s><s>Corticosteroids (≤7.5 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent), analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were maintained at stable dosages for the study duration.</s></p></div>
