<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study design and participants</head><p><s>In a Dutch multi-centre, randomised controlled screening trial (COlonoscopy or COlonography for Screening (COCOS) trial, 2009-2010, trial number: 2009/03WBO and NTR1829, The Hague, Netherlands) comparing primary colonoscopy to CTC <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, patients in the CTC-arm with one or two small 6-9 mm colorectal lesions were advised to undergo a surveillance CTC after an interval of three years.</s><s>Patients with more than two 6-9 mm polyps or larger polyps on baseline CTC were referred for colonoscopy directly and therefore not included in the present follow-up study.</s><s>The 95 small lesions detected on index CTC in this patient subpopulation were thus left in situ and re-measured at follow-up to assess the percentage of volumetric change for each lesion over the entire surveillance interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Based on volumetric change on CTC over the entire surveillance interval as proportion of baseline volume, lesions were classified as either grown (N30% growth), stable (b30% regression to b30% growth) or regressed (N30% regression).</s><s>Details of this method and the choice of the 30% cut-off are described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Following the surveillance CTC, all patients were offered a colonoscopy for resection of the lesions.</s><s>Location and size of the polyp on colonoscopy were recorded.</s><s>The distal colon was defined as rectum and sigmoid.</s><s>From those lesions for which histopathology was available, formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material was retrieved and reviewed by an expert pathologist (GAM).</s><s>Based on histopathology and size at colonoscopy, lesions were classified as non-advanced adenoma, advanced adenoma, non-advanced serrated polyp or advanced serrated polyp according to the definitions summarised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Ethics approval from the Dutch Health Council was obtained for COCOS, including surveillance CTC after 3 years.</s><s>Patients had already given their written informed consent to be contacted for follow-up studies and consented to this study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Procedures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">DNA isolation</head><p><s>DNA was isolated as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In brief, DNA from FFPE material was isolated following micro-dissection (N 70% tumour cells).</s><s>A six-day incubation period with proteinase K in lysis buffer (ATL buffer, QIAmp, DNA micro-kit, Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands)</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research in context</head><p><s>Evidence before this study We searched Pubmed (from June 1, 2015 up to March 1, 2018) with a combination of relevant key terms including: colonic lesions, polyps, natural history, evolution, growth, progression, follow-up, mutation, copy number changes and molecular profile.</s><s>Inherent to the fact that colorectal polyps are removed once detected on endoscopy, molecular features of these lesions cannot be correlated to longitudinal observations on phenotype changes.</s><s>Therefore, the knowledge on the biology of colorectal cancer progression gathered up to now is mainly based on cross-sectional studies.</s><s>Next to the sequence of mutations classically associated with adenoma to carcinoma progression, we have previously shown that certain DNA copy number alterations are associated with progression of cancer.</s><s>In one study where polyps were left in situ and followed up in time, mutation burden was correlated with polyp growth.</s><s>However, comprehensive analysis of DNA alterations (i.e.</s><s>sequence mutations, promoter methylation, DNA copy number changes and MMR status) in longitudinally observed polyps has never been performed.</s><s>To enhance our understanding of the natural course of disease in colorectal polyps, we set out to assess the association between DNA alterations and in vivo growth in small colorectal polyps.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Added value of this study</head><p><s>We had access to a unique set of 65 small polyps that had been followed longitudinally, and performed a comprehensive analysis of DNA alterations in these polyps, including DNA copy number, mutation, CIMP and MMR status.</s><s>For the first time we were able to show that regressed polyps did not harbour DNA copy number alterations or mutations associated with later stages of polyp to cancer progression.</s><s>Higher growth rates were observed in lesions with cancer associated DNA copy number alterations (cancer associated events or CAEs), as well as in lesions with a higher mutation burden.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications of all the available evidence</head><p><s>Since approximately only 5% of all colorectal adenomas eventually progress to cancer, strategies for early detection ideally should focus on identifying only those 5% of lesions that progress and ignore the 95% of polyps that will not harm patients.</s><s>In this in vivo human longitudinal study we have provided insights in the DNA alterations of small colorectal polyps and their growth over time.</s><s>These insights can guide the development of new specific and sensitive screening and surveillance methods.</s><s>was performed.</s><s>Every day, proteinase K (10 μl or 20 ng/μl) was freshly added.</s><s>DNA was isolated using the QIAmp DNA micro-kit (Qiagen) and concentrations and purity were measured on a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Isogen, IJsselstein, The Netherlands).</s><s>Isolated DNA was used as input for copy number analysis, mutation analysis and CIMP analysis, in that order specifically.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In the present study, we sought to evaluate whether growing colorectal polyps showed distinct molecular features associated with progression, compared to lesions that regressed or remained stable over time.</s><s>To this aim, we performed detailed molecular analyses in a set of 65 small (6-9 mm) colorectal polyps that were removed three years after initial identification by CTC.</s></p><p><s>Higher growth rates were related to presence of non-random DNA copy number alterations associated with colorectal adenoma to carcinoma progression (cancer associated events or CAEs), as well as to increased mutation burden.</s><s>Regressed lesions did not show CAEs, but did have mutations in genes involved in common CRC pathways, which concerned mostly APC mutations.</s><s>Because APC inactivation is such an early event in adenoma genesis, it may not prevent lesions from regressing.</s><s>The only mutation besides APC that was present in one of the regressed lesions was in the SMO gene, a rare mutation occurring in 0.9% of CRCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The SMO protein is a component of the hedgehog signalling pathway, which has been shown to negatively regulate WNT signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In gastric cancers, however, SMO mutations were found not to be associated with altered expression of hedgehog target genes, indicating that these are probably passenger mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our observation that multiple mutations are already present in a substantial proportion of small colorectal polyps is in line with previous observations that detectable mutations occurred at an early stage of polyp development, at a mean size of only 30 ± 35 crypts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>For perspective; lesions of 10mm 3 contain approximately 3 × 10 5 crypts.</s><s>Many of the somatic mutations detected in tumours may occur even before morphologically recognisable tumour formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>Recent data show that in ~1% of morphologically normal colorectal crypts driver mutations were already present <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In approximately one third of the adenomas (6/19; 32%) with APC mutations, also mutations in the PI3K, RAS-MAPK, or p53 pathways occurred.</s><s>However, only two of these adenomas with additional mutations in the PI3K, RAS-MAPK, or p53 pathways were at high risk of progression based on the criterion of having ≥2 CAEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Accumulating evidence suggests that whereas mutations in driver genes are already present early in precancerous lesions, chromosomal instability is a late phenomenon during adenoma to carcinoma progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, copy number alterations likely play a more critical role in malignant transformation.</s><s>This is functionally supported by the observation that engineered patient-derived, adenoma organoids with critical driver mutations, only obtained metastatic capacity when CIN was present <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>The results from our study confirm that mutations, present in regressed, stable and grown lesions, do not reflect polyp risk of progression, whereas CAEs, only present in stable and grown lesions, may likely do so.</s></p><p><s>Identifying adenomas with a high progression risk is of value for clinical practice.</s><s>At the current moment, adenomas ≥10 mm, with villous component or high-grade dysplasia are considered high risk -or advanced -adenomas.</s><s>Yet, this definition gives a suboptimal estimation of the true risk of progression and has been introduced and adopted in literature without much evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>The presence of more ≥2 CAEs more precisely reflects the natural course of the disease and more specifically identifies adenomas at high risk of progressing to cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Previous research has shown that only 25% of advanced adenomas and 3% of non-advanced adenomas presented with ≥2 CAEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, suggesting that the majority of advanced adenomas should not be considered high risk, whereas a small proportion of non-advanced adenomas should.</s><s>The problem associated with the definition of advanced adenoma, is also reflected by studies that investigated the relationship between polyp growth and the risk of progression, taking advanced adenomas as the endpoint <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>In the original description of our cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the rates of advanced adenomas were 47%, 21% and zero in progressed, stable and regressed lesions, respectively.</s><s>As 6-9 mm polyps that grow will easily qualify as advanced adenoma, when reaching 10 mm or more, we hypothesised that these rates were an overestimation of the actual risk of progression.</s><s>Indeed, when focusing on molecular features rather than phenotypical features to define highrisk adenomas, only 13% of the adenomas that had grown, 11% of the stable adenomas and none of the regressed adenomas had ≥2 CAEs.</s><s>Although numbers are small, these last rates appear to be more consistent with the actual progression risk, as it is estimated that approximately 5% of adenomas eventually progress to cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The application of CAEs to identify high risk adenomas could be used in the development of novel diagnostic screening tests.</s><s>After all, screening programs ideally should aim to detect precursor lesions just before they transform to colorectal cancer, in order to reduce both cancer incidence and mortality.</s><s>In addition, molecularly-defined high risk adenomas could impact surveillance.</s><s>According to the current postpolypectomy colonoscopy surveillance guideline, the presence of advanced adenomas shortens the surveillance interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>In our study a total of 18 patients had at least one advanced adenoma based on phenotypical features at follow-up colonoscopy, compared to five patients based on molecular features (of which only three overlapping between the groups), which suggests overdiagnosis is happening with the current strategy.</s><s>With the technical advancements over the recent years low cost and fast methods for copy number profiling have become available <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>This makes the use of CAEs for risk stratified surveillance a realistic approach, although first further research is needed to assess the correlation between the presence of molecularly-defined high risk adenomas and the risk of metachronous lesions.</s></p><p><s>The use of CAEs as progression biomarker only applies to adenomas and not to serrated polyps.</s><s>In the present cohort, CAEs were absent in serrated polyps irrespective of their growth category.</s><s>This is not surprising, since progression of this lesion type is associated with the acquisition of MSI instead of CIN and therefore different molecular events Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.
