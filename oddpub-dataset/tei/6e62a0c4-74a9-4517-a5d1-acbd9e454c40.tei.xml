<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective</head><p><s>We aimed to grade disease severity in PTB patients at diagnosis and after completion of DOTS treatment by developing a reading scheme based on five different radiographic manifestations and analyze their association with the clinical parameters of systemic involvement and infectivity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>141 HIV-negative adults with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive PTB were enrolled in a prospective observational study in Hyderabad, India.</s><s>The presence and extent on CXRs Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health problem with an estimated 9.0 million incident cases and 1.5 million deaths in 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>India alone accounts for an estimated 2.2 million cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>According to the WHO guidelines for TB control, early diagnosis of pulmonary TB (PTB) by smear microscopy remains the main procedure in low-income settings, even though it has the drawbacks of low specificity and variable sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In India, the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program RNTCP recommends the use of chest radiography (CXR), where available, as an additional screening tool to increase the sensitivity of the diagnostic algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, certain radiographic features and scoring systems have been described for the identification of PTB by CXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>However, these features are not fully pathognomonic for PTB and lack reproducibility, especially when used in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>CXR also potentially provides useful information for grading the extent of pulmonary involvement and disease severity at diagnosis, as well as for assessing treatment outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>The pathologic features of PTB exhibit wide heterogeneity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, e.g., in reports from the pre-antibiotic era, at least two distinct types of pathology in pulmonary TB-a nodular form and tuberculous pneumonia-have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it seems likely that specific radiographic features at diagnosis, as well as after treatment, might differ between patients not only as a result of disease severity, but also differences in disease pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>The extent of infected lung tissue destruction is linked to disease severity, bacillary load, and disease spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, lung remodeling and pathological scarring often occurs during the course of the disease, despite pathogen clearance under Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>As a result, short-and long-term disease effects can lead to persistent impairment of lung function, despite microbiological cure, in a significant proportion of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>To analyze whether specific radiographic features are related to disease severity at diagnosis, they can be correlated with other well-known parameters of disease severity and infectivity, such as BMI, sputum smear positivity and the FEV1.</s><s>Some of the CXR features have already been found to be related to the extent of pulmonary pathology and are associated with clinical signs of disease severity and infectivity: BMI is a well-recognized clinical measure of TB severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; and malnutrition is also known to be associated with the radiographic extent of pulmonary disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies have also shown that patients with cavitary PTB have higher bacterial loads in their sputum <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, in one study, the area of alveolar infiltrates was also found to be associated with sputum smear positivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, these studies used different CXR reading schemes for the characterization of pulmonary involvement, e.g., by dividing the lungs into parts: upper and lower lobes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, thirds <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, quarters <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, by using additional scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> or by grading the density of infiltrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, a new numerical scoring system was suggested to grade disease severity at diagnosis and predict treatment outcome by using two-month smear status as an outcome measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>This score was derived from the percentage of affected lung by grading visual estimation of the extent of any dense or patchy opacification, cavitation, or other pathology as percentage plus 40, if cavitation was present <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>These authors also demonstrated that this numerical score correlated with BMI, sputum smear positivity, as well as FEV1, as well-known clinical parameters of disease severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>However, the expression of pulmonary involvement as a numerical score might not reflect the heterogeneity of pulmonary pathology since different CXR features are not related to disease severity to the same extent.</s><s>For instance, areas of higher density on CXR due to pulmonary scaring which also contribute to the extent of the area of lung affected might not mirror active disease and thus the extent of tissue destruction to the same degree than alveolar infiltrates which are most likely reflecting the early inflammatory state of acute post primary PTB and in particular of tuberculous pneumonia <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that distinct CXR features are differentially associated with disease severity and might thus be differently associated to the BMI and sputum smear positivity as clinical parameters of disease severity.</s><s>In addition it is not known whether and to what extent specific CXR features at diagnosis are associated with lung impairment after the completion of treatment.</s><s>Therefore to independently grade different CXR features that have been associated with PTB might allow an improved description of CXR changes in TB patients after DOTS treatment in the field, which might help to facilitate more tailor-made treatment in TB care, in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>The aim of this study was to grade disease severity in HIV-negative adult patients with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive PTB, in a prospective study in Hyderabad/India, using a new system that independently determines the presence and extent of five different manifestations of radiographic findings that are associated with PTB <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>The following radiographic manifestations were classified: (i) extent of lung involvement, (ii) extent of alveolar infiltration, (iii) the presence of cavitation, (iv) the presence of lymphadenopathy, and (v) the presence of pleural effusion.</s><s>With regard to the manifestation `extent of lung involve-ment´, we combined and simplified the reading schemes for this manifestation suggested by Ralph et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and the radiographic reading scheme suggested by Baez-Saldana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> making use of a quadrant scheme.</s><s>In addition, the presence or absence of cavities, mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion was noted, but the extent of these manifestations was not assessed.</s><s>In order to justify the assumption that each manifestation of our CXR reading scheme correlates with other well-known parameters of disease severity at diagnosis, we analyzed its association with the clinical parameters of systemic involvement (BMI) and infectivity (sputum smear positivity).</s><s>The presence and extent of the radiographic manifestations on CXR at diagnosis were further compared with those following the completion of 6 months of DOTS treatment, to further assess whether changes in the appearance of the different CXR manifestations with treatment were associated with subsequent improvement.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design, setting, and participants</head><p><s>We performed an observational study at the Mahavir hospital and research center in Hyderabad, India.</s><s>The recruitment of study participants was carried out prospectively from July 26, 2011 to November 21, 2013; all 141 individuals with PTB within the study period were recruited according to the following inclusion criteria.</s><s>We recruited only patients who were newly diagnosed with a sputum smear-positive PTB disease, who did not have previous exposure to TB antibiotic therapy and were registered in the Hyderabad DOTS program at Mahavir hospital.</s><s>All participants tested negative for HIV.</s><s>The diagnostic criterion for the presence of PTB was the presence of at least two initial sputum smear examinations positive for Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB), in accordance with the Indian technical and operational guidelines for TB control <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The DOTS treatment was according to the RNTCP and consisted of one intensive phase with isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), and ethambutol (E) administered under direct observation three times per week on alternate days, for 2 months, followed by a continuation phase for 4 months with H and R administered thrice per week on alternate days with at least the first dose of every week being directly observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>The dosage strengths of drugs used under DOTS consist of H: (600 mg), R: (450 mg), Z: (1500 mg), E: (1200 mg) or S (streptomycin): (750 mg).</s><s>Patients who weighed 60 kg or more received additional 150 mg R, patients who were more than 50 years old received 500 mg S instead of E, patients who weighed less than 30 kg received drugs according to body weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>All study participants gave their written informed consent before the investigations and the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee for bio-medical research, Bhagwan Mahavir Medical Research Centre, Hyderabad, India.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variables, data sources and measurements</head><p><s>Demographic data, including gender, age and BMI, along with data on smoking and drinking habits, were recorded using the hospital's standard DOTS program questionnaire.</s><s>The final treatment outcome was recorded as cured, failed, default, lost to follow-up, and death.</s><s>The demographic data were obtained directly from patients or their relatives during an interview performed by a trained researcher at initial recruitment to the study.</s><s>Other relevant clinical data, including the results of the sputum smear microscopy and the serological HIV test result, were obtained from the hospital's TB control program records and medical staff.</s><s>Sputum smears were examined at the time of diagnosis and after two month of treatment for AFB using Ziehl-Neelsen staining and graded by standard criteria as follows: no AFB in 100 High-Power Field (HPF) (negative), 1-9 AFB in 100 HPF (Scanty), 10-99 AFB in 100 HPF (1+), 1-10 AFB per field in at least 50 HPF (2+) and &gt; 10 AFB per HPF in at least 20 (3+) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of the chest radiographs</head><p><s>All patients underwent postero-anterior CXR at the start of DOTS treatment using a Siemens Heliophos D X-ray generator (Siemens, Mumbai-India).</s><s>Because CXR is not part of the standard follow-up for PTB patients at Mahavir hospital's DOTS program, only 62 patients also underwent additional CXR after completing 6 months of treatment.</s><s>CXRs were first assessed by two radiologists who, by consensus, developed an assessment scheme for the radiographic manifestations indicative of the presence and extent of lung involvement in PTB, as described below.</s><s>Subsequently, two independent radiologists analyzed these manifestations to assess inter-reader reliability.</s><s>All radiologists were blind in relation to the clinical data.</s><s>In order to define the extent of the two pulmonary manifestations area of lung involvement and alveolar infiltrates, each lung was divided into two halves, an upper and a lower half, by a horizontal line drawn at the level of the upper endplate of a thoracic vertebra situated immediately below the tracheal carina.</s><s>The four resulting quadrants were designated as follows: I, right upper quadrant (RUQ), II, right lower quadrant (RLQ), III, left upper quadrant (LUQ), and IV, left lower quadrant (LLQ) S1 Fig, and as proposed by Baez-Saldana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>The total area of lung affected by any parenchymal lesion was determined by counting the number of quadrants involved, i.e., from one to four and each quadrant accounting for 25% of the total extent.</s><s>This is a more simplified scheme than the one recently proposed which is based on the total percentage of affected lung by visual estimation of the extent and density of opacification, cavitation, or other pathology as a percentage of visible lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In a next step, the extent of alveolar infiltrates was separately graded using the four-quadrant scheme.</s><s>Alveolar infiltrate, a term still preferably used by clinicians, relates to areas of patchy or confluent opacities, in contrast to nodular lesions, airway disease, a miliary pattern, or parenchymal scarring.</s><s>Moreover, cavities, when present, were assigned to one or more quadrants, e.g., I for cavitation in RUQ.</s><s>No attempt was made to evaluate the size of the cavities, and the presence or absence of mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy along with pleural effusion was noted, but the extent or localization in the four-quadrant scheme of these manifestations was not assessed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical methods</head><p><s>Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) or median ± Interquartile Range (IQR) and categorical variables as the frequency count and percentage.</s><s>Interobserver agreement between radiologists regarding categorical variables was assessed with kappa statistics, the initial kappa values were prevalence and bias, adjusted as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and interpreted according to the approach of Landis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>The agreement in continuous variables was assessed using correlation analysis and the method of Bland and Altman <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The association of individual CXR features and clinical characteristics was assessed with univariable and multivariable regression analysis: linear regression was used for continuous dependent variables, such as the BMI, and ordinal regression for ordinal dependent variables such as the sputum smear microscopy.</s><s>The goodness of fit of the regression models was evaluated with ANOVA and goodness of fit tests for linear and ordinal regressions respectively, and the amount of variation explained by the model with the R 2 and pseudo R 2 tests for linear and ordinal regressions, respectively.</s><s>In the case of ordinal regression, the proportional odds assumption was assessed with the test of parallel lines.</s><s>The differences between the extent of CXR features at diagnosis and after completion of 6 months of DOTS treatment were analysed with the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, McNemar test, and repeated measures multinomial regression for continuous, categorical binary and categorical ordinal variables, respectively.</s><s>The difference in BMI gain, depending on the affected lung area, was assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test.</s><s>SPSS 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois-USA) was used for data analysis and values of p &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</s><s>The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Guidelines were used as a reporting guide for this observational study <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, our aim was to grade the severity of pulmonary involvement of PTB with a new reading scheme based on the assessment of the presence and extent of different radiographic manifestations associated with PTB <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>The extent of lung involvement and the extent of alveolar infiltrates were graded by making use of a four quadrant scheme.</s><s>The presence of cavities, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were included as either present or not present.</s><s>By applying this radiographic reading scheme, we found that, in our PTB patients, an average lung area of 51.7% +/-23.3% was affected by radiographic abnormalities at diagnosis.</s><s>In addition, 94% of the patients had alveolar infiltrates at least in one quadrant and, in 89.4% of the cases, infiltration could be observed in the upper quadrants, suggesting that most of these patients had post primary PTB.</s><s>This is in agreement with other studies which reported that post primary TB occurs in immunocompetent adults and accounts for about 80% of all clinical cases and nearly 100% of infection transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, cavitation was found in 29.1% of the patients, which is in agreement with the prevalence reported by other studies in PTB patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, good inter-reader reliability could be found for grading the affected lung area, as well as for grading the extent of alveolar infiltrates, suggesting that our simple reading scheme has the potential for accurate and reproducible CXR grading of disease severity of PTB.</s><s>For the detection of cavities, inter-reader reliability was surprisingly moderate.</s><s>Therefore, cavitation can be a very distinct feature of PTB that is easy to detect, but in other settings, it can be overlooked <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To substantiate our finding that different CXR manifestations correlate with BMI and sputum smear positivity as adequate well-known parameters of disease severity at diagnosis, we found that the extent of lung involvement was related to BMI, whereas the extent of alveolar infiltrates, along with the presence of cavitation, was strongly associated with sputum smear positivity.</s><s>Our findings are in agreement with those that found a similar correlation between BMI and radiographic features of lung involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>By assessing the extent of alveolar infiltrates with the new reading scheme, we found that this feature was associated with sputum smear positivity.</s><s>In the early inflammatory state of acute post primary PTB, the extent of local pulmonary disease pathology, and in particular of tuberculous pneumonia, has been shown to be associated with the bacillary load in the sputum of TB patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, our findings support the observation that the extent of alveolar infiltrates assessed with the new reading scheme reflects this early state in PTB and its relation to increased infectivity.</s><s>As expected, we also found an association between sputum smear positivity and the presence of cavities, which is in agreement with the findings of several other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>The presence of lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion, albeit with a fair level of agreement, was neither associated with BMI nor with sputum smear positivity.</s><s>Consequently, these CXR features most likely reflect the local disease status.</s></p><p><s>Our results suggest that the use of individual CXR manifestations might be more appropriate and practical in assessing disease severity than the use of a score system.</s><s>Although the extent of alveolar infiltrates and cavitation are both predictors of sputum smear positivity, alveolar infiltration has a higher level of agreement between radiologists and, therefore, it might be a more reliable proxy marker of infectivity.</s><s>It is also probable that each CXR manifestation reflects different pathophysiological stages of the disease.</s><s>We judged the association of the proportion of affected lung area and cavitation as evaluated in our reading scheme with twomonth sputum smear status as recently suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, but we did not find an association between the extents of affected lung area or cavitation and two-month sputum smear status.</s><s>However, the methodology that we used to assess lung involvement was not entirely comparable to the one previously used <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which might be the reason for the discrepancies between the two studies.</s><s>A recent meta-analysis revealed that sputum smear examination at the end of the second month of treatment has only low sensitivity and modest specificity for predicting treatment failure and relapse, therefore it might not greatly add to scoring systems for predicting the outcome of PTB <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The microbiological cure rate in our study after 6 months of DOTS treatment was 95%, although 4% of patients still had positive sputum smear after two months of treatment.</s><s>Accordingly, CXR findings of all patients improved after 6 months of treatment.</s><s>But, approximately one third of the patients still showed PTB associated radiographic abnormalities in at least one quadrant.</s><s>Noteworthy, it was recently shown that in patients with cured PTB, the degree of radiographic abnormalities evaluated using a scoring system comparable to the one used in our study, was significantly and inversely associated with spirometric impairment assessed by FVC and FEV1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>These findings have recently been confirmed by another study demonstrating that 34.3% of patients with a history of PTB had non-reversible chronic airway obstruction that was associated with significantly more radiographic abnormalities in CXRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>.</s><s>It is therefore likely that, despite the microscopically cure rate of 95%, the existing pulmonary lesions in the CXRs of our patients might at least partly reflect persistent respiratory impairments.</s><s>Since CXR is often not available for the diagnosis and follow up of PTB patients in low income settings, there are only few data comparing the radiographic pulmonary involvement at diagnosis and after 6 months of DOTS treatment.</s><s>A recent study reported that after 6 months of DOTS treatment, 27% of TB patients still had at least moderate-severe pulmonary function impairment, and 57% still had respiratory symptoms, despite most achieving 'successful' treatment outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.</s><s>These findings support an association of the area of lung affected with severity of pulmonary involvement.</s><s>The extent of alveolar infiltrates as a different and more distinct manifestation of our reading scheme decreased from 98.4% to 25.8% of patients with infiltrates in at least one quadrant.</s><s>It is likely that a considerable proportion of the patients analyzed in a previous study in which a reduced FEV1 could be related to the area of lung affected, was due to the presence of persistent alveolar infiltrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>However, in follow-up studies, this manifestation was not independently investigated in terms of its association with PTB pathology and its impact on long-term outcome so far.</s></p><p><s>One additional finding of our study was that, after 6 months of treatment, the presence of cavities decreased substantially from 34,8% to 1.6%, which was an excellent cure rate compared to another study which found that from 53.1% of the PTB patients who presented cavities in CXR at diagnosis, 16.9% of subjects still had persistent cavities at the end of 6 months of treatment, that was associated with an increased risk of TB relapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>.</s><s>Further studies are needed in order to investigate which factors are associated with the reduction in the presence of cavities observed in our study.</s><s>In our cohort, we also found that lymphadenopathy decreased from 46.8% to 16.1% and pleural effusion from 19.4% to 6.5% after 6 months of treatment.</s><s>No data are available that associate lymphadenopathy independently with long-term outcome or shortand long-term pulmonary function impairment.</s><s>But, in one study, persistent pleural effusion in PTB was shown to be associated with pleural thickening and a slowed FEV1 and FVC increase after 6 months treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we found that most of the radiological manifestations we investigated were differentially associated with parameters of disease severity and each changed to a different extent after 6 months treatment.</s><s>Since, according to the RNTCP, the standard DOTS treatment regime for all PTB patients was based on a three times per week application, it is tempting to speculate that patients with severe disease, according to different manifestations, might benefit from an intensification of the frequency of antibiotic therapy.</s><s>One of the limitations of our study was the absence of other clinical parameters correlated with disease severity, such as underlying lung disease, as well as FEV1, which would have allowed the assessment of its association with individual CXR manifestations and their confounding effect on the association between the extent of CXR features with BMI and sputum smear grade.</s><s>In addition, only 62 patients could be followed by CXR from diagnosis to the completion of DOTS treatment and, since we only studied CXRs from HIV-negative smear positive patients, our findings need to be evaluated further for HIV-positive and/ or smear-negative patients with PTB.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have developed a new assessment scheme to grade the presence and extent of specific CXR features and pulmonary disease severity in patients with PTB.</s><s>By differentially analyzing the five radiographic manifestations, i.e., lung involvement, alveolar infiltration, cavitation, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion our grading scheme factors the broad heterogeneity in pulmonary pathology allowing the integration of differential information regarding disease severity into clinical decision-making.</s><s>Prospective studies are required to evaluate this reading scheme in representative populations, and to determine the association of each manifestation with short-and long-term pulmonary function impairment and whether there would be any benefit to lengthening or modulating therapy based on CXR severity assessment.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Characteristics of study
