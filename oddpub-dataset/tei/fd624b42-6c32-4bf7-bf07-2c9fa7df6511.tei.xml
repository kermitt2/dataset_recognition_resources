gene loci in mouse using Capture-C, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq in forelimb, hindlimb at three developmental stages, and midbrain.</s><s>The fine mapping of chromatin interactions revealed a strong preference for functional genomic regions such as repressed or active domains.</s><s>By combining chromatin marks and interaction peaks, we annotated more than 1000 putative limb enhancers and their associated genes.</s><s>Moreover, the analysis of chromatin interactions revealed two regimes of chromatin folding, one producing interactions stable across tissues and stages and another one associated with tissue and/or stage-specific interactions.</s><s>Whereas stable interactions associate strongly with CTCF/RAD21 binding, the intensity of variable interactions correlates with changes in underlying chromatin modifications, specifically at the viewpoint and at the interaction site.</s><s>In conclusion, this comprehensive data set provides a resource for the characterization of hundreds of limb-associated regulatory landscapes and a framework to interpret the chromatin folding dynamics observed during embryogenesis.</s></p><p><s>[Supplemental material is available for this

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Probing the interaction profiles of 446 loci using Capture-C</s></p><p><s>The developing limb is a dynamic system in which regulatory changes occur in a time-and tissue-specific manner.</s><s>Despite many similarities between fore-and hindlimb development, the gradual changes in gene expression and minute differences in temporal patterning lead to different morphologies.</s><s>Thus, developing limbs constitute a convenient model to survey the regulatory dynamic of chromatin architecture.</s><s>In this project, we chose seven combinations of tissue and time points, i.e., forelimb and hindlimb, each at E10.5, E11.5, and E13.5, as well as midbrain at E10.5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>We probed the chromatin architecture of 446 viewpoints, including 434 main promoters and 12 alternative promoters.</s><s>The 446 loci were selected based on their involvement in limb development (patterning, growth, and tissue differentiation), as well as their association with congenital limb malformations.</s><s>These loci involve major developmental limb transcription factor families such as Tbx, Sox, Hox, and Runx; genes involved in signaling pathways such as FGF, WNT, RA, and BMP; as well as differentiation markers such as Sox9, Col1a1, and Myod1 (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>To evaluate the transcriptional variation among the tissues, we performed RNA-seq and identified genes which are expressed differentially between tissues or developmental stages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>As expected, we observed a high similarity among the limb samples and major differences between limb and midbrain.</s><s>Forelimb and hindlimb of the same stage were very similar to each other with only a few differentially expressed genes at all three time points.</s><s>However, between developmental stages, transcriptional changes were much more pronounced.</s></p><p><s>Using Capture-C (CC), we obtained high-resolution interaction profiles for all surveyed promoters in biological replicates (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hughes et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In order to assess the intensity of chromatin interactions, we combined the 446 profiles across all time points, tissues, and replicates to generate a simple, empirical background.</s><s>This model allows us to determine the interaction intensity of any region with respect to the distribution obtained from the whole data set at a given distance from its viewpoint (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>We defined interaction peaks as regions displaying intensity above the 99th or 95th percentile, thus as regions being among the top 1% or 5%, respectively, regarding their interaction intensity.</s><s>Across all tissues and time points, we annotated, on average, 600 strong interactions when applying the 99th percentile and 3000 when lowering the threshold to the 95th percentile (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>For most analysis presented in this work, we applied the more conservative 99th percentile as a threshold to reduce the risk of false positive interactions.</s><s>Finally, we tested whether these interactions could also be identified with an alternative approach, implemented in the software package CHiCAGO (Cairns et al. 2016), and found an overlap for 79%-89% of our called interactions (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3D-microarchitecture is associated with functional chromatin domains</head><p><s>To evaluate in which type of functional chromatin domains chromatin interactions form, we generated ChIP-seq profiles for H3K27me3, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K4me1 from the same tissues and time points as described above.</s><s>We used the software EpiCSeg <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mammana and Chung 2015)</ref> to segment the genome into seven chromatin states (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>EpiCSeg assigned each genomic region to one out of the seven states based on the abundance and co-occurrence of histone marks.</s><s>The ChIP-seq signatures of the states were identified in unsupervised learning and afterward manually assigned to functional classes.</s><s>Three states associated predominantly with active marks and were labeled accordingly.</s><s>Active-A and Active-B with high H3K4me3 and H3K27ac occurred frequently at promoters, whereas Active-C was characterized by low H3K4me3, and high H3K27ac and H3K4me1 levels.</s><s>All three states were found in intergenic and intronic regions, suggesting that they all might mark putative enhancer regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>A state solely enriched for H3K27me3 is here referred to as repressed.</s><s>Interestingly, repressed regions were Distribution of genomic features across chromatin states in hindlimb at E10.5, as well as their genome-wide distribution.</s><s>(C) Functional chromatin domains cover 19% of the genome-wide (GW) and 25% of regions proximal to the CC viewpoints (±2 Mb) (VP-PROX).</s><s>More than sixty percent of interaction sites (99th percentile) were found in functional chromatin segments.</s><s>(D) States of viewpoints' TSSs linked to active interaction peaks (data were aggregated from all tissues) (see Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>).</s><s>(E) At the Mecom gene, interaction peaks form specifically over acetylated regions (black arrows) and disappear in the midbrain, where these regions are not acetylated.</s><s>The RNA-seq tracks show that the Mecom gene is expressed at high level in limb tissues, whereas its expression is much lower in midbrain.</s><s>(F) States of viewpoints' TSSs linked to repressed interaction peaks (data were aggregated from all tissues) (see Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S7B</ref>).</s><s>(G) Tbx5 promoter forms a long-range interaction (red arrow) with an H3K27me3 domain (Lhx5) only when it is covered by the same mark and repressed (see RNA tracks) in hindlimb and midbrain.</s></p><p><s>not strongly biased toward promoter regions but also frequently found in intergenic domains.</s><s>A small fraction of the genome was found to be covered by both active and repressive marks and is here referred to as a heterogeneous state.</s><s>The heterogeneous state is strongly enriched at promoter regions and associates with mild gene expression, in contrast to Active-A and -B, which are found at very active promoters, and repressed ones, which are found at lowly expressed genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>; Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>The heterogeneous state is likely to represent the cell heterogeneity of our in vivo samples, rather than bivalent regions, as some genomic regions might be active in some cells and repressed in others.</s><s>Indeed, limb and midbrain tissues contain tens to hundreds of different cell types with individual transcriptional signatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Zeller et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">La Manno et al. 2016</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, we observed that heterogeneous regions are enriched in TSSs (transcriptional start sites) of genes with highly localized expression such as Hand2 or Hoxd10, which are restricted to the posterior side of the developing limb bud, or Col2a1, which is expressed solely in chondrocytes (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bell et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrey et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Osterwalder et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, two states, low signal and no signal, cover the large majority of the genome, i.e., 63% and 18%, respectively.</s><s>While low signal segments are depleted of chromatin marks probed in this study, the no signal state represents mainly regions of low mappability (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The called CC interaction peaks strongly associate with the functional states active, heterogeneous, and repressed, and are depleted from the low signal or no signal state in comparison to the genome-wide or viewpoint proximal (±2 Mb) frequency of each state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As 33%-55% of interaction peaks occurred in active segments, we asked whether they are linked to viewpoints with similar or different patterns of chromatin modifications.</s><s>We therefore categorized the interacting regions according to their chromatin states and determined the chromatin state at the linked TSSs.</s><s>First, interactions of active chromatin sites are more frequently linked to active TSSs than to repressed ones, in comparison to the overall distribution of states at captured TSSs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>These observations suggest that active chromatin sites preferentially interact with each other and that changes in active chromatin domains during tissue differentiation and development could accompany changes in 3D contacts.</s><s>An illustrative example is the Mecom gene, where several interactions in forelimb and hindlimb at E10.5 co-occur with high acetylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, these interactions were not observed in midbrain, where the Mecom gene is 10 times less expressed and the interaction sites are not acetylated.</s></p><p><s>Similarly, we observed that repressed interaction peaks interact with TSSs enriched for the repressed state and depleted from the active ones (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>;
