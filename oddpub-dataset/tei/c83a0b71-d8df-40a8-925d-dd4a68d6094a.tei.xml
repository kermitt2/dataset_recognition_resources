<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Hierarchical Genomic Analysis of Basal Co-expression</head><p><s>To analyze the basal coordination of transcription between all pairs ði; jÞ of genes, we built a specific measure of transcriptional co-expression, C ij , hereafter referred to as ''basal correlation.''</s><s>C ij quantifies the tendency of the expression of the two genes to systematically vary in parallel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), here among the 227 working samples.</s><s>Specifically, it is equal to the difference between the number of pairs of samples for which the two genes co-vary and the number for which they vary in the opposite direction, normalized by the total number of possible pairs of samples.</s><s>Compared with other correlation measures to which it is related, such as the Pearson correlation, C ij is well suited to highlight the basal coordination of genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>In particular, C ij z0 indicates that the expression of the two genes varies as many times in the same direction as in the opposite direction.</s><s>In contrast, C ij z1 indicates that they always vary in the same direction, whereas C ij z À 1 indicates a systematic tendency to vary in the opposite direction.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> shows the resulting heatmap of C ij , for which the genes are sorted according to their genomic position, and each pixel indicates the co-expression level between two genes.</s><s>One can distinguish the presence of specific contiguous clusters of highly co-expressed genes with, on average, a genomic extension that typically extends up to 10 kbp <ref type="bibr">(Figure 1B,</ref><ref type="bibr">bottom)</ref>.</s><s>This 10 kbp length scale is larger than the typical length scale of operons, corroborating that the co-expression of proximal genes extend beyond operons.</s><s>It is actually similar to that found in E. coli and B. subtilis when performing a similar analysis of coexpression <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jeong et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carpentier et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Junier and Rivoire, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To delineate in a more precise way the relationship between basal coordination of transcription and the established organization of M. pneumoniae into operons (see Experimental Procedures for their definition), we analyzed in detail the genomic organization of co-expression.</s><s>To this end, we developed a hierarchical description of co-expression constrained to respect the linear organization of the genome.</s><s>Briefly, we built a dendrogram in which pairs of adjacent genes were hierarchically fused on the basis of their co-expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Using this dendrogram, we defined domains of the genome, which we call G -domains, as the contiguous domains of genes for which all the adjacent genes have a co-expression larger than G (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>An analysis of G -domains for all possible values of G reveals that although these domains may coincide with operons at certain values of G, they are generally different.</s><s>This can be qualitatively appreciated for specific clusters of genes, such as that of the F-ATPase machinery (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>More quantitatively, we evaluated the capacity of G -domains to predict operons using our most recent manual annotation of operons as the ground truth (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>To this end, we made G vary from 1 to À1 and we assessed both the specificity and the sensitivity of predictions.</s><s>The resulting area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), which summarizes the balance between specificity and sensitivity by a single value, was equal to 0.76 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>G -domains are thus not perfect predictors (in which case the AUC would have been equal to 1), corroborating the necessity to analyze co-expression properties independently of our knowledge of operons, at least in the first stage.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Three Qualitatively Different Levels of Basal Coexpression</head><p><s>To better understand the hierarchical properties of co-expression, we analyzed the relative orientations of adjacent genes as a function of their co-expression (846 pairs analyzed for which expression values were available for the two genes) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also analyzed the tendency of co-directional genes to overlap (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), as well as the intergenic distances between the non-overlapping ones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Notably, the three properties (relative orientation, overlapping, and distance) suggest a similar three-level organization of coexpression.</s><s>Specifically, for co-expression &gt; 0.6 (strong coexpression), 227 of 234 pairs of genes are co-directional, with a high proportion ($52%) of overlapping cases (Pz4:10 À11 , hypergeometric test).</s><s>For co-expression between 0.3 and 0.6 (moderate co-expression, 375 pairs), genes significantly tend to be co-directional ðPz7:10 À7 Þ and to overlap ðPz7:10 À5 Þ, all the more that co-expression is large.</s><s>At this level, although intergenic distances between non-overlapping genes are larger than those with strong co-expression, they remain relatively small.</s><s>Plotting the co-expression level of all pairs of non-overlapping co-directional genes as a function of their intergenic distance actually reveals the existence of a 100 bp length scale below which typical co-expression is larger than 0.3 and above which co-expression is low and statistically insensitive to distances (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Finally, below 0.3 (low co-expression, 237 pairs), there is no enrichment for a specific relative orientation of genes (Pz 1, binomial test of the hypothesis that the probability of codirectionality is equal to 0.5).</s><s>Moreover, intergenic distances between co-directional genes are large, exceeding 100 bp and reaching typically 400 bp at very low co-expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Performing the same analyses using Pearson correlation led qualitatively to the same findings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>The sharp delineation of the three different regimes as well as their correspondence between the different properties (relative orientation, overlapping, and distance) is less clear, though, than those obtained using the basal correlation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transcription En Bloc Coordinates Co-directional Genes and Operons</head><p><s>Because a significant number of operons have moderate coexpression levels and because TRT pervades the transcriptomes of bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wade and Grainger, 2014)</ref>, we wondered whether TRT could explain the co-expression levels of co-directional genes belonging to distinct operons.</s><s>We thus investigated the tendency of all adjacent co-directional genes belonging to two different operons to be transcribed as a single transcript (268 pairs analyzed).</s><s>We examined the variation of expression in their intergenic region as a function of the variation of expression of the downstream gene (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Our rationale was that TRT, if present, should leave a trace on the expression of the intergenic region that precedes the downstream gene.</s><s>We thus (A) The distribution of relative orientations of adjacent genes as a function of their co-expression reveals the existence of three qualitatively different levels of co-expression, with threshold occurring at $0.3 and $0.6 (vertical gray lines).</s><s>(B and C) A similar three-level organization can be distinguished both from the fraction of overlapping pairs (B) and from the distribution of the intergenic distances ðdÞ that separate co-directional genes (C).</s><s>(D) Mean co-expression as a function of the distance separating co-directional adjacent genes, revealing a characteristic length scale of 100 bp below which co-expression is all the higher that the distance is small.</s><s>Error bars correspond to SEM. compared the co-expression between the downstream gene and the sense (5 0 / 3 0 ) intergenic region (co-expression C S in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) with that between the two genes (co-expression C); as a control, we considered the anti-sense (3 0 / 5 0 ) region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, right) (co-expression C A ).</s><s>To prevent any bias arising from the transcription of the UTRs inside operons, for this analysis, we defined intergenic regions as the sequences that separate the transcription termination site (TTS) of the upstream gene and the TSS of the downstream gene.</s></p><p><s>For co-expression levels larger than $0.3, we observed that the degree of co-expression between co-directional adjacent operons was higher when there was co-expression with the sense intergenic region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>); in contrast, it did not show any dependency with the anti-sense expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, right).</s><s>The same analyses, but considering genes that are separated by more than 100 bp (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), or using the Pearson correlation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>), led to the same conclusions.</s></p><p><s>Next, to explicitly demonstrate the role of TRT in basal coordination of transcription, we first studied the efficiency, h, of TRT extending between two co-directional adjacent operons, say, X and Y with X preceding Y (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>).</s><s>h was defined as the ratio between the RNA-seq expression levels measured at the TSS of Y and at the stop codon of the last cistron of X (independently whether this was associated to a well-defined terminator).</s><s>We thus assumed that the RNA-seq level just preceding Y would result from the TRT of X and would be representative of the basal level of Y.</s><s>According to this model, for which we provide below an experimental validation, the overall expression of Y is thus equal to the sum of its basal level coming from TRT, plus some contribution from its own TSS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We analyzed seven pairs of genes with various degrees of correlations and distances: two pairs with strong correlation, including one overlapping case (MPN155a-MPN155);
