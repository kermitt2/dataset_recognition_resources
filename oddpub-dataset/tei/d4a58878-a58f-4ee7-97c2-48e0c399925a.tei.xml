0.5% in any of the datasets).</s><s>Proportions of the loss-of-function variants were higher for the variants with lower alternative allele frequencies (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), which suggests selection pressure on these variants.</s><s>Thus, we assessed site frequency spectrum (SFS) of the WGS datasets, as well as those in worldwide populations obtained from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and the UK10K project <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>As expected from previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , a ratio of the fractions of sites under selection pressure (= f) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> between loss-of-function variants and synonymous SNV was high in the Finnish population ( = 11.3), while the Japanese population indicated moderate values ( = 3.5-4.0;</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>).</s><s>Effective population sizes estimated from the WGS datasets showed rapid increases over approximately the past 10,000 years, as also reported in other populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>To our knowledge, this is one of the largest high-depth WGS data studies ever reported in a single non-European population.</s></p><p><s>Genome-wide natural selection signatures in Japanese.</s><s>Using the high-depth WGS data, we evaluated genome-wide natural selection signatures of the Japanese population.</s><s>We calculated SDS to evaluate very recent selection signatures (around the past 2000-3000 years).</s><s>Since SDS calculation requires accurate information on genome-wide localization of the singletons, we excluded the genomic regions with low confidence in variant calling from the subsequent analysis (e.g., centromeres or regions with an excess density of singletons).</s></p><p><s>By meta-analyzing the results of the three WGS datasets, we obtained normalized SDS (and corresponding P-values) for 6,292,092 common variants, respectively, (MAF ≥ 0.01;

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Among the five EAS subpopulations, the highest DAF was observed in the Japanese population (JPT, DAF = 0.731).</s><s>Relatively high DAF were also observed in the Chinese (DAF = 0.601, 0.670, and 0.714 for CDX, CHB, and CHS, respectively) and Vietnam (KHV, DAF = 0.626) populations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>This supports the previous findings that the functional variant of ADH cluster region is under selection in the east Asian populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Regarding the Japanese BBJ subjects, all the four SDS top SNPs within ADH cluster, MHC region, BRAP-ALDH2, and SERHL2 showed significant DAF heterogeneity enrichment among the Japanese geographic regions (P &lt;
