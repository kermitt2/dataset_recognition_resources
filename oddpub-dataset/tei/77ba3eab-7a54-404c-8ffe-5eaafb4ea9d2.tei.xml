this method can be used for unbalanced experiment and unbalanced orthogonal array; it is possible to work with heterogeneity variance and correlated errors within block or environment; it can be apply with any environment numbers; it makes possible to consider the adaptability and stability to select superior genotypes within progenies; it does not depend on estimation or interpretation of other parameters such as regression coefficient; it allows to eliminate the GxE interaction error, due to it considers the heritability for this effect; it generates results on the same magnitude of the phenotypic values for the trait; and it estimates the genetic gain for the three features simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For all reasons discussed above the objectives for this study were: i) to estimate the parameters in the 180 half-sib families in Jatropha evaluated for five production years; ii) to verify the significance of the GxE interaction variance; iii) to estimate the adaptability and stability for each family based on three prediction methods; iv) to select superior half-sib families based on the adaptability and stability analyses; and v) to estimate the prediction accuracy for the sixth production year.</s></p></div>
