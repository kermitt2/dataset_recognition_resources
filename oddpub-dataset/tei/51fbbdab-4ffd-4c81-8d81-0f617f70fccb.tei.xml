<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Introduction: Continuous or episodic allergen exposure is a major risk factor of frequent symptoms and exacerbations for patients with allergic asthma.</s><s>It has been shown that temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) significantly reduced allergen exposure and airway inflammation and improved quality of life of patients with poorly controlled allergic asthma.</s><s>Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effects of nighttime TLA when used during real-life conditions for 12 consecutive months in addition to the patients' regular medication.</s><s>Methods: This multicenter, pre-and postretrospective observational study included patients with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe allergic asthma who received add-on treatment with TLA for 12 consecutive months.</s><s>Data on medication use, asthma control, asthma symptoms, lung function, use of hospital resources, and exacerbations were collected after 4 and 12 months and compared with corresponding data collected retrospectively from medical records during the year prior to inclusion in the study.</s><s>Results: Data from 30 patients (mean age 28; range 8Á70) completing 4 months and 27 patients completing 12 months of TLA use are presented.</s><s>The mean number of exacerbations was reduced from 3.6 to 1.3 (p B0.0001), and the ratio of asthma-related emergency room visits or hospitalizations diminished from 72.4 to 23.3% (p00.001) or from 44.8 to 20.0% (p B0.05), respectively, after 12 months of TLA use.</s><s>The Asthma Control Test index increased from 14.1 to 18.5 (pB0.0001).</s><s>After 4 months of TLA use, clear improvements can be shown for most variables in line with the data collected after 12 months.</s><s>Conclusions: The addition of TLA to the patients' regular medication significantly reduced exacerbations, asthma symptoms, and the utilization of hospital resources.</s><s>The data support that TLA may be an important new non-pharmacological approach in the management of poorly controlled allergic asthma.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics</head><p><s>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (der Med.</s><s>Fakulta ¨t Bochum) on November 4, 2011 (Ref No. 4175Á11).</s><s>Local management (R&amp;D) approval was obtained at each center.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Potential eligible patients were identified at participating sites based on the below mentioned screening and eligibility criteria from a clinic database or diary.</s><s>Informed patient consent was sought for study participation as well as research access to the medical records and, if needed, researcher contact with the general practitioner to complete the study dataset.</s><s>For underage patients, written informed consent was also collected from their guardians.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>A non-randomized uncontrolled preÁpost retrospective observational study was carried out to investigate the effect of 12 months' TLA use during real-life conditions.</s><s>The study was performed in 10 German centers specialized in pediatric or adult lung diseases with a special interest in severe and difficult-to-treat asthma.</s><s>Patients with severe and difficult-to-control persistent asthma were followed according to a structured study protocol with clinical visits after 4 and 12 months while on nightly TLA use.</s><s>The TLA device was installed in the home of the patients within 10 days of study inclusion.</s></p><p><s>Prospectively collected data covering the 12 months of TLA use on asthma exacerbations and emergency care visits were compared with corresponding data collected retrospectively for the study baseline from medical records at the hospitals or clinics where the patients had been treated during the prestudy year.</s></p><p><s>There was no prespecified hypothesis that the study was statistically powered to investigate.</s><s>As the study involved a broad group of patients with poorly controlled persistent asthma, and the management of the patients during the study period was deemed by the individual status of the patient triggered by the same treatment goals during regular medical care, the handling of patients and clinical decisions were not restricted in any way, as normal in controlled clinical trials.</s><s>The study, therefore, intentionally compared treatment effects in real-life circumstances.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study participants</head><p><s>Specific screening criteria for potential study patients were applied at all participating centers (Row 1 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Study participants were recruited during the period December 2011 to November 2012.</s></p><p><s>Patients with severe difficult-to-control asthma (Row 2 in Table <ref type="table">)</ref> fulfilling the following eligibility criteria were recruited <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>: Physician diagnosis of asthma, difficult-totreat asthma, good treatment adherence and trained inhalation technique, positive bronchodilator response and/or bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR; Row 3 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), high level of control medication (Row 4 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), inadequate asthma symptom control according to National guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, during the past 4 weeks (Row 5 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), written informed consent signed by patient and/ or guardians, hospital medical records available and accessible.</s></p><p><s>The following ineligibility criteria were applied: Diagnosis of other obstructive or systemic lung diseases (e.g.</s><s>cystic fibrosis, COPD) at the time of inclusion, other lung diseases or congenital malformations in the airways, other significant chronic conditions, congenital or acquired heart disease with significant functional changes.</s></p></div>

randomized placebo-controlled efficacy trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The study has several limitations.</s><s>It was designed as a pre-and post-comparison of TLA use on the frequency of asthma exacerbations in patients with a verified medical history and documented frequent disease exacerbations requiring hospital resources, with patients serving as their own controls.</s></p><p><s>The data quality of retrospective studies relies very much on the accuracy and completeness of the clinical records referred to.</s><s>Given the nature of the study, incomplete data may have been obtained from the pre-TLA period, thus rather leading to an underestimation of the effects compared with the TLA period, when the study patients and physicians were aware of the study focus on exacerbations and asthma disease deteriorations.</s><s>Therefore, this study's reported reduction of the exacerbation rates and hospital resource utilizations after the TLA introduction is likely to underestimate the true differences.</s></p><p><s>Without a control group, any spontaneous improvements in asthma morbidity during the 12-month study period (TLA use) may have been missed.</s><s>In addition, although we took care to select only patients with good treatment adherence, improved adherence to previous treatment during the observation period explaining part of the improvement cannot be excluded.</s><s>However, we believe that this is unlikely since eligible patients had had troublesome asthma with considerable disease burden for several years, making previous non-adherence to treatment unlikely to be of major relevance.</s></p><p><s>There were some exacerbation-related parameters that did not reach formal statistical significance, nevertheless these parameters all pointed into the same direction, that is, TLA improved the asthma control status in these severely ill asthmatics.</s><s>The lack of statistical significance may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the patients included and the low number of events observed.</s></p><p><s>The mode of action of TLA is to reduce the allergen exposure during sleep, which is the most likely mechanism behind the effects observed in this study.</s><s>However, it should be noted that TLA also reduces the exposure to particles in the inhaled air, thus contributing to a general reduction of airway irritants <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>This may be of significant value for severely ill patients who can be expected to have considerable airway inflammation.</s><s>Unfortunately, measures of airway inflammation such as exhaled nitric oxide were not part of the study protocol.</s><s>As a surrogate marker for the reduction of airway inflammation after TLA introduction, we observed a significant reduction of BHR compared with baseline levels.</s></p><p><s>The effect of TLA on concomitant allergic rhinitis and/ or eczema was not recorded in the study.</s><s>As there are some remarkable anecdotal reports (outside this study) about effects of TLA use in asthmatic patients with eczema and rhinitis comorbidities, further studies are warranted and are now underway to investigate the effect of TLA on both these conditions.</s></p><p><s>The overall management of patients during the TLA intervention period did not change compared with the pre-TLA period.</s><s>The actual nursing care during the TLA period was not restricted in any way, as is normally the case in controlled clinical trials.</s><s>Consequently, the present study can be viewed as reflecting real-life circumstances and assessing symptom-related meaningful data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In conclusion, this open study assessing the effect of 12 months of TLA as add-on to pharmacological management in patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe allergic asthma showed a significant reduction of exacerbations and use of resources.</s><s>Improvements in both subjective and objective asthma control measures confirmed the potential value of TLA in the management of patients with difficult-to-treat allergic asthma.</s><s>This is even more relevant, as these severely affected patients were already treated with high doses of available medications including systemic corticosteroids.</s><s>The use of TLA is not associated with any pharmacological side effects and is safe to use.</s><s>Furthermore, the reduction in asthma-related hospital admissions and emergency resource use has important socioeconomic advantages.</s><s>Further studies are warranted to confirm whether reductions in daily OCS use can be achieved and sustained.</s><s>Finally, careful investigations should be carried out to identify those patients who will benefit most from TLA as a novel tool in the management of difficult allergic asthma.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Inclusion criteria for screening and recruitment (patients were required to fulfill each of the inclusion criteria 2Á5)1: Screening criteria for potential study participation Criteria for severe asthma, based on the German Asthma Net<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> At least one severe exacerbation during the past 12 months which fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: Á Inpatient treatment or treatment in an emergency department Á Exacerbation treated outside the hospital with systemic steroids for at least 3 days or by an increasing dose of a systemic therapy for at least 3 days Willingness to participate in the study where baseline data will be collected at study inclusion, that is, before the TLA use, after 4 months (TLA treatment success evaluation) and after 12 months use (long-term evaluation).</s><s>2: Inclusion criteria for severe asthma<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> The study population consisted of three subgroups of patients, those with: Untreated, severe asthma Difficult-to-treat severe asthma Treatment-resistant severe asthma, including: Á Asthma for which control is not achieved despite the highest level of recommended treatment: refractory asthma and corticosteroid-resistant asthma; or Á Asthma for which control can be maintained only with the highest level of recommended treatment.3:</s><s>Inclusion criteria for positive bronchial reversibility and positive bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) Positive bronchial reversibility test ( ]12% increase in FEV1 after short-acting beta2 agonists (SABA); or Significant bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) following unspecific provocation (e.g. with methacholine or treadmill).</s><s>A positive BHR was defined according to the following (31): A decrease in FEV1 !20% after methacholine challenge test; or A decrease in FEV1 !10% after a standardized exercise bronchial provocation test; or Circadian PEF variability !20% over a period of 3Á14 days, derived from at least four measurements per day.</s><s>4: Inclusion criteria for high level of therapy Long-term therapy with high-dose ICS (only for children and adolescents aged 6Á18) ( !400 mg budesonide equivalent/ !200 mg fluticasone alone); or Daily therapy with medium-to-high-dose ICS (]400 mg budesonide equivalent/ ]200 mg fluticasone) in combination with long-acting beta2 agonists and/or leukotriene receptor antagonist and/or theophylline; or Therapy with OCS fixed ]3 past months.</s><s>5: Inclusion criteria for inadequate asthma symptom control according to NVL (27) in the past 4 weeks prior to inclusion Asthma symptoms ]3 times per week; or Use of rescue medication; or Limited activity due to asthma; or Any symptoms at night; or Exacerbation(s) ]1 last year, treatment with systemic steroids and/or hospitalization required; or Reduced lung function: pathological FEV1/FVC ratio or FEV1 at inclusion.</s><s>6: Outcome parameter: The ATS/ERS definition of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations (30) A moderate asthma exacerbation should result in a temporary change in treatment, in an effort to prevent the exacerbation from becoming severe, and should include one or more of the following: Deterioration in symptoms, deterioration in lung function, and increased rescue bronchodilator use.</s><s>These features should last for 2 days or more but not be severe enough to warrant systemic corticosteroid use and/or hospitalization.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
