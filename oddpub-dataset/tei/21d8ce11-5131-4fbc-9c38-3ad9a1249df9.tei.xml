records of all new patients referred to the hypertension specialty clinic at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for apparent TRH and evaluated between January 2009 and October 2014 were reviewed.</s><s>Patients were included if they met the AHA/Committee of the Council for High Blood Pressure Research definition of TRH: (1) failure to achieve office blood pressure (BP) &lt;140/90 mm Hg in patients prescribed three or more antihypertensive medications at optimal doses, including a diuretic if needed, or (2) ability to achieve office BP at goal but patient prescribed four or more antihypertensive medications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Patients were excluded if they were intolerant to three or more antihypertensive drug classes.</s><s>Screening for white-coat effect with 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was conducted for patients who reported normal home BP (&lt;135/85 mm Hg), and patients with demonstrated BP control at home were also excluded.</s><s>All patients were covered by either private medical insurance or Medicare.</s><s>All patients reported that they were adherent to all antihypertensive medications prior to TDM.</s></p><p><s>During each clinic visit, BP was measured by nursing staff using the same validated oscillometric device (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY) after the patient had been resting quietly for 5 minutes as recommended by guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>BP measurement during a single visit was repeated three times separated by 1 minute and the values averaged.</s><s>Serum levels of antihypertensive medications were assessed as part of our routine standard of care for new referral patients with apparent TRH since 2009.</s><s>Screening for nonadherence was conducted at Compliance With Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act-certified laboratories as previously described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>atients with serum levels

undetectable antihypertensive medications divided by the total number of antihypertensive medications tested.</s></p><p><s>Investigation to determine secondary causes of hypertension was at the physician's discretion depending on clinical presentation.</s><s>All patients with positive screening tests for PA (serum aldosterone ≥15 ng/dL and suppressed plasma renin activity ≤1 ng/mL/h) were subsequently scheduled to undergo confirmatory tests (oral salt loading test or intravenous saline suppression test).</s><s>Presence of PA was confirmed using previously recommended cutoff values of urinary aldosterone &gt;12 lg/ 24 h for the oral salt loading test and serum aldosterone &gt;10 ng/dL after intravenous saline suppression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr"

tests for PA (plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone levels), intravenous saline suppression tests to confirm diagnosis of PA, adrenal vein sampling (AVS), and computed tomography (CT) of adrenal glands were based on the 2013 Medicare fee schedule (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The model was based on the following assumptions: 1 Prevalence of medication nonadherence is 54% based on data from our study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> which was consistent with results from other published studies using TDM in patients with resistant hypertension. 7-9</s><s>2 Overall prevalence of PA in patients with TRH and the prevalence of PA in adherent patients with TRH are based on our current data (see Results section).</s><s>3 Sensitivity and specificity of the ratio of serum aldosterone to plasma renin activity of ≥15 mL/ dL/h in detecting PA are 87% and 75%, respec-tively, based on prospective studies in patients with PA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> Similar sensitivity and specificity has been reported at this range of aldosterone to renin ratio. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s> Only patients with positive screening tests will undergo intravenous saline suppression test to confirm diagnosis of PA.</s><s>Thus, the cost of investigation in patients with positive results on screening test will include the

Endocrine Society guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Thus, the cost of investigation in the patients with confirmed PA after positive result on saline suppression test will include the cost of screening test, confirmatory test, AVS, and CT scan.</s><s>The cost of investigation in the patients with negative saline suppression test will include only the cost of the screening and confirmatory tests.</s><s>One-way sensitivity analysis examining the costeffectiveness ratio over the range of prevalence of medication nonadherence (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>) shows that TDM-guided PA screening is associated with lower cost compared with unselected PA screening until the prevalence of nonadherence falls below 10%.</s><s>When the cost of TDM was considered in the two-way sensitivity analysis (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) while keeping the other assumptions fixed, TDM-guided screening was the lower cost strategy until the cost of TDM was above $150 per patient (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) in the population with a prevalence rate of 20% nonadherence.</s><s>At the prevalence rate of 50% nonadherence, TDM-guided screening is the cost-saving strategy until the cost of TDM is above $600 per patient (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>When the cost of a PA workup (cost of screening plus saline suppression test) was considered in the two-way sensitivity analysis, (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>), TDM-guided PA screening was the preferred strategy regardless of the cost of PA workup until the prevalence of nonadherence fell below 30%.</s><s>In the population with a prevalence rate of 20% nonadherence, unselected screening was the preferred strategy until the cost of a PA workup was above $400 per patient.</s><s>When the prevalence of PA in the overall TRH patients was considered in the twoway sensitivity analysis (Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), TDM-guided screening was the cost-saving strategy in the population with a prevalence rate of 50% nonadherence until the prevalence of PA in the TRH patients was below 7.5%.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In a cohort referred to a specialty hypertension clinic for apparent TRH despite self-reported medication adherence, we found that: (1) the prevalence rate of PA in patients with TDM-derived nonadherence was significantly lower than in patients who were adherent by TDM, and (2) screening for PA using a TDM-guided approach was cost-saving compared with routine unselective screening.</s></p><p><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Other methods of assessing adherence to medications, such as patient self-report, detailed questionnaire, pill counts, or prescription fill rate, may have significant disadvantages compared with TDM.</s><s>Although several of these techniques do not incur additional expense, they have limited accuracy when compared with the research gold standard of electronic monitoring via pillboxes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>Patient self-report and detailed questionnaire were shown to overestimate adherence in 80% of patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> while pill counts are accurate in determining adherence in only 50% to 70%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Prescription fill rates may be more accurate in a closed hospital system but are prohibitively difficult to track in most clinical settings, since patients fill their medications from multiple different pharmacies.</s><s>In contrast, our recent study showed that TDM is a very sensitive technique in uncovering nonadherent behavior despite self-reported adherence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>ecause of the high prevalence of nonadherence, investigation for secondary hypertension is recommended only after nonadherence to medication is excluded. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>PA is one of the most common identifiable causes of TRH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> The wide range of prevalence of PA may be related to the study design or population studied.</s><s>Our study provides the first direct evidence for a difference in PA prevalence for adherent vs nonadherent patients by TDM.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> Our data suggest that TDM-guided screening is a useful strategy for diagnosing PA in the TRH population.</s><s>Since previous studies have indicated that hypokalemia was present in only 14% to 48% of patients with PA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> the current Endocrine Society guidelines advocate routine screening for PA in all patients with TRH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>In contrast, the 2008 AHA position statement recommends investigation for PA only in adherent patients with TRH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> However, the cost of nonselective screening and confirming presence for PA in patients with false-positive screening tests may be a substantial burden, considering the rapid rise in prevalence of TRH from 16% in 1998 to 2004 to 28% in 2005 to 2008 according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>n the present study, we found that despite additional up-front costs associated with testing, TDM-guided PA screening is associated with reduced costs for PA screening and an overall lower cost of investigation to diagnose PA.</s><s>Using the cost of TDM allowed by the Medicare fee schedule, the benefit of TDM-guided PA screening in terms of cost-savings is evident in the population with prevalence of nonadherence as low as 10%.</s><s>Furthermore, information derived from TDM may potentially reduce unnecessary PA screening from 85% to 35% of all TRH patients.</s></p><p><s>The potential disadvantage of using a TDM-guided PA screening strategy is that investigation for PA in the nonadherent subset of patients with TRH may be overlooked or delayed.</s><s>However, the overall proportion of PA missed with the TDM-guided approach compared with unselective routine screening was small, at only 3.8% of patients.</s><s>Furthermore, the current AHA guidelines do not recommend further investigation for secondary hypertension for patients who are nonadherent to treatment because behavioral intervention to improve nonadherence is more likely to improve BP control.</s><s>The recommendation is supported by our recent study indicating that, when nonadherent patients were given TDM-guided feedback regarding specific undetectable serum drug levels and provided counseling to overcome barriers to adherence, BP improved substantially at subsequent visits without treatment intensification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Thus, TDM may significantly improve adherence in initially nonadherent patients as a behavioral intervention, helping identify patients with true TRH as potential targets for investigation for secondary hypertension.</s><s>It is important to note that, in our hypertension specialty clinic, the nonadherent patients continue to receive medical therapy including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which are considered the fourth-line drug therapy for TRH patients with or without primary aldosteronism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>Furthermore, initially nonadherent patients who continue to have uncontrolled hypertension after adherence is improved following behavioral intervention are subjected to PA screening in the same fashion as the initially adherent patients in our clinic.</s><s>The modest potential delay in a secondary hypertension workup in patients with true TRH or pseudo-resistant hypertension would likely be completely outweighed by the lower cost and diagnostic efficiency of minimizing unnecessary testing in nonadherent patients.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STUDY LIMITATIONS</head><p><s>Our study is limited by its retrospective, single-center design and relatively small number of patients with TRH.</s><s>In addition, we routinely performed both TDM and diagnostic tests for PA simultaneously in our clinic in patients referred for TRH.</s><s>Thus, our routine clinic practice during this study period did not exactly reflect of the TDM-guided staged strategy discussed here.</s><s>However, the advantage of simultaneous testing in terms of the present study was that the TDM results could not influence our decision to perform a workup for secondary hypertension, as evidenced by the fact that a similar proportion of TDM-adherent and -nonadherent patients underwent screening tests for PA.</s><s>Despite the similar screening rate, a higher proportion of TDM-adherent vs -nonadherent patients had positive screening tests for PA (45% vs 19%, respectively), suggesting a true difference in PA prevalence.</s><s>The cost of investigation for PA is likely to be underestimated because the screening test is assumed to be conducted only once per patient, while in the clinical setting, these tests are often conducted multiple times when the patients are seen by different physicians for persistently elevated BP.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>Our study suggests that an alternate TDM-guided strategy for diagnosing PA in patients with apparent TRH is associated with lower cost by selectively targeting the subset of patients at the highest risk for PA for further testing with minimal impact on efficiency in detecting PA.</s><s>Future prospective studies are needed to confirm the difference in the prevalence of PA between adherent vs nonadherent patients with TRH and compare the effectiveness of a TDM-guided approach in terms of BP reduction and hypertensive target organ complications.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1.
