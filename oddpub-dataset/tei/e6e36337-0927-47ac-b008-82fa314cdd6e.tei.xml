intolerance of animals and humans with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Under conditions of thermoneutrality, core body temperature can be maintained in the absence of any thermoregulatory process (e.g.</s><s>shivering).</s><s>However, under conditions of cold exposure adaptive thermogenesis occurs through a compensatory increase in sympathetic nervous system tone (SNS) which, in concert with TH, accelerates energy expenditure (EE) and increases body temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Numerous studies primarily performed on animal models have investigated the mechanism of TH for activating brown adipose tissue (BAT).</s><s>Findings from different TR knockout mice (e.g.</s><s>TRα , TRβ , TRα

of 3,3′ ,5-triiodothyronine (T 3 ) under cold exposure and for the first time provided evidence for T 3 in the enhancement of the thermogenic response to sympathetic stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>This suggests that the subsequent heat liberation is actually a result of synergism between norepinephrine (NE) and T 3 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>The significance of the central nervous system in TH activation of BAT was demonstrated in rats in which central administration of T 3 , via the inhibition of hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), induces thermogenic gene expression in BAT through stimulation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Additionally, SNS stimulation results in activation of β -adrenergic receptors (β -AR) by NE which induces both the enhanced thermogenic activity of existing brown adipocytes and the recruitment of new cells to BAT depots <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Energy release is accomplished by the activity of UCP1, a BAT-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>With regards to WAT, a distinct population of UCP1-positive adipocytes arises within subcutaneous and visceral depots of mice in response to cold exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and β 3 adrenergic receptor agonist treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>To date it remains a matter of controversy as to whether these cells, entitled "brite" or "beige" adipocytes, are produced from the conversion of existing white adipocytes and/or the differentiation of WAT resident progenitor cells, leading to a process called "browning" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>There is preliminary evidence that suggests a role for TH in the induction of beige adipocytes in WAT.</s><s>In human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells, 3-10 day treatment with T 3 induced UCP1 expression which was most pronounced during the differentiation phase and was dependent on the presence of thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, treatment of mice with the TRβ specific agonist GC-1 leads to induction of adaptive thermogenesis in subcutaneous WAT, increased energy expenditure, and restoration of cold tolerance in cold-intolerant mice independent from BAT activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, in mice centrally administered T3 leads to the recruitment of BAT in inguinal WAT which is accompanied by increased energy expenditure and body temperature.</s><s>Since the effect was abolished in UCP1 KO mice, the findings highlight the significance of UCP1 as a central relais modulating the central effects of TH <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, a novel circuit for the control of TH feedback in the brain via the Liver X receptor α and β has recently been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>LXRα β −/− mice display increased TH serum level combined with changes in expression of genes associated with TH synthesis and TH transport as well as prominent UCP1 staining in the subcutaneous adipose depot <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In a positron emission tomography (PET) study of a patient with a history of thyroid cancer, systemic administration of TH led to BAT activation in periumbilical WAT indicating that browning had occurred as a result of T 4 supplementation for 14 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Despite the significance of TH for adaptive thermogenesis, there is currently limited understanding of whether and how different thyroid states, i.e. hypo-and hyperthyroidism, regulate

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study provides new evidence of how TH affects thermogenesis in both brown and white adipose depots.</s><s>For the first time with regard to metabolic activity of BAT, we were able to identify a distinct profile in hyper-and hypothyroid mice at room temperature.</s><s>First, regarding the amount of BAT, the in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> F-FDG PET/ MRI-estimated BAT volumes gave first evidence for an increased total amount of BAT in hyperthyroid mice compared to hypo-and euthyroid animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>).</s><s>Second, although hypo-and euthyroid animals contained detectable BAT, hyperthyroid mice displayed an increased metabolic activity as determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> F-FDG uptake (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C+D</ref>).</s><s>In line with this observation, fatty acid oxidation activity in BAT was increased in hyperthyroid mice as determined by the uptake of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> C-acetate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>The opposite metabolic profile was found in hypothyroid animals, which display significantly lower uptake of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> F-FDG and of <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> C-acetate in BAT when compared to hyperthyroid mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A-D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The observation of active BAT in all three experimental groups emphasizes the significance of thermal conditions for metabolic control irrespective of thyroidal state.</s><s>As discussed by Nedergaard et al. under sub-thermal conditions (for mice 18-22 °C) BAT derived heat will be used to maintain body temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Paradoxically, the low BAT activity in hypothyroid animals was associated with a strong increase of thermogenic genes (Ucp1, Dio2, Fgf21, Cidea, and Elovl3; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) and with a significant upregulation of the adrenergic system, as evidenced by significant increases of Ardb3 and NE concentrations in hypothyroid animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Although NE per se is not an index of NE release or sympathetic tone, these data suggest an increase in norepinephrine outflow to the periphery as a compensatory response to maintain body temperature.</s><s>This finding is principally in agreement with observations in cold exposed hypothyroid rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in iWAT and gWAT of hypothyroid mice we detected features of adipose tissue browning, evidenced by an increased expression of brown specific genes (Ucp1, Cidea, and Elovl3; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and a multilocular UCP1-positive phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, these data suggest a compensatory WAT browning as a response of decreased heat production due to BAT inactivity in hypothyroid mice.</s><s>Indeed, decreased BAT thermogenesis in mice lacking bone morphogenetic protein (BMPR1A) is associated with increased circulating NE and a compensatory browning of iWAT and eWAT in a very similar fashion to the hypothyroid mice in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>The idea of heat compensation is further substantiated by the observation of enriched expression of the zinc finger protein 423 (Zfp423) in WAT and BAT selectively in hypothyroid mice (Figs 2+ 5).</s><s>Gupta et al. demonstrated that Zfp423+ endothelial cells undergo an endothelial-mesenchymal transition into Zfp423+ Pparg+ pericytes that serve as a pool of committed pre-adipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the increased Zfp423 expression in the adipose tissues of hypothyroid mice likely suggests the formation of beige adipocytes by recruitment and de-novo differentiation of progenitor cells as has been demonstrated by cold exposure or adrenergic β 3 -AR agonist treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The observation of browning of white adipose tissue was also made in white adipose tissues of hyperthyroid mice, where in particular, established markers for adipose tissue browning such as Ucp1, Fgf21, Cidea, and Elovl3 were upregulated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In addition, hyperthyroid mice were characterized by a significant increase in Ardb1 expression in iWAT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>Recent studies demonstrated that the absence of the β 1 -AR receptor impairs NE-induced de-novo brown adipogenesis in BAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Conversely, β 1 -AR transgenic mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity and display a high abundance of adipocytes expressing Ucp1 in WAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>With the results gained in the present study we cannot conclude whether or not central effects of T3 contribute to the observed WAT browning.</s><s>However, evidences from a recent study by Alvarez-Crespo et al. suggest a coordinated action of central hyperthyroidism on WAT browning.</s><s>Thus, the authors for the first time demonstrated that central T3 administration in mice induces UCP1 dependent thermogenesis in BAT and browning of WAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Also, similar to the observed increased BAT amount in our cohort of hyperthyroid mice, Alvarez-Crespo reported BAT recruitment upon central T3 infusion even at thermoneutrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Notably, keeping in mind that the hyperthyroid state of our mouse cohort is rather mild it is even more interesting to observe the significant effects on BAT recruitment and WAT browning.</s><s>Further work will be necessary to address the extent of centrally induced T3 effects, i.e. by the determination of hypothalamic AMPK and ACC in our model of hyperthyroidism <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Collectively, our data provide first evidence for differential mechanisms contributing to WAT browning dependent upon altered thyroidal state.</s><s>This is most apparent in hypothyroid mice that exhibit increased adipogenesis and de-novo differentiation of brown adipocytes potentially as a compensatory mechanism to hypothermia resulting from BAT inactivity.</s><s>In hyperthyroid mice, it can be hypothesized that increased β -adrenergic activation contributes to WAT browning most likely by central effects of TH.</s><s>However, it has to be emphasized that with the current data we cannot exclude potential non cell-autonomous contributions from the SNS to adipose tissue browning irrespective of thyroidal state.</s><s>Thus, in order to rule out that temperature as opposed to thyroidal state is the underlying reason for WAT browning, further studies should be performed under temperatures where sympathetic stimulation of facultative thermogenesis is depressed i.e. thermoneutrality (30 °C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s></p></div>
