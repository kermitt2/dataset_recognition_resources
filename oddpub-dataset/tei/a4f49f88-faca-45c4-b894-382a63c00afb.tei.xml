<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Enzymatic conversion of polysaccharides into lower-molecularweight, soluble oligosaccharides is dependent on the action of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes.</s><s>Polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs) use an oxidative mechanism to break the glycosidic bond of polymeric carbohydrates, thereby disrupting the crystalline packing and creating new chain ends for hydrolases to depolymerize and degrade recalcitrant polysaccharides.</s><s>PMOs contain a mononuclear Cu(II) center that is directly involved in C-H bond hydroxylation.</s><s>Molecular oxygen was the accepted cosubstrate utilized by this family of enzymes until a recent report indicated reactivity was dependent on H 2 O 2 .</s><s>Reported here is a detailed analysis of PMO reactivity with H 2 O 2 and O 2 , in conjunction with high-resolution MS measurements.</s><s>The cosubstrate utilized by the enzyme is dependent on the assay conditions.</s><s>PMOs will directly reduce O 2 in the coupled hydroxylation of substrate (monooxygenase activity) and will also utilize H 2 O 2 (peroxygenase activity) produced from the uncoupled reduction of O 2 .</s><s>Both cosubstrates require Cu reduction to Cu(I), but the reaction with H 2 O 2 leads to nonspecific oxidation of the polysaccharide that is consistent with the generation of a hydroxyl radical-based mechanism in Fenton-like chemistry, while the O 2 reaction leads to regioselective substrate oxidation using an enzyme-bound Cu/O 2 reactive intermediate.</s><s>Moreover, H 2 O 2 does not influence the ability of secretome from Neurospora crassa to degrade Avicel, providing evidence that molecular oxygen is a physiologically relevant cosubstrate for PMOs.</s></p><p><s>oxygen | hydrogen peroxide | monooxygenase T he utilization of molecular oxygen (O 2 ) is essential for numerous biological processes.</s><s>Although a powerful oxidant, biological utilization involves reduction at metal centers such as iron and copper to generate oxidants capable of a wide range of reactions with organic molecules.</s><s>Oxygenases have evolved to generate a reactive O 2 species capable of selective O-atom insertion into an unactivated C-H bond while controlling aberrant side reactions and the leakage of reactive oxidant species into solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Cu-dependent polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs), also known as lytic PMOs, are found in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> and are secreted into the extracellular environment to degrade polysaccharides through an oxidative mechanism.</s><s>Over the past decade, research on this enzyme family has intensified as PMOs have emerged as potential catalysts in biofuel production <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> and have been implicated in various physiological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recently H 2 O 2 , rather than O 2 , was reported to be the physiological cosubstrate utilized by PMOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>While the peroxygenase activity of PMOs may have implications in industrial applications, such activity in a biological setting would be distinct from that of known peroxygenases, which employ a ferric heme cofactor that can stabilize reactive intermediates similar to P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>In the presence of a reductant, but in the absence of a polysaccharide substrate, PMOs reduce O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and generate H 2 O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>O 2 reduction in the presence of a polysaccharide substrate is expected to lead to substrate oxidation, similar to other wellcharacterized O 2 -activating Cu enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The heterogeneity of reactions with large, insoluble polysaccharide substrates hinders substrate loading of the PMO and complicates biochemical studies, especially when the substrate-free enzyme leads to the uncoupling of O 2 activation (reduction) from substrate oxidation.</s><s>Under these reaction conditions it can be difficult to distinguish oxygenase activity from peroxygenase activity resulting from the in situ generation of H 2 O 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>The ability of some PMOs to oxidize soluble oligosaccharides allows for homogenous reaction mixtures that overcome the concentration ambiguity of insoluble substrates, as well as suppressing the uncoupled reaction <ref

provided insight to the active-site environment and the positioning of the polysaccharide substrate in C4-oxidizing PMOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>The glycosidic bond connecting the second and third glycosyl units (from the reducing end) is positioned over the Cu active site, such that regioselective oxidation would generate Glc2ox [β-D-xylo-hexos-4-ulopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl], which would subsequently hydrate in a nonenzymatic chemical step to form a geminal diol [Glc2gem, 4-hydroxy-β-D-xylo-hexopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl] as the only products (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In this paper, we investigated the cosubstrate dependence on the oxidative degradation of three cellulosic substrates by MtPMO9E, a C4-oxidizing PMO from Thermothelomyces thermophila (formerly Myceliophthora thermophila).</s><s>The cosubstrate (O 2 or H 2 O 2 ) utilized by the PMO to oxidize the polysaccharide was dependent on the substrate concentration, as well as the solubility of the cellulosic substrate.</s><s>Based on these findings, MS was used to compare the product profiles and modifications of the PMO

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Since the discovery of polysaccharide monooxygenases (PMOs), attention has focused on structure, function, and mechanism.</s><s>The PMO copper active site can utilize oxygen or hydrogen peroxide to catalyze substrate oxidation.</s><s>Although oxygen has been considered to be the physiologically relevant cosubstrate in the reaction, recent reports have focused on hydrogen peroxide.</s><s>While oxygen is acknowledged as the cosubstrate utilized for other biological copper-dependent hydroxylations, there is no reason to rule out hydrogen peroxide for PMOs.</s><s>This paper provides a detailed kinetic analysis and characterization of PMO reactivity with each cosubstrate.</s><s>PMOs are capable of using either cosubstrate to oxidize the glycosidic linkage of cellulosic substrates, but different molecular mechanisms are accessed that affect enzyme activity and the products formed.</s></p><p><s>distribution resulting from an equal number of turnovers of oxidant.</s><s>In addition, kinetic analysis of O 2 -and H 2 O 2 -dependent reactivity provides a rationale for the catalytic properties associated with peroxygenase and oxygenase activity.</s><s>The results presented herein support O 2 as a cosubstrate for PMOs to oxidize polysaccharide substrates, as originally proposed for this family of enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>, and draw sharp distinctions from the reaction with H 2 O 2 .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Comparison of Oxidative Activity on Cellulosic Substrates.</s><s>Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose), phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), and cellohexaose (Glc6) vary in their physical properties including crystallinity, microfibril shape, specific surface area, and average degree of polymerization.</s><s>These properties directly affect polysaccharide solubility and the concentration of PMO-accessible chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>The PMO MtPMO9E was chosen to directly compare activity on these three cellulosic substrates.</s><s>MtPMO9E regiospecifically hydroxylates the C4 position of cellulose as well as soluble cellodextrins (SI Appendix, Figs.</s><s>S1-S5 and Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1-S6</ref>) and as such serves as a good PMO model with reaction specificity.</s><s>The uncoupled MtPMO9E reaction results in the formation of H 2 O 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), which is  known to participate in the oxidation of polysaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>MtPMO9E activity on the three cellulosic substrates was tested in the presence of increasing concentrations of HRP to distinguish O 2 -dependent oxidations from H 2 O 2 -dependent oxidations.</s><s>Subsequent assays used increasing substrate concentrations in the presence of an excess concentration of HRP (1.3 μM) relative to the PMO (1 μM) to maximize substrate loading of the enzyme.</s><s>It is important to note that only the soluble products released from Avicel and PASC oxidation were monitored.</s></p><p><s>The total soluble oxidized products resulting from the reaction with the two insoluble substrates, Avicel and PASC, were significantly influenced by the concentration of HRP in the assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> B and C).</s><s>Excess HRP relative to the PMO essentially inhibited the generation of oxidized products from Avicel (8 ± 4%) and only had a slightly less inhibitory effect with PASC (15 ± 3%).</s><s>When the concentration of Avicel or PASC was increased, less inhibition by excess HRP was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 E and F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The primary reaction with homogenous reaction mixtures containing the soluble substrate Glc6 is the coupled reaction of O 2 reduction and substrate hydroxylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>A correlation between substrate concentration and the total oxidized products was observed when an excess concentration of HRP was used in the reaction mixtures.</s><s>Subsaturating Glc6 concentrations (i.e., [Glc6] &lt; K m(Glc6) , discussed below) resulted in a nearly 50% decrease in reaction products, whereas HRP had less of an inhibitory effect with increasing Glc6 concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>).</s><s>At Glc6 concentrations greater than 275 μM, the total oxidized products decreased by less than 10%.</s><s>In addition to a nominal effect on activity by HRP, H 2 O 2 was not detected in the presence of high concentrations of Glc6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) and yet O 2 consumption was observed (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) reduces PMOs directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref> and reduces O 2 slowly (22), which will limit the in situ generation of H 2 O 2 .</s><s>Therefore, the above assays were repeated substituting ascorbic acid with CDH (1 μM) from T. thermophila (MtCDH2) and the CDH substrate cellobiose (Glc2) (2 mM).</s><s>The addition of HRP to the reaction mixtures containing either Avicel or PASC led to 75% and 56% reduction in soluble oxidized products, respectively, indicating that the MtCDH2-dependent PMO activity was equally uncoupled compared with the reactions with ascorbate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>).</s><s>However, HRP had a very small effect on the total oxidized products from Glc6 when using MtCDH2, strongly suggesting these products were a direct result of PMO catalyzed O 2 activation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>).</s></p><p><s>O 2 Versus H 2 O 2 : Oxidation Analysis of MtPMO9E and Glc6.</s><s>Single and multiple turnover assays were employed to investigate the outcome of the MtPMO9E reaction with either cosubstrate in the presence and absence of Glc6.</s><s>In all reactions, the same amount of cosubstrate (75 μM) was consumed, enabling a direct comparison of each cosubstrate.</s><s>The rapid consumption of H 2 O 2 prevented measurement of its disappearance; however, based on the consumption of Glc6, all H 2 O 2 was consumed over the course of the reaction (discussed below).</s><s>O 2 consumption by MtPMO9E was much slower, and hence it was recorded (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Global analysis of protein modification during turnover with either O 2 or H 2 O 2 was assayed by MS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Oxidation of the untreated sample was observed, indicating PMO oxidation occurred during the expression, purification, or processing of samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The single turnover of O 2 in the absence and presence of Glc6 led to minimal, if any, oxidation of MtPMO9E.</s><s>When H 2 O 2 was the substrate, the singly (+16 Da) and doubly (+32 Da) oxidized forms of the enzyme occurred at higher relative abundance than in the control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>).</s><s>These oxidized forms of the enzyme were below detection limits when Glc6 was present in the assay.</s></p><p><s>Multiple turnovers of MtPMO9E with O 2 in absence of Glc6 resulted in some oxidative modification of the enzyme, whereas in the presence of Glc6 no change in the overall extent of enzyme oxidation was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, multiple turnovers with H 2 O 2 in the absence of Glc6 led to extensive oxidation of MtPMO9E (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> and SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S8</ref>).</s><s>Previous work has shown oxidative modification of PMOs predominantly occurs on aromatic residues near the active site, and the Cu-coordinating His residues, which can lead to degradation of the His side chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with these results, a modest fraction of the enzyme exhibited a decrease in molecular mass of 55 Da (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>In addition, activity of the H 2 O 2 -treated PMO decreased ∼40%, compared with that of the untreated enzyme (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>It was clear Glc6 protected the enzyme from self-oxidation, as addition to identical reaction mixtures significantly decreased the extent of PMO oxidation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The oxidation products of Glc6 were also determined for each reaction using high-resolution MS.</s><s>Each spectrum was analyzed for nonoxidized cellodextrin ions (GlcX; X = 2 ≤ degree of polymerization ≤ 6), 4-ketoaldose ions (GlcXox), and geminal diol ions (GlcXgem).</s><s>All products were detected as ions with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) above the cutoff value of 2. Based on the binding mode of Glc6 observed in the crystal structures of a fungal PMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, regioselective C4 oxidation of Glc6 is expected to generate only Glc2ox and Glc2gem products (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Reactivity with O 2 , independent of assay format, led to nearly exclusive formation of Glc2ox and Glc2gem ions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), as expected for regioselective hydroxylation of Glc6.</s><s>Conversely, single-turnover experiments with H 2 O 2 as the cosubstrate generated not only Glc2ox and Glc2gem ions but also Glc6ox ions.</s><s>Multiple turnovers of MtPMO9E with H 2 O 2 produced a range of oxidized products (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), suggesting the reaction with H 2 O 2 leads to the formation of a nonselective oxidant.</s><s>Although absolute product quantification was not possible due to the lack of standards for these compounds, it is noteworthy that the percent relative abundances of these products diminished with increasing  <ref type="table">S7 and S8</ref>.</s></p><p><s>distance from the Cu active site.</s><s>The observation of Glc6ox and Glc6_2ox ions indicates that oxidation is occurring at sites on the polysaccharide other than the C4 position as the glycosidic bond was not cleaved (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>These oxidized Glc6 species were not detected in control reactions and thus are not a result of nonenzymatic solution chemistry.</s><s>The Glc6ox ion was further analyzed by tandem MS (MS/MS) to identify the site of oxidation.</s><s>The precise location of the oxidation could not be unambiguously determined due to the low precursor ion abundance of this species compared with that of the substrate and the similarity of its mass (m/z = 989.31) to the substrate ion (m/z = 991.33).</s><s>Nonetheless, the MS/MS spectrum is consistent with oxidation occurring on the third glucose monosaccharide residue from the reducing end of Glc6 at a position other than the C1 or C4 position (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Kinetics of H 2 O 2 Reactivity.</s><s>A significant decrease in the total amount of oxidized products from the insoluble substrates was observed with the addition of HRP, indicating that the majority of the products are a result of MtPMO9E reacting with in situgenerated H 2 O 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Given this result, we attempted to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters of cellodextrin oxidation using H 2 O 2 as the cosubstrate.</s><s>As homogenous solutions are needed for reliable steady-state kinetic data, Glc6 was the only suitable polysaccharide substrate for these assays.</s></p><p><s>MtPMO9E oxidation of Glc6 by H 2 O 2 required the addition of ascorbic acid.</s><s>Unfortunately, in the presence of ascorbic acid initial rates corresponding to &lt;15% consumption of the limiting reactant were too fast to be measured, even at relatively low H 2 O 2 concentrations (12.5-100 μM) (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>).</s><s>However, observed rates corresponding to the consumption of &gt;50% of H 2 O 2 added could be determined (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>).</s><s>The observed rates (285-916 min −1 ) indicated the PMO reacted faster with H 2 O 2 than with O 2 (discussed below).</s><s>Rate measurements for higher H 2 O 2 concentrations (i.e., &gt;100 μM) were not possible as the H 2 O 2 was completely consumed before time points could be collected.</s></p><p><s>Steady-State Kinetics of the Oxygenase Reaction.</s><s>Steady-state assays with Glc6 as the varied substrate were performed at a fixed O 2 concentration (206 μM) to probe the steps involved in the oxidation of the polysaccharide substrate.</s><s>These assays were performed in the presence and absence of HRP to test if the in situ-generated H 2 O 2 influenced the initial rates involved in the oxidation of Glc6 when O 2 was the cosubstrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>The kinetic parameter k cat /K m(Glc6) encompasses initial rates with subsaturating Glc6 concentrations, steps where H 2 O 2 reactivity would be most likely to influence activity.</s><s>A threefold decrease in the apparent k cat /K m(Glc6) [k cat /K m(O 2 ) = 0.30 ± 0.05] was observed when HRP was present in the assay [k cat / K m(O 2 ) = 0.11 ± 0.02] (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S10</ref>).</s><s>This result is consistent with competing H 2 O 2 -mediated turnover.</s><s>There was no significant difference between the apparent k cat values determined in the presence (10.8 ± 0.6 min −1 ) or absence (10.1 ± 0.2 min −1 ) of HRP, strongly suggesting that H 2 O 2 , if generated, did not influence the oxygenase reaction when the PMO was saturated with Glc6.</s></p><p><s>Assays with varied O 2 used a Clark-type oxygen electrode to monitor O 2 consumption in the presence and absence of Glc6, probing the kinetics of O 2 reactivity for the coupled and uncoupled reaction, respectively.</s><s>To ensure the MtPMO9E was fully saturated with Glc6, a coupled assay detecting the formation of H 2 O 2 was employed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>The initial rate data with O 2 indicated that MtPMO9E activity was dependent on O 2 concentration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>A small decrease in the k cat as well as the K m(O 2 ) was observed when the PMO was saturated with Glc6 [coupled reaction, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> and SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>The K m(O 2 ) correlates closely with the concentration of dissolved oxygen under ambient conditions, consistent with PMO function in an extracellular environment.</s><s>The k cat /K m(O 2 ) values [k cat /K m(O 2 ) = 0.074 ± 0.014] were independent of Glc6, indicating that the free enzyme and PMO/Glc6 complex react with O 2 at the same rate, regardless of whether O 2 reduction results in Glc6 hydroxylation.</s><s>Cellulose Degradation by Neurospora crassa Secretome.</s><s>Although it is well known that PMOs work synergistically with other secreted cellulases to degrade biomass <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, the extracellular formation of H 2 O 2 by oxidoreductases and oxidases could enhance PMO activity and overall cellulose degradation.</s><s>To study the influence of H 2 O 2 on the ability of the N. crassa secretome to degrade Avicel, HRP was added to degradation assays using the secretome from N. crassa.</s><s>Based on proteomic analysis of this secretome <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>, HRP concentrations were selected to mirror similar HRP-to-PMO ratios used with purified proteins.</s><s>The pink color of the reaction supernatant, resulting from the oxidation of the Amplex Red, indicated H 2 O 2 was produced over the course of the reaction.</s><s>However, over this range of HRP concentrations, there was no significant effect on the overall production of glucose (Fig. <ref type="figure"

however, the reactions are mechanistically distinct as different products are observed.</s><s>The oxygenase mechanism carries out regioselective oxidation leading to cleavage of the glycosidic bond (only Glc2ox products) without oxidative damage to the enzyme.</s><s>This is consistent with the evolution of an enzyme that would control the reactivity of the oxidant and limit turnover-dependent inactivation Perhaps the low k cat /K m(O 2 ) values combined with the high K m(O 2 ) values serve as a protective kinetic feature of PMOs in an effort to minimize uncoupled turnover.</s><s>In addition, the PMO second coordination sphere residues are positioned to stabilize a cupric superoxide species <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>.</s><s>While extensive experimental work continually points to a cupric superoxide species for HAA by Cu enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>, computational work has favored Cu-oxyl-based mechanisms for PMOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, the peroxygenase mechanism appears to involve hydroxyl radical chemistry resulting from Fenton-like chemisty with H 2 O 2 and Cu(I).</s><s>In the absence of a polysaccharide substrate, this Fenton-like chemistry leads to protein modification and loss of activity; these observations are consistent with indiscriminate reactivity resulting from the generation of hydroxyl radicals.</s><s>It is known that polysaccharides are suitable hydroxyl radical scavengers <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>; this is apparent from the protective role of Glc6 against enzyme modification and the relative lack of regioselective oxidation observed with H 2 O 2 .</s><s>The close proximity of the glycosidic bond between the second and third glycosyl unit favors the C4 position for hydroxyl radical chemistry, but other bonds of the polysaccharide are also oxidized (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), as expected with hydroxyl radical chemistry.</s><s>Indeed, a recent computational study indicated hydroxyl radicals are generated in the peroxygenase reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The ability of a PMO to function as either a peroxygenase or oxygenase is intriguing.</s><s>Based on X-ray structural data with another PMO, the polysaccharide substrate binds with the C4 positioned over the Cu active site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, such that the formation of a reactive oxidant, regardless of cosubstrate identity,  is competent for HAA.</s><s>However, the question arises as to which cosubstrate is used in nature.</s><s>It is tempting to favor the peroxygenase reactivity, especially considering H 2 O 2 -generating oxidases are secreted with PMOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>However, degradation of Avicel by cultured N. crassa secretome was not influenced by the addition of exogenous HRP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>The formation of H 2 O 2 by these enzymes appears to be tightly regulated and likely intended for extracellular peroxidases, not PMOs.</s><s>Thus, the available concentration of "free" H 2 O 2 may not be able to compete with the abundance of O 2 typically found in extracellular environments.</s><s>Although the monooxygenase reaction is significantly slower than the peroxygenase reaction, regioselective hydroxylation is achieved and, more importantly, there is minimal oxidative damage to the PMO, regardless if substrate is present.</s><s>This allows the PMO to function without inactivation.</s><s>The peroxygenase reaction is less regioselective and results in extensive detrimental oxidative damage to the enzyme, begging the question if H 2 O 2 is an intended physiological cosubstrate for PMOs.</s></p><p><s>Overall, PMOs catalyze both peroxygenase and oxygenase reactions to oxidize insoluble and soluble polysaccharides.</s><s>These results demonstrate that O 2 is a cosubstrate for PMO reactions in the hydroxylation of polysaccharides.</s><s>With the reduced Cu(I) form of the enzyme, H 2 O 2 is a much faster cosubstrate but suffers from the outcomes noted above.</s><s>Our data provide a basis for understanding the kinetics involved in O 2 activation and Glc6 oxidation.</s><s>Additional efforts will be necessary to fully understand the reactivity of PMOs with O 2 and decipher the intricate molecular details of the O 2 -catalyzed reaction.</s></p></div>
