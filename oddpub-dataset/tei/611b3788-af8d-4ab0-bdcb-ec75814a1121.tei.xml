<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>The GAUSS-3 trial enrolled patients with elevated LDL-C levels who were unable to tolerate an effective dose of a statin because of muscle-related adverse effects.</s><s>Local institutional review boards approved the study protocol, and all patients provided written informed consent.</s><s>The methods are described in greater detail in a design manuscript <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">9</ref> ; the protocol is available in Supplement 1 and the statistical analysis plan in Supplement 2.</s></p><p><s>Briefly, the study had 2 phases: after an initial 4-week washout period in which any statins, ezetimibe, or other lipidlowering agents were discontinued, participants were enrolled in phase A, a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover procedure to rechallenge patients with atorvastatin.</s><s>Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atorvastatin (20 mg daily) or matching placebo for the first 10 weeks (period 1), then underwent a 2-week washout period, followed by crossover to the alternate therapy for a second 10-week period (period 2).</s><s>Patients who experienced intolerable muscle symptoms during the first period did not complete the full 10 weeks of exposure but entered a 2-week washout period before proceeding to period 2.</s></p><p><s>After completion of phase A, patients who experienced muscle-related adverse effects while taking atorvastatin but not placebo were eligible for phase B, a 24-week, double-blind randomization to ezetimibe or evolocumab using a doubledummy design in which patients received either injectable placebo and oral ezetimibe or injectable evolocumab and oral placebo.</s><s>Alternatively, patients could proceed directly to phase B if they had a documented history of CK elevation more than 10 times the upper limit of normal accompanied by muscle symptoms while taking statin therapy, with documented resolution of both CK elevation and symptoms at discontinuation.</s><s>These study procedures were designed to ensure that only patients with reproducible statin-associated muscle symptoms entered phase B of the study.</s><s>For phase B, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive subcutaneously administered evolocumab (420 mg monthly) or oral ezetimibe (10 mg daily).</s><s>Randomization for both phases was performed centrally via an interactive web-based or voice recognition system.</s></p><p><s>In phase A, randomization used a permuted block size of 4. Phase B used a permuted block size of 3, with stratification for LDL-C level (&lt;180 mg/dL vs ≥180 mg/dL [to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]).</s><s>Allocation was concealed using a centralized randomization process.</s><s>Information on race/ethnicity was self-reported based on fixed, standardized US Census terms and used to determine if outcomes were different for patients from different racial/ethnic subgroups (as routinely required by regulators).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion Criteria</head><p><s>The main eligibility criteria for phase A included age between 18 and 80 years and inability to tolerate atorvastatin at 10 mg and any other statin at any dose or, alternatively, 3 or more statins, with 1 at the lowest average daily starting dose and 2 other statins at any dose.</s><s>The lowest average starting dose was defined as 5 mg for rosuvastatin, 10 mg for simvastatin, 40 mg for pravastatin, 20 mg for lovastatin, 40 mg for fluvastatin, or 2 mg for pitavastatin.</s><s>For patients with diagnosed coronary heart disease, lipid inclusion criteria required an LDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or greater.</s><s>Patients without coronary heart disease were required to have an LDL-C level of 130 mg/dL or greater with 2 or more risk factors, 160 mg/dL or greater with 1 or more risk factors, or 190 mg/dL or greater with no additional risk factors.</s><s>Patients were excluded for myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or stroke within 3 months before randomization.</s><s>Other inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the protocol (Supplement 1).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatments</head><p><s>Atorvastatin (20-mg tablets) and matching placebo were supplied as overencapsulated tablets.</s><s>Evolocumab (140 mg) and matching placebo were supplied in a single-use, disposable, handheld mechanical (spring-based) 1.0-mL prefilled</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary and Secondary End Points</head><p><s>In phase B, to account for the pharmacodynamic effects of a PCSK9 antibody administered monthly (evolocumab), the study prespecified 2 coprimary end points: mean percent change from baseline LDL-C level to the mean of LDL-C levels at weeks 22 and 24, which approximates mean treatment effect, and a more conservative measure, the percent change from baseline LDL-C level to the level at week 24, which reflects effects at the end of the dosing interval.</s><s>Using the same 2 time points, the tier-1 cosecondary efficacy end points assessed absolute change from baseline in LDL-C level; percent change from baseline in levels of total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB); percent change from baseline in total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio and ApoB to apoliprotein A1 ratio; and the percentage of patients achieving an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL.</s><s>Tier-2 cosecondary efficacy end points were also measured as percent change from baseline to the mean of weeks 22 and 24 and at week 24 and included levels of lipoprotein(a), triglycerides, HDL-C, and very lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol.</s></p><p><s>The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug were collected for each randomized treatment group.</s><s>Prespecified safety and tolerability outcomes included the incidence of muscle-related adverse effects during phase A. Adverse events were coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.</s><s>An independent committee adjudicated clinical events including death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and hospitalization for heart failure.</s><s>The incidence of antievolocumab antibodies (binding and neutralizing) at any time was assessed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Methods</head><p><s>The analyses of safety and tolerability during the phase A double-blind statin rechallenge included all randomized participants who received 1 or more doses of atorvastatin or placebo.</s><s>Efficacy and safety analyses for phase B included all randomized patients who received 1 or more doses of ezetimibe or evolocumab.</s><s>For patients who participated in both phases, baseline lipid values were defined as those taken at the beginning of phase A. For patients who bypassed phase A, the lipid values taken at the beginning of phase B were considered the baseline values.</s><s>For the coprimary end points, a repeatedmeasures linear-effects model was used to compare the efficacy of evolocumab with ezetimibe, which included terms for treatment group, stratification by LDL-C level (&lt;180 mg/dL vs ≥180 mg/dL), scheduled visit, and the interaction of treatment with scheduled visit.</s><s>A positive result for the trial required statistical significance for both coprimary end points.</s><s>For efficacy end points, for which the analysis method was the repeated-measures linear-effects model, missing lipid mea-surements were not imputed.</s><s>The statistical model for the cosecondary efficacy end points was identical to that for the coprimary end points, with the exception of the end point percentage of patients achieving LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL, which was analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test adjusted by the LDL-C stratification.</s></p><p><s>Multiplicity adjustments were applied for analyses of coprimary and cosecondary end points to control the overall familywise error rate at .05 using a combination of sequential testing, the Hochberg procedure, and the fall-back procedure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">10</ref></s><s>he statistical approach for control of multiplicity is shown in eFigure 1 in Supplement 3. Cumulative incidence estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with hazard ratios (HRs) calculated using an unstratified Cox model and P values calculated using the log-rank test.</s></p><p><s>Analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Determination</head><p><s>The number of participants expected to be enrolled in phase A was 500 to provide 100 patients for phase B, assuming a rate of 20% for muscle-related intolerance in phase A, which was a conservative estimate based on observational studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">3</ref></s><s>The mean for LDL-C reduction for evolocumab compared with ezetimibe was estimated as −35.9% (95% CI, −44.1% to −27.8%) from prior studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8</ref></s><s>Assuming that 15% of phase B randomized patients would end treatment early but remain in the study, 5% would end the study early, and 2% would not receive any study drug, a sample size of 100 provided 98% power for each of the coprimary end points and 96% power to simultaneously detect significant treatment effects for the coprimary end points.</s><s>The sample size calculation was performed using a 2-sided t test with a .05</s><s>significance level, an attenuated treatment effect of 21% greater reduction in LDL-C level with evolocumab, and an attenuated common standard deviation of 24%.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Statin intolerance related to muscle symptoms represents a major unresolved challenge to the delivery of optimal cardiovascular care.</s><s>The reported incidence of statin-associated muscle symptoms in observational studies ranges from 5% to 29% of treated patients, varying by statin and dose. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">2</ref> Often, despite multiple attempts to find a statin regimen acceptable to the patient, practitioners resort to less effective therapies.</s></p><p><s>Alternative approaches typically include use of ezetimibe or administration of statins intermittently or at dosages below the approved starting dose. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">12</ref></s><s>These alternative therapeutic strategies provide less LDL-C reduction than recommended by current practice guidelines and result in higher LDL-C levels than most practitioners consider acceptable for optimal reduction of cardiovascular risk.</s><s>The problem of statin-associated muscle symptoms is particularly vexing for patients with known cardiovascular disease (ie, secondary prevention) or those with very high LDL-C levels (eg, patients with heterozygous familial hyperlipidemia).</s><s>However, concerns exist about the ability to reliably diagnose this disorder, uncertainty about its true incidence, and absence of clinical outcome data for nonstatin therapies.</s></p><p><s>In the current trial, we sought to address several of these concerns, first by determining the incidence of statin intolerance due to muscle-related adverse effects with a blinded atorvastatin rechallenge and subsequently by evaluating the tolerability and relative efficacy of 2 potentially useful therapies in these patients-ezetimibe and a recently approved PCSK9 inhibitor, evolocumab.</s><s>To identify the presence of statin intolerance, the trial design used a 2-stage approach previously tested in a smaller study. <ref type="bibr">13</ref></s><s>n the first phase of the study, patients with a strong history of muscle-related statin intolerance were administered both atorvastatin and placebo using a crossover procedure to allow identification of patients who developed muscle symptoms during atorvastatin administration but not during placebo administration.</s><s>During this rechallenge procedure, we observed a 42.6%</s><s>rate of discontinuation for intolerable muscle symptoms with atorvastatin but not placebo, which was modestly higher than that reported in a smaller prior study using simvastatin. 13</s><s>However, 26.5% of patients reported similar symptoms with placebo but not atorvastatin, demonstrating that reported muscle symptoms are not always related to statin use.</s><s>Since statin-associated muscle symptoms are dose-related, the rate observed in GAUSS-3 for atorvastatin (20 mg) may underestimate the problem, particularly for patients needing high-intensity statin therapy, such as those enrolled in the trial.</s></p><p><s>During the second phase of the study, patients with reproducible statin-induced muscle symptoms during rechallenge were randomized to 2 nonstatin LDL-C-lowering thera-pies to assess both efficacy and tolerability.</s><s>The PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab produced significantly larger reductions in levels of LDL-C and other atherogenic lipoproteins (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>Both coprimary end points showed a 16.7% reduction with ezetimibe and a more than 50% reduction with evolocumab.</s><s>These reductions in LDL-C levels are consistent with current labeling for both products.</s><s>Despite very high baseline values, the LDL-C goal of less than 70 mg/dL was achieved in nearly 30% of evolocumab-treated patients and 1.4% of ezetimibe-treated patients (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The LDL-C reduction for both drugs was stable by 4 weeks and sustained during the course of the 24 weeks of treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The study demonstrates the unmet medical need in this population, all of whom had either preexisting cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors and very high baseline LDL-C levels, which on average exceeded 210 mg/dL.</s><s>In such patients, LDL-C reduction with statins is considered a particularly important priority in efforts to prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.</s><s>Because some patients cannot tolerate statins, the need for alternative LDL-C-lowering strategies in such patients is self-evident.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[8]</ref> Although these initial trials included some patients with a history of extreme CK elevations during statin treatment, the studies did not use a placebo-controlled statin rechallenge procedure to identify the presence of statin intolerance.</s><s>In retrospect, these studies may have included many patients who would have been able to tolerate 10 weeks of atorvastatin (20 mg) during blinded rechallenge.</s></p><p><s>Both ezetimibe and evolocumab were well tolerated during the trial, with 5 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%) and 1 evolocumab-treated patient (0.7%) discontinuing active treatment because of muscle-related adverse events.</s><s>However, 11 evolocumab-treated patients (7.6%) discontinued oral placebo for muscle symptoms.</s><s>These findings demonstrate that both drugs are unlikely to provoke muscle symptoms and can be administered successfully in such patients, although with significant differences in lipid-lowering efficacy.</s><s>Since a minority of patients achieved optimal LDL-C levels despite treatment with evolocumab, it may be worth exploring the addition of ezetimibe to evolocumab for those patients requiring further LDL-C reduction.</s><s>It should be noted that neither ezetimibe nor evolocumab is approved for reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events.</s><s>Although a single outcome trial was completed for ezetimibe and showed modest event reduction, the drug was not approved in the United States for a clinical outcome benefit. <ref type="bibr">14</ref></s><s>]<ref type="bibr">[17]</ref> To our knowledge, the GAUSS-3 trial represents the largest and most comprehensive study using a blinded rechallenge procedure to assess the ability of patients with a history of muscle-related adverse effects to tolerate statins.</s><s>The trial provides insights into the time course of statin-associated muscle-related adverse effects.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, initial randomization to either atorvastatin or placebo in phase A resulted in similar rates of muscle symptoms during the first 50 days, with a modest increase in occurrence with atorvastatin near the end of the 10-week exposure (HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.71]; P = .02).</s><s>After crossover to period 2, larger numbers of patients experienced symptoms in the atorvastatin treatment group, with differences in event rates occurring relatively early (HR, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.44 to 2.66]; P &lt; .001)</s><s>(Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s><s>Study participants were aware that they might receive a statin during phase A and frequently reported intolerable muscle symptoms while receiving placebo, clearly demonstrating the importance of patient perceptions on inability to tolerate statins.</s><s>Although the reported rate of intolerance during atorvastatin administration was higher than that observed with placebo, these differences were modest, reflecting the importance of the "nocebo effect" (adverse effects during placebo administration) among patients with a history of statin intolerance. <ref type="bibr">18</ref></s><s>he study has important limitations.</s><s>The study was modest in size, reflecting the clinical challenges of requesting that participants with a strong history of muscle intolerance undergo rechallenge with atorvastatin after experiencing unpleasant adverse effects during prior attempts at statin treatment.</s><s>The study design also did not permit the use of a common management strategy for patients with muscle-related symptoms-administration of small doses of statins 1 to 3 times weekly.</s><s>Such a study design would be challenging, because this approach often requires months of careful titration to reach the highest statin dosage tolerable for individual patients.</s><s>The 24-week duration of therapy was relatively short for patients who require lifetime LDL-C reduction.</s><s>However, the majority of patients report statin-associated muscle-related adverse effects within the first 3 months of initiating therapy.</s><s>An additional limitation is that many of these patients with very high baseline LDL-C levels did not achieve optimal LDL-C levels and would require additional therapeutic agents, which may be associated with muscle symptoms.</s><s>Although preliminary data are promising, definitive data on cardiovascular outcomes with evolocumab are not yet available. <ref type="bibr">19</ref></s></p></div><figure
