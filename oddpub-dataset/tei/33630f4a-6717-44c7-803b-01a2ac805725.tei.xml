<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Approximately 5% of the human genome is structurally variable in the normal population, which includes deletions and duplications (collectively referred to as copy number variants, CNVs), as well as inversions, and translocations.</s><s>Structural variations have received considerable attention as a major cause for genetic disease, promoting the search for CNVs as a standard diagnostic procedure in conditions such as intellectual disability and congenital malformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Swaminathan et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The pathogenicity of many CNVs can be explained by their effect on gene dosage.</s><s>In contrast, it is difficult to predict the consequences of balanced rearrangements, such as inversions, or the functional impact of CNVs that are limited to non-coding DNA.</s><s>Such variants have the potential to disrupt the integrity of the genome, causing changes in the regulatory architecture that lead to pathogenic alterations of gene expression levels and patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Haraksingh and Snyder, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Spielmann and Mundlos, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the large-scale functional organization of the regulatory genome is a major limitation in predicting their potential pathogenicity.</s></p><p><s>New methods for enhancer identification and analysis of chromosome conformation have enabled substantial progress toward elucidating genome-wide regulatory interactions.</s><s>Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) performed directly on ex vivo tissues can reveal the location of distantacting tissue-specific enhancer sequences at genomic scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Visel et al., 2009a)</ref>.</s><s>In parallel, sequencing-based studies of DNA-DNA interactions have provided insight into the general conformation of the genome in living cells, as well as interactions between promoters and distant-acting transcriptional enhancers in specific cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>These data also show that enhancers can control multiple genes, frequently over hundreds of kilobases away from their target.</s><s>Only a fraction of enhancers contact the nearest promoter, whereas most skip one or more genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Laat and Duboule, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>How the selective interaction of enhancers with their respective target genes is achieved remains largely unknown, but the organization of the genome in domains of interaction that are shielded from each other by boundaries appears to be critical.</s><s>Genome-wide interaction studies by chromosome conformation capturebased approaches such as Hi-C (a high-throughput variant of the chromosome conformation capture technique <ref type="bibr">[3C]</ref>) and 5C (chromosome conformation capture carbon copy) show that the genome is partitioned into megabase-scale topologically associated domains (TADs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dixon et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nora et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>These domains have been proposed to represent regulatory units within which enhancers and promoters can interact.</s><s>They are separated by boundary regions that often contain CTCF binding sites or housekeeping genes representing de facto insulators that block interactions across adjacent TADs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dixon et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The importance of TAD structures is further supported by the finding that TAD boundaries appear to be largely static across different species and cell types.</s><s>This suggests the existence of a preformed and stable topology that organizes the physical proximity between enhancers and their target genes.</s><s>However, the observation that TADs exist regardless of transcriptional status has also raised questions regarding their role in cell-and tissue-specific regulatory processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Laat and Duboule, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it has remained unclear if alterations in TAD structure, as they may occur in genomic rearrangements, can contribute to disease etiology.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we analyze the potential value of annotated TAD boundaries for understanding how structural variation in the human genome elicits pathogenic phenotypes.</s><s>Focusing on families with rare limb malformations, we identified several rearrangements in the extended WNT6/IHH/EPHA4/PAX3 region and re-engineered them in mice.</s><s>Through a series of circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing (4C-seq) experiments and expression studies in mouse limb tissue and human patient-derived cells, we show that the rearrangements disrupt the normal topology of protein-coding genes and their enhancers relative to TAD boundaries, resulting in inappropriate interactions and misexpression.</s><s>Our results highlight the utility of considering the three-dimensional architecture of the genome for predicting the consequences of structural variation and reinforce that this approach may be useful for the analysis of structural variants in a wide spectrum of human disease phenotypes.</s></p></div>

were observed.</s><s>Furthermore, 4C-seq experiments in these mice showed decreased frequency of interaction of the target genes Pax3 and Ihh with the Epha4 domain.</s><s>Thus, leaving the proposed boundary regions intact diminishes all molecular phenotypes and averts morphological aberrations by preventing ectopic interactions.</s></p><p><s>Distance between regulatory elements and their target genes may be another determining factor.</s><s>At the HoxD locus, for example, duplications within the TAD that result in an increase in the distance between promoter and enhancers were shown to result in an impairment of activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Montavon et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>While we cannot rule out that distance effects contribute to the attenuation of molecular phenotypes, the difference between the deletion sizes is 100 kb for the Dbf/Dbf S alleles and 200 kb for the DelB/DelB S alleles, corresponding to 17% and 12% of the total deletion size, respectively.</s><s>It appears unlikely that these minor differences in distance alone are sufficient to explain the reversion of molecular phenotypes to near-wild-type levels, given that similar differences in deletion size of 200 kb are present across the brachydactyly families (B1, B2, and B3) without apparent effect on the phenotype.</s></p><p><s>A Framework for Interpreting Human Structural Variation Depending on their size and position, structural variants may disrupt higher-order genomic organization.</s><s>In this study we present a conceptual framework for the interpretation of such variants using genome-wide chromatin interaction datasets.</s><s>Our results reinforce the notion that the pathogenicity of a substantial proportion of human disease-associated deletions results from ectopic enhancer-promoter interaction causing gene misexpression due to the elimination of annotated boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Ibn-Salem et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The aberrant chromatin interactions observed at the EPHA4 locus in the present study exemplify how the disruption of TAD structure by eliminating or interfering with boundary elements can lead to the functional rewiring of gene-enhancer interactions (schematically shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>This model also illustrates how different types of large-scale structural changes can converge to give rise to the same phenotype.</s><s>We showed that duplication and an inversion, as observed in the F-syndrome cases, or duplication and a deletion, as in the polydactyly family/mouse mutant, result in nearly identical molecular changes and morphological defects.</s><s>In both cases the target gene interacts with the same non-coding genomic region and exhibits similar ectopic expression domains, despite the fundamentally different nature of the underlying structural mutation.</s><s>In the deletions, a boundary is removed from the genome, permitting contact of the enhancer with genes outside of the TAD.</s><s>In contrast, in the inversion and the duplications the enhancer is placed next to the new target gene.</s><s>In the latter rearrangements the boundaries are left intact, but their new position no longer restricts contact of the enhancer with the target gene (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>The effect of such rearrangements is a gain of function via misexpression of one or several target genes.</s><s>On the other hand, rearrangements of comparable size that do not interfere with TAD boundaries can be without consequence, as shown for the DelB S and Dbf S mutants.</s><s>Thus, considering overall TAD structure and in particular the integrity of the boundaries and their position relative to genes and enhancers appears critical when predicting ectopic and potentially pathogenic enhancer-promoter interactions.</s><s>As this situation depends on the presence of several factors including available enhancers and receptive genes that can give rise to phenotypes when misexpressed, other pathogenic mechanisms such as loss or gain of gene function have to be considered when interpreting structural variations.</s><s>Notably, such predictions can be experimentally tested even if the affected tissue is not available.</s><s>As shown in this study, normal and abnormal TAD structure and enhancerpromoter interactions may be preserved across developmental tissues and adult human cells such as fibroblasts.</s><s>Hence, 4Cseq in patient cells can yield diagnostically valuable information to predict effects of structural variants on gene regulation and thus disease etiology.</s><s>While the present study focused on one locus and one set of related morphological phenotypes, TAD data for the entire human and mouse genome are becoming available at increasing resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jin et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rao et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>These data should also help to interpret rearrangements in regions with higher gene density.</s><s>Thus, the general principles uncovered in this study and the resulting approaches for the interpretation of structural variation in human phenotypes are expected to be applicable to other genomic loci and a wide spectrum of genetic conditions caused by structural variants.</s></p></div>
