associated with inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), monophasic or recurrent isolated optic neuritis (ON) or transverse myelitis (TM), pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-seronegative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), and N-methyl D aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis

show neuropathological features that are similar to MS pattern II pathology with demyelinated lesions, preserved axons and complement-mediated pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>MOG is a very well-studied antigen in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is often used as a model for MS.</s><s>These animal models have been developed using active immunization with MOG, transfer of MOG-specific T cells and antibodies, and mice transgenic for MOGspecific T and B cell receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr"

antibodies are strongly pathogenic only after inflammation and blood-brain barrier leakage induced by encephalitogenic T cells.</s><s>Co-transfer of the mouse monoclonal anti-MOG antibody 8-18-C5

role in demyelinating diseases are still not fully understood.</s><s>While hMOG antibodies can initiate both complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in an Fc-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref

target="#b34">[35]</ref> and cellular cytotoxic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> independent of effector function.</s><s>Previous in vivo studies have indicated that MOG antibodies trigger the activation of MOG-specific T cells by facilitating opsonization and accumulation in antigen-presenting cells in the CNS and periphery.</s><s>This process then fosters T cells to recognize their autoantigen and activate in an Fc-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Administration of hMOG antibodies into a MBP-T cellmediated EAE model in Lewis rats resulted in minor demyelination and axonal loss in the absence of excessive complement activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and intracerebral injection of hMOG-IgG into murine brain resulted in complement-independent reversible demyelination and axonal loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It has become increasingly clear that only MOG antibodies recognizing correctly folded and glycosylated MOG are disease relevant.</s><s>Although MOG is highly conserved between different species, previous studies have shown that single amino acid exchanges between mouse MOG (mMOG) and hMOG led to a loss of binding ability of most hMOG antibodies to mMOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>These experimental observations and the polyclonal nature of serum IgG reinforce that not all hMOG autoantibodies will be reactive to rodent MOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr"

however, we did not observe an increase in demyelination.</s><s>Similar to the results observed in cerebellar slice cultures, the monoclonal MOG antibody 8-18-C5 applied in milligram amounts led to substantial myelin loss, macrophage activation, and complement deposition.</s></p><p><s>In addition to CDC and ADCC, human MOG antibodies have recently been shown to trigger disease severity in an EAE model due to the activation of MOGspecific T cells by fostering autoantigen recognition via antigen-presenting cells.</s><s>MOG antibody-mediated demyelination was not observed in these studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, hMOG antibody-mediated CDC may not play a significant role in this rodent model.</s><s>To conclude, the important question whether human MOG antibodies are pathogenic in vivo is still unsolved.</s><s>Since the complement-mediated demyelination is difficult to study in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, a human MOG transgenic rat model might be needed to analyze effector mechanisms of human MOG antibodies.</s><s>This would be also very important because cross-reactivity to rodent MOG is not necessarily related with pathogenicity per se.</s><s>We still cannot exclude, whether MOG antibodies solely reactive to human MOG could also induce demyelination in an animal model more resembling the human species.</s><s>However, this study showed that cross-reactivity to rodent MOG is a very important factor to analyze potential MOG antibody-mediated effector mechanisms in rodent models.</s></p><p><s>Our study has several limitations.</s><s>First, the majority of patients were children, and most of them had a benign monophasic disease course.</s><s>Only very few adult patients with severe disease courses were included.</s><s>Indeed, the only sample able to induce pathogenic effects in the organotypic brain slice model was from an adult patient.</s><s>Second, the purification and injection of total patient IgG may have resulted in insufficient MOG-IgG concentration to induce pathological effects ex vivo and in vivo.</s><s>One possible approach to circumvent problems with minor antibody concentrations is to directly inject those antibodies intrathecally or intracerebrally.</s><s>High efficacy has been shown recently, by injecting low doses of 8-18-C5 and complement into the corpus callosum of mice leading to complement-dependent demyelination <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</s><s>Third, as already mentioned above, cross-reactivity to rodent MOG is not necessarily related with pathogenicity in rodents per se and the pathogenic epitope might only be present in human MOG.</s><s>Forth, we cannot totally exclude, whether additional autoantibodies may contribute to pathology in MOG-seropositive diseases.</s><s>Future studies may require purified MOG autoantibodies or recombinant antibodies derived from MOG-reactive human plasma cells.</s><s>Finally, only a subset of samples could be analyzed for the in vivo pathology due to limited amounts of patient material.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Only a small proportion of antibodies to hMOG are reactive to rodent MOG as analyzed by CBA and tissue IHC.</s><s>While MOG mAb 8-18-C5 caused vigorous complement-mediated demyelination ex vivo and in vivo, serum IgG from only a single MOG-seropositive patient with high-titer antibodies to mMOG and rMOG was able to induce complement-dependent tissue injury in an ex vivo organotypic brain slice model.</s><s>The results suggest that high-titer species-specific MOG autoantibodies recognizing unique epitopes on native MOG may be mandatory for CDC in vivo.</s><s>Future studies should therefore use hMOG antibody-positive samples with high titers and affinity to rodent MOG epitopes or monoclonal MOG antibodies with defined epitope recognition and affinity before testing them in vivo for pathogenic potential.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Serum antibody titer levels to human, mouse, and rat MOG by live cell-based assay.</s><s>The cutoff titer value of 1:160 is indicated by a dashed horizontal line.</s><s>Individual antibody titers are shown as black circles (reactive to hMOG only), yellow triangles (reactive to hMOG+mMOG) or red squares (reactive to hMOG+mMOG+rMOG).</s><s>Antibody titers were compared using a non-parametric test (Friedman's test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test, overall p value &lt; 0.001).</s><s>***p &lt; 0.001</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,155.68,94.85,283.87,127.73" type="bitmap" /></figure>
