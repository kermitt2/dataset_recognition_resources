<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Methodology of protein structure prediction have been intensively studied over decades from various angles, such as bioinformatics, physics, chemistry, statistics, and robotics.</s><s>Although there are still some areas that need further development, e.g.</s><s>template-free (often also called ab initio or de novo) modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , structure prediction has become practical in several situations, which include cases where structures can be modelled using templates (template-based modeling) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s><s>The progress of the protein structure modeling field has been objectively monitored in the Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP) from 1994 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , a community-wide assessment of prediction methods that is held every two years.</s><s>In CASP, participating prediction groups/methods are evaluated based on structure models they build for protein target sequences, which are presented by the organizers before determination of their tertiary structures.</s><s>From CASP7 in 2006, assessors' evaluation reports show that performance of template-based modeling have not changed much partly reflecting maturity of the methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> .</s><s>Now, biologists routinely use structure prediction to interpret or design experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In the case of template-based modeling, obtaining a structure model of the correct fold, i.e. a structure that has a root-mean square deviation (RMSD) of 3-6 Å, can be expected if the template structures found in a structure library has a reasonably high confidence score <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Improving the structure model further through model refinement, an additional procedure to gain a couple of more angstroms in RMSD to the native structure, is critical for bringing a computational model with the correct fold to a level that it is practically useful in various applications.</s><s>For example, a model at a 5 Å RMSD would be only used for indicating residue positions in the protein such as interpreting and designing residue mutagenesis experiments.</s><s>However, if the model was refined to within 1.5 Å RMSD, it can be used for molecular replacement in experimental structure determination, virtual drug screening, and investigating enzymatic reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Thus, model refinement has been one of the foci of recent method developments in the CASP community <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>However, model refinement is still not easy.</s><s>It is well known that running naïve molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a structure model do not improve model consistently.</s><s>Rather, it deteriorates the model for almost half of the cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>In CASP, until CASP9 held in 2010, there were no methods that could refine models consistently with statistical significance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>This situation changed in CASP10, when the FEIG and Seok groups showed improvements on the starting models in majority of their cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Particularly, the FEIG group significantly outperformed all the other groups in their Global Distance Test-High Accuracy (GDT-HA) score <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> improvement.</s><s>The FEIG's approach was based on MD: from the MD trajectories starting of a model to be refined, structures were chosen that did not deviate much from the initial structure to avoid degraded structures and further filtered by using additional scoring function <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>In CASP11, many top performing groups, including FEIG <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , used MD-based approaches with some variations, e.g. using support vector machine (a machine learning method) to select models after MD <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , remodeling using multiple templates before MD-based refinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , taking consensus with homologous structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , or using multiple rounds of relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here, we report our group's method and performance in the model refinement category in CASP12.</s><s>Our approach is based on MD trajectories, following the FEIG group's success, with several critical differences: We used an implicit solvent model rather than explicit water molecules in simulation, and moreover, the length of the trajectories is significantly shorter than those used in the FEIG approach.</s><s>In spite of the computationally inexpensive strategy, our approach was ranked high among participants in CASP11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> as well as in CASP12.</s><s>Differences of our approach in CASP11 and CAS12 are that we optimized parameters of the method carefully for CASP12 and also changed the implicit solvent model used in the MD simulations.</s><s>In CASP12, our approach refined 29 out of 42 targets successfully in terms of the GDT-HA score and 24 in terms of the CASP12 assessors' score that is a linear combination of five scores (http://predictioncenter.org/casp12/zscores_final_refine.cgi?</s><s>formula=assessors).</s><s>We showed that the refinement occurred not only at loop regions but also overall in structures cores, and the approach mainly expanded structures (showing that the improvement of structure evaluation scores are not merely due to compression of structures).</s><s>Drawbacks of the approach are also discussed.</s></p></div>
