<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p><s>If the same formulation and active pharmaceutical substance was listed for both regular and as-needed use, it counted as a single medication.</s><s>The following medications were excluded: viscous eye drops, topical lotions, oyster shells (calcium supplementation used in Denmark), and antibiotics.</s><s>Information about the number of prescribed drugs was obtained from participants prescription register Shared Medicine Card (SMC).</s><s>The SMC is a central Danish database that contains information on all registered Danish citizens' prescriptions for the two most recent years.</s><s>During data collection, 366 patients met inclusion criteria and were scheduled with an appointment in either the Department of Endocrinology or the Department of Respiratory Medicine.</s><s>However, a significant number of these patients did not keep their appointments and were therefore not included in the study.</s><s>In addition, some patients declined participation due to fatigue, illness, or lack of time.</s><s>Patients received oral and written information about the study and gave written informed consent to participate, including consent to access the hospital electronic patient record.</s><s>We used the validated PATD instrument, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> which includes questions related to patients' attitudes toward their health, use of medications, and challenges experienced during contact with the healthcare system.</s><s>Following World Health Organization guidelines, <ref type="bibr">13</ref> we translated the questionnaire to the Danish language using forward-backward translation.</s><s>The questionnaire was pilot tested on five patients during interviews, and the questionnaire was revised based on the interview results.</s><s>Item 9, assessing how medication costs impacted patients' attitudes and willingness to deprescribe, was modified to make it applicable to patients in the Danish Healthcare System (DHS).</s><s>In the DHS, drugs prescribed at hospitals are free at the point of delivery, but those prescribed in the primary care sector, primarily by general practitioners, are subject to reimbursement.</s><s>The degree of reimbursement depends on individual patients' annual medication costs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14</ref></s><s>The original wording of item 9, "Having to pay for my medications would play a role in my willingness to stop one or more of them" was revised to "The cost of medications impacts my willingness to stop one or more of them" in the Danish version of PATD.</s></p><p><s>We expanded the questionnaire by including items about demographics (age, gender, and educational level), self-rated health (one item), and health literacy (four items from The Australian Health Literacy Questionnaire translated and validated into Danish). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15</ref></s><s>Participants were also asked whether they were interested in being contacted for an appointment at an outpatient clinic with a special focus on their medications.</s><s>Participants completed the questionnaire, which was distributed and collected by a pharmacist, at the outpatient clinics and could ask the pharmacist questions about the items in the questionnaire.</s><s>The data collection was stopped when a total of 100 patients had completed the questionnaire.</s></p><p><s>Information about the number of participants' diagnoses was collected from their electronic patient records from the hospital.</s><s>Multimorbidity was defined as having two or more of the following chronic conditions: diabetes, cancer, chronic back pain, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, joint disease, allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia (excluded from this study), schizophrenia, longterm use of antidepressants, anxiety, high cholesterol, hypertension, stroke, heart disease, and chronic pain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref></s><s>e study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (No.</s><s>BFH-2016-050).</s><s>According to Danish law, ethical permission is not required for survey studies.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Attitudes toward medications and deprescribing</head><p><s>Most participants (81, 81%) thought they took a large number of medications.</s><s>Most participants (65, 65%) also reported feeling confident about taking the number of medications they did, and 79 (79%) believed that their medications were necessary (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>When responding to visual cues showing certain amounts of tablets or capsules, 62 (62%) participants reported that they would feel comfortable with a maximum of daily intake of eight tablets or capsules (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, 85 (85%) reported that they would be willing to stop taking one or more of their regular medications if their doctor told them they could do so (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Approximately one in ten (11, 11%) felt that they took at least one regular medication that they no longer needed (Table <ref

participants (40, 40%) believed that one or more of their medications were causing side effects (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>The majority of participants (85, 85%) reported that they had a good understanding of the indication for their medications.</s><s>For 18 (18%) participants, the cost of medications influenced their willingness to stop taking them (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Less than half of participants (42, 42%) had experience with stopping one of their regular medications: of these, 16 (38%) reported that they did not need the withdrawed medication, whereas 25 (60%) reported that they had to restart the medication or start a new one (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Asked about what type of follow-up they would prefer if one or more medications were withdrawn, 67 (67%) participants answered that they would want personal contact, and 48 (48%) also wanted to receive written information via post or

<ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, 41 (41%) participants reported that they would be interested in a consultation in an outpatient clinic focusing on polypharmacy.</s><s>A similar proportion (42, 42%) reported that they were not interested, 15 (15%) responded that they were unsure about whether they would like a consultation, and 2 (2%) did not respond.</s></p><p><s>The supplementary tables revealed that there was no association between the participants' attitudes towards medication and deprescribing and self-rated health.</s><s>Likewise, we found no association between the participants' attitudes toward medication and deprescribing and health literacy.</s><s>Our cohort of multimorbid, Danish outpatients taking 10 or more medications felt that they had a large number of current prescriptions, although most participants were comfortable with the number of medications they took.</s><s>Most of the participants believed that their medications were necessary, and only few of the participants felt that they took unnecessary medication, which contrasts with the literature stating a high degree of inappropriate prescriptions in populations with excessive polypharmacy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref></s><s>A previous study from the DHS focusing on the quality of care for patients with multiple chronic conditions, found that patients with a high number of prescribed medications often have inappropriate medications on their list of prescribed medications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Thus, it seems that patients with a high number of prescribed medications can be comfortable with the medicine they take even though some of the medicine may be inappropriate.</s><s>In line with this, results from an Australian study focusing on patients' attitudes toward deprescribing showed that the willingness to deprescribe depended on patients' perceptions about medication appropriateness, fear of adverse outcomes related to withdrawal, dislike of taking medications, and the availability of a process for withdrawal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>rther, when participants were presented with visual cues of tablets and capsules, their responses suggested that they were not comfortable with the number of medications they actually took on a Forty percent of participants believed that one or more of their medications were causing adverse effects.</s><s>Many treatments entail adverse effects, and we expected that more participants would ascribe symptoms to medications.</s><s>The level of reported adverse effects could indicate that some patients do not associate symptoms they are experiencing with their medications.</s><s>However, the part of patients reporting adverse effects is consistent with results from other studies using the PATD questionnaire. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>st participants reported that they would like to withdraw one or more of their drugs if their doctor told them that they could do so.</s></p><p><s>Half of the participants preferred that deprescribing one or more of their drugs would be followed by a consultation with a healthcare professional, and the other half of the participants would have liked post or e-mail follow-up.</s><s>Less than half of the participants answered that they would be interested in a consultation in a specialised outpatient clinic focusing on polypharmacy.</s><s>Thus, it seems important that patients trust the healthcare provider who conducts the deprescribing consultation.</s><s>Other studies have identified trust as a core facet of effective therapeutic relationships, particularly for people with chronic illness because of their greater vulnerability, uncertainty regarding outcomes, and increased dependence on healthcare providers over extended periods of time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref></s><s>Thus, trusting healthcare providers and the healthcare system may be a vital strategy for individuals with chronic illness with many prescribed medications.</s><s>In addition, sufficient consultation time is essential; limited consultation time results in lower trust in patient-physician relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref></s><s>Our results
