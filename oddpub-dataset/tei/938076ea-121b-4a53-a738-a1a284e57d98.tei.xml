<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>IOS is an ongoing, international, prospective observational study (NCT01034969) monitoring the safety and effectiveness of icatibant during real-world use.</s><s>This registry was initiated in 2009 by Shire (Zug, Switzerland); by April 2015, 50 sites in 11 countries participated, including Austria, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</s><s>The study design is described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, physicians completed electronic forms when their patients attended routine clinic visits, approximately every 6 months.</s><s>A description of each attack that occurred between clinic visits was recorded, including the anatomical site(s), severity, time of administration of icatibant injection(s) and rescue medications, the point at which symptoms were resolved and whether the drug was self-administered or delivered by a health professional.</s><s>Patients evaluated the characteristics of attacks, including their severity.</s><s>Additionally, key medical history-related details and information on attacks occurring during the previous year were collected when patients enrolled in the IOS.</s><s>The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and received the approval of the respective local ethics committees and/or health authorities.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained for each patient.</s><s>Exploratory outcome measures included the percentage of attacks that involved the abdomen, skin and larynx and the proportion of patients experiencing specific attack severity (classified as very mild, mild, moderate, severe or very severe).</s><s>Further outcome measures included the total number of attacks that were self-treated, the percentage of attacks requiring more than one icatibant injection and the proportion of attacks treated with C1-INH concentrate as rescue medication.</s><s>Several time-related assessments were also measured, including number of hours between onset of the attack and first icatibant injection, between first and second doses of icatibant, between first administration of icatibant and resolution of symptoms, between second dose of icatibant and symptom resolution and the total duration of the attack (i.e. from onset to symptom resolution).</s><s>The time span of untreated attacks occurring within 12 months of enrolling in the IOS was also calculated and recorded as an average for each affected anatomical site.</s><s>Additionally, we assessed the age at which angioedema symptoms began, the age at diagnosis as well as the diagnostic delay after symptom onset for these two patient groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p><s>A mixed-model analysis of repeated measures (PROC MIXED; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used to compare time to treatment, time to resolution and duration of attack.</s><s>The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means between the two patient groups (C1-INH-AAE versus C1-INH-HAE types I/II).</s><s>The v 2 test (level of statistical significance, a 5 0Á05) was used to compare percentages between patient groups.</s><s>The generalized linear model with repeated measures (PROC GLIMMIX; SAS Institute Inc.) was used to compare severity between groups.</s></p></div>
