<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Lower intestinal perforations (LIPs) are rare in the general population with an incidence rate of about 0.04/1000 persons/year in the European population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">1</ref> The incidence of LIP increases with age and is higher in women than in men.</s><s>In most cases, perforations appear as a result of infected or inflamed diverticular disease.</s><s>Lethality is high, with rates of around 30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">2</ref> and increases with age. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">3</ref> In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), perforations of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract have been a concern for quite a long time.</s><s>In the prebiologic era, GI complications were among the most common causes of death in patients with RA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">4</ref> At that time, concerns mainly referred to perforations of the upper GI tract, for which non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most important risk factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">5</ref></s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[8]</ref> Similarly, GCs were found to be strongly associated with lower GI perforations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[11]</ref> with HRs in patients with RA of 2.8 (95% CI 1.3 to 6.1) compared with non-users <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">9</ref> or 4.7 (95% CI 1.9 to 12.0) when GCs and NSAIDs were used concomitantly.</s></p><p><s>Since the approval of the first biologics, the incidence of GI tract complications in RA was expected to decrease with the decreasing use of NSAIDs and high-dose GCs.</s><s>However, this is only the case if concomitant GCs can be reduced by effective therapy.</s><s>Curtis et al investigated the risk for GI tract complications on tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors (TNFi) and found a higher incidence of hospitalised GI perforation with concomitant GCs (1.12 (95% CI 0.5 to 2.5)/1000 patient years (PYs)) than without (0.47 (95% CI 0.2 to 0.98)). <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">9</ref></s><s>The British Biologics Register (BSRBR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">12</ref> compared the risk of GI perforations in patients treated with TNFi and those on conventional synthetic (cs) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) only.</s><s>While there was no statistically important elevation of the risk associated with TNFi with an incidence rate of lower GI perforations of 0.39/ 1000 PYs, concomitant GCs were the most important risk factor, conveying a 2.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 5.3) times higher risk, confined to lower GI perforations with a HR of 8.0 (95% CI 2.6 to 24.1).</s></p><p><s>The clinical development programme of tocilizumab (TCZ) for the treatment of RA identified GI perforations as important risk.</s><s>An integrated safety analysis of eight trials and long-term extension studies with TCZ reported that no GI perforation had occurred in the group treated with csDMARDs only, but 26 such cases were identified in patients of the group ever exposed to TCZ, resulting in an incidence rate of 2.8/1000 PYs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">13</ref> Eighteen of these perforations occurred in the colon.</s><s>Due to the early escape design of the trials, only 825 PYs were available in the csDMARD group, limiting the significance of the finding.</s></p><p><s>Since there is little information on the overall incidence of LIP in patients with RA exposed to specific treatments, no robust comparisons of the incidence rate of GI perforations could be made between TCZ-treated patients and those on other therapies.</s><s>Several other factors, such as diverticular disease, high disease activity or long-standing high-dose GC or NSAID use, could also have accounted for the higher incidence in TCZ-treated patients.</s><s>Further, the few studies existing in this field differ considerably in study design, case definition and population studied, the latter impacting on the background risk.</s></p><p><s>Prospective observational cohort studies, such as the German biologics register Rheumatoid Arthritis Observation of Biologic Therapy (RABBIT), have the advantage that all patients who start treatment with one of the approved biologic agents are eligible to be enrolled.</s><s>In addition, a control group treated with csDMARDs only is observed under the same protocol.</s><s>This design enables studying differences in incidence rates of adverse events occurring under different treatments.</s><s>The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for LIP within the RABBIT register, taking concomitant (time varying) dosages of NSAIDs and GCs into account.</s><s>We thereby aimed to examine the clinical signs and symptoms of LIP events to inform treating physicians how to advise their patients when starting a new treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS Patients</head><p><s>We used data of the German biologics register RABBIT captured and validated until 31 October 2015.</s></p><p><s>RABBIT is an ongoing observational cohort study that started in May 2001.</s><s>Since then, patients with RA are enrolled when starting a treatment with a biologic DMARD (bDMARD), or csDMARD after failure of at least one csDMARD.</s><s>Once enrolled, patients are observed for at least 5 years regardless of treatment terminations and changes (with the option to extend observation for another 5 years, if the patient agrees).</s></p><p><s>The study protocol was approved in 2001 by the ethics committee of the Charité University School of Medicine, Berlin.</s><s>Each patient participating in the study gave written informed consent before study entry.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments and procedures</head><p><s>During follow-up, information from rheumatologists and patients is captured at regular intervals: at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and thereafter every 6 months.</s><s>Data collected include clinical status, disease activity (including disease activity score based on 28 joints (DAS28)), details on DMARD treatment (substance, dosage, application, start and stop dates, reasons for stopping) and concomitant treatments like NSAIDs (yes/no) and GCs (actual dose and mean dose since last questionnaire).</s><s>At every time point of follow-up, all adverse events that occurred since last questionnaire are reported.</s><s>At baseline and every 2 years, rheumatologists report comorbid conditions in predefined groups and in plain text.</s><s>Patients report, among other items, physical function (using the Hannover Functional Status Questionnaire, FFbH).</s></p><p><s>Adherence to scheduled visits is monitored closely.</s><s>Investigations of dropouts (defined as two missing follow-ups) are performed regularly.</s><s>This includes inquiries to local administration offices regarding patient's vital status and, if the patient had died, obtaining the causes of death from the health authorities.</s><s>Complete details have been published. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">14</ref></s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome validation</head><p><s>To capture all LIPs, we first identified all events that might be associated with GI perforations (including also haemorrhages and bleedings of the intestinal tract) via a predefined group of MedDRA terms.</s><s>These included all events of the standard MedDRA query (SMQ) 'GI perforation' plus 51 additional MedDRA codes (see online supplementary table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Based on medical records and specific queries to the treating rheumatologists, all events were validated first by the leading physician of RABBIT (AS).</s><s>An additional external validation was done by the Head of the Department for Gastroenterology of the Charité University Medicine (BS).</s><s>At time of validation, both reviewers were blinded for the patient's treatment exposure.</s><s>Only events with a definite, non-iatrogenic and non-traumatic LIP were selected for the analysis.</s><s>We only counted perforations localised below the duodenojejunal junction (ligament of Treitz) as lower GI perforation.</s><s>The topmost localised perforation included in the analysis was in the terminal ileum.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of DMARD exposure</head><p><s>Treatment was assigned using a risk window for exposure to bDMARDs: a patient was considered exposed to a certain bDMARD at the time of the event if he/she had received at least one dose of the drug within 3 months (rituximab 9 months) prior to the event.</s><s>Patients unexposed to bDMARDs in this risk window were assigned to the csDMARD group.</s></p><p><s>All substances targeting TNF (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab) were subsumed under TNFi since we had not seen any differences in incidence rates.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Multiple Cox regression was applied to compare the risks of LIPs between the treatment groups.</s><s>Adjustment was made for age, sex, treatment with GCs and NSAIDs.</s><s>We distinguished current (Cox regression 1) and cumulative (Cox regression 2) treatment with NSAIDs and GCs.</s><s>For each patient, the portion of visits with new or ongoing NSAIDs treatment was used as a proxy for NSAID use (range: 0 to 1).</s><s>Regarding cumulative treatment with GCs, we proceeded in a similar way, but considered each month with a dose of &gt;5-10 mg/day with a weight of 0.5 and each month with a dose of &gt;10 mg/day with a weight of 1.</s><s>Further covariables (body mass index (BMI), number of bDMARD failures, DAS28) were additionally investigated in univariate Cox regression.</s><s>We applied two sensitivity analyses: (a) we restricted the cohort to a subgroup of patients recruited after 2009 and (b) we repeated Cox regression 1 and 2 but restricted the reference group to biologic naïve patients.</s><s>Exact Poisson and Clopper-Pearson binomial CIs were calculated for incidence rates and proportions.</s><s>The uncertainty of HRs is shown in 95% CIs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS Patients</head><p><s>Until 31 October 2015, 13 310 patients had been enrolled in the RABBIT register.</s><s>Patients in the csDMARD-treated biologic naïve control group were older and had shorter disease duration at inclusion than TNFi-treated patients.</s><s>Patients starting treatment with non-TNFi biologics had the longest disease duration and the highest number of prior treatment failures (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Most of them (66.1%) had prior TNFi treatment.</s></p><p><s>The prevalence of chronic GI disease at baseline was lowest in the csDMARD-treated group and highest in patients starting treatment with abatacept.</s><s>Chronic diverticulosis was reported in 33 patients.</s><s>In two patients, a history of diverticulitis was known to the rheumatologist, one of these patients had a perforated diverticulum before inclusion in the register.</s><s>None of the patients with chronic GI disease at baseline developed an intestinal perforation during follow-up.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>This is the first comparative analysis of real-life data on the risk of LIP, covering all DMARDs available in Germany for the treatment of RA.</s><s>In agreement with the results from the TCZ clinical development programme which qualified LIP as important identified risk, we found a rate of 2.7/1000 PYs in patients treated with TCZ.</s><s>This rate was significantly higher than in other biologic agents or csDMARDs.</s><s>It is of clinical importance that the majority of patients who experienced a LIP on TCZ did not have a history of diverticulitis.</s><s>Further, some patients with LIP presented with relatively mild symptoms.</s><s>In combination with the suppressed values of CRP under TCZ treatment, this may lead to a delayed diagnosis by non-specialised physicians not familiar with TCZ.</s><s>Rheumatologists should be aware that IL-6 inhibition can be associated with an increased risk of LIP in patients with prior diverticulitis.</s><s>Patients should be advised to observe signs and symptoms of LIP carefully and to inform nonspecialised doctors that CRP, in their case, cannot be interpreted as a marker of diverticular inflammation.</s><s>This could contribute to reduce a rare but serious risk in daily care.</s></p><p><s>Sharp &amp; Dohme, Pfizer, Roche and UCB.</s><s>The principal investigators and their team had full academic freedom in study design and conduct, data analysis and publication of results.</s><s>These stipulations were delineated in their contract with the sponsors.</s><s>For the purpose of information, all six funding companies received the manuscript 30 days prior to submission.</s><s>Publication of this article was not contingent on their approval.</s><s>The data interpretation, drafting, critical revision and approval of the final manuscript were performed solely by the authors.</s></p><p><s>Competing interests AS: personal fees from BMS, MSD, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi-Aventis outside the submitted work.</s><s>AR: honoraria from Pfizer.</s><s>BS: consultant for Abbvie, Janssen, Hospira, MSD, Mundipharma and Takeda and speaker fees from Abbvie, Falk, Ferring, Hospira, MSD and Takeda outside the submitted work.</s><s>PH: consulting fees, speaking fees and/or honoraria from AbbVie and Pfizer.</s><s>KR: personal fees from Roche, AbbVie, UCB, BMS and Celgen outside the submitted work.</s><s>AZ: grants and personal fees from AbbVie, BMS, MSD, Pfizer, Roche and UCB outside the submitted work.</s><s>JL: personal fees from Sandoz and Pfizer outside the submitted work.</s></p></div>
