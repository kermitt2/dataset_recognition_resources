<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and setting</head><p><s>Women were recruited in Berlin, Germany, from December 2012 to August 2014, using information materials (posters, flyers, and leaflets), the intranet platforms of Char-itéÀUniversitätsmedizin Berlin, and students' e-mail lists.</s><s>In adition, the study was advertised on 2 Berlin subway lines for 5 months.</s><s>Telephone interviews were used for participant prescreening.</s><s>To facilitate recruitment, a financial compensation of 30 EUR was introduced after 8 months.</s></p><p><s>Participants were eligible for the trial if they fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: female sex; 18 to 25 years of age (criterion broadened to 18À34 years after 8 months of recruitment to facilitate recruitment); having dysmenorrhea, defined as self-reported cramping pain during every menstrual cycle; no prior history of a gynecologic disease that could be a reason for dysmenorrhea; having had menstruation in the last 6 weeks and a menstrual cycle duration between 3 and 6 weeks; moderate or severe pain, defined as a score equal to or greater than 6 on a numeric rating scale (NRS, 0À10) for the worst pain intensity during the last menstruation; and providing written and oral informed consent.</s><s>Participants had to own a smartphone (iOS or Android) and to agree to enter study data through the app.</s><s>Patients were not eligible for the trial if they fulfilled any of the following exclusion criteria: already using or planning to use acupressure, acupuncture, shiatsu, or/and tuina massage in the following 8 months; or known pregnancy or planned pregnancy in the following 8 months.</s></p></div>
