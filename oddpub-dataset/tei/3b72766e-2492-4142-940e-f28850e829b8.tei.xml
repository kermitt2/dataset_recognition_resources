<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background:</head><p><s>The geographical distribution of ticks on companion animals needs to be monitored to develop and plan effective control measures, as suggested by the European Scientific Counsel on Companion Animal Parasites.</s><s>The aim of this study was to conduct the first Italian national survey of tick distribution on privately owned dogs.</s><s>Methods: The study was performed over 20 months (February 2016 -September 2017) and involved 153 veterinary practices in 64 different provinces covering 17/20 (85%) Italian regions.</s><s>Participating practitioners were asked to examine five different dogs per month at random and complete a questionnaire for each dog.</s><s>Differences in tick infestation associated with: sex, age and hair length (long and short); the dog's habitat (indoor or outdoor/kennel); and the dog's environment (urban or rural/sylvatic) were evaluated.</s><s>The attachment site of ticks on the dog was also recorded.</s><s>Acaricide efficacy was evaluated for the subset of dogs for which complete information on product used, date of sampling and date of last ectoparasiticide treatment was available.</s><s>Results: Of the 3026 dogs examined, 1383 (45.7%) were carrying at least one tick.</s><s>Overall, 2439 tick samples were collected and a total of 14 tick species identified.</s><s>Rhipicephalus sanguineus group were the most predominant ticks (63.6%), followed by Ixodes ricinus (30.6%) and I. hexagonus (5.6%).</s><s>Twenty-four dogs had mixed tick infestations.</s><s>Long-haired dogs had a higher tick infestation risk as did dogs with outdoor and rural/sylvatic lifestyles.</s><s>Ticks were located on the head (37.4%), the neck (28.8%), the muzzle (15.5%) and the back (15.3%).</s><s>A higher prevalence of Rhipicephalus was found in the interdigital spaces (10.8%) compared to Ixodes (0.2%).</s><s>Finally, ectoparasiticide treatments were found significantly protective against tick infestation, especially orally administered formulations.</s><s>Conclusions: Privately owned dogs in Italy have a high prevalence (45.7%) of infestation with ixodid ticks and this risk varies by dog phenotype and lifestyle.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and tick collection</head><p><s>A nationwide survey was performed in Italy from February 2016 to September 2017.</s><s>The project involved voluntary participation of veterinary practices in different areas of Italy.</s><s>The dogs enrolled in the study were homogeneously distributed across the regions using a criterion of proportional allocation, i.e. each region was assigned a number of dogs proportional to the total number of dogs registered in each region <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Each veterinary practice was provided with a "tick survey package" containing the study protocol, 60 questionnaires, 60 sample vials with 70% ethanol and a tick removal hook.</s><s>The protocol instructed participating vets to examine at least five dogs per month for ticks over the 20-month study period.</s><s>Dogs were to be randomly chosen without prior knowledge of their tick infestation status.</s><s>The questionnaire requested information on the location of the sampled dog (post code of the owner or, if this was not given, the practice postcode), breed, sex, age, hair length and recent ectoparasiticidal treatment (the last treatment for ticks and the drug used).</s><s>Additional questions included: the type of housing (indoor or outdoor/kennel), the environment in which dog is usually moved (urban, rural/sylvatic), and the attachment site of ticks if present.</s></p><p><s>At the time of the visit, each dog was thoroughly visually examined for 15-20 min to detect any ticks present.</s><s>Eleven body regions were observed including: head, muzzle, neck, armpits, back, abdomen, arts, tail, anus, vagina and interdigital spaces.</s><s>All ticks found were removed and preserved in the sample vials at room temperature for submission to the laboratories of Parasitology in Turin and Naples.</s><s>An individual identification number (ID) was assigned to each animal and questionnaires and vials were labeled with the same ID.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data handling and tick identification</head><p><s>Questionnaire and sample vial data were entered into an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet.</s><s>Ticks were identified to species level, life-stage (i.e.</s><s>larva, nymph or adult) and gender (female or male) under a stereomicroscope using appropriate morphological keys <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Specimens (86) that were difficult to identify from morphological characterization were selected for genetic analysis.</s><s>DNA was extracted using a commercial kit (HiPurA™ PCR Product Purification Kit, HiMedia, Mumbai, India) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</s><s>Partial mitochondrial 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene sequences were generated and analyzed using primers and PCR conditions as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Amplicons were resolved in ethidium bromide-stained (1.5%) agarose gels (Bio-Rad, Madrid, Spain) and sized by comparison with a marker in the 6X DNA Loading Dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA).</s><s>Gels were photographed using a digital documentation system (Gel Doc 2000, Bio-Rad, Watford, UK).</s><s>PCR products (amplicons) were purified (HiPurA™ Mammalian Genomic DNA Purification Kit, HiMedia) and sequenced.</s><s>Sequences were analyzed using the Chromas version 2.1.1 software and compared with the partial mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA gene sequences in GenBank.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mapping and statistical analysis</head><p><s>The location of positive dogs for each tick genera was geo-referenced using a geographical information system (GIS, ArcGIS version 10.3 ESRI), referring to the owner's postcode or, if missing, to the veterinary practice postcode for the dog.</s><s>GIS was also used to analyze spatial information on body locations of ticks on examined dogs.</s><s>Tick infestation differences were analyzed in association with dog sex, age, hair length (long and short), habitat (indoor or outdoor/kennel) and environment (urban or rural/ sylvatic) using the Chi-square test, with presence or absence of ticks as dependent variable.</s><s>Four categories were used for dog gender: male, female, male neutered and female neutered.</s><s>Dogs were classed into five groups for the age analysis: puppies (less than 1 year of age); young-adult (1-3 years); adult (4-6 years); old (7-10 years); and very old (&gt; 10 years).</s><s>Acaricide efficacy was evaluated for those dogs for which complete information on the product used, date of sampling and date of last acaricide treatment was available.</s><s>Differences were considered significant at P &lt; 0.05.</s><s>Chi-square tests and logistic regression were performed using SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM Corp.
