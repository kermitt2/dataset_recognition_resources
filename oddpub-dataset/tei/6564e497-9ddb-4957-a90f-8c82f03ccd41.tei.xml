<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective.</s><s>In disease-modifying antirheumatic drugnaive patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had achieved sustained low disease activity (a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate of Â£3.2 at both week 40 and week 52) after 1 year of treatment with certolizumab pegol (CZP) at a standard dose (200 mg every 2 weeks plus optimized methotrexate [MTX]), we evaluated whether continuation of CZP treatment at a standard dose or at a reduced frequency (200 mg every 4 weeks plus MTX) was superior to stopping CZP (placebo plus MTX) in maintaining low disease activity for 1 additional year.</s></p><p><s>Methods.</s><s>A total of 293 patients from period 1 of our study were re-randomized 2:3:2 in period 2 to CZP at a standard dose (n 5 84), CZP at a reduced frequency (n 5 127), or placebo plus MTX (CZP stopped) (n 5 82).</s><s>The primary end point was the percentage of patients who maintained low disease activity throughout weeks 52-104 without flares.</s><s>We used a hierarchical testing scheme, comparing CZP at a standard dose with CZP stopped.</s><s>If P &lt; 0.05 was achieved, then CZP at a reduced frequency was compared with CZP stopped (nonresponder imputation).</s></p><p><s>Results.</s><s>The 293 patients from period 1 represented 36% fewer patients than projected, yielding a smaller number of patients eligible for period 2. Higher proportions of patients treated with the standard and reduced frequency regimens maintained low disease activity than those who had stopped CZP (48.8% and 53.2%, respectively, versus 39.2% [P 5 0.112 and P 5 0.041, respectively; nominal P value, first hierarchical test not significant]).</s><s>Similar trends were observed for radiographic nonprogression (change from baseline of Â£0.5 in modified Sharp/van der Heijde score; 79.2% and 77.9% of patients, respectively, versus 70.3%) and normative physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index score of Â£0.5; 71.4% and 70.6% of patients, respectively, versus 57.0%).</s><s>Safety profiles were similar between all groups, with no new safety signals identified for continuing CZP to week 104.</s><s>No deaths were reported.</s></p><p><s>Conclusion.</s><s>The study failed to meet its primary end point.</s><s>However, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the standard and reduced frequency doses of CZP plus MTX; both controlled RA more effectively than stopping CZP.</s></p><p><s>With the current armamentarium of treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), targeting achievement of low disease activity or disease remission is recommended and achievable in many patients.</s><s>While there is agreement that the clinical response induced by biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should ideally be sustained, there is currently no consensus regarding the length of time that defines a sustained response.</s><s>Based on a state of enduring disease control, clinicians must also consider the possibility of successfully withdrawing or tapering therapy (i.e., decreasing dose or dosing frequency), a treatment concept referred to as the "induction-maintenance" approach.</s></p><p><s>Tapering therapies after achieving a desired treatment target has therefore become a topic of considerable interest; results of several recent trials have suggested that this may indeed be possible with several biologic agents, with some of these trials also focusing on patients with newly diagnosed RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Applying such treatment strategies may confer significant benefits to individual patients through the reduction of medication dosage and the associated risks while maintaining a state of disease control, as well as through easing of the economic burden of the disease as a result of increased cost effectiveness of the treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Current recommendations issued by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref> suggest continuation of therapy with only conditional recommendations for tapering, thereby implying that RA patients will thus spend long periods taking biologic agents.</s></p><p><s>The aim of the C-EARLY study was to advance potential care options with regard to the inductionmaintenance concept by evaluating the early initiation of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in combination with optimized methotrexate (MTX), as well as subsequent continuation, tapering, or withdrawal of CZP, in a population of DMARD-naive patients with early RA at high risk of progressive disease.</s><s>CZP is an Fc-free, PEGylated, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) biologic DMARD used to treat both established and early RA in combination with MTX <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Period 1 of the C-EARLY study (NCT01519791) assessed the efficacy and safety of 1 year of CZP in combination with optimized MTX versus optimized MTX alone.</s><s>Results from period 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> showed that significantly higher proportions of patients treated with CZP plus MTX achieved clinical treatment targets such as sustained remission (28.9% had a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [DAS28-ESR] of ,2.6 at both week 40 and week 52;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>C-EARLY is the first reported randomized, double-blind study with an anti-TNF biologic DMARD that compares the following 3 treatment strategies: continuation at full dose, tapering, or withdrawal of biologic therapy, in combination with optimized MTX, in maintaining low disease activity after 1 year of anti-TNF treatment in DMARD-naive patients with early and progressive, active RA.</s><s>Previous studies, such as the Productivity and Remission in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Etanercept vs. Standard of Care in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (PRIZE) study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, compared the effect of tapering to a half dose (25 mg/week) of etanercept in combination with MTX with the effects of etanercept withdrawal (with MTX) and treatment with placebo alone.</s><s>The Optimal Protocol for Methotrexate and Adalimumab Combination Therapy in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (OPTIMA) study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> compared the effect of continuing the full dose of adalimumab with the effects of biologic therapy withdrawal (with MTX) and MTX monotherapy.</s></p><p><s>The primary end point of the present study was not achieved.</s><s>Fewer patients than projected from period 1 were eligible to enter period 2 (i.e., achieved sustained low disease activity), which may have resulted in an underpowered study.</s><s>The use of sustained low disease activity at 2 consecutive study visits (both week 40 and week 52) as the entry criterion for period 2 was more difficult to achieve than a single-visit criterion.</s><s>The primary end point of period 2 was stringent, as patients were required to have maintained low disease activity throughout the entirety of the second year for 5 consecutive visits rather than just at a single study visit.</s><s>The expected 20% and 15% differences between the CZP standard and reduced frequency groups versus the CZP stopped group in the maintenance of low disease activity to week 104 were also not realized.</s><s>It should be noted that the study protocol design was undertaken in 2010, prior to the issuance of the 2011 ACR/ EULAR guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, in which the Simplified Disease Activity Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and Boolean-based definitions of low disease activity and remission superseded DAS28-ESRbased definitions as the closest reflection of "deep" disease control.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, results from period 2 of C-EARLY may still be of value to rheumatologists and patients, and could inform care options, since the data suggest that after 1 year of CZP treatment at the standard dose (200 mg every 2 weeks plus MTX), continuing treatment for an additional year at a reduced frequency dosage (200 mg every 4 weeks plus MTX) provided control of disease activity comparable to continuing treatment at the standard dose.</s><s>A numerically higher proportion of patients continuing CZP at both dosages maintained clinical response and improvements in physical function in comparison with patients who stopped CZP treatment after 1 year.</s></p><p><s>Unexpectedly, a slightly higher proportion of patients continuing treatment at the reduced frequency dose achieved low disease activity, remission, and normative physical function compared with patients continuing a standard dose of CZP.</s><s>This could have been due to the smaller-than-expected sample size, which led to more variability in the results.</s><s>However, the numerical differences between the CZP standard dose and reduced frequency groups are small and not considered clinically meaningful.</s></p><p><s>Treatment of patients very early in the course of RA is associated with inhibition of the progression of joint damage as well as with better clinical outcomes.</s><s>The 52week data from C-EARLY period 1 revealed that early initiation of CZP plus MTX significantly inhibited joint destruction compared with no CZP treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>The results of exploratory analyses from period 2 suggest that early initiation of CZP treatment can provide better and continued protection against progression of structural damage over a 2-year period, regardless of whether CZP was continued after 1 year.</s><s>This difference was larger when compared with the descriptive arm of the MTX responders, even though those patients had a good clinical response with 2 years of therapy with optimized MTX alone.</s><s>We note that our study was not powered to detect differences in radiographic progression rates; however, our findings are consistent with previous data from Japanese MTX-naive patients with early RA in the Certolizumab-Optimal Prevention of joint damage for Early RA (C-OPERA) trial, in which patients who had been treated with CZP plus MTX for 1 year exhibited lower rates of radiographic progression for 1 additional year after stopping CZP, in comparison with patients who had been receiving 2 years of MTX monotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>.</s><s>Similar results were also reported in DMARD-naive patients started on adalimumab plus MTX in the High Induction Therapy with Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (HIT HARD) study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, although with a shorter (24-week) treatment duration.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the clinical efficacy described above, early initiation of CZP plus MTX has demonstrated benefits over optimized MTX alone in patient-reported measures such as workplace and household productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>More patients who continued the standard or reduced frequency doses were able to maintain the initial 52-week improvements up to week 104 in comparison with patients who stopped CZP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>MTX therapy in this study was optimized by week 8 (i.e., patients were given the maximum tolerated dose, between 15 mg and 25 mg) (9).</s><s>To our knowledge, the Dutch U-Act-Early study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> and our international C-EARLY study are the only trials to mandate per-protocol optimization of MTX to achieve high levels of MTX dosage in DMARD-and MTX-naive patients with early RA.</s><s>This optimization may in part explain the good clinical responses achieved by the MTX responders over the course of the 2 years.</s></p><p><s>There were low numbers of flares reported in this study, a limitation which was likely due to the requirement that flares be self-reported by the patient.</s><s>The physicians involved in this study did not have a systematic evaluation method and were not mandated to formally assess disease flares.</s><s>Although DAS components were measured at each study visit, the investigator remained blinded with regard to the DAS score.</s><s>The low number of flares is not reflected by the relatively high proportion of patients (;50%) who did not maintain low disease activity.</s><s>Of those who had disease flares, most (80%) achieved low disease activity again, and no safety issues were identified in those patients.</s><s>However, because too few patients were identified as having a disease flare, no formal conclusions can be drawn about the safety and efficacy of reintroduction of the CZP standard dose in restoring low disease activity.</s><s>Further evaluation of flares among the patients in this study is warranted.</s><s>No new safety signals were identified for an additional 52 weeks of CZP plus MTX treatment, and the safety profile was consistent between all groups, including the MTX responder patients, who had been treated with placebo plus optimized MTX for 2 years and had never received CZP.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the data from the first 52 weeks of the C-EARLY study demonstrated a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio for early initiation of CZP plus MTX therapy in DMARD-naive patients within 1 year of receiving their diagnosis of active RA with poor prognostic factors for disease progression (9).</s><s>Clinical improvements achieved by the early initiation of CZP therapy during period 1 of the study were maintained in numerically more patients who continued at the standard or reduced frequency doses, thus providing support for the "induction-maintenance" approach for this specific population of patients with early RA who had never been exposed to either synthetic or biologic DMARDs.</s><s>Exploratory analyses of radiographic data reported from period 2 suggested that early CZP initiation could be a better option for avoiding structural damage in this patient population compared with treatment with MTX alone, supporting the results reported from other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Further research would be needed to identify the characteristics of patients who would be able to stop CZP therapy successfully.</s><s>By investigating the effect of continuing or tapering biologic DMARD therapy after reaching a disease target, our study contributes to the body of knowledge supporting the induction-maintenance treatment approach, and our results inform the evolving paradigms of disease management in RA while also highlighting the need for further clinical trial evidence.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
