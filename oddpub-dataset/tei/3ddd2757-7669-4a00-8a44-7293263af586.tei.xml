for this study: the proportion of patients who achieved the Peripheral SpA Response Criteria (PSpARC40) at week 12.</s><s>The PSpARC40 was defined as Ն40% improvement (Ն20-mm absolute improvement) from baseline in the VAS scores for patient's global assessment of disease activity and patient's global assessment of pain, and Ն40% improvement from baseline in at least one of the following features: 1) swollen joint count (SJC) (total of 76 joints assessed) and tender joint count (TJC) (total of 78 joints assessed), 2) total enthesitis count, or 3) dactylitis count.</s><s>The total

in a group of SpA patients who were previously excluded from trials of anti-TNF agents for the treatment of AS or PsA.</s></p><p><s>The nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA patient population enrolled in this trial was younger and had a greater proportion of women compared to the PsA study population enrolled in clinical trials of anti-TNF therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr"

diagnosis.</s><s>This delay may be due to underdiagnosis of this disease population.</s><s>The mean TJC and SJC were also lower (13 and 7, respectively) compared to those in patients with PsA (TJC

more than 50% of the patients.</s><s>However, the baseline values for patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity and the HAQ-S in this study indicate that the levels of disease activity and functional impairment were comparable between patients with nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA and patients with PsA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>The proportion of patients with enthesitis at baseline and the enthesitis index scores suggest that in addition to peripheral arthritis, enthesitis may have a substantial contribution to the overall burden of disease in nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA.</s></p><p><s>This study demonstrated that 39% of patients in the adalimumab group achieved the primary end point of PSpARC40 response compared to 20% of patients in the placebo group.</s><s>These results suggest that the novel composite end point of the PSpARC40, which was developed specifically for this nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA population, performs well in discriminating the efficacy of the active drug from the placebo treatment in this population while enabling a comprehensive evaluation of disease activity.</s><s>Other cutoff values for the PSpARC response (PSpARC20, PSpARC50, and PSpARC70) were also tested, and similar effect sizes across all 4 PSpARC response thresholds were observed.</s><s>Based on subgroup analyses, the presence of an elevated hsCRP level at baseline was the only significant predictor of the PSpARC40 response to adalimumab therapy at week 12.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with previously published reports on the benefits of anti-TNF therapy in enthesitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>, significant improvement in enthesitis was demonstrated following treatment with adalimumab, as indicated by the Leeds and SPARCC enthesitis indices but not by the MASES.</s><s>The MASES was developed for the AS population <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and assesses sites of entheses in primarily axial locations, in contrast to the Leeds and SPARCC indices, and thus may not be as suitable for a peripheral SpA population <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>.</s><s>Baseline enthesitis scores were low, as were the baseline dactylitis counts.</s><s>Fewer than 25% of patients had dactylitis at baseline.</s><s>Thus, no treatment effect on the dactylitis count was noted at week 12.</s></p><p><s>Composite measures that have been used previously in clinical trials of AS were also noted to discriminate between active drug and placebo in the present study.</s><s>The mean change in the BASDAI and ASDAS inactive disease response rates were better in patients treated with adalimumab compared to those receiving placebo.</s><s>This may be largely attributed to the components that reflect involvement of the peripheral joints and entheses.</s><s>These observations are consistent with the findings in a study by Paramarta et al, in which the BASDAI50 score (adalimumab 42% versus placebo 5%) and ASDAS inactive disease score (adalimumab 42% versus placebo 0%) showed significant improvements in those treated with adalimumab compared to those receiving placebo after 12 weeks of therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the ASDAS category of inactive disease, clinical remission was measured using the PSpARC remission criteria, with the results demonstrating that the frequency of disease remission was higher among patients treated with adalimumab.</s><s>Furthermore, in the adalimumab group, significant improvement in function and health-related quality of life, as measured using the SF-36v2 PCS, was also observed.</s></p><p><s>Adalimumab was well tolerated during the 12week double-blind study period in this study population.</s><s>There were only 2 serious AEs, and there were no serious infections, tuberculosis, malignancies, or deaths.</s><s>No new safety signal was observed during the 12-week double-blind period beyond what is already known about the safety profile of adalimumab in SpA (AS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, PsA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and nonradiographic axial SpA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>) and other immune-mediated diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Limitations of this study include the duration of the double-blind period, which did not allow for a longer-term analysis of the efficacy of adalimumab compared to placebo in this patient population.</s><s>Longer observation is also needed to better characterize the safety of adalimumab in patients with nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA.</s><s>The primary efficacy end point, the PSpARC40, has not been validated in other peripheral SpA cohorts.</s><s>However, validation of this outcome measure is ongoing.</s><s>Other cutoff levels (e.g., the PSpARC50) might better differentiate between active drug and placebo.</s><s>The BASDAI and ASDAS are vali-dated for patients with AS, but not for patients with peripheral SpA; however, most of the components used to calculate the ASDAS are applicable to a peripheral SpA population.</s></p><p><s>Patients with nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA can benefit from alternative, more effective treatment options.</s><s>After 12 weeks, adalimumab significantly ameliorated the signs and symptoms of disease and improved physical function in patients with active nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA who had experienced an inadequate response or intolerance to NSAIDs.</s><s>The safety profile of adalimumab in this patient population was consistent with the well-established safety of adalimumab in multiple immune-mediated diseases.</s><s>Longer-term data are needed to confirm and support the current findings of a favorable benefit-risk profile of adalimumab in patients with nonpsoriatic peripheral SpA.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
