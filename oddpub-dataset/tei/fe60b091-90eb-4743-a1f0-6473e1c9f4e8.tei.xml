<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and study population</head><p><s>The study was conducted in the Qazvin province (Located 150 km northwest of Tehran), which contains 2% of the population of Iran.</s><s>Qazvin has 73 secondary schools within two different educational districts.</s><s>A list of schools was obtained from the Organization for Education at Qazvin.</s><s>Schools were eligible for the study if they were situated in Qazvin province and were not currently engaged in an oral health education and promotion program.</s><s>Five secondary schools were not eligible for the study for these reasons leaving 68 schools for potential inclusion.</s></p><p><s>The study employed a cluster randomized controlled trial design.</s><s>There were three conditions (termed Ôgeneral planningÕ, Ôimplementation intentionÕ and Ôactive controlÕ) with data collected at baseline, one and six months.</s><s>All procedures were carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.</s><s>The study was approved by both the Ethics Committee of Qazvin University of Medical Sciences and the Organization for Education at Qazvin.</s><s>The trial was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>database (NCT02066987).</s><s>All participants and their parents provided informed consent prior to participation, and all information about the participants was kept strictly confidential.</s><s>The CONSORT checklist is available as Checklist S1.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size</head><p><s>The sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome measure (self-reported brushing).</s><s>It was estimated that 370 adolescents would be needed in each condition to detect a medium-sized effect (CohenÕs d = 0.50), with 95% power and a significance level of 5%, assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.30, a mean cluster size equal to 25, with 16 clusters, a 1/3 allocation ratio, and 5% lost to follow up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment</head><p><s>To account for potential attrition, we aimed to recruit 1,110 students from the 68 eligible schools.</s><s>According to a report of the Organization for Education at Qazvin, high school classes contained an average of 25 students.</s><s>Therefore, 48 schools were selected randomly from 68 eligible schools providing a potential yield of around 1200 students.</s><s>Twenty-four schools were selected randomly from each of the two districts in the recruitment area including twelve boysonly and twelve girls-only schools from each district.</s><s>An invitation letter was sent to the principals of eligible schools to participate in the study.</s><s>All 48 eligible schools agreed to participate in the study and the study aims were subsequently communicated to the adolescents and their parents.</s><s>Recruitment started in February 2014, and 1 month and 6 month follow ups were completed in April 2014 and October 2014.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> shows the flow of students through the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>A total of 1,308 students were screened for study eligibility.</s><s>Of the 1,271 eligible students, a total of 1,158 (91.1%) students in 48 schools participated in the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random Allocation</head><p><s>Due to the potential for contamination between conditions if students in the same class were allocated to different conditions, stratified cluster randomization was used to assign a classroom from each of the schools into three conditions.</s><s>StrataÕs for randomization were education district and gender.</s><s>That is, from each district, one class from a boys-only and one class from a girls-only school was randomly assigned into one of the three conditions.</s><s>A computer-generated list of random numbers was used by an independent statistician to randomize classes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Masking</head><p><s>The research assistants, statisticians and outcome assessors were all masked to condition.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention</head><p><s>After baseline assessment, all adolescents received a leaflet containing information on oral health, the importance of brushing, and the recommended number of times that people should brush daily.</s><s>The correct technique for brushing was presented using photos.</s><s>The modified Bass technique of toothbrushing was described in order to promote plaque removal from both coronal and gingival margins <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>All adolescents were provided with a toothbrush and toothpaste after reading the leaflets.</s><s>Finally, the adolescents were provided with a calendar and asked to keep a record of their dental brushing behavior.</s><s>The intervention was delivered by a health psychologist with a background in oral health (the first author).</s><s>Participants in the general planning condition then received following instructions:</s></p><p><s>It may be helpful for you to plan when and where you will brush your teeth each day over the next month.</s><s>Please write below when, where, and after what activity you will brush your teeth (e.g., at 8.00 a.m. and 9.00 p.m. in the bathroom after eating breakfast/dinner).</s><s>Because you should brush your teeth twice a day, please make two plans.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I will brush my teeth at ____(WHEN) at or in ____(WHERE) before/after ____(ACTIVITY).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention effects on intention and PBC</head><p><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>, adolescents in the implementation intention condition reported stronger intentions to brush in the future than those in the planning condition at the 1-month and six-month assessments.</s><s>Adolescents in both intervention conditions reported significantly stronger intentions to brush compared to adolescents in the control condition (p &lt; 0.05) at the one-month and six-month assessments.</s><s>Moreover, adolescents in both planning conditions reported more PBC over brushing compared to adolescents in the control condition (p &lt; 0.05), but there was no significant differences between the intervention conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention effects on self-monitoring and frequency of planning</head><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows that adolescents in both intervention conditions showed a significant increase in self-monitoring of brushing and more frequent planning compared to adolescents in the control conditions at both 1-month and 6-month follow-ups.</s><s>At the 1-month and 6-month time points, adolescents in the implementation intention condition reported using planning strategies more frequently compared than those in planning condition.</s><s>However, there was no significant difference between intervention conditions in self-monitoring over time.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present research provided one of the first tests of the effects of planning (specifying when, where, and how to act) and forming implementation intentions (specifying the same in an if-then format) on adolescentsÕ dental brushing behavior using an experimental design with one and six months follow-up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of planning and implementation intentions on dental behavior</head><p><s>As hypothesized, the planning and implementation intention interventions had a significant effect on self-reported brushing behavior, clinical, and psychological outcomes as compared to an active control condition.</s><s>This finding is in line with SchŸz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> who found that a brief planning intervention specifying when, where, and how to floss increased flossing compared to a control condition 2 and 8 weeks later.</s><s>It is worth noting, however, that despite the considerable room for improvement in baseline self-reported brushing behavior in the present research (the baseline frequency of self-reported brushing was below 13 times per month on average), even the highest rate of self-reported brushing post intervention (16 times per month in the implementation intention condition 6 months post intervention) was far from the recommended rate of brushing (approximately 60 times per month) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>This observation demonstrates that, although planning and implementation intentions are effective in increasing the target behavior, additional intervention components might be needed in order to achieve the recommended level of behavioral performance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of planning compared with implementation intentions on dental behavior</head><p><s>Confirming Hypothesis 2, the implementation intention intervention was significantly more effective in promoting brushing behavior and clinical outcomes.</s><s>This finding supports the idea (and accumulating evidence) that making plans for action in a contingent if-then format is particularly effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The difference between forming implementation intentions and more general forms of planning is that good opportunities to act (specified in the if-part of the plan) are explicitly linked to suitable responses to these opportunities (in the then-part of the plan).</s><s>The consequence is that good opportunities to act are swiftly and accurately identified and intended responses are initiated relatively automatically Ð that is quickly, efficiently, and without deliberation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, more general forms of planning may serve only to overcome the problem of poorly elaborated intentions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, rather than instigating cognitive processes that foster effective goal striving.</s><s>On the basis of the present findings, we therefore recommend that researchers and practitioners interested in promoting oral health in adolescents (and other outcomes) prompt motivated participants to form if-then plans to support their intentions.</s><s>Studies have shown implementation intentions to be feasible and effective Òone minute interventionsÓ which can be delivered without face-to-face contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The formation of implementation intentions might, therefore, be prompted through filling in electronic or paper-based planning exercises as part of daily clinical routines.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The present research has some limitations.</s><s>First, our primary outcomes were self-reported measures of oral health behavior, which may be susceptible to bias due to memory or social desirability.</s><s>However, the clinical measures used in this study showed similar effects as the selfreport measures and previous evidence has attested to the validity of self-report measures of brushing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Second, the extent to which the obtained effects are sustainable beyond 6 months are unclear.</s><s>Future studies may benefit from examining effects over even longer time periods.</s><s>The largest changes occurred between baseline and 1 month follow-up and so future studies should consider maintenance of the effects and how if-then planning can be used to promote habitual behavior and to deal with lapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Planning interventions are an economic and effective way to change oral self-care behavior.</s><s>The findings of this study suggest that specifying when, where, and how to perform the goal-directed behavior and, in particular, forming implementation intentions (specifying the above in a contingent if-then format) has the potential to increase dental brushing rates among adolescents.</s><s>Note.</s><s>SD = standard deviation, There were no significant differences between the conditions in demographic characteristics and cognitive variables</s></p></div>
