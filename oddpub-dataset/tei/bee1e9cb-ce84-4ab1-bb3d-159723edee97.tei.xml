ACS patients with T2DM.</s><s>The results demonstrate that the combination group produced more LDL-C reduction during acute phase for Chinese ACS patients with T2DM.</s><s>The greater reduction of LDL-C level was observed in the combination group compared with statins group (39% VS. 18.5%, p = 0.007) at day 7 th after treatment.</s><s>LDL-C level was reduced by 50% in the combination therapy

between the treatment groups.</s><s>Data are expressed as mean ± SE.</s></p><p><s>patients received combination therapy at day 30 th .</s><s>According to the 2011 ESC/EAS guideline for the management of dyslipidemia for patients with very high risk, the target of LDL-C should be less than 1.8 mmol/L or reduced by 50%, our study show that there are 77% patients in the combination group achieved the recommended LDL-C goal, compared with 45% patients in statins group.</s><s>This study demonstrated that the combination therapy significantly improve the control rate of LDL-C level during acute phase of ACS in Chinese patients with T2DM.</s><s>Therefore, adding EZ to moderate statins is more effective strategy to get significant additional LDL-C-lowering and make more Chinese patients to achieve LDL-C goal.</s><s>Recent study reported that the early reduction of LDL-C level was associated with the reduced cardiovascular events such as recurrent ischemic events and death in ACS patients in the 16 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The present study indicates that stains combined with EZ bring more Chinese ACS patients with T2DM achieve the target LDL-C the goal in early stage, more patients will benefit from lower LDL-C level eventually.</s><s>Recently, the IMPROVE IT trial demonstrated that the LDL-C level was significantly decreased in EZ/Simvastatin group compared with the simvastatin group in the 30 days.</s><s>In addition, LDL-C lowering effect in combination therapy continued through-out at least 2.5 years follow-up with good safety and significantly reduced the incidences of CVD morality, MI and stroke.</s><s>The levels of TG were decreased by 20% and 22% in combination group and statins group at day 30 th , respectively, but no significant difference

EZ were not potent enough to improve HDL-C level in Chinese ACS with T2DM patients.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies show that the combination of EZ and statins provided greater reduction on hs-CRP compared with statins monotherapy for 12 weeks in hypercholesterolemia patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>We observed that the levels of serum hs-CRP were significantly decreased in both groups at day 30 th , compared with those at baseline.</s><s>Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between two groups (47% and 42%, P =

compared with those in the combination group.</s><s>Moreover, the reduction of hs-CRP levels in each group might be explained by acute inflammation regression after acute stage of ACS and may not be related to the statins or statins combined with EZ.</s><s>Therefore, based on the present evidence, we cannot overemphasize the anti-inflammatory effects of either statins or EZ <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The recent study showed that EZ can improve the IR in the metabolic syndrome with elevated LDL-C (&gt;120 mg/dl) patients in the EZ group <ref
