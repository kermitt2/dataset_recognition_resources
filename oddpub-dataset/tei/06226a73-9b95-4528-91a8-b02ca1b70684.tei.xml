<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Most MKs are residing directly at the vessels.</s><s>We performed in vivo antibody labeling targeting the MK-specific and platelet-specific von Willebrand factor receptor subunit GPIX (CD42a) to overcome the limitations of the CD41-YFP mouse and to stain the entire MK population in the mouse BM, without affecting platelet production (Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-D</ref>).</s><s>This labeling scheme also obviated the necessity for TPO-treatment to increase the number of labeled MKs.</s><s>Since platelets are continuously produced, we analyzed MK migration under steady-state conditions, visualizing the BM in the mouse skull using 2P-IVM.</s><s>We tracked single MKs (n = 54) over time at a frame rate of 1f/min and discovered that the cells were sessile (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>, Supplementary Movie 1).</s><s>MKs had an instantaneous velocity of 0.38 ± 0.47 µm/min (median ± SD) and displayed either just a wobbling or shifted their center of mass during proplatelet formation at BM sinusoids, in line with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>We then assessed MK mobility by analyzing MK tracks based on an anomalous diffusion model.</s><s>The mean squared displacement (MSD = &lt; r 2 (t) &gt; = 4 K α t α ) of MKs was calculated for different time scales t as the MSD can be directly linked to (the time scale-dependent) diffusion coefficient K α and the anomalous diffusion exponent α.</s><s>For MK migration, we found low values (median ± SD) for the MSD (0.35 ± 0.41 µm 2 ) and α (0.65 ± 0.22), indicating a slow, subdiffusion-like movement in a highly crowded environment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), further demonstrating hindered movement of MKs in the BM.</s></p><p><s>As most studies of murine hematopoiesis have been performed on long bones and 2P-IVM approach in the cranial BM has a limited field of view, we next performed immunohistochemical analysis of cryo-sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> of murine femora (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and sterna (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Under steady-state conditions, we found no regions lacking cells of the megakaryocytic lineage (CD41-positive).</s><s>Surprisingly, MKs were not only found near the sinusoids (labeled with anti-CD105 or anti-CD31 antibodies), but also in close contact to endosteal zones (indicated by dark regions surrounding the BM, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a, b</ref>).</s><s>MK diameters were comparable in sternum and femur (22.19 ± 0.14 µm vs. 22.57</s><s>± 1.44 µm) and in both, the majority of MKs (68.2 ± 6.9% vs. 73.1 ± 5.2%) was found in direct contact with the vessel (distance &lt; 2 µm), which is in agreement with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Of note, consecutive cryo-sections confirmed that more than 99% of CD41-positive MKs were also positive for GPIX (CD42a) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Both groups also showed identical MK diameters and percentage of vessel association.</s><s>We next examined the localization of the MK-specific tubulin isoform β1 as a marker for mature MKs 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>As expected, mature β1-positive MKs were larger than immature β1-negative CD41-positive cells (23.53 ± 6.23 µm vs. 20.19 ± 4.24 µm, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, however, maturation was not accompanied by altered MK distribution, as the majority of both β1-tubulin negative and positive cells were in direct contact with the vessel (66.9 ± 4.5 vs. 73.9</s><s>± 4.9%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>In addition, vessel-MK distances of non-vessel associated (NVA) MKs were indistinguishable for β1-tubulin negative and positive cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>Next, we assessed the percentage of β1-tubulin positive CD41-positive cells within 100 µm distance from the bone cortex, compared to more distant MKs.</s><s>Interestingly, the percentage of β1-tubulin positive cells among all MKs was identical between the 'bone-associated' and more distant MK population (83.0 ± 2.8% vs. 82.7 ± 2.6%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the majority of MKs was found in close proximity to the sinusoids, independently of their size or maturation state.</s></p><p><s>MKs are distributed throughout the BM.</s><s>To assess the MK distribution in its intact 3D environment, we utilized light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) to examine complete and intact bones (Supplementary Movie 2, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A, B</ref>).</s><s>We first established a clearing protocol, leading to optically transparent bones (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C, D</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>To avoid staining artifacts due to insufficient antibody penetration in situ, we performed in vivo labeling using an anti-GPIX antibody derivative <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>LSFM transversal imaging of the cleared and intact femora and sterna allowed visualization of MKs with a resolution of less than 2 µm, which was sufficient to identify proplatelets extended by MKs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>, Supplementary Movie 3 and 4).</s><s>3D reconstructions of LSFM data revealed a surprisingly dense blood vessel network with an average vessel-to-vessel distance of only 43.18 ± 12.72 µm in the sternum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>The mean MK diameter was determined as 20.36 ± 8.19 µm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), comparable to the values obtained with cryo-sections.</s><s>Thus, the spatial distribution of MKs is highly restricted by the vasculature as the vessel-to-vessel distance equals the diameter of two MKs.</s><s>In line with this, we found that 79.3 ± 5.1% of MKs localized adjacent to the blood vessels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>This value is higher than those obtained by analyzing cryo-sections, likely due to vessels which are missed as they are located above or beneath the analyzed plane of the bone section.</s></p><p><s>Analyzing the 3D LSFM data sets by virtual slicing revealed that the 3D information significantly improves quantitative cell analysis, as it reduces the risk of overrating cell distances due to 'off-center' cell slicing and other well-known cutting artifacts.</s><s>Equally important, LSFM enabled us to analyze 30-fold more MKs per bone sample compared to conventional sections.</s><s>Thus, we can demonstrate that within an entire bone the pool of MKs is distributed throughout the microvessel network.</s><s>Analysis of five equally sized sub-stacks of the complete 3D stack of an intact bone revealed identical values in all MK parameters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>), further supporting the hypothesis that the entire BM contains MKs.</s><s>Next, we assessed whether the BM is structured differently between different types of bone.</s><s>To this end, we confirmed that the bone-like structures at the outer linings of femur or sternum sections are positive for collagen I 21 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>), and partly positive for osteocalcin (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>We noted that in our LSFM data these structures displayed a characteristic auto-fluorescence signal (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>), enabling segmentation of bone structures from our LSFM data (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4A, B</ref>).</s><s>We determined the bone-to-bone and vessel-to-vessel distances of femur diaphysis (Supplementary Movie 5), femur epiphysis (Supplementary Movies 6 and 7), sternum (Supplementary Movie 8), and cranial BM (Supplementary Movie 9).</s><s>Of note, while bone-to-bone distances differed between femur diaphysis and the other three types of bone (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>), vessel-to-vessel vessel, as well as MK-to-vessel distances were indistinguishable (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, the majority of MKs was vessel-associated in all four types of BM (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>).</s><s>As the 'classical concept' of megakaryopoiesis suggests a migration from the bone associated (BA) endosteal niche towards the vasculature during MK maturation, we compared bone-associated; less than 100 µm distance from the bone cortex) and non-bone-associated (NBA) MKs (Fig. <ref type="figure">4e</ref>) in femur diaphysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f</ref>) and sternum (Fig. <ref type="figure">4g</ref>).</s><s>Notably, in either case BA and NBA MK parameters were indistinguishable (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f, g</ref>), corroborating our finding that we could not detect any MK-deficient areas within the BM.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Platelet depletion does not affect megakaryocyte motility.</head><p><s>Having established assays for MK motility and 3D distribution, we next tested the effects of increased platelet consumption.</s><s>We depleted platelets using anti-GPIbα antibodies that cause rapid Fc-independent platelet clearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>This antibody treatment resulted in severe thrombocytopenia (virtually no circulating platelets on d1; 10.4 ± 8.7% of the respective unaffected values on d3, restored platelet counts on d7,

periods of several hours.</s><s>MKs displayed an instantaneous velocity of 0.02 ± 0.06 µm/s (median ± SD) and MK tracks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b, c</ref>, Supplementary Movie 10) resembled those of steady-state conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, MSD values (0.40 ± 0.39 µm 2 ) and α values (0.45 ± 0.18) were low, indicating that

performed LSFM analyses of sterna at multiple time points post platelet depletion.</s><s>Notably, we did not detect any signs of MK loss due to rupture and the main MK parameters remained grossly

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our whole-organ imaging approach revealed that the entire inter-bone space is filled with BM that is fully vascularized, leaving

directly at the sinusoids (Fig. <ref type="figure">7d</ref>), independently of their distance to the bone cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Thus, vasculature seems to dictate the distribution of the vast majority of MKs, namely those in direct contact to the vessels.</s><s>In contrast, NVA MKs are randomly distributed across the BM with negligible mobility.</s><s>Moreover, there are no differences in the distribution of 'young' and mature MKs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>This clearly contradicts the current idea of cellular migration during megakaryopoiesis.</s></p><p><s>Notably, the current model is based primarily on the seminal paper of Avecilla et al., who revealed that a co-injection of SDF1 and FGF4 into c-MPL-deficient mice transiently increases platelet counts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>The increased MK numbers at the sinusoids after SDF1-injection have been interpreted as result of MK migration towards the vessel.</s><s>However, an increase of MK numbers-due to accelerated HSC differentiation-would inevitably result in an increase of MKs with vessel contact, even if the relative MK distribution remained unaltered.</s><s>As HSCs and other progenitor cells are also affected by the CXCR4-SDF1 axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , it is possible that this initial study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , which used relatively long observation periods after SDF1 treatment, was confounded by effects acting rather indirectly on the spatiotemporal MK distribution.</s></p><p><s>The current model of MK migration is also supported by in vitro data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Thus, CXCR4 might be critical to facilitate the last step of MKs and to some extent polarize them, so that they adhere to the endothelial layer (as it has been described in vitro by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> ) before they start forming proplatelets.</s><s>However, to the best of our knowledge, WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome), which is at least in some patients caused by hyperreactive CXCR4 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> is not associated with altered platelet counts.</s><s>Thus, it may as well be that CXCR4 signaling is not required for thrombopoiesis.</s><s>Mazharian et al. assessed MK migration using cell tracking and visualizing cell movement in vitro, albeit in the absence of BM environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>They revealed that SDF1-triggered MK migration depends on the Src-Syk-PLCγ2 axis.</s><s>However, platelet counts are not affected by MK and platelet specific Syk-deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Of note, deficiency of talin1 or kindlin-3, both critical mediators of integrin activation and cell migration, did not affect platelet counts either <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>More importantly, we did not observe any effects of talin-deficiency on MK distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, leukocyte adhesion deficiency, type III patients, who have loss-offunction mutations in FERMT3 (the gene encoding for kindlin-3) do not suffer from thrombocytopenia.</s><s>Independently of the relevance of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling in vitro, our study clearly demonstrates that MKs do not need to migrate to the vessel due to the low vessel-to-vessel distances.</s><s>One reason appears to be the dense BM vasculature restricting the extraluminal space in vivo, thereby precluding the need for MK migration, as growing MKs will reach a vessel with minimal movement.</s><s>In addition, our 2P-IVM data, with up to 4-h long recordings, show that MKs barely move.</s><s>The vessel-associated localization of MKs enables a rapid response under conditions of increased platelet need.</s><s>After platelet depletion we did not observe MK rupture, indicating that only under inflammatory conditions 7 platelet generation may occur without proplatelet formation.</s><s>Interestingly, platelet depletion did neither affect MK migration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b, c</ref>) nor the MK distribution in the BM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d-f</ref>).</s><s>Such overall unaltered MK distribution, even under conditions of elevated platelet production, provides indirect evidence for the existence of a key regulatory mechanism that places the origin of the vast majority of MKs in closest vicinity to the vessels.</s><s>In support of this, we observed a similar distribution of 'young' (β1-tubulin negative) vs. mature MKs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>This allows platelet counts to recover quickly after depletion.</s><s>Even if the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, the findings here unveil that it is crucial to pay particular attention to the vascular niche when it comes to the origin of MKs.</s><s>In contrast, the 'real' endosteal zone, which lacks vascularization, is restricted to the outer part of the bone and basically cell-free (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 and 4</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure"

'classical' niche within the BM, murine MKs can also be found in the spleen.</s><s>Platelet production has also been described within the capillary beds of the lungs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>However, after analyzing more than 230 MKs in total and more than 24 h of 2P-IVM video recordings we observed almost no MKs within the BM vasculature (0.87% of MKs).</s><s>Using LSFM, which allowed analysis of high sample numbers, MKs were rarely found within the vasculature (2.0 ± 1.6% of all MKs).</s><s>Thus, it appears unlikely that the translocation of BM-derived mature MKs into different organs would be a dominant phenomenon.</s></p><p><s>A vessel-biased MK distribution is critical to enable efficient proplatelet formation upon demand.</s><s>However, this MK distribution appears to be the consequence of the dense microvasculature and presumably perisinusoidal HSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, it appears likely that MK precursor cells reside in close proximity to the vasculature, allowing the rapid generation of new MKs upon platelet demand (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the vessel-biased distribution of MKs could be supported by MK polarization (e.g., via 'directed growth').</s><s>Polarization may be triggered by mechanical cues, such as adhesion to endothelial cells expressing vascular cell-adhesion molecule-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> or by environmental soluble factors such as SDF1 or sphingosine-1phosphate <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>With that in mind, MK positioning could affect platelet production rather than megakaryopoiesis.</s><s>However, we cannot rule out the possibility that two pools of MKs exist: one pool that resides directly at the vessel to readily produce platelets (e.g., on demand), whereas a second, largely quiescent pool of MKs or (potentially) megakaryocytic progenitor cells, resides more distant from the vasculature.</s><s>The hypothesis of two rather distinct MK pools is supported by our EdU-experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>This experiment allows to distinguish between two models: A 'serial tube' model where all mature MKs are used for platelet release before new precursors differentiate and take up EdU (first in-first out, all mature MKs would be EdU-positive) or a 'dual MK pool' model in which mature EdU-negative MKs are still present.</s><s>In fact, our results show a substantial fraction of MKs to be EdU-negative (even for an extended EdU-feeding period and increased platelet demand) so that the 'dual MK pool' model is the more likely one.</s><s>A similar concept has been proposed for HSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , which reside either directly at the blood vessels or at the endosteal niche <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> .</s><s>The combination of previous reports on MK-biased HSCs that regulate HSC activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and the finding that MK-secreted factors keep HSCs quiescent <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> raises the intriguing possibility that MKs regulate the MK-biased pool of HSCs.</s></p><p><s>These findings have immediate translational implications: On the one hand, the vessel-biased MK distribution indicates, that promoting megakaryopoiesis (e.g., by differentiation-promoting chemokines) might be sufficient to rapidly enhance platelet production, as MKs do not need to migrate towards the vasculature.</s><s>On the other hand, the existence of two MK pools (fast vs. more quiescent response) might explain why therapies to increase platelet counts are not fully effective.</s><s>We believe that further studies addressing exactly this concept might ultimately provide insights on how to activate the second quiescent MK pool to accelerate platelet production.</s></p></div>
