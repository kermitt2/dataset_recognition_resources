<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the joints, which results in their progressive destruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Recent studies suggest that B cells play an important role in the development and progression of RA through several mechanistic pathways, and the subsequent polyclonal activation of B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>By producing different inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies, they may directly drive pathologic inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, memory B cells have gained particular interest in evaluating response during therapies from biologics that have shown promising results in treatment of RA.</s><s>Different cytokines are involved in B cell differentiation, maintenance and survival.</s><s>They are distinctly implicated in each phase of the pathogenesis of RA-promoting autoimmunity, maintaining chronic inflammatory synovitis and driving the destruction of joint tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Biological agents targeting key proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) have been substantially advanced in the treatment of autoimmunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>IL-6 is a multifunctional pleiotropic cytokine acting as stimulator of both B and T cell functions.</s><s>It is produced by various cells of the innate immune system (for example macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, neutrophils), B cells, and to some extent by CD4 effector T helper (Th) cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>IL-6 also influences various cell types and has multiple biological activities through its unique receptor system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>It has been described as a late-acting B cell differentiation factor that is involved in in vitro differentiation of B cells into antibody-forming cells and germinal center reactions.</s><s>In addition to its involvement in immune responses, it also regulates hematopoiesis, the acute phase response and inflammation.</s><s>Dysregulation of IL-6 production and its pathological role in different autoimmune diseases have been well documented and highlight IL-6 and its signaling cascade as a potential target for autoimmune therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, tocilizumab (TCZ), a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the alpha chain of IL-6R, which prevents binding of IL-6 to membrane and soluble IL-6R, was developed and has been licensed for the treatment of RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>TCZ has shown convincing clinical efficacy by reduction of signs/symptoms and a marked inhibition of radiological progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Functionally distinct B cell subsets can be defined by the phenotype expression of CD27 and immunoglobulin D (IgD).</s><s>Human peripheral memory B cells are mainly discriminated from naïve B cells by the phenotypic expression of CD27 (a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family) and presence of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in their Ig variable genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>CD27 expression by B cells has been considered a hallmark for SHM and their memory.</s><s>CD27+ memory B cells are a heterogeneous population comprising of pre-switch (IgD + CD27+) and post-switch (IgD-CD27+) B cell subsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>There are still unanswered questions about the exact identification of memory B cells based on CD27 expression, since recent studies in these lines have shown a double-negative (DN) population (CD19 + CD27-IgD-) that bears all signatures of memory B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>A very large portion of DN (CD27-IgD-) B cells express mutated Ig and an evaluation of telomere length, expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl2, and absence of the ATP-binding cassette B1 transporter (ABCB1) have been used to discriminate them from naïve CD27-B cells and relate them to the memory B cell compartment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Even though DN memory B cells mainly express switched Ig isotypes, they have a reduced rate of SHM compared to post-switch B cells.</s><s>This has been hypothesized to be due to either an impaired germinal center (GC) formation or resembling a distinct lineage of memory B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), DN B cells are expanded and could be linked to autoimmunity by analysis of the specific autoantibodies including 9G4 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>So far, the nature of DN B cells has still not been fully delineated in general as well as in autoimmune diseases.</s></p><p><s>Our previous studies of memory B cell subsets during in vivo IL-6R inhibition indicated phenotypic and molecular changes in pre-and post-switch memory B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>In RA, DN B cells have not been thoroughly studied and there is scarce information in the literature.</s><s>Therefore, we initiated the current study to analyze the DN B cell compartment in RA in more detail by phenotypic and molecular analyses of the different isotypic DN B cell receptors, their immunoglobulin receptor (Ig-R) mutational pattern and their modulation by in vivo IL-6R and TNF-α inhibition.</s></p></div>
