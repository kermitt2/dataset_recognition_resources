findings are currently unclear.</s><s>The attenuation effect of fasting plasma glucose concentration on fetal growth may suggest the role of maternoplacental glucose transfer to meet fetal nutrient demand and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s><s>In showing that the association between the maternal night-fasting interval and fetal growth was partially influenced by fasting plasma glucose concentration, it is suggested that this association can be also effected by other mechanisms.</s><s>In animal models, chronodisruption during pregnancy can reduce placental melatonin secretion, which might in turn elevate oxidative stress amounts (9) and compromise placental nutrient transfer, thereby restricting fetal growth and altering fat deposition <ref type="bibr"

to such an environment would be to store energy and slow down metabolism, which would lead to increased adipose tissue accumulation by the fetus <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>To protect brain growth, peripheral insulin sensitivity is downregulated to get more glucose into the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>Such prioritization of nutrient allocation for

findings show that infant girls are more susceptible to the effects of the maternal night-fasting interval, which is in line with a study that used a rat model and showed that female offspring exposed

effects remains elusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, but could reflect interactions between the maternal circadian timing system, nutritional mechanisms, and factors associated with fetal development that are sexually dimorphic.</s></p><p><s>The present study has the advantage of a prospective design, with exposure assessed at a prenatal stage and most outcomes ascertained objectively.</s><s>An important strength of the study is the use of 3-d food diaries to assess usual dietary intake and the night-fasting interval, which helped to minimize recall bias.</s><s>A wide array of sociodemographic, health, and lifestyle factors that could confound associations was taken into account and controlled for in the analyses.</s><s>Given the paucity of existing data on prenatal fasting patterns and neonatal outcomes, our study provides useful, informative data on this relation.</s></p><p><s>However, we also recognized and considered the following limitations.</s><s>First, neonatal TBF was estimated by using a formuladerived equation; the formula, however, has been validated by infant body composition measurements with the use air displacement plethysmography <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Second, our study lacked measures of plasma insulin, glucocorticoids, and oxidative stress amounts, which would have been useful to mechanistically explain the associations of the maternal night-fasting interval with fetal growth and adiposity.</s><s>Third, dietary assessment was only collected at one time point in the late second trimester, which restricted our ability to evaluate the trimester-specific effect of the maternal night-fasting interval on fetal growth.</s><s>Similarly, maternal glucose concentrations were measured at one time point during pregnancy, so we were not able to assess the effect of glucose metabolism at different stages of pregnancy.</s><s>Fourth, the study was conducted in a Southeast Asian setting with a Singaporean mother-offspring cohort and, hence, generalization to other populations should be made with caution.</s><s>Lastly, despite our efforts to control for multiple covariates, the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured or poorly measured covariates remains.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, sex-dependent fetal growth and adiposity development in response to a fasting period were observed, such that infant girls born to mothers with a longer night-fasting interval in the late second trimester of pregnancy were found to have increased head circumferences and TBF percentages at birth.</s><s>Monitoring maternal nighttime fasting might be a new approach to potentially modify neonatal outcomes and future health.</s><s>However, more studies are needed to replicate these findings and to understand their biological mechanisms.</s><s>Also, randomized controlled trials and long-term studies are warranted to confirm whether a lengthened maternal night-fasting interval is beneficial or harmful to the offspring.</s><s>Because GUSTO is an ongoing prospective study, it will allow us to assess the longer-term consequences on child growth, development, and health.</s><s>Our finding thus supports an important line of research into the developmental programming effects of chrononutrition.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
