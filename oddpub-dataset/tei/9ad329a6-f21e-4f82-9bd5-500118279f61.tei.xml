<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dembowsky et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Taylor and Schramm, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Maiorov et al., 1997)</ref>, which originates distal from the lesion site and becomes disinhibited by the rostral SCI.</s><s>Episodes of SNA remain present until chronic SCI in humans, including subclinical episodes not meeting the criteria of autonomic dysreflexia, which develops subsequent to acute injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Wallin and Stjernberg, 1984)</ref>.</s><s>As intact immune function is essential to combat infections, a neurogenic, functionally relevant SCI-IDS may facilitate the development of infections.</s><s>Infections, in particular SCIassociated pneumonia (SCI-AP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) are the main cause of death in the acute phase after SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(DeVivo et al., 1989)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, they were also identified as a disease modifying factor imposing an independent risk factor for poor neurological outcome in patients after SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Failli et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>SCI-IDS is aggravated by a variety of non-SCI specific triggers.</s><s>First, polytrauma and iatrogenic surgical treatment lead to a post-aggression syndrome, followed by a 'systemic immune response syndrome' (SIRS) and 'compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome' (CARS), which are also able to increase incidence of infections even in the complete absence of any CNS injury.</s><s>Second, motor paralysis is likely to enhance bacterial contamination by propagating aspiration.</s><s>Third, leucocyte migration might be decreased due to a reduction in blood flow, which is caused by the immobility of bedridden patients after SCI.</s><s>However, the factors mentioned above cannot sufficiently explain the enhanced susceptibility to infection after SCI as (i) physiological aspiration during sleep does not cause pneumonia; and (ii) patients with isolated vertebrae fracture and/or polytrauma suffer infections less frequently despite sharing the hospital milieu enriched by multi-resistant bacteria.</s><s>Moreover, SCI patients are on average comparatively young patients with few comorbidities (e.g.</s><s>diabetes), who would be otherwise expected to mount a robust immune response.</s><s>Thus, in contrast to the current understanding, attributing enhanced infection susceptibility solely to the patient's environment and motor dysfunction only, a secondary functional SCI-IDS may account for the enhanced infection susceptibility.</s><s>This hypothesis is supported by the sequel of the SCI-IDS preceding the onset of infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berlly and Shem, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Riegger et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Riegger et al., , 2009))</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To quantify a direct functional neurogenic effect of SCI on infection susceptibility, we applied a controlled experimental model of SCI-AP.</s><s>We set out to analyse the hypothesis that SCI blunts the ability of the immune system to mount a functional immune response to a clinically relevant infectious challenge and whether this is dependent on the injury level after acute SCI.</s><s>Specifically, we investigated: (i) whether the lesion-level dependent, neurogenic component of SCI-IDS is sufficient to propagate infections; (ii) whether it is dependent on preganglionic or postganglionic injury; and (iii) how this neurogenic component relates to non-SCI specific factors that likewise contribute to immune suppression, such as post-aggression syndrome.</s><s>To validate the clinical relevance, we investigated whether the experimental observation of a lesion level dependent, enhanced susceptibility to develop SCI-AP was mirrored after human SCI.</s><s>In sum, we set out to characterize functional SCI-IDS as a direct consequence of SCI suppressing host defence and its underlying neurogenic mechanism mediated by sympathetic decentralization.</s></p></div>

Disinhibited spinally generated sympathetic nerve activity after high thoracic (Th3) SCI leads to ad hoc induction of excitatory SNA burst entering the splenic nerve<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dembowsky et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Taylor and Schramm, 1987)</ref> associated with increased levels of norepinephrine (NE) in the spleen, which in turn causes apoptosis of immune cells in the spleen<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lucin et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lucin et al., , 2009))</ref>.</s><s>This results in a decrease of spleen size and an elevated susceptibility to infection.</s><s>Blocking SNA signaling to the spleen ('shielding') by preceding peripheral denervation of the splenic nerve ameliorates functional SCI-IDS and bacterial load after Th3-SCI.</s><s>Moreover, here we identify the peripheral splenic nerve as a target for immunomodulation after SCI in order to restore impaired host defense after SCI (SCI-IDS) by blocking SNA to the spleen.</s><s>Spleen shielding may be an interventional strategy to ameliorate functional SCI-IDS to prevent infections in patients at risk.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="13,61.74,59.81,480.91,333.75" type="bitmap" /></figure>
