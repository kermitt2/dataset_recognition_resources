type="bibr" target="#b24">(UNICEF et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is associated with a mortality risk nine times higher than that of a non-malnourished child, and among children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), the risk of dying is more than twofold of that of the reference group <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Black et al. 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In 2007, the United Nations endorsed communitybased management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) as a treatment model for SAM, supporting its integration with other initiatives at primary health care level to reduce child mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(WHO et al. 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Core components of CMAM include early detection of SAM cases by screening in the community and treatment at home with ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF).</s><s>In emergency contexts with high levels of external input of resources and staff by non-governmental organizations, the model has performed well in achieving high coverage levels, high recovery rates, low case fatality rates and decreased opportunity costs for families <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Collins 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chaiken et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Collins et al. 2006a)</ref>.</s><s>Its application to nonemergency contexts has subsequently been encouraged to increase coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chaiken et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Collins 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Currently, CMAM is integrated into primary health care in an increasing number of countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia <ref type="bibr">(UNSCN and UNICEF 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SAM as a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) &lt;−3 of the growth standard median, or presence of bilateral pitting oedema, or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of &lt;115 mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(WHO and UNICEF 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The MUAC cut-off defining SAM has been raised from the initially recommended &lt;110 mm, although the latter is still applied in some settings.</s><s>The integration of management of acute malnutrition into existing primary health care systems often involves staff with limited medical training such as community health workers, implying a need for simplified protocol for admission and discharge procedures as well as for case management of malnutrition and childhood illnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chamois 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kopplow 2010)</ref>.</s><s>MUAC has been introduced as an independent and single admission criterion for non-oedematous SAM, partly in response to this need.</s><s>Recent research comparing performance of WHZ and MUAC supports this shift in methods, finding that MUAC identifies children at risk of dying within 6 months better than WHZ in 6-59-month-olds <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Briend et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The use of MUAC-based admission criteria also avoids the previous problem of having different tools for screening and admission <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Collins et al. 2006b)</ref>.</s><s>Further, MUAC assessment can quickly be carried out by one person with limited training <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Myatt et al. 2006)</ref> and is less prone to measurement error than WHZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mwangome et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>As use of MUAC also has additional advantages in terms of cost and maintenance, it is increasingly used when CMAM programmes are implemented and scaled up.</s></p><p><s>Combining MUAC admission criteria with WHZbased discharge criteria is somewhat problematic, as some children may fulfil a WHZ discharge criterion already at the time of being admitted by MUAC or soon thereafter <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Myatt et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>To solve this problem, and to have the full benefit of using MUAC in CMAM, e.g.</s><s>no need to assess height, there is a need for other discharge criteria than those based on WHZ.</s><s>A set target of 15% weight gain from admission weight is currently recommended as discharge criteria for programmes relying on MUAC for admission <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(WHO and UNICEF 2009)</ref> and is applied in commonly utilised CMAM training manuals <ref type="bibr">(FANTA 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">GNC 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Use of this 15% weight gain cut-off has projected about 50% of beneficiaries recovering from SAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Myatt et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>While the recommendation was set to 15%, it was also advised that a 20% weight gain might be required for sufficient recovery depending on the context <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(WHO and UNICEF 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For similar reasons as in SAM management, the use of MUAC is also increasing in Supplementary Feeding Programmes aiming to manage the less severe form of wasting; non-oedematous MAM.</s><s>The current definition of MAM is WHZ ≥ −3 and &lt;−2 (WHO 2006) but increasingly, admission of MAM children is based on MUAC applying different cutoffs, often combined with WHZ criteria in a two-stage screening and admission process (Federal Ministry of Health, Ethiopia and UNICEF 2004; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bahwere et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>The data used for this analysis were taken from a larger project; 'Effectiveness of community based management of severe acute child malnutrition: Importance of maternal care and health system context (COMSAM)', aiming to evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated CMAM programme in four adjacent districts in southern Ethiopia.</s></p><p><s>From July to December 2011, weekly visits were conducted at 94 health posts providing CMAM in these districts known as prone to food insecurity.</s><s>Health post registration books were used to identify children admitted to the outpatient treatment programme (OTP).</s><s>A household visit was made within 7 days of registration to all listed children by trained research teams.</s><s>At the household, anthropometric measurements including height, weight and MUAC of the listed child were taken using the recommended anthropometric procedures <ref type="bibr">(GNC 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The household visits were used to collect information on other characteristics of the child, such as age (by use of a local calendar), presence of oedema and pallor, as well as characteristics of the main caretaker and household including socio-economic factors.</s><s>Double entry was applied when entering data into the database.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropometry and prediction of nutritional status after weight gain</head><p><s>Standard instruments were used for anthropometrical assessment; MUAC was measured by the colourbranded plastic tapes with 1-mm increments used by the programme; weight was assessed using Uniscale (precision of 100 g, provided by UNICEF); and height/length was assessed by locally constructed wooden boards, also used in national surveys.</s><s>Children under the age of 24 months were measured lying down and older children in standing position.</s><s>The children's age, weight and length/height were used to calculate the anthropometric indices of weight-forheight, height-for-age and weight-for-age using the WHO Anthro software (WHO 2010).</s><s>Additional weight variables were created by multiplying the child's admission weight by 1.10, 1.15 and 1.20 to mimic weight gains at discharges of 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively.</s><s>These simulated discharge weights were converted to WHZ by WHO Anthro software using admission height/length and disregarding any potential changes in age and height.</s><s>In this way, nutritional status by WHZ was established at the three weight gain targets.</s><s>Nutritional recovery was defined as WHZ ≥ −2.</s></p></div>

(2013)</ref> would be to use MUAC for discharge.</s><s>The latter study found that discharge by MUAC leads to longer stays in the programme for the most malnourished children, eliminating the unfavourable effects seen with percent weight gain as discharge criterion.</s></p><p><s>Management of SAM ultimately aims at reducing morbidity mortality by resolving acute malnutrition and its complications <ref type="bibr">(GNC 2011)</ref>.</s><s>This study, by its theoretical approach, is limited to the extent that it does not include any aspect of evaluating the effects on morbidity/mortality, but assumes that increased WHZ equals reduced risk.</s><s>WHZ does not constitute a gold standard for evaluating nutritional status or recovery.</s><s>This can be exemplified by the recent findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Briend et al. (2012)</ref>, showing MUAC to be a better predictor of mortality than WHZ when used as admission criterion.</s><s>WHZ is, however, widely used in programming for MAM and SAM and a feasible tool for evaluating effects of discharge protocol in our setting.</s></p><p><s>It should also be noted that our results only represent a best-case scenario for anthropometric recovery by treatment of acute malnutrition, assuming 100% of treated children reach the desired target weight.</s><s>Under real conditions, the programmatic and population context will modify to what extent the children will recover.</s><s>Often much less is achieved, as interrupted supply of RUTF, defaulting and non-response to treatment are undesirable but uncommon outcomes.</s></p><p><s>A limitation of our study lies in the relatively high number of children excluded from analysis due to implausible HAZ.</s><s>This may in part be due to an intended or unintended tendency by parents to adjust date of birth in order to have children younger than 6 months, who would normally not qualify, admitted into the programme.</s><s>We also aimed at providing a more conservative estimate of remaining wasting and did not include potential height increase during treatment in our predictions.</s><s>Assuming no height development is likely to have slightly overestimated WHZ at targeted discharge and conversely underestimated the proportion of remaining wasting.</s><s>Of further importance for the interpretation of our results is that children with oedema, who are among the most affected by SAM, are not represented.</s><s>These cases were dropped from the analysis, as data on lowest weight during treatment were not available for oedematous children.</s><s>These factors represent a further limitation, as some of the more vulnerable children may have been lost from analyses, possibly reducing the number of children remaining malnourished after treatment.</s><s>Strength may be seen in the high quality of anthropometric measurements achieved by using specially trained study teams.</s><s>The overall coverage of SAM cases was probably high and the number of missed SAM cases was low as the distribution of RUTF constituted a strong pull factor, and health posts providing OTP are evenly distributed throughout the community.</s><s>Thus, the sample of MUAC-SAM children identified is likely to be representative of the area.</s><s>However, the sample of cases of MUAC-MAM may be less representative of MAM in the population as these cases were not the target group for provision of RUTF and it can be expected that some of these children were not brought for screening.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>The present study applied different percentages of weight gain as discharge criterion to predict children's nutritional recovery in a CMAM programme that uses MUAC for screening and admission.</s><s>Findings showed that 15% of weight gain, being the most commonly recommended target, was inadequate for some of the most vulnerable children to sufficiently recover.</s><s>Consequently, using percent weight gain as single discharge criterion poses risk of not being equitable as it is not proportional to the nutritional need and may lead to insufficient recovery among those with most severe condition.There is a need for further research to determine suitable discharge criteria in CMAM programmes using MUAC for screening and admission.</s></p></div>
