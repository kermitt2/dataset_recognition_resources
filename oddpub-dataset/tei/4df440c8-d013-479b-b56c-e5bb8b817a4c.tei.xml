<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is regularly accompanied by psychiatric symptoms such as depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Feinstein et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>With a lifetime risk of up to 50% and a point prevalence of up to 25%, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a frequent comorbidity of MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Patten et al. 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Multiple sclerosis-associated depression has a substantial negative impact on patients' quality of life, cognition, and psychosocial functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hakim et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sa 2008</ref>).</s><s>Higher levels of depressive symptoms are also linked to poorer treatment compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ivanova et al. 2012)</ref>, and thus can affect long-term health outcomes.</s><s>If left untreated, depressive symptoms in MS may worsen over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ensari et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Despite the high clinical relevance of depression in MS, it remains frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated.</s></p><p><s>The diagnostic criteria for MDD include a number of somatic and vegetative symptoms that overlap with typical symptoms of MS (e.g., fatigue, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration), which can make accurate MDD diagnosis particularly difficult in this patient population.</s><s>Therefore, valid and reliable, easy-to-use diagnostic tools taking into account the potential confounding of MS symptoms are needed.</s><s>Adjustment of cutoff scores may be required to prevent false diagnoses due to somaticsymptom-related score inflation.</s><s>This is particularly important in patients who might be at risk for a comorbid mood disorder, for example, patients with elevated self-reported depressive symptoms.</s></p><p><s>A wide range of self-rated questionnaires are available for quantification of depression.</s><s>Some of these have been validated and used in MS patients (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Avasarala et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benedict et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Moran and Mohr 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mohr et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Honarmand and Feinstein 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Quaranta et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Guidelines published by the American Academy of Neurology recommended only the BDI as well as a two-question tool to screen for depressive disorders with a weak level of evidence and did not find sufficient evidence for other instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Minden et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, only a few studies to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sullivan et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pandya et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Honarmand and Feinstein 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Quaranta et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Patten et al. 2015)</ref> have used a structured clinical interview to establish MDD diagnosis, and only the most recent ones also included Receiver-Operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, the gold standard to verify diagnostic accuracy.</s><s>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) showed good diagnostic accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Honarmand and Feinstein 2009)</ref>, however, it only covers some of the diagnostic criteria of MDD.</s><s>Moreover, it is copyrighted and may not be easily available, particularly for clinics or research groups in developing countries.</s><s>A clinician-based, MS-specific depression scale (MSDRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Quaranta et al. 2012</ref>)) also achieved good accuracy overall, however, it has relatively poor sensitivity (38%) and so far has only been used in Italian patients.</s><s>Finally, a very recent paper demonstrated good accuracy of the patient health questionnaire PHQ-9, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression rating scale (CES-D), and the HADS in MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Patten et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, there is still paucity of data directly comparing different selfreport questionnaires head-to-head and against structured interviews.</s><s>No study to date has addressed this question in German-speaking MS patients.</s></p><p><s>The 30-item self-rated Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR 30 ) was developed as part of the STAR*D trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rush et al. 1996)</ref> and has been validated for several patient populations with physical illness so far but not for MS.</s><s>In contrast to most self-rated questionnaires for depression such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or the HADS, it assesses all symptom domains for MDD as designated in the DSM-IV and is available both in patient self-rating as well as clinicianbased rating form.</s><s>Moreover, it has been validated in more than 30 languages and is freely available (http:// www.ids-qids.org/)</s><s>without licensing charges.</s><s>It also offers a self-rated validated 16-item short version (QIDS-SR) and subscales providing separate scores for cognitive and somatic symptoms that have been derived <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Duivis et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>It might therefore be a promising tool to screen for and quantify depressive symptomatology in MS.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims of the Study</head><p><s>Here, we compare diagnostic accuracy of the BDI, the IDS, its subscales, and its short form (QIDS) in a group of German MS patients who reported elevated depressive symptoms.</s><s>This sample might therefore model a clinical situation where detection of MDD is particularly important.</s><s>We aim to establish meaningful threshold values based on a structured clinical interview.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>MS patients (n = 31) were recruited via the MS clinic of the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf using our patient database and written consent prior to inclusion in the study was obtained.</s><s>We contacted patients by mail if the scores from their last clinical visit recorded in the database indicated elevated depressive symptoms as measured by the Mood subscale of the Hamburg Quality of Life Questionnaire for MS (HAQUAMS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gold et al. 2001)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diagnosis of major depression</head><p><s>Patients underwent structured diagnostic interviews by trained raters (A.F., S.L.) (The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, M.I.N.I.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackenheil et al. 1999</ref>).</s><s>Several approaches have been proposed to implement DSM-IV diagnostic criteria in patients with physical illnesses: "aetiological" (case-by-case exclusion of somatic symptoms judged likely to be due to the comorbid medical illness), "inclusive" (use all symptoms regardless of etiology), and "substitutive" (substitution of most or all somatic symptoms with additional cognitive or affective symptoms).</s><s>For the current study, we used the inclusive approach, that is, MDD diagnosis was made if a patient met at least five of the nine criteria which must include "depressed mood" or "loss of interest/anhedonia."</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-report measures of depression</head><p><s>All patients completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hautzinger et al. 1995)</ref> and the IDS-SR 30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Trivedi et al. 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Subscore calculation of the IDS-SR 30 included a somatic and a cognitive subscale as published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Duivis et al. (2013)</ref>.</s><s>The cognitive scale contains 10 IDS-SR 30 items, one for each of the following symptoms domains: Feeling sad or irritable, the quality of mood, concentration/decision making, self-perception, suicidal ideation, general interest, as well as capacity for pleasure excluding and including sexuality.</s><s>The somatic subscale includes items on sleep, appetite, weight, energy level, psychomotor retardation/restlessness, and leaden paralysis/physical energy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p><s>Major depressive disorder diagnosis was established based on the M.I.N.I. (criterion).</s><s>Receiver-Operating characteristics curves were created using MatLab and MedCalc software, giving an overview of sensitivity and specificity combinations for possible thresholds in each questionnaire.</s><s>Error estimates and confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping using 1000 replications.</s><s>Using MedCalc, the BDI, IDS-SR 30 total and somatic and cognitive subscore ROC curves were compared statistically using the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">DeLong et al. (1988)</ref> for the calculation of the Standard Error of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and of the difference between two AUCs .</s><s>This algorithm is particularly useful because it adjusts the AUCs for the expected frequency of the condition (MDD in this case) in the population of interest (in this case MS).</s><s>Based on available epidemiological research <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Patten et al. 2003)</ref>, we estimated the MDD point prevalence in the MS population at 25%.</s><s>AUC values were interpreted according to the following guidelines: 0.9-1 excellent, 0.8-0.9</s><s>good, 0.7-0.8</s><s>fair, 0.6-0.7 poor.</s></p><p><s>Cutoff values were established with the (0, 1) minimum distance method giving equal weight to sensitivity and specificity.</s><s>Distributions of the thresholds as well as the falsepositive and false-negative rates were determined to estimate uncertainty and control for the small sample size.</s><s>Finally, BDI and IDS-SR 30 scores were correlated using Pearson correlation coefficients.</s><s>All values are given as mean AE SEM.</s><s>P-values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</s></p></div>

it does however increase the administrative burden and may waste resources in particular settings such as primary care.</s><s>For maximum sensitivity, specificity, and cost-effectiveness, the two-question approach proposed by David Mohr and colleagues might be the ideal choice.</s><s>However, it does not yield a quantitative score of depression severity, which may be necessary in a research setting or to monitor treatment response in clinical care.</s><s>The HADS provides a middle ground of a comparatively short scale offering both good accuracy for MDD diagnosis as well as a quantitative score.</s><s>Generally, the HADS is a good measure for symptom severity in somatic, psychiatric, primary care patients and in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bjelland et al. 2002)</ref> and is therefore widely used.</s><s>However, more recent work has revealed that it lacks consistent differentiation between symptoms of anxiety and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cosco et al. 2012)</ref> and it does not cover all symptom domains of MDD.</s></p><p><s>The IDS-SR 30, validated for the first time in MS patients in the current report, in our opinion has a number of features that make it a good option for measuring depression in MS: (1) it covers all DSM-IV criteria (and only those) (2) it offers parallel patient-and clinicianrated versions; (3) it was translated in many languages and is increasingly used; and (4) subscales for cognitive and somatic symptoms can be constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Duivis et al. 2013)</ref> as we have done in our present analysis and an algorithm for identification of DSM-assigned melancholic depression based on the items of the IDS-SR 30 is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Khan et al. 2006</ref>).</s><s>This might be particularly relevant for use in studies to explore novel biological substrates of depression in MS as these were found to differ between data-driven designations of melancholic and atypical idiopathic depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lamers et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Similar dissociations between biological correlates and clinical features might also exist in MS-associated depression, as our previous research has indicated that affective and cognitive symptoms of depression in MS might be more closely related to neuroendocrine-limbic abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gold et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gold et al. , 2014) )</ref> while vegetative/somatic aspects show closer correlations with markers of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gold et al. 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>First applications in an RCT for a behavioral intervention (exercise) in MS also suggest that the IDS-SR 30 may be responsive to detect changes in depressive symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Briken et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Sensitivity to change remains an important issue for depression questionnaires in MS that have not systematically been addressed.</s><s>Some limitations have to be considered when interpreting the results from our present study.</s><s>First of all, the sample size was small and all our patients were contacted because they had previously shown elevated depressive symptoms, that is, the sample was preselected for elevated levels of depression.</s><s>On one hand, this sample might be a good model for clinical situations where accurate diagnosis is particularly important.</s><s>On the other hand, in larger samples including many patients with very low or no depressive symptoms, diagnostic accuracy of IDS-SR 30 and BDI may be higher than reported here.</s></p><p><s>Despite finding the IDS-SR 30 somatic subscale to show only fair accuracy, the total IDS score was not found to perform significantly worse than the IDS-SR 30 cognitive subscale.</s><s>This indicates that, while removal of somatic symptoms may be preferable, we found no evidence to suggest that it is strictly necessary for somatic symptoms to be removed from the IDS for diagnostic accuracy in MS.</s><s>Future studies performed with a larger sample size will provide accurate/reliable estimates of the cutoff values.</s><s>However, the specific values of the threshold estimates are not the most important results arising from this study.</s><s>A far more meaningful and important result is the ability to provide estimates of the false-positive/negative rates for the various scores, given a particular score threshold.</s><s>For example, we estimate the false-positive (negative) rate for IDS-SR 30 _total as 19.9 AE 7.3% (23.0 AE 12.0%), noting that the provision of error estimates implicitly accounts for the small sample size.</s><s>Pragmatically, these results are perhaps the most important results in the article, as they provide an estimate of the error rates that would be expected, should the particular cutoff value (in this case, 28) be used as the decisionmaking criterion.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the present study does not address the ability of the BDI or the IDS-SR 30 for differential diagnosis of MDD versus other affective disorders.</s><s>In our sample, two patients with high scores on the BDI and IDS-SR 30 were found who did not meet diagnostic criteria for MDD according to the M.I.N.I.</s><s>When looking at the M.I.N.I. data of these individuals, we observed that both met diagnostic criteria of dysthymia.</s><s>This means that while the questionnaires have readily identified a mood disorder, they do not seem to be a means of distinguishing between MDD and dysthymia.</s><s>This illustrates that distinction between different affective disorders may therefore be a particular challenge in MS that requires clinical interviews and cannot be achieved with general self-report questionnaires for depression.</s><s>In conclusion, both the IDS-SR 30 and the BDI are valid measures to quantify depressive symptoms and show good diagnostic accuracy.</s><s>The IDS-SR 30 cognitive subscale may be useful as a screening tool and to quantify affective/cognitive depressive symptomatology.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>ª</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>2015 The Authors.</s><s>Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
