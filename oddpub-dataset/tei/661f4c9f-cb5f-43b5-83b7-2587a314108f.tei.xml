epithelial cells need to release TH through transmembrane translocation into the blood circulation, and keeping in mind that thyrocytes are TH target cells themselves, a regulatory mechanism must exist that determines how much of the T 4 liberated from Tg is either retained in the thyrocytes or transported back into the same.</s><s>We propose that intra-thyroidal TH transporters like the monocarboxylate transporter molecules Mct8 and Mct10 may act as such sensors of (i) the extent of proteolytic TH liberation, (ii) the amounts of TH released from thyroid follicles, and (iii) the

to diminished T 4 export from thyroid follicles <ref type="bibr">(Trajkovic-Arsic et al., 2010a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Di Cosmo et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, intra-thyroidal
