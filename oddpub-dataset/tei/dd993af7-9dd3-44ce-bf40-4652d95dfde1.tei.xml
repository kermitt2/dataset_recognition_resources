that TIMP-1 inhibits excessive degradation of the ECM by MMP-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and therefore might be found to be strongly increased after rupture.</s><s>TIMP-2, -3, and -4 were found in decreased amounts in rotator cuff ruptures compared to healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>The absent or negative regulations of TIMP-2, -3, and -4 in the present study indicate their secondary role in the early human tendon healing process.</s></p><p><s>It has been previously shown that the age and degenerative status of Supraspinatus tendons is related to an increased expression and secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-13, as well as TIMP-1, -2, and -3 in tenocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Also, other authors have found a relationship between altered expression of MMPs and TIMPs and chronic tendon pathologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref

target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The increase/decrease of MMPs and TIMPs, as seen in chronic tendon pathologies, might indicate that with increasing time after rupture the tendon tissue at the rupture site is moving in a degenerative direction.</s><s>This could also be confirmed by the histological analysis, showing a more abnormal tendon in the later time-point group.</s><s>Whether these alterations are taking place due to the normal tendon healing process, or if these changes also have a negative impact on the tendon healing outcome, cannot be clarified within the present study.</s><s>However, a relationship between MMPs and the healing outcome after Rotator Cuff reconstruction has already been proven in a clinical study where the increase of MMP-1 and MMP-9 expression at the time of surgery correlated with failed healing more than 6 months after surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Agres et al. demonstrated altered tendon properties with a higher tendon stiffness and elongation compared to an intra-patient control two to six years after Achilles tendon reconstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>The reason for these sustained tendon alterations is unclear, but might be due to an ineffective remodeling process possibly triggered by MMP/TIMP regulation.</s><s>A recent study found no effect of early surgical intervention after Achilles tendon rupture (≤24 h, 24-48 h, ≥48 h-1 week) in respect to muscle strength and several outcome scores one year after surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>With the strongest MMP/TIMP imbalance observed in the group operated on 7-10 days after rupture, it would indicate that 7 days might be the critical border for clinical intervention.</s></p><p><s>Detailed information about the time-dependent alterations of MMPs and TIMPs in human tendon healing is not available.</s><s>Presently, an increased expression of MMP-13, MMP-2 (confirmed by correlation analysis), and MMP-9 as well as COL1A1 and COL3A1 (correlation analysis) was found over time after rupture, whereas MMP-3 and MMP-10 and TIMP-1 (correlation analysis) decreased.</s><s>Interestingly, the TIMPs showed no significant alterations over time by group comparisons.</s><s>Comparable results were described previously after ACL transection in minipigs, where MMP-13 as well as COL1A3 and COL3A1 increased over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In rat and mouse healing models, MMP-9 and MMP-13 participated in the early phase of tissue degradation and expression decreased afterwards, whereas MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression remained high until the later remodeling process <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>The participation of all mentioned MMPs in the healing process could be confirmed by the present results.</s><s>However, the continuous high expression of MMP-3 is in contrast to the present findings of a decreased expression at the later time-point group.</s><s>However, in the present study, MMP and TIMP expression was only analyzed until day 10 post rupture.</s><s>Therefore, a comparison to the later remodeling phases was not possible.</s><s>It is unclear if MMP-3 plays a positive or negative role in the tendon healing process.</s><s>Based on its known function in activating other MMPs, it has been suggested that a decreased expression of MMP-3 leads to an incorrect remodeling process <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In an immunohistological study on rabbit Supraspinatus tendons, MMP-2 and TIMP-1 were found 7 and 14 days after rupture and decreased afterwards.</s><s>In contrast, TIMP-2 was constitutively expressed during the whole healing period <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, which is comparable to the present findings.</s><s>Animal studies showed that COL3A1 expression is mainly induced in early tendon healing, which leads to tendon scar formation, whereas an increase in COL1A1 seems to play a minor role <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>However, this is in contrast to the present results of a similar increasing expression pattern of COL1A1 and COL3A1 and no change in COL1A1 to COL3A1 ratio over time.</s><s>The upregulation of COL1A1 might be a result of the increased MMP activity to overcome the excessive collagen degradation.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, all MMPs as well as TIMP-1 and -3 were regulated between intact and ruptured tendon samples and/or over time, which indicates their active contribution in the early human tendon healing process.</s><s>When looking at the alterations found over time, the increased expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 together with the decrease of the more regulatory MMP-3 and -10 and the simultaneous lack of regulation of TIMP expression over time might lead to a highly imbalanced MMP/TIMP ratio in vivo.</s><s>This in turn might result in an incorrect remodeling process.</s><s>Even if this is currently very speculative, the composition of MMPs/TIMPs in the ruptured tendon might some day be used as biomarker for the healing outcome.</s><s>However, this requires further evaluation and a correlation to the healing outcome, which was not possible within the present study.</s><s>Today, MMPs are already discussed as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis in various cancer types <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, but there are a several limitations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The limitations of the present study are as follows.</s><s>The first is the low number of intact tendons from patients, which were used as control for RNA analysis.</s><s>This is caused by the limited availability of intact tendon samples due to the strict ethical regulations.</s><s>However, the focus of the present study was to evaluate acute ruptured Achilles tendons at different time-points post rupture, and distinct differences to the intact samples could be demonstrated.</s><s>In addition, the MMP proteins were localized by immunohistochemistry in the tendon tissue sections in a descriptive manner.</s><s>Due to limited sample material, a quantification of the protein and the validation of the MMP activity were not possible.</s><s>However, it was previously shown that the mRNA and protein levels of MMPs correlate well <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>The last limitation to mention is the limited time frame of 2 to 10 days.</s><s>It would be interesting to also look at later time-points to gain more information regarding the remodeling process in which the MMPs might also play a crucial rule.</s></p></div>
