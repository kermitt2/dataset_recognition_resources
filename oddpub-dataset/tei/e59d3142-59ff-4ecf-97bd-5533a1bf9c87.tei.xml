of cancer cells when introduced to various collagen density.</s><s>We speculate that these same pathways are being activated in the TNBCs and are stimulated passively through focal adhesion-mediated interactions with the ECM.</s></p><p><s>When cells grown on glass substrates were treated with Y-27632 or blebbistatin, we inhibited their ability to undergo contraction through myosin-II and caused focal adhesion detachment from the substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref> .</s><s>This, in turn, showed shifts in metabolic indexes from GLY to OXPHOS in MDA-MB231 and MCF10A cells.</s><s>This confirms that it is through actin-mediated cell contractility that modulated these shifts in metabolism.</s><s>Interestingly, the MDA-MB231 cells treated with Y-27632 had a similar NADH free: bound ratio as those grown on 3.0 mg/mL, which could mean that their degrees of contractility were similar to each the respective conditions.</s><s>Those treated with blebbistatin had a much larger shift towards OXPHOS, surpassing the population of bound NADH of cells grown on 1.2 mg/mL collagen.</s><s>Since blebbistatin directly affects myosin-II and is more potent than Y-27632, this was as expected.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that stable adhesions have a developed mechanosensing network of actin, and these adhesions can grow in response to forces or increasing substrates stiffness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref> .</s><s>Thus, cells on the denser substrates should have the most stable adhesions.</s><s>In turn, they would also have increased FAK which promotes glucose consumption and plays a key role in the OXPHOS and GLY balance within cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The human melanoma cell lines, A375MM, in this study attached to 1.2 mg/mL and 3.0 mg/mL collagen substrates but did not spread as well as all other cells.</s><s>This was an indication that their adhesions are not stable or favorable on these substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> and their mechanosensing ability could have been compromised and reduce mitochondria activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, this would fail to change the metabolic indexes of these cells as shown in our results; where the NADH free: bound of A375MM on 1.2 mg/mL or 3.0 mg/mL have no difference.</s><s>This phenotype showed that there is a confirmed link between focal adhesion-mediated mechanosensing and cellular metabolism.</s></p><p><s>Glioblastoma cells, U251MG also showed no change in the the population of bound NADH as collagen density decreased.</s><s>It is important to note that there are many other possible uses for pyruvate aside from OXPHOS in the mitochondria.</s><s>Downstream of GLY are intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, such as citrate, which allows for the synthesis of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids, a demand for highly proliferating cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60</ref> .</s><s>There is also fatty acid synthesis through citrate which is shown to correlate with the formation of invadopodia, which are actin-rich protrusions used for matrix invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> .</s><s>In addition, the pentose phosphate pathway could further increase the GLY and fraction of free NADH.</s><s>All of the pathways mentioned could be elevated within MDA-MB231 cells, which could contribute to their difference in metabolic trends from the U251MG cells when collagen density is varied.</s></p><p><s>There is still the question of whether or not the shifts in metabolic signatures are unique to TNBCs.</s><s>Based on the results reported here, this seems to be the case.</s><s>Since we are changing the concentration of collagen to tune the density of the substrates, the density of ligands for integrin binding also varies.</s><s>At the same time, an increase of substrate stiffness has been shown to upregulate FA signaling as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62</ref> .</s><s>Thus, it is possible that the increase of integrin expression itself is the primary cause of the metabolism shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> .</s><s>Within in vivo systems, an increase in collagen density results in a stiffer ECM, which our system aimed to represent.</s></p><p><s>The TNBCs have a significant decrease in the fraction of bound NADH when plated on glass, 3.0 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL collagen, respectively.</s><s>Although the percent of bound NADH of MDA-MB-468 cells on both collagen substrates increased compared to glass, there is no significant difference of bound NADH between the two collagen substrates.</s><s>This variation from the MDA-MB-231 cell line could be due to the cell's phenotype.</s><s>MDA-MB-468 cells are much rounder than the MDA-MB-231 cells in every condition.</s><s>This roundness likely indicates a decreased adherence to the substrate, and thus, when plated on the two much less dense collagen substrates, may have reached a plateau in its adhesion.</s><s>This lack of change in adherence may be the cause of the non-significant changes in the free:bound ratio between the two collagen substrate conditions, however additional work is required to confirm this hypothesis.</s><s>MCF7 and T-47D cells were shown to have similar trends of their average bound NADH when comparing them side-by-side.</s><s>These two cell lines are similar in their genotype of ER+ , PR+ , and HER2-.</s><s>Expression levels of ER+ , PR+ , HER2-are known to play an important role in cellular metabolism, thus these results are not surprising <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We confirmed that the changes in the metabolic trajectory of the MDA-MB231 cells were reflective in cellular metabolism using the OXPHOS and GLY inhibitors.</s><s>When these inhibitors were added, cells shifted their metabolism accordingly to their inhibitors but there were no significant metabolic differences across collagen densities within these changes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S5a</ref>).</s><s>However, the MCF10A cell lines did not show any changes in metabolic indexes across substrate densities in their untreated conditions.</s><s>They did show substrate sensitivity only when OXPHOS was inhibited.</s><s>When R&amp;A was added to inhibit OXPHOS in MCF10A cells on the 3.0 mg/ mL and glass substrates, there was a maximum decrease to around 63.8% of the population of bound NADH; however, those on 1.2 mg/mL collagen showed no significant change (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S5b</ref>).</s><s>This could mean that on denser collagen substrates, these cells were more susceptible to metabolic changes when introduced to inhibitors.</s><s>Additionally, this could also indicate that the metabolism of the MCF10A cells was behaving more like the MDA-MB231 cells on the denser matrices.</s><s>When 2DG&amp;DCA was added to inhibit GLY in MCF10A cells, we see an increase in the population of bound NADH to around 71.8% when grown on 1.2 mg/mL collagen substrate.</s><s>Since OXPHOS and an environment with less collagen is preferable for the MCF10A cells, this could mean that this ECM provides an extra boost towards OXPHOS pathway when GLY is inhibited.</s></p><p><s>The phasor approach to FLIM of NADH allows isolation of the metabolic signature within sub-cellular compartments of the cells.</s><s>Here, we focused on comparing the nuclei and cytoplasm of MDA-MB231, MCF10A, A375MM, and U251MG cell lines (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>We were able to see that the metabolic shifts within the nuclei and cytoplasm of MDA-MB231 and MCF10A cells are similar to their whole cell signature.</s><s>However, within A375MM cells we were able to make distinctions of the population of bound NADH between surfaces, which were not detected when averaging over the entire cell.</s><s>The nuclei of A375MM cells on 3.0 mg/mL collagen substrates has a significant decrease in the population of bound NADH with respect to those on glass.</s><s>Thus, looking at the nuclear metabolic indexes can separate subtle changes that are hidden in whole cell readings.</s><s>These distinctions seen could be due to nuclear processes, such as transcription or DNA repair, which has also been shown to affect the ratio of bound and free NADH <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We have shown that focal adhesion-mediated contractility modulates cell metabolism in MDA-MB231 cancer cells.</s><s>With the use of FLIM of NADH, we were able to non-invasively measure metabolic changes of cancer cell lines MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, T-47D, MCF7, A375M, U251MG and within non-tumorigenic lines MCF10A, and NIH3T3.</s><s>Particularly in triple-negative breast cancer lines, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468, we saw that less dense collagen substrates shifted cells to have a more OXPHOS metabolic signature due to their increased population of bound NADH.</s><s>Further studies by inhibiting myosin-II contractility increased the population of bound NADH in MDA-MB231 cells across all surfaces and confirmed our hypothesis.</s><s>This further supports that ECM mediated adhesions are upregulated due to substrate density and modulates metabolic signatures.</s><s>We also confirmed that the changes in NADH free:bound in MDA-MB231 and MCF10A cells were due to GLY or OXPHOS by inhibiting these pathways with dichloroacetate and 2-deoxyglucose or rotenone and antimycin A, respectively.</s><s>With our results combined with what is known in literature, there is a relationship between the mechanosensing and metabolism pathway in cancer cells and both play a critical role in regulating cancer invasiveness.</s><s>This provides insight to develop therapies which target mechanosensing abilities of cancer cells to revert their metabolism similar to a more non-tumorigenic cell type or decrease their invasiveness.</s></p></div>
