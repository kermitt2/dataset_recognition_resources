<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>This was a cross-sectional study of herders and their cattle conducted between December 2015 and May 2016 in the Greater Bahr el Ghazal region.</s><s>We collected quantitative data and metadata (socio-demographic data and animal attributes) using a structured questionnaire.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study setting</head><p><s>Greater Bahr el Ghazal region is situated in the Northwestern part of South Sudan.</s><s>The region consists of ten states, Aweil, Aweil East, Gogrial, Lol, Tonj, Twic, Wau, Gok, Eastern Lakes, and Western Lakes.</s><s>The region consists of vast land with iron plateau and swamps feeding 12 million heads of cattle which represents 50% of the National herd <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s><s>It is predominantly inhabited by the Dinka ethnic group, who are cattle herders; other ethnic groups like Balanda and Kerash mostly practice agro-pastoralism <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>This mixture of land use allows for complex human-animal interactions usually compounded by the high population density <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>It is these complex dynamics that our study was aiming to unravel with respect to brucellosis.</s><s>A map of our study area is shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>The study population consisted of cattle and herders from cattle camps in Bahr el Ghazal region.</s><s>The cattle belonged to herders in the areas of Aweil, Gogrial, Tonj, and Wau states.</s><s>Majority of cattle is owned by pastoralists who migrate throughout the dry season looking for pastures in small groups of families or in large groups of villages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In effect, the herds in each grouping can be owned by more than one family, but usually it is a herd per family.</s><s>The herdsmen who tend to the animals are usually relatives of the owners, but in rare circumstances, families can employ herdsmen to manage their cattle herds.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size</head><p><s>The sample size for cattle was estimated using a bovine brucellosis prevalence (6.5%) previously reported in Greater Bahr el Ghazal <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>We assumed a brucellosis test sensitivity and specificity of 85%, and 90% respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, and a precision 0.05 with 95% confidence intervals.</s><s>We would then be expected to sample 346 cattle, however, 893 samples were collected using a systematic random sampling procedure, which allowed us to improve the precision of the sero-prevalence estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since herds are owned and maintained in cattle camps, large numbers of cattle tend to be clustered in fewer cattle camps.</s><s>In this regard, we conveniently screened 87 herders from 37 cattle camps in two of the four states (Tonj and Aweil).</s><s>Note that the screening was done with consent from the herders, as described in the ethical consideration section.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sampling procedure</head><p><s>The four states where the study was conducted were purposively selected basing on the safety of the area at the time of the study.</s><s>Between one and three cattle camps were selected per state, for each cattle camp; lists of herders with their respective herds were obtained from the veterinary office.</s><s>Usually, a camp contained up to 100 herds each with on average 150 animals.</s><s>We randomly selected thirty-percent of the herds in each camp.</s><s>This was done by dividing the number of herds on the camp-herd list by thirty, and the quotient was used as the interval for selecting the herds from the camp-herd list.</s><s>For the selected herds, we then sought permission from the herd owner and only if granted, would we ask for the number of animals in their herds.</s><s>This number would then be divided by 10, and the quotient was used as an interval for selecting individual animals lined up in a kraal.</s><s>If the herd owner rejected our request, the herd was dropped and we continued with same frequency as before, in order to get a replacement herd.</s><s>A total of 893 animals were selected from 37 cattle camps from four the states.</s><s>It is noteworthy that we selected a minimum of 20 animals per herd using this strategy.</s></p><p><s>We also collected blood samples from the herders who were in direct contact with animals and were willing to participate in this study according to the informed consent.</s><s>However, it is important to note that some of the herders were below eighteen years; in this case we sought permission from their parents and guardian.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>Information about animal body condition status, history of abortion and presence of hygroma as indicators of brucellosis were captured on data sheet during blood collection by observation and interviewing animal's owners.</s><s>In addition, information on herd size, lactating stage and age of the animal was collected.</s><s>Age was determined using the dentition method of ageing cattle.</s><s>From all the participants, a questionnaire was administered, and we collected information about the individual's occupation, age, sex, marital status and education level.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample collection</head><p><s>Ten (10) ml of blood were collected from the jugular vein of the selected animal by a veterinary research assistant; on the other hand, 5 mL of blood was collected from the cephalic vein of each herder by a registered nurse.</s><s>All blood samples were then kept at room temperature (25˚C-30˚C), and tilted at an angle of 45˚for 6-8 hours to allow for clotting.</s><s>The sera were aliquoted into new set of labeled Eppendorf tubes, stored on ice packs and transported to Wau Teaching Hospital Laboratory, where they were kept in a deep freezer at -80˚C.</s><s>The samples were then transported to the Central Diagnostic Laboratory at Makerere University, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biosecurity, Kampala-Uganda by air after completion of data collection.</s><s>Here, serological tests that included, Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT), and Competitive Enzyme Linked Immuno sorbent Assay (c-ELISA) were done within five days of delivery as described below.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Serological testing</head><p><s>Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT).</s><s>The antigen used in the RBPT was obtained from the Veterinary Research Institute, Sudan.</s><s>It was prepared and standardized following the procedure as described by Al ton <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The antigen was quality controlled according to the OIE guidelines (2016) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The same secondary standard sera were used as positive and negative controls during the testing.</s><s>Prior to testing, serum samples and the antigen were removed from the refrigerator and left to thaw at room temperature.</s><s>Following equilibration of serum at room temperature, 30μL of serum was dispensed into an enamel plate, an equal volume of RBPT antigen was also added to the plate, and then mixed.</s><s>After rocking the plate for 5 minutes, the test result was read.</s><s>Agglutination was recorded as negative (0), weak positive (+1), positive (+2), strong positive (+3) or very strong positive (+4) as earlier described <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The plates with negative and weakly positive agglutination were considered negative.</s><s>Positive and negative control sera were run in parallel for each sera batch tested.</s><s>Duplicates of each tested serum were used to assure that the antigens used in the test were sensitive, as well as specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Competitive Enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (c-ELISA).</s><s>The test kit, Serum P04130-13 brucellosis Antibody Test Kit-IDEXX was used as a confirmatory test.</s><s>The test was performed following the manufacturer's guidelines.</s><s>Briefly, PBS-Tween Solution 20x concentrate 1/20 was diluted in distilled water.</s><s>Then, 500 mL were prepared by adding 25ml PBS-Tween Solution to 475 mL distilled water and mixed thoroughly.</s><s>After this, freeze dried mAb was reconstituted immediately before use with 6mL sample dilution buffer by adding the buffer carefully into the bottle.</s><s>All reagents were equilibrated to room temperature (21˚C-28˚C) for 30-45 minutes before use.</s><s>The samples and controls were diluted by adding them to the wells of the plates prefilled with the buffer.</s><s>Fifty-microliter of each serum controls (positive, weak positive and negative) were added into each of the appropriate wells, respectively.</s><s>Each control was run in duplicate.</s><s>Five-microliter of each sample dilution buffer was added into two separate wells (designated as conjugate control).</s><s>Five-microliter of each test sample was added to each appropriate well, and then 50μL of mAb-solution were added to all wells of the samples and controls within 10 minutes.</s><s>The test plate was sealed and the reagents were mixed thoroughly by tipping the sides of the plate.</s><s>The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.</s><s>Thereafter, the plate was rinsed 4 times with PBS-Tween using Sanofi Pasteur washer.</s><s>One hundred microliters (100-μl) substrate solutions were added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature; timing began after the first well was filled.</s><s>The reaction was stopped by adding 50μL of 4% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), in the same order as the substrate solution was added to each well and mixed thoroughly.</s><s>The optical densities (OD) of the controls and the test samples were measured using a micro plate photometer (Bio Tek ELX800 absorbance reader) at 450 nm after 15 minutes from the addition of the stop solution.</s><s>The mean and standard deviations of the optical densities of the test and control samples were calculated.</s><s>The percentage inhibition (PI) for the controls and test samples were calculated using a formula (PI = 100 -(Mean OD of test sample/ Mean OD of Controls X 100)).</s><s>To ensure quality, the OD values of the control and test samples were required to fall within 0.75-2.0.</s><s>PI values &lt;30% were considered negative and those &gt; 30% are classified positive.</s><s>The serological tests were performed following the OIE guidelines as specified in Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, chapter 2.1.4</s><s>(OIE,2016)</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>Statistical analysis was done in SPSS and R, version 24 and 3.2.3</s><s>respectively.</s><s>For descriptive statistics, that is to say, proportions and percentage of the positive against the number tested were estimated; while Chi-square was employed in assessing the relationship between various factors and test outcome (test positivity).</s><s>A positive Brucella sample was defined as sample that was positive on RBPT and confirmed by c-ELISA, while a negative sample was defined as a sample that was negative on RBPT, as well as c-ELISA.</s><s>A logistic regression model was developed to identify factors associated with bovine brucellosis in cattle.</s><s>The model developed by adding variables in a forward selection process adjusting for confounding, starting with variables that had the lowest p-value from the univariable analysis.</s><s>Only variables that had a p value &lt;0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> were included in the model, these were added and removed to see if they still retained their level of statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05), and checked for potential confounding effects as well.</s><s>The least complex model was chosen based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC).</s><s>Standard post estimation statistics were also done.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics considerations</head><p><s>This study involved an administration of questionnaires to the herders, as well as blood sampling from cattle.</s><s>Therefore, the study protocol (SBLS/REC/15/133) was assessed and approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity (COVAB), Makerere University, Uganda; reference number SBLS.</s><s>NA.2015 (S1).</s><s>We also obtained permission to collect human and animal samples from Ministry of Health (MOH) (S2), and Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF)-RSS/MLFI/DVS/J/15/7 (S3), South Sudan.</s><s>Furthermore, we sought consent from the participants in this study.</s><s>Their decision to participate was arrived at, after we explained the objectives and the potential benefits of this work to them as individuals and their communities at large.</s><s>For individuals who were below 18 years of age, we sought permission from their parents or guardians.</s><s>All this was done in local ethnic language of the group, to which the individual belonged.</s><s>All this was in addition to the assurance of anonymity as required by the ethical approval obtained.</s><s>We also obtained import and export permits for biological sample transportation from Ministries of Agriculture of Uganda and South Sudan (S4&amp; S5).</s></p></div>
