<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OMERACT consensus meeting</head><p><s>A Workshop with breakout groups was held at the OMERACT 2016 meeting in Whistler, Canada, and followed three steps.</s></p><p><s>(Step 1) Presentation of background information-Meeting attendees were presented with a description of SDM and an example of a patient decision aid.</s><s>Commonly assessed Domains and subDomains of SDM derived from the literature and the results of the Delphi survey were provided.</s><s>To help attendees determine outcome Domains most important to them, two clinical vignettes, one with a high level of SDM behaviours and one with a low level <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, were performed by a clinician and patient research partners (found at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rfystn08dx6c042/AABnUMvPqBn-9dTJlkOF3jCsa?dl=0).</s><s>Attendees were asked to complete a checklist of the draft core set to indicate whether the outcome Domains of SDM were present in each vignette.</s></p><p><s>(Step 2) Breakout group discussion-Attendees were then assigned to eight breakout groups to ensure representation of all key stakeholders (e.g., patients, clinicians).</s><s>Each one of these groups was led by a facilitator and notes were taken by a reporter.</s><s>In these groups, participants decided whether each Domain should be in the inner core set (essential to evaluate in all SDM trials), middle core set (relevant but not essential to assess in every SDM trial) or outer core set (should be part of a research agenda for future consideration).</s><s>These Domains were displayed on a flip chart, and participants were given seven stickers to attribute to the various Domains (one per Domain).</s><s>They also discussed reasons for including/excluding Domains from the core set.</s></p><p><s>(Step 3) Plenary voting-Rapporteurs from each breakout group presented a summary of their group's discussion and vote at a final plenary session.</s><s>Participants then voted using electronic voting clickers to decide whether each Domain should be in the inner core set, middle core set, outer core set or whether they had insufficient information to vote.</s><s>Each outcome Domain was included in a category of the core set if at least 70% of participants endorsed it.</s><s>A final vote was held to decide whether outcomes associated with SDM interventions were within the scope of OMERACT.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electronic Delphi Survey</head><p><s>Participants' Characteristics-A total of 170 participants completed Delphi survey Round 1, and 116 completed Round 2 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Participants came from 29 countries in North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, Asia and Africa.</s><s>There was an equal representation of clinicians/researchers and patients/caregivers in both rounds (52% versus 48% in Round 1, and 53% versus 47% in Round 2).</s><s>The majority of patients were diagnosed with RA (73% in Round 1 and 69% in Round 2) followed by OA and PsA.</s><s>Participants with no SDM experience accounted for 40% in Round 1, those with limited experience (i.e., had used or developed one SDM intervention) accounted for 35%, and those experienced in SDM (i.e., had used or developed two or more SDM interventions) accounted for 25%.</s><s>Participants' characteristics' were similar in Round 2.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ratings of Outcome Domains by Delphi Participants-Delphi results for Round 1</head><p><s>showed that all 12 subDomains, representing all seven Domains, should be included in the potential core set (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Participants also suggested five new subDomains that were added in Round 2. The most important subDomains were knowledge of options, and values clarification and discussion.</s><s>Compared to clinicians/researchers, patients/caregivers rated the following subDomains as more important: patients' understanding that their values influence their decision (p= 0.018), values clarification (p=0.006) and discussion (p= 0.037), patients' involvement in decision making (p= 0.029), patients' ability to weigh good and bad features of options (p= 0.021), informed value-based choice (p= 0.035), decisional conflict (p= 0.001), and adherence to the chosen option (p= 0.005).</s><s>All 12 subDomains reached the 70% threshold for patients/caregivers, while all except decisional conflict reached this threshold for clinicians/researchers.</s><s>For Delphi Round 2, results showed that 14 out of the 17 subDomains, representing all seven Domains, met the 70% criteria for inclusion in the potential core set (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>The three subDomains failing to meet the 70% threshold were decisional conflict, decisional regret and trust in healthcare providers.</s><s>The most important subDomains were knowledge of options and values clarification and discussion.</s><s>According to patients/caregivers, all 17 subDomains reached the 70% threshold, while the same 14 subDomains that were important in the overall analysis were important to clinicians/researchers.</s><s>Compared to clinicians/ researchers, patients/caregivers had higher importance ratings for clarification of values (p=0.003) and involvement in decision making (p= 0.036).</s><s>Ratings did not vary with respondents' experience in SDM.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OMERACT Consensus Meeting</head><p><s>A total of 189 individuals attended the OMERACT meeting and 21 of them had previously answered the Delphi survey.</s></p><p><s>(a) Breakout groups-Initial voting was carried out in the eight breakout groups to help decide which items needed the most discussion.</s><s>The majority of Domains were supported.</s><s>Domains judged most important concerned the understanding of information and values clarification (each receiving 88% of votes) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>).</s><s>However, as the small group discussions progressed, it became clear that many participants had limited prior experience with SDM; many participants found it difficult to distinguish between the SDM process and outcomes.</s></p><p><s>(b) Plenary session-A total of 96 attendees (51% of attendees at the OMERACT meeting), including eight patient research partners, 83 clinicians/researchers and five policymakers, voted at the plenary session, held immediately after the breakout group discussions.</s><s>According to this plenary vote, none of the Domains reached the 70% threshold (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ref>).</s><s>Participants felt that the most important Domains to include in the inner core were the impact of the decision (68%), understanding information (67%) and clarifying and discussing patients' values (62%).</s><s>A further vote was taken to assess whether the audience supported this initiative going forward and 84% indicated their support.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The current study aimed to determine the core set of outcome Domains and subDomains for measuring the effectiveness of SDM interventions in rheumatology clinical trials.</s><s>Results from the Delphi survey, with a high proportion of patients/caregivers (48%) and individuals with experience with SDM (60%), showed that 14 of 17 subDomains, representing all eight IPDAS Domains, were considered critically important.</s><s>However, at the OMERACT 2016 Workshop and breakout groups, only 8% were patients and, despite their strong support for the core set, their views were outvoted by the other stakeholders who were predominantly rheumatology clinicians/researchers.</s><s>This study is one of the first to seek consensus on SDM outcome Domains with a considerable amount of both patient and clinician/researcher input.</s><s>With nearly equallysized groups of patients/caregivers and clinicians/researchers in the Delphi survey, the weight of both sets of opinions were relatively equivalent.</s><s>Although three subDomains did not meet the 70% threshold in the overall Delphi results, they did among patients.</s><s>This is consistent with the IPDAS Delphi survey, which found higher endorsement of outcome Domains among patients versus researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>These contrasting levels of stakeholder endorsement pose the question of whether studies should ensure a balance in number of patients/caregivers and other stakeholders, and if not, whether results should be weighted to allow for opinions of both sets to be equally taken into account.</s></p><p><s>While all seven Domains included subDomains considered important in the Delphi survey, none reached the 70% threshold at the final plenary vote.</s><s>These contrasting levels of endorsement may be explained by differences in participant characteristics and a different voting context in each setting.</s><s>The lower proportion of patients at the consensus meeting compared to the Delphi survey (8% at meeting versus 47% in Delphi Round 2) may have led to lower levels of outcome Domain endorsement, since patients tend to rate SDM outcome Domains higher than other stakeholders.</s><s>Additionally, since the Delphi survey was sent via e-mail to potential participants, those taking the time to complete it may have been more motivated due to particular SDM interest or expertise, leading to stronger endorsement compared to attendees at a meeting not specifically dedicated to SDM.</s><s>Furthermore, because the second reminder for the Delphi survey was a few days before the OMERACT meeting, it is possible that only a subset of more motivated individuals found the time to answer the second round, thus potentially leading to stronger endorsement of the subDomains of the core set.</s><s>Any effects from relatively lower SDM familiarity among consensus meeting participants may also have been heightened by the influences of group pressure that are more likely to arise in a face-to-face setting than an online survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>However, as the final vote at the consensus meeting demonstrated, there is interest in continuing this work within OMERACT.</s></p><p><s>Breakout group discussions and plenary session voting results revealed some challenges in the comprehension of SDM concepts used, possibly because of the complexity of Domains that included various subDomains.</s><s>Attendees also mentioned confusion about the fact that some Domains assessed the SDM process rather than its outcomes, and seemed to prefer outcomes, as shown by the high endorsement for the impact of the decision at the plenary session.</s><s>These findings underscore the need to revise and clarify terms and definitions used by our working group, to promote better understanding of SDM process and outcome Domains.</s><s>Using the language suggested by Sepucha and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> about the quality of the decision-making process and the quality of the choice made may help to increase comprehension of SDM outcome Domains.</s></p><p><s>The results of the plenary session vote could be due partly to the participants' lack of experience with SDM, above-mentioned process/outcome confusion and the preference for outcomes of SDM rather than its process.</s><s>The relatively low percentage of OMERACT attendees who voted at the plenary session (51%) may further reflect a lack of interest or experience with SDM within OMERACT or simply participant fatigue experienced on the last day of the meeting.</s><s>It is also possible that voting and non-voting participants at the plenary session may have had different opinions on the core set but we do not have the data to verify this hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>This experience shows the importance of involving all key stakeholders to the same extent and to ensure clarity and a shared understanding of the core set of outcome domains.</s><s>Many OMERACT attendees seemed to lack sufficient confidence in understanding to vote in favour of the core set.</s><s>Further efforts should aim at providing additional education about SDM, dispelling its myths <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, promoting understanding of its process and outcomes using clear terms and definitions, and ensuring patients' voices are heard throughout the consensus process.</s><s>The next steps include the development of a white paper to justify and describe this work, the conduct of interviews with opinion leaders within OMERACT and the SDM community (from all key stakeholder groups) to increase the clarity and relevance of the core set among OMERACT, as well as further consensus building efforts (Delphi survey and consensus meeting) after ensuring a thorough understanding of opinion leaders within OMERACT through educational activities (e.g., webinars).</s></p><p><s>Meaningfully enhancing communication with patients as part of this initiative will facilitate the development of consensus on a core set to assess the effectiveness and safety of SDM interventions, as well as contextual factors that may impact their outcomes (see OMERACT master checklist in supplementary material).</s><s>Patients' high endorsement of outcome Domains suggests a need to further develop this core set in spite of the lack of clinician/ researcher endorsement.</s><s>As an OMERACT patient research partner phrased it: "Patients must be involved in their care and treatment decisions not just to ensure patient-centred care but also so that patients understand and take responsibility for these decisions.</s><s>SDM is the wave of the future; we can't run away from it, we have to tackle it together."</s><s>Refined draft core set of outcome domains and subdomains *</s></p></div>
