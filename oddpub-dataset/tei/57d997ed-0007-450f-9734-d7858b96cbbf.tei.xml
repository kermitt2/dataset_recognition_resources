<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Mutation processes moulding the exomes of 31 OS.</s><s>Our discovery set for whole-exome sequencing comprised 31 OS, which were sequenced at a median depth of B150 Â (range 131-370) alongside with paired constitutional DNA from peripheral blood (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All tumour samples were derived from pre-therapeutic biopsies.</s><s>Making use of Stampy and Platypus programs for mapping and variant calling, the number of somatic base substitutions (single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)) and indels called with high confidence ranged from 7 to 3,153 (median ¼ 66.5) and 17 to 529 (median ¼ 33.5) per exome, respectively.</s><s>Of these, a median of 21 SNV changes (range 4-174) and seven small indels (range 2-210) were potentially functional within protein-coding regions.</s><s>The SNV spectrum for each OS exome is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 and 2</ref>. With two exceptions, the C:G4T:A changes were the most common changes followed by C:G4A:T and T:A4C:G changes.</s><s>The mutation burden of OS was similar to the ageing signature of most tumour types from the pan-cancer analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , however, a decomposition of mutation spectra with a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm revealed a pattern similar to the signatures 3 and 5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>A subset of tumours of this class is known to acquire a characteristic pattern of substitution mutations including kataegis and the presence of signature 3 was strongly associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations within breast and pancreatic cancer types <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Driver mutations impair cell control of genome integrity.</s><s>For the discovery of somatic driver mutations we restricted our analysis to protein-coding regions.</s><s>A minimum variant allele frequency of 0.05 was set.</s><s>We then prioritized genes for further investigation by filtering mutations to exclude all SNVs with moderate or benign predicted functional effects (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) score ¼ o0.05 and Mutation Taster and PolyPhen2 40.8).</s><s>All protein-truncating and splicesite mutations were retained.</s><s>We then identified genes that were mutated in two or more tumours and inspected all variant reads in the Integrated Genome Viewer to exclude any mutations at sites of evidently poor quality.</s><s>Eventually, 26 genes (Supplementary Data 1) including some that had already been reported in the context of OS (for example, ARTX, SFPQ,

identified clearly monoclonal mutation events in TP53 or RB1 in 47% of cases, whereas additional 40% of tumours could be explained by invoking mutations in alternative driver genes.</s><s>Eight of these genes-BRCA2, BAP1, RET, MUTYH, ATM, PTEN, WRN and RECQL4-are well-known Mendelian cancer drivers, whilst the four remaining genes (ATRX, FANCA, NUMA1 and MDC1) have been reported in the context

total, 87% of OS could be explained by any of the 14 driver genes.</s><s>Our findings thus supplement the 'traditional' TP53-centred model of OS evolution such that molecular pathways functionally similar to TP53 can drive its initial phases by conferring to genome instability.</s><s>Tumours without clonal TP53 mutations may still acquire subclonal TP53 mutations later which adds B25% to the total mutation prevalence.</s><s>This is important to realize when interpreting findings of other studies as, for example, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> reported structural and SNV mutations in TP53 in 30 of 34 genomesequenced tumours.</s><s>In a second study, whole-exome sequencing of 53 paediatric OS yielded a 75% prevalence of TP53 mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>The difference between these and our estimate might in part result from our inability to identify rearrangements within the first intron of TP53 (which we estimated at 15% frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> ), but other aspects being equal, we conclude that not all previously reported TP53 mutations are clonal and thus represent the triggering event.</s><s>Instead we envision a situation, in which multiple oncogenic pathways drive chromosomal aneuploidy and instability in early stages of OS evolution.</s><s>Mutational landscapes of two tumours without TP53 mutations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>) shall illustrate our hypothesis.</s><s>The first tumour (OS-046) does likely acquired a homozygous mutation in NUMA1, resulting in mitotic segregation errors that at some point led to the chromoplexy of chromosomes 2, 8 and 17 driven by inter-chromosomal exchanges.</s><s>The evidence supporting NUMA1 mutation as a triggering event in OS-046 stems from the fact that all somatic SNV mutations were monoclonal, which would be hardly possible if they were sequential to the chromosomal instability.</s><s>Similarly, an early evolutionary history of the second tumour (OS-059) could have been driven either by a germline MUTYH mutation or by a somatic RB1 mutation.</s><s>Mutations in both genes were found hemizygous in a tumour, both mutations were clonal events and the functions of both genes are related to chromosomal instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>However, a parsimonious explanation would still favour a single somatic hit in the MUTYH gene over two somatic hits in RB1.</s></p><p><s>In a recent study Nik-Zainal et al. 12 described a distinct profile (which they termed profile D) of substitutions and deletions in breast cancer with BRCA1/2 mutations, which later was reported by Alexandrov et al. <ref type="bibr"

target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) in 29/31 (94%) tumours from which exome-sequencing data were available.</s><s>This seems particularly interesting because early evolution of OS has historically been attributed to TP53 and RB1 driver mutations, but the root molecular cause of its genomic complexity (in later phases) remains unclear.</s><s>Seeking to validate this finding we turned to whole-genome copy-number profiles of 123 OS and specifically looked for characteristic large-scale copy-number changes that also constitute the hallmark of BRCA1/2-mutated breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Surprisingly, 84% of the analysed tumours fulfilled these criteria, suggesting that exome findings are likely to be correct and that various degrees of BRCAness are acquired throughout OS evolution.</s><s>A recent study in ovarian cancer developed a LOH-based homologous recombination deficiency score, which reflects the number of subchromosomal LOH segments with a size exceeding 15 Mbp.</s><s>Intriguingly, a high homologous recombination deficiency-LOH score, as seen in 78% of OS assayed in our study, was shown to correlate with deficiency in homologous repair and a positive response to a combination treatment including a PARP inhibitor in breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Putative deficiency in homologous repair and other similarities between OS and tumours with BRCA-like phenotype indicate a specific weakness that could be therapeutically exploited.</s><s>Specifically, the inhibition of PARPs contributing to

of OS presented here prerequisites the existence of intratumour heterogeneity, which is in fact lost in vitro.</s><s>The polyclonal nature of OS also implies that BRCA-like traits of OS genomes might result not only from BRCA1/2 mutations alone but also from mutations in other genes of the homologous recombination pathway, each of which confers to additional biological properties.</s><s>These limitations do not invalidate our findings or conclusions, but suggest that, for example, responsiveness of individual tumours to PARP inhibitors will not only depend on the proportion of cancer cells with BRCA-like features but also on the specific mutations and genes that bring about homologous recombination deficiency.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the presented data support a BRCA-like phenotype as a unifying trait of OS independently of which oncogenic pathway drives tumorigenesis.</s><s>We have shown that at least 14 different genes underlie the disease, including Mendelian cancer drivers
