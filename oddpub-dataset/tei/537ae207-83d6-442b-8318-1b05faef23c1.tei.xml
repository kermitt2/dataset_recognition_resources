(2) require minimal power consumption; and (3) promote mobile and unobtrusive monitoring outside the laboratory.</s><s>To our knowledge, neither commercially available BIS instruments (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S1</ref> of the online supplement) nor more advanced wearable prototypes proposed in the recent literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref> meet all these requirements.</s><s>In fact, commercial off-the-shelf bioimpedance devices basically suffer from some of the following major limitations:</s></p><p><s>(1) they are rather bulky and limited to laboratory/clinical settings; (2) they generally employ a single electrode set-up and model the human body as a single cylinder, preventing the possibility to distinguish fluid distribution between different body segments simultaneously; or (3) when they provide measures on more than one body segment, it is not possible to select segments different from those predefined by the system (e.g., limbs and trunk); and (4) many of them do not employ the principle of bioimpedance spectroscopy, but typically operate a single frequency (e.g., 50 kHz), limiting their use for differentiating intra-and extra-cellular water.</s><s>These are considerable drawbacks for various applications in sports medicine that require the continuous monitoring of impedance changes in specific body segments without interfering movements, or the assessment of the hydration level during prolonged physical exercise, such as during a marathon run.</s><s>Similarly, rehabilitation medicine may require monitoring BIS in selected body segments for therapeutic interventions.</s><s>This includes, for example, free-moving patients wearing compression socks to prevent deep venous thrombosis, or patients with peripheral artery disease exercising the lower limbs, when echographic blood flow measurements are not feasible.</s><s>In addition, aerospace medicine applications may necessitate continuous long-term evaluations of BIS with minimal interferences of other activities.</s><s>Such recordings could assess blood pooling in the lower extremities of jet-pilots exposed to changing gravity forces, or fluid shifts concomitant with weightlessness and/or artificial gravity in astronauts.</s><s>In all these cases, unobtrusive, wearable BIS systems, capable of long-term recordings, could provide important physiological and clinical information.</s></p><p><s>We have recently shown that a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) can generate the proper waveforms of the stimulation currents and elaborate the measured voltages over the frequency range requested for BIS studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Since the DSP can be integrated in a miniaturized and light-weight BIS system with very low power consumption, this paved the way for a new class of wearable BIS instruments that may allow the unobtrusive long-term monitoring of different body segments simultaneously over a broad range of frequencies.</s><s>Based on the DSP approach, we have developed a novel BIS prototype that aims to provide a wearable, not just portable, multi-segmental and multi-frequency device with a built-in triaxial accelerometer.</s><s>This device allows studying the relationship between movements, position and body impedance for hours with up to 50 impedance spectra per second over a broad range of frequencies.</s><s>The significant impact of this technology can be traced to the following advantages: it is wearable, it enables long-term continuous (online) monitoring, it is based on a segmental approach and it implements multifrequency spectroscopy, potentially allowing intra-and extra-cellular water assessment.</s><s>These characteristics are not met by any of the devices commercially available.</s></p><p><s>The aim of the present work was therefore (1) to describe a wearable prototype for monitoring BIS over different body segments without interfering with the subject movements and (2) to assess the feasibility of this prototype to quantify impedance changes associated with fluid shifts in three body segments concomitant with physical exercise as well as postural changes.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Discussion</head><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> shows the time course of the impedance magnitude at 48 kHz in the three body segments.</s><s>Impedance was similar in the two thighs at baseline, but markedly differed between the active and inactive leg during exercise.</s><s>Its magnitude decreased in the active leg, with a fast variability component superimposed to the decreasing trend.</s><s>By contrast, |Z(f)| increased in the inactive leg without showing the fast variability components.</s></p><p><s>The decreasing impedance trend of the active thigh (red line) is likely due to the increased volume of blood accumulated in the active thigh, particularly in the capacitance vessels of the venous district, which follows the increased demand of blood flow in the upper leg.</s><s>In contrast, an explanation for the fast variability component is that knee-extension muscles squeeze out blood from the thigh vessels during each contraction, thus decreasing the volume of fluids and conversely increasing the impedance.</s><s>In addition, each knee extension may also have caused a synchronous change in impedance by modifying the cross-sectional areas of the contracting muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the pelvis area, impedance decreased at the start of the exercise warm-up.</s><s>This behavior could be due to the fact that the pelvis is located just upstream of the active thigh and the increased blood flow demand for the exercising muscles may have also increased the blood volume in the neighboring area during warm-up.</s><s>The increased impedance after warm-up in the pelvis and in the inactive thigh seems to reflect blood flow redistributions from these non-exercising segments to the active leg.</s></p><p><s>During exercise, pelvis impedance also demonstrated a fast variability component.</s><s>It is assumed that part of the blood volume squeezed out by the contracting muscles of the active thigh was pushed into the pelvis, producing a fast periodic component similar to that observed in the active thigh.</s><s>This fast variability disappeared when the muscle contractions stopped at the start of recovery, while the impedance difference between the inactive and active thighs persisted during the whole recovery period.</s></p><p><s>Our device appears to have the sufficient resolution and sensitivity needed for studying small acute circulatory responses during the first minutes following the start of exercise (note the enlargement of the transition from warm-up to exercise in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref>).</s><s>These response are probably related to the mismatch between oxygen demand and oxygen supply by the blood flow in the working muscles.</s><s>In fact, we can observe an increase of impedance magnitude in the active thigh that starts 100 s after the onset of exercise (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6a</ref>).</s><s>This increase is likely due to the working muscles' contraction that occludes blood flow into the muscle and pushes out a substantial fraction of blood volume into the pelvis.</s><s>In accordance with that, we also observe a temporary decrease of impedance in the pelvis area synchronous with the impedance increase in the active thigh (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6b</ref>), which could correspond to the volume of blood shifted from the active thigh to the pelvis.</s><s>It is known that an increased oxygen demand in a working muscle accumulates metabolites that stimulate chemically sensitive nerves in the muscular parenchyma and that, in turn, activates the muscle metaboreflex <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The efferent response of this reflex activation is an increase in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system that, on the one hand, induces an increase of cardiac output, aimed at increasing blood flow, and, on the other hand, constricts the vasculature in order to redirect the augmented flow of blood to the active muscles only.</s><s>Vasoconstriction induced by the metaboreflex may have temporarily reduced the volume of blood in the pelvis, causing the rapid |Z(f)| increase 200 s after the onset of exercise (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6b</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the impedance of the active thigh starts to decrease about 50 s after the start of the impedance rise in the pelvis, suggesting that the decrease of impedance in the active thigh is, at least in part, a consequence of vascular vasoconstriction in the pelvis area.</s></p><p><s>the decrease of impedance in the active thigh is, at least in part, a

type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, or reported that temperature does not even affect the electrode-skin interface at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, Cornish et al. (1998) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> found that increased skin temperature, in fact, has an effect on impedance when a bipolar electrode arrangement is employed, but not when a tetrapolar electrode configuration is used: in this latter case, impedance changed by less than 2% when skin temperature changed by 15 ˝C.</s><s>We may therefore assume that effects of body temperature on impedance are only marginal with the tetrapolar electrode set-up that was used with our device.</s><s>In particular, given the small differences in skin temperature between the thighs and between the start and end of exercise (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), we may exclude substantial effects of body temperature on our present findings.</s><s>Finally, sweating might be another factor influencing the BIS, but because of the relatively light exercise load, and the small increase of temperature, sweating did not occur during exercise.</s><s>In any case, the tetrapolar electrodes arrangement has also been shown to be largely insensitive to the effects of sweating <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s></p></div>
