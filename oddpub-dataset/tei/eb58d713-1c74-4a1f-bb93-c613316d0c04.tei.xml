<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Medical diagnosis and molecular or biochemical confirmation typically rely on the knowledge of the clinician.</s><s>Although this is very difficult in extremely rare diseases, we hypothesized that the recording of patient phenotypes in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms and computationally ranking putative disease-associated sequence variants improves diagnosis, particularly for patients with atypical clinical profiles.</s></p><p><s>Methods: Using simulated exomes and the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) patient cohort and associated exome sequence, we tested our hypothesis using Exomiser.</s><s>Exomiser ranks candidate variants based on patient phenotype similarity to (i) known disease-gene phenotypes, (ii) model organism phenotypes of candidate orthologs, and (iii) phenotypes of proteinprotein association neighbors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>Benchmarking showed Exomiser ranked the causal variant as the top hit in 97% of known disease-gene associations and ranked the correct seeded variant in up to 87% when detectable disease-gene associations were unavailable.</s><s>Using UDP data, Exomiser ranked the causative variant(s) within the top 10 variants for 11 previously diagnosed variants and achieved a diagnosis for 4 of 23 cases undiagnosed by clinical evaluation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>Structured phenotyping of patients and computational analysis are effective adjuncts for diagnosing patients with genetic disorders.</s></p></div>

30 its benchmarking, using the same strategy with 1000 Genome Project exomes, spiked HGMD variants and ESP and 1000 Genomes Project frequency data, revealed a 13-58% improvement over all existing prediction methods, including eXtasy, PHEVOR, and the previous version of Exomiser.</s><s>The performance of the current version of Exomiser with 97% for both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive disorders compares favorably with Phen-Gen's performance of 92 and 96% for dominant and recessive disorders, respectively.</s><s>When using the same masking strategy to detect novel associations for autosomal dominant and recessive disorders, Phen-Gen performs at 56 and 89% compared to 79 and 87% for the current version of Exomiser.</s><s>Compared to the prior version of Exomiser, this represents an improvement in detection of novel associations by 4-13% and of known associations by 16-31%.</s><s>This suggests that Exomiser is currently the optimal solution to detecting known and novel disease variants.</s></p><p><s>Exomiser takes advantage of cross-species phenotype data using semantic bridging ontologies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> and this capability produces the increased performance we observed in our benchmarking over other exome prioritization tools.</s><s>This ability to stretch phenotypic coverage by leveraging cross-species genotype-phenotype data is particularly important in programs like the UDP, where the patients have unusual phenotypes that may be caused by variation in an as yet unstudied gene.</s><s>We have already shown the utility of expanding the phenotypic matches by our ability to prioritize AARS2 variants in UDP_4306, GRIN2B variants in UDP_608, MED23 variants in UDP_2146/2156, and SMS variants in UDP_930/929 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the SMS match is to the Sms mouse data generated by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium; no other Sms mutant mouse descriptions reported the glucose and potassium abnormalities that were critical to identifying this variant.</s><s>We therefore speculate that expansion of the phenotype coverage in the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium database over the next few years will enable many more discoveries like this.</s><s>The inclusion of the protein-protein association data was also of particular importance for the UDP patients, where 5 of the 11 disease variants found in previously diagnosed families were detected by Exomiser via this link.</s><s>In all cases, these patients were diagnosed with diseases known to be associated with the mutated gene.</s><s>However, the patient's phenotypic profile was so atypical that only weak matches at best were detected for these diseases.</s><s>Instead, Exomiser detected strong phenotypic matches to protein-protein association neighbors of the mutated gene.</s></p><p><s>In summary, combining Mendelian segregation filters, population frequency, and variant predicted deleteriousness with structured phenotype data from humans and model organisms improves diagnostic efficiency and effectively identifies and prioritizes exome variants associated with known and new diseases.</s><s>Comparing patient phenotype to human disease phenotype data is particularly useful to identify known human diseases, whereas for those human genes currently unassociated with disease, increasing phenotypic coverage by using model organism and protein-protein association data allows generation of hypotheses for the genetic basis of a disease.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 semantic phenotype matching.For each variant that passed the frequency and Mendelian inheritance filters, the patient's Human Phenotype Ontology terms were compared to all human diseases associated with the gene containing the variant in OMIM or Orphanet, (a) as well as any phenotypes associated with orthologs of the gene in mice or zebrafish (b).</s><s>If there was no phenotypic match between the patient and any phenotypes associated with the gene, then the patient's phenotype was compared with phenotypes associated with nearby genes in the protein-protein association network (c).</s><s>When calculating the phenotypic score, the network considered the similarity to the patient phenotype and proximity of the matching gene to the gene in which the patient had a mutation.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,69.06,90.73,455.90,387.02" type="bitmap" /></figure>
