<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The identification of suitable feature selection methods and learning algorithms is a critical step to develop accurate radiomics models.</s><s>We therefore performed a systematic evaluation of different feature selection methods and learning algorithms in predicting LRC and OS for patients with locally advanced HNSCC.</s><s>All algorithms were able to deal with continuous time-to-event survival data and have not been investigated previously.</s><s>In general, the systematic evaluation showed a good predictive performance for LRC.</s><s>However, there was no method which noticeably outperformed all others.</s><s>Instead, a subset of different feature selection methods and learning algorithms led to similar results.</s><s>This indicates that a wide range of different methods are useful and should be considered for further radiomics analyses.</s><s>Moreover, applying multiple methods may decrease the influence of random effects which may occur in selecting one single approach.</s><s>Furthermore, the evaluation showed that the performance differences between the learning algorithms were smaller than between the feature selection methods.</s><s>In line with Parmar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , this indicates that feature selection is more important in the process of developing an accurate radiomics model.</s><s>In contrast to LRC, the predictive performance for OS was generally lower.</s><s>This may occur since the cause of death does not necessarily have to be related to cancer, and due to the corresponding increase in "noise" on the outcome.</s><s>Furthermore the best performances were achieved by the BGLM-CIndex, -Weibull and -Cox models in combination with the random feature selection.</s><s>One explanation  for the good performance of random feature selection may be that the hyper-parameter optimisation combined with feature selection, which is performed internally by several of the classifiers, leads to a better model accuracy.</s><s>However, the results on the training set (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>) show that the train error is actually greater than the test error for the cases with high prognostic performance.</s><s>This indicates that the resulting validation performance may be a statistical fluke.</s><s>A significant difference in LRC was found between patients stratified into a low and a high risk group using the best performing models, which confirms their clinical potential.</s><s>However, the results strongly depend on the process of selecting the stratification cut-off, and not necessarily on the performance of the risk model.</s><s>This was the case for multiple models which predicted risk well, yet did not lead to a stratification of patients to risk groups with significant differences in loco-regional tumour recurrence.</s><s>Still, the applied cut-off selection process, which is based on different bootstrap samples, may lead to more robust results compared to, e.g., a median cut-off.</s><s>For instance, the cut-off determination based on bootstrap samples led to more significant results (n = 30) than the median cut-off (n = 20) on the validation cohort for LRC.</s></p><p><s>The signature obtained by the Spearman feature selection method achieved a higher validation performance than the signature by Aerts et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , which, however, was developed on a dataset of lung cancer patients.</s><s>The features included in the signature by Aerts et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> were selected based on their stability across test-retest image scans, multiple tumour delineations and 100 bootstrap samples on the exploratory cohort.</s><s>They represent the single best feature from each of four feature groups (statistical, shape, texture and wavelet features).</s><s>In contrast, our radiomics signature for the Spearman method consisted mainly of features extracted from transformed images (e.g., wavelet), leading to more sensitivity to image perturbations, e.g., image rotations and translations.</s><s>However, models trained using Spearman method showed the highest validation performance which indicates that those image perturbations had in the end a limited effect on the model accuracy.</s></p><p><s>The robustness of the signatures obtained by the different feature selection methods was in general very high against image rotations and translations.</s><s>We included 293 HNSCC patients from different institutions in our study, resulting in a highly heterogeneous dataset, which captures the variability between different CT settings and reconstruction parameters usually affecting the model accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Therefore the obtained signatures might be less biased from single-centre selection effects and thereby more generalisable and robust.</s><s>Furthermore the stability of feature selection methods was not assessed directly, as we observed that selected features in a particular bootstrap varied greatly from one bootstrap to the next, i.e., we found low overlap.</s><s>Therefore we aggregate feature ranks and select features based on rank and occurrence using an adaptation of the enhanced Borda score <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> which may also increase the stability.</s><s>To further enhance its robustness, feature stability information, e.g., from test re-test datasets, could be included in the future.</s><s>To improve the comparability and applicability of radiomics signatures, image processing should be done according to the recommendations of the imaging biomarker standardization initiative <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The prognostic performance of radiomic analyses may in principle be further improved using the deep-learning approach.</s><s>In particular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to learn feature representations directly from the imaging data instead of using hand-crafted features.</s><s>The application of CNNs have already showed promising results in the medical imaging domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> such as image segmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> or lesion detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>However, only few studies so far investigated the potential of the deep learning approach for radiomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Paul et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> showed that deep learning features alone did not improve the model accuracy in comparison to traditional quantitative imaging features.</s><s>Therefore, in the present study we decided to focus on traditional quantitative imaging features because investigation of CNNs still requires substantial fundamental research concerning the application of deep learning in radiomics: Deep learning is usually based on 2D images, which reduces the available information of the tumour.</s><s>In general 3D-CNNs are possible, however, for such an approach no pre-trained networks are available which requires sufficient more data samples for training to avoid e.g., model overfitting.</s><s>A further, unresolved, limitation is the missing ability to handle (censored) continuous time-to-event survival data, which was the main focus of our study.</s><s>Still, deep-learning is a promising approach for radiomics and requires further investigation.</s><s>Therefore we are focusing on both extending our curated medical image data set and addressing several open methodological questions to adapt deep learning to radiomic risk modelling in the future.</s></p><p><s>We developed a radiomics modelling framework (RMF) to perform unbiased automatic radiomics analyses.</s><s>Before feature selection, unsupervised feature clustering was performed to reduce and group redundant features.</s><s>The hierarchical clustering process depends on the cut-off threshold.</s><s>The cut-off height was set manually, based on considerations for the resulting number of clusters and likely redundancy.</s><s>The selection of a different cut-off height may result in slightly different findings.</s><s>Furthermore, it is conceivable to perform a model-based feature pre-selection on the exploratory cohort.</s><s>For instance, a univariate Cox regression model may be used to remove non-informative features, followed by feature clustering to optimise the cut-off value at the beginning of the processing chain.</s></p><p><s>After the feature selection process, automatic hyper-parameter optimisation was performed by the RMF, which has not been considered in most of the previously radiomics studies.</s><s>One reason is the computational resources required to optimise the model parameters.</s><s>To limit these resources, we defined hyper-parameter ranges for each algorithm with the aim to reduce the parameter space.</s><s>The parameter space was defined based on prior knowledge, e.g., the maximum signature size was derived by the number of events, i.e., 10 events per predictor variable as well as identifying those settings that led to balanced performance in cross-validation of the exploratory cohort.</s><s>A further time reduction could be achieved by replacing the exhaustive grid search optimisation by a random search strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, the automatic hyper-parameter optimisation at the beginning of the model training adjusts the model to the specific prediction task, which may improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the influence of model overfitting.</s><s>This is particularly important for the more complex models (e.g., BT-Weibull, BT-Cox and MSR-RF), as the choice of their hyper-parameters influences how well they can learn the underlying data distribution.</s></p><p><s>Based on our systematic evaluation of machine-learning algorithms for continuous time-to event survival data we conclude that the Cox model can be used as a baseline predictive model.</s><s>The Cox model, despite its simplicity was able to achieve results comparable to the more complex models.</s><s>In addition, the tree based methods (BT-Cox, RSF, MSR-RF) or full-parametric models like BT-Weibull and the boosted gradient linear model (BGLM-Cox) should be considered.</s><s>In the case of feature selection methods we recommend the Spearman correlation coefficient and mutual information based methods (MRMR, MIM, MIFS).</s><s>Multivariate-Cox feature selection as well as the random forest based method (RF-VI, PVI-RF) led to acceptable performance and may also be evaluated.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, a wide range of available machine-learning methods appears useful in future radiomics studies.</s><s>The application of suitable feature selection methods and learning algorithms is an important step to increase the robustness of future radiomics studies.</s><s>Furthermore, it helps to standardise the methods within the radiomics processing chain towards more stable and relevant clinical risk models.</s></p></div><figure
