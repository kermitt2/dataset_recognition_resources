<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The arterial elasticity substudy of the START trial is the first randomized comparison of ART initiation on vascular function, when compared with deferral of ART (ie, untreated HIV infection).</s><s>We did not observe a significant influence of ART initiation on SAE or LAE.</s><s>These findings challenge prior reports, based on cross-sectional and uncontrolled data, suggesting that ART treatment may improve (or impair) vascular function <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[34]</ref>, as well as clinical outcome data from the Strategic Management of AntiRetroviral Therapy trial showing that continuous ART treatment was associated with lower CVD event rates when compared with episodic ART <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">36]</ref>.</s><s>Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Therapy is unique with respect to studying HIV-related CVD risk, both in terms of the target population (with relative immune preservation and at very low CVD risk overall) and the prospective controlled study design (ie, experimental intervention of ART initiation).</s><s>Therefore, findings from this study both address limitations from prior studies and raise important questions about CVD risk among contemporary patients who initiate ART very early during HIV disease.</s></p><p><s>Several potential explanations exist for why our findings do not show changes in arterial elasticity with ART initiation.</s><s>Antiretroviral therapy initiation may influence CVD risk, positively or negatively, through biology not directly assessed.</s><s>Arterial elasticity does not directly assess nitric oxide-mediated endothelial dysfunction, which has been shown to improve after ART initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">37]</ref>.</s><s>Arterial elasticity estimation through BP waveform analysis reflects a more mixed pathology including both structural and functional changes throughout the vasculature.</s><s>Furthermore, arterial elasticity measurements do not directly assess atherosclerotic disease per se.</s><s>Some longitudinal HIV studies of imaging techniques that do assess atherosclerotic lesions (eg, ultrasound estimates of CIMT or carotid plaque prevalence, or computed tomography assessments of CAC) have demonstrated changes in disease progression that are influenced by ART use <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[41]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is important to note that none of these data on ART-related changes in CVD assessments included a randomized comparison with untreated HIV infection.</s></p><p><s>Additional factors that may have influenced our findings include that participants were at low risk for CVD risk, had a median duration of HIV diagnosis of only 1.3 years, and were observed for a relatively modest duration.</s><s>All of these factors may have influenced the degree to which HIV-or ART-related vascular damage occurred.</s><s>Our ability to study the effects of specific antiretrovirals was also limited.</s><s>Specifically, the ART regimen used by the immediate group included TDF in 99% and efavirenz in 74%, and neither drug has been associated with excess risk for CVD when compared with other antiretrovirals <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">43]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, this study did not include measures of plasma cytokines, monocyte activation, and/or T-cell activation-all shown to be potentially important for HIV-related CVD pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">44]</ref>.</s><s>Further characterization of the effects of ART initiation on systemic inflammation during very early HIV disease will be an important focus of future research involving START.</s><s>Finally, it is worth emphasizing that both HIV infection and ART may exert offsetting influences on vascular function <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">46]</ref>, such that the finding of no detectable treatment effect may be the net result of ART toxicity concurrent with declines in HIV-specific effects.</s></p><p><s>Our study also has risk for type-2 statistical error given our sample size; ie, there may be a small magnitude difference between immediate and deferred ART that we were unable to detect.</s><s>However, we were able to rule out what would likely be a clinically meaningful difference in SAE-which is associated with a broad spectrum of CVD events in the MESA cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[16]</ref>.</s><s>If the estimate for an SAE treatment effect in our study was found to be significant in a larger sample (ie, an effect of ART initiation resulting in an improvement of SAE by 0.25 mL/ mmHg × 100), data from MESA suggest this would correspond to an approximate 2%-3% absolute difference in CVD event risk (or a 5%-8% difference at our upper confidence limit of 0.63 SAE units).</s></p><p><s>Despite these limitations, our findings provide compelling randomized data suggesting that ART initiation may not affect CVD risk to a clinically meaningful degree among HIV-postive patients with preserved immunity.</s><s>Indeed, the primary findings from START report 12 and 14 CVD events in the immediate and deferred ART groups, respectively, corresponding to a very low overall CVD event rate of 0.19/100 person-years (among n = 4685 participants over a mean 3.0 years of follow-up) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The relative immune preservation and short duration of HIV infection in START are particularly important considerations.</s><s>Much of the data demonstrating greater CVD risk at lower CD4 counts and at higher HIV viral loads, factors that improve with ART, involve studies of participants with a much greater degree of HIV disease progression <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">47]</ref>.</s><s>Analyses of CVD risk based on the level of immune depression (ie, current and nadir CD4 count) were conducted in the D:A:D (Data collection on Adverse events of anti-HIV Drugs) cohort and demonstrated very weak associations overall that were only present at lower CD4 + counts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Cumulatively, these observations and our results support a hypothesis that excess CVD risk attributable to HIV infection may simply not be apparent in early disease, given that the effects of HIV infection on CVD pathogenesis occur over the long term, whether from immune depletion, inflammation, and/or other disease-specific factors.</s><s>Thus, strategies such as ART to mitigate HIV-related CVD risk may only have a modest benefit that will take many years to manifest.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>In conclusion, we have shown that immediate ART initiation did not significantly improve SAE or LAE, when compared with randomization to ART deferral (ie, largely untreated HIV infection), among a diverse global population of HIV-positive persons with recent HIV infection and high CD4 + counts.</s><s>These data suggest that early ART treatment does not influence vascular function to a clinically meaningful extent among HIVpositive persons with preserved immunity.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) use and viral suppression by treatment group over follow-up.</s><s>Plots present the percentage of substudy participants in each treatment group that are on ART (A) and have a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ribonucleic acid level &lt;400 copies/mL (B) at each visit over follow-up.</s><s>The numbers of participants from each treatment group that attended each study visit are also listed below the x-axis.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,92.48,436.34,409.04,232.51" type="bitmap" /></figure>
