<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements</head><p><s>The study questionnaire is based on existing and validated questionnaires investigating adolescent health behaviour (eg, Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children, HBSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> ; German Children and Youths Survey, KIGGS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s>It includes questions related to sociodemographics, smoking and other health behaviours, such as alcohol consumption, nutrition, PA and ST, as well as height and weight.</s><s>It took about 30-40 min to complete the questionnaire.</s><s>Our study group has the status of an associated project of the HBSC.</s></p><p><s>During a first visit to schools, the BEST study was presented to the students by trained research personnel and consent forms were distributed for students and parents/caregivers.</s><s>During the second visit, which took place a few weeks later, baseline data were assessed with the questionnaire in the classroom among children, who had provided both consent forms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome measures</head><p><s>Physical activity PA was assessed using two adapted items of the HBSC questionnaire.</s><s>The first question read: 'On how many days in the past week were you physically active for at least 60 min?'</s><s>According to WHO guidelines, for our primary outcome we defined a student as meeting current guidelines if he or she was active at least 60 min on each of the last 7 days (yes/no). <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref></s><s>The other question asked for the number of hours of moderate intensity PA per week ('How many hours per week are you physically active (any activity that increases your heart rate and makes you get out of breath)?') with examples of such activities.</s><s>This number was divided by seven to obtain the number of hours of PA per day.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screen time</head><p><s>ST was assessed with two questions (also part of the HBSC questionnaire) asking for the time spent each day watching TV or playing with the computer.</s><s>TV time was assessed by asking 'How many hours/day do you usually watch television in your free time?' for weekdays and weekend days separately.</s><s>Computer time (minutes/day) was assessed by asking 'How many hours/day do you usually play games on Open Access a computer, or use a game console in your leisure time?'.</s><s>Total ST was computed by adding up TV and computer time.</s><s>Using a smartphone or tablet was not assessed.</s><s>According to the AAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> recommendations, we defined more than 2 hours of ST per day as high ST.</s></p><p><s>covariates Individual level Sex, age and anthropometric data (height and weight) of the students were assessed via self-report.</s><s>The BMI was calculated using the self-reported data.</s><s>BMI categories are presented using cut-offs defined by the specific percentiles which at age 18 years correspond to the adult cut-off points for underweight (&lt;18.5 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25 kg/m 2 ) and obesity (30 kg/m 2 ).</s><s>According to that definition, underweight is defined as a BMI &lt;10th percentile, normal weight as a BMI between the 10th and the 90th percentile, overweight as a BMI between the 90th and the 97th percentile and obesity as a BMI ≥97th percentile. <ref type="bibr">39 40</ref></s><s>ccording to official definitions, a student was defined as having a migration background if he or she was not born in Germany or if at least one parent was not born in Germany but moved to Germany after 1949. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref></s><s>dividual SES To assess the individual SES of the student, we used the Family Affluence Scale (FAS), a validated instrument to assess the material affluence of the family asking for the number of cars and computers in the family, for holidays during the past 12 months, and whether the child has its own room. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref></s><s>The FAS consists of values from 0 to 7, with higher values indicating higher affluence, and can be categorised into three categories (low (0-3), moderate (4-5) and high affluence(6-7).</s><s>The FAS was completely assessed only at the 24 months follow-up, we therefore used the 24 months follow-up FAS to describe family SES at baseline.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open Access</head><p><s>The neighbourhood SES represents the social and health indicators of a city or of its districts, including unemployment rate, welfare reception rate, average per capita income and others.</s><s>In our study, students living in low SES neighbourhood areas were more likely to be physically active than those with middle or high neighbourhood SES.</s><s>To a certain extent, this is surprising and in contrast to many earlier studies that have reported mostly no or inverse associations between neighbourhood SES and PA. <ref type="bibr">28 56-59</ref></s><s>However, as suggested in an earlier study the observed finding in our study may be related to higher active transportation among adolescents of families with lower SES because they may be less likely to own a car resulting in more students using the bicycle or public transportation to school. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref></s><s>Similar to individual SES, another explication could be that the major part of PA among adolescents consists of unstructured activities rather than organised team sports. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref></s><s>Thus, a membership in a sports club (which is less probable in neighbourhoods with lower SES) would not affect the overall amount of PA.</s></p><p><s>Low and middle neighbourhood SES were also associated with higher ST compared with high neighbourhood SES.</s><s>This result is in line with a study by Carson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> Neighbourhood safety, as suggested by Carson et al, may be one possible explanation for this finding.</s><s>In addition, the lack of suitable and well-maintained recreation facilities could lead to more ST as replacement of other leisure time activities.</s><s>In contrast to our results, many studies investigating neighbourhood SES and its association with sedentary behaviour reported null results as shown in a recent review by Stierlin et al, suggesting that other factors may be more important than neighbourhood SES in the context of adolescents' sedentary behaviour. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s>Possible reasons for these differences between findings may be related to different study populations across individual studies but also the fact that our study only focused on ST instead of total sedentary behaviour.</s><s>Screen viewing as a health behaviour has not been investigated widely in the context of individual and neighbourhood SES, but it appears that in Berlin it is more closely linked with these factors than PA.</s><s>Hence, promoting alternative activity opportunities for adolescents living in lower SES neighbourhoods could be a worthwhile target for interventions.</s><s>In the context of the existing literature, it would be useful to also investigate total sedentary behaviour in future German studies.</s></p><p><s>In addition to individual and neighbourhood SES, school level factors play a role in the health behaviour of school children. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref></s><s>Moore and Littlecott found that school level affluence was independently associated with health behaviours (except PA) of the school students after adjusting for the individual SES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref></s><s>When additionally including school type and school neighbourhood SES as covariates in our analysis, presented results for PA and ST were attenuated somewhat and neighbourhood SES was no longer independently associated with PA and ST, indicating the potentially important role of school type and school neighbourhood SES on PA and ST.</s></p><p><s>A possible explanation for this finding could be that adolescents living in areas with lower neighbourhood SES are more often attending an integrated secondary school which has been shown in table 1b.</s><s>Since the academic standards of integrated secondary schools tend to be lower than those of high schools, it is possible that students of the first-mentioned have more leisure time than those of the latter. <ref type="bibr">64 65</ref></s><s>ome studies found that the school socioeconomic environment, that is, social networks and peer influences had a greater effect on health behaviour among adolescents than the individual SES. <ref type="bibr">63 66</ref></s><s>This illustrates the complex interplay of individual SES, neighbourhood SES and the school environment (school type and school neighbourhood SES), that may also be affected by parental choice of schools and other parental influences on school activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67</ref></s><s>A recent study from the UK has provided some further evidence for these complex relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref></s><s>tudies from Germany have also shown that the neighbourhood SES as well as the SES of the students tends to be correlated with the school type. <ref type="bibr">68</ref></s><s>Better educated parents tend to send their children to high schools rather than integrated secondary schools, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> which could imply that it is the school type itself influencing PA and ST, and the social environment of the student.</s><s>But even if the choice of the school type is done by the parents and is influenced by their SES, targeting integrated secondary schools may be important and could be emphasised more in health promotion activities.</s><s>It appears that this may help to address the issue of individual SES on the one hand (more children with low SES in secondary schools) but also neighbourhood SES on the other hand.</s><s>Further research is needed to disentangle these complex relationships between individual and neighbourhood SES, as well as school environment.</s><s>With additional research it could be investigated if some neighbourhoods might benefit more from ST-related activities, while others might benefit more from PA-related activities.</s><s>The aim should be the ability to target the content of health promotion activities according to school type and neighbourhood to meet greatest needs.</s></p><p><s>In addition to individual and neighbourhood SES, other factors like the built environment (ie, number of public transport stops, residential density, intersection density and the number of parks) could also play an important role in adolescents' health behaviours. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref></s><s>These factors may be mediators of the observed associations, but studies have also suggested that associations may be moderated by the built environment (studies have shown that individuals with low neighbourhood SES had a greater benefit of good walkability than
