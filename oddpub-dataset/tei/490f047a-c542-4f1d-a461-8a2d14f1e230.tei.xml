parameter show that the radicalization of 4b-OH, 11b-OH hydroxyls and 4a-OH of Vam3, requires almost the same amount of energy, in both solvents.</s><s>However, the water facilitates the -OH cleavage.</s><s>In fact, in this last medium we get lower values of 22-23 kcal/mol.</s><s>Despite the absence of charged species in the radicalization processes, this relevant difference can be explained by the presence of many polar groups on the Vam3 that inevitably resents the polarity of the medium.</s></p><p><s>The similarity of the BDE values suggests that there is no significant difference in radical-scavenger activity between the three hydroxyl groups 4a-OH, 4b-OH and 11b-OH.</s><s>For a more reliable comparison with the available literature data, our BDE value corresponding to the more stable radical of Vam3 (Vam3-O_4b•) was redone in terms of ∆H.</s><s>We have obtained the value of 75.1 kcal/mol in the apolar solvent and 52.5 kcal/mol in water.</s><s>In a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> on trans and cis resveratrol and some their derivatives, the computation performed at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) level in methanol indicated BDE values of 72.1 (trans-resveratrol) and 74.7 kcal/mol (cis-resveratrol).</s><s>In two previous gas-phase B3LYP/6-311++G** investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> the BDE of resveratrol was estimated to be 77.3 and 77.8 kcal/mol, respectively.</s><s>Instead, the value of 76.9 kcal/mol was obtained using a gas-phase B3LYP/6-31G computational approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taking into account the different basis set used in these investigations and that most of the data was obtained in the gaseous phase, all BDE available values are in any case slightly higher than those calculated for Vam3 in both solvents.</s><s>Thus it is possible to hypothesize that Vam3 can act as a potent antioxidant with at least similar effectiveness than resveratrol and many other phenolic compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The IP, adiabatic ionization potential, stands for the difficulty to extract an electron from neutral Vam3.</s><s>Looking at the spin distribution of Vam3-O + • in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, it is quite likely that the stripped electron belonged to one of the three 4b-OH, 11b-OH or 4a-OH hydroxyls because only in these cases we can have a good delocalization.</s></p><p><s>As for the IP values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, there is a substantial difference between the values in the two media due to greater stabilization of a charged species in solvents with high polarity.</s></p><p><s>The PDE, proton dissociation energy, is related to the difficulty for a hydroxyl radical cation of Vam3 to lose the proton with generating the corresponding radical.</s><s>The PDE values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, say that the process concerning the loss of proton is more favorable for the usual three hydroxyls and slightly less easy in the apolar medium.</s><s>Part of solvent effects difference derives from the proton free energy values, which are quite different in the two considered media <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As already mentioned, SET-PT is a stepwise mechanism.</s><s>The energy required to accomplish the whole SET-PT reaction is equal to the sum of IP and PDE.</s><s>The first step alone requires an energy equal to the IP that however, is already about 50 and 25 kcal/mol higher than the BDE values, depending on the considered solvent.</s><s>This is sufficient to say that the HAT mechanism seems, at least from the thermodynamic point of view, favorable with respect to SET-PT.</s></p><p><s>The difficulty for neutral Vam3 hydroxyl to lose the proton for generating the corresponding anion is measured by the PA values.</s></p><p><s>As expected, the solvent effects are significant for PAs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>), since in this process are involved charged species, anion and proton.</s><s>The different stabilization of anions and the difference of the values of G(H + ) in the two considered solvents determines the big gap between the two set of PA values, thus, if we are in water, deprotonation of Vam3 appears to be a very low-cost energy process for all hydroxyl groups.</s></p><p><s>To extract an electron from a Vam3 anion in order to generate the corresponding radical an amount of energy equal to electron transfer free energy (ETE) is necessary.</s><s>The values in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> for this parameter, suggest the energetic requirement for radicalizing the anions increases in going from apolar to polar solvent.</s><s>In water, the ETE values are comparable with IP.</s><s>This means that extracting an electron from the neutral species or anions of Vam3 does not entail much difference.</s></p><p><s>As SET-PT, SPLET is a stepwise mechanism.</s><s>The amount of energy required for the whole process corresponds to the sum of PAs and ETEs.</s><s>If we compare the amount of energy required for HAT and that individually required for each step of SPLET mechanisms, it is concluded that they could be competitive.</s><s>More information on the mechanism used by the antioxidant Vam3 against the hydroperoxyl free radical, can be obtained evaluating the ∆G of the reactions involved in HAT, SET-PT and SPLET processes.</s><s>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> we have reported the Gibbs free energies values (∆G) for these reactions   Data suggest that, in an apolar solvent, which better simulates the work environment of antioxidants, the HAT mechanism is the favored one because the first step of both SPLET and SET-PT is strongly endergonic.</s><s>In water, despite the first two steps are in any case endergonic processes, the energies at stake are overall less prohibitive than those required in the apolar environment making all the three working mechanisms probable.</s></p><p><s>More founded conclusions could be drawn by studying the entire course of the HAT process by evaluating the activation energies (∆G ‡ ) required to complete the transfer of the hydrogen atom from the antioxidant to the •OOH free radical.</s></p><p><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref> we report the potential energy profiles obtained in the apolar and in water for the reaction of Vam3 with •OOH.</s><s>Computations indicate that, in order to transfer hydrogen atom from 4a−OH, 4b−OH or 11b−OH to free radical, we have to spend 7.5-8.2</s><s>kcal/mol in the non-polar solvent and 12.7-12.9</s><s>kcal/mol in water.</s><s>This means the process is quite easy and this is a further support to the hypothesis that the HAT mechanism is favored over the others, especially in an apolar medium.</s><s>Given the structural similarity of Vam3 with resveratrol, the present result is also supported by a previous DFT investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> in which is found that the •OOH scavenging activity of trans-resveratrol occurs by HAT.</s><s>Moreover, in a previous theoretical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, it was found that some resveratrol derivatives act through the HAT mechanism because of the higher energies involved to form radical cations which prevents to follow the single electron transfer (SET) pathway.</s><s>In water, we have found eight possible adducts formed mainly with the carbon atoms of the rings C and D where there is a good conjugate system and that is the part shared by Vam3 with resveratrol.</s><s>Again, as has been done for the HAT mechanism, the activation energies (ΔG ‡ ) for all processes providing negative ΔG values have been calculated and reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>.</s><s>As can be observed, although the formation of the adducts examined is thermodynamically feasible, the reaction barriers are quite high and such as to prevent it from actually happening.</s><s>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>, we report optimized geometries of transition states lying on the PESs of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>.</s><s>In a RAF mechanism •OOH free radical can bind to the carbon atoms of Vam3 to form the so called radical adducts.</s><s>In Table <ref type="table">3</ref> we have collected the reaction Gibbs free energy values obtained considering all the attack positions for •OOH free radical on Vam3.</s><s>In the apolar solvent the reaction appears to be endergonic in all cases except for the adduct formed on the C 11a (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In water, we have found eight possible adducts formed mainly with the carbon atoms of the rings C and D where there is a good conjugate system and that is the part shared by Vam3 with resveratrol.</s><s>Again, as has been done for the HAT mechanism, the activation energies (∆G ‡ ) for all processes providing negative ∆G values have been calculated and reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>.</s><s>As can be observed, although the formation of the adducts examined is thermodynamically feasible, the reaction barriers are quite

been calculated and reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>.</s><s>As can be observed, although the formation of the adducts examined is thermodynamically feasible, the reaction barriers are quite high and such as to prevent it from actually happening.</s><s>In an experimental work on the antioxidant properties of trans-resveratrol against superoxide anion and hydroxyl free radicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, it was observed the formation of two main radical adducts which then forms another one.</s><s>In the first adduct, hydroxyl radical add in ortho position to the hydroxyl group of the phenol moiety because of its π-donor effect.</s><s>In the second one, the hydroxyl adds to the aliphatic double bond generating a carbon-centred radical which is stabilized by resonance effects extending to the whole phenol moiety.</s></p><p><s>As can be noted (see Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), also our computations indicate that it is thermodynamically possible to obtain radical adducts on the two analogous attack positions on Vam3 (12b and 7b/8b), but the corresponding activation barriers (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>) are very high, which makes us exclude the RAF mechanism.</s><s>Since in Vam3 the attack positions for the formation of the radical adducts lying in the portion of resveratrol are exposed externally and that in any case the presence of the ring E does not imply problems for the effects of resonance and conjugation, the reason for this apparent disagreement can be ascribed to the different reactivity of the hydroperoxyl compared to the hydroxyl radical.</s><s>In fact, as it occurs in the work above cited <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, adducts are formed with the hydroxyl and not with the less reactive superoxide anion radical.</s><s>Moreover, this explanation is supported also by the results of a systematic study of the reactivity of trans-resveratrol toward hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals in aqueous simulated media performed at density functional level <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> in which authors establish that •OH scavenging activity of trans-resveratrol takes place predominantly by a RAF mechanism while the •OOH scavenging activity of trans-resveratrol takes place almost exclusively by HAT.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p><s>A density functional-based investigation of the HAT, SET-PT, SPLET and RAF antioxidative mechanisms of Vam3, a natural product isolated from Vitis Amurensis Rupr.</s><s>structurally similar to resveratrol, was performed, by examining its chemical behavior towards •OOH free radical chosen as target in an apolar and a polar (water) solvent.</s><s>Our results indicated that:</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p><s>Atom transfer seems to be the most probable mechanism followed by Vam3 in its action of radical scavenger especially in an apolar solvent due to the fact that the first step of both the SPLET and SET-PT pathways appears to be strongly endergonic.</s><s>The height of activation barriers computed for the hydrogen atom transfer to the •OOH free radical are quite low, and reinforce this hypothesis.</s><s>In water, all three working mechanisms are probable because, although the first two steps of SET-PT and SPLET are in any case endergonic processes, the energies at stake are less prohibitive than those required in a lipid-like environment.</s></p></div>
