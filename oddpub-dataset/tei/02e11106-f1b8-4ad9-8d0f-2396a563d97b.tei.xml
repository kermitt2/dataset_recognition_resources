reward related overconsumption of highly palatable, energy dense foods beyond homeostatic needs is considered a central aspect in the multifactorial pathogenesis of obesity and its accompanying metabolic distortions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Dysfunctional information flow of cortico-striatal networks involved in metabolic regulation as well as reward processing has been suggested to be of importance for the pathophysiology of obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>The limbic cortico-basal ganglia loop plays a central role in the brains reward circuitry that is responsible for the processing of reward related aspects of food consumption and it is intricately interconnected with hypothalamic midbrain areas that regulate the organism's homeostatic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>In addition, peripheral hormones like insulin, leptin and ghrelin have been shown to modulate neuronal function within the basal ganglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>In the context of obesity, multiple functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated cortical and striatal areas show profound differences between lean and obese individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>In obese participants an enhanced activation during food anticipation accompanied by a decreased activation during food reward receipt was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>It has been hypothesized that a central aspect of obesity might be an altered reward processing in the cortico-basal ganglia network similar to what has been found in models of addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Thus, the controversial concept of obesity being a disorder based on food addiction has been postulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>In line with this, obesity could be regarded as another neuropsychiatric brain circuit disorder similar to addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder or Parkinson's disease, which is supported by recent progress in the molecular and optogenetic dissection of the neurocircuitry involved in the regulation of food intake and metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>The etiologies of circuit dysfunction are multivarious including damage of specific neuronal pathways, loss of individual neuronal populations and aberrant functional activity characterized by pathological oscillatory activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>While a number of these aspects like impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> or neuronal injury due to hypothalamic inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> have been addressed in the context of obesity, the question of whether aberrant network activity occurs in the involved neuronal circuits has not been clarified.</s><s>To address this important question we aimed to characterize information processing in the limbic cortico-basal ganglia loop by simultaneous multi-site local field potential (LFP) recordings.</s><s>LFPs are extracellular signals that are primarily generated by the summed activity of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials within groups of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Due to their biophysical properties LFPs pose an opportunity to characterize the coordination of neuronal population activity within a defined network <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Recent cumulative evidence suggests that oscillations are of paramount importance for interneuronal communication in small-and large-scale neuronal networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> with oscillations at different frequencies subserving different functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore the coherence of oscillatory signals between different brain areas has been proposed as a marker of functional connectivity that regulates neuronal communication through selective synchronization of neuronal populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>The term oscillatory signaling as it is used here refers to the general description of the power and coherence of oscillatory LFPs within and between specific neuronal target areas.</s><s>Recent studies on human patients suffering from debilitating neuropsychiatric diseases such as Parkinson´s disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression have demonstrated a close relation between altered oscillations at specific frequencies and disease symptoms, suggesting a causal relation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</s><s>In the current study, we performed parallel in vivo-electrophysiological recordings of LFPs under urethane anesthesia from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) at baseline and during a standardized intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test.</s><s>We demonstrate that HFD induced obesity is characterized by an increase of beta oscillatory power in the limbic cortico-basal ganglia loop that is most pronounced in the NAC and accompanied by a decreased coherence in the beta frequency band between the NAC and the mPFC.</s><s>NAC beta activity is highly correlated to diet-induced elevations of insulin and leptin levels at baseline while showing a differential group-dependent response towards a systemic glucose challenge.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the current study we followed a systematic combined approach of endocrinological testing and characterization of the neuronal network activity in a rat model of obesity.</s><s>Based on the idea of a circuit disorder with abnormal reward processing in diet induced obesity we explored oscillatory LFP activity within the limbic circuit of the cortico-basal ganglia loop before and during a systemic glucose challenge.</s><s>Our main findings are: 1.) A distinct peak in the low beta frequency band was found in the nucleus accumbens of the animals that received a high fat diet for 4 weeks.</s><s>2.) Beta power correlated with body weight and serum leptin as well as insulin levels at baseline pointing to an association between central beta activity and peripheral metabolic parameters.</s><s>3.) Beta power increased in controls during a defined i.p.-glucose challenge but no further increase occurred in animals pretreated with a high fat diet.</s><s>4.) Cortico-subcortical beta band coherence between the mPFC and the NAC as well as the mPFC and the VTA was reduced in the HFD groups and was differentially modulated after the systemic glucose application.</s><s>Oscillatory brain activity has only rarely been studied in the context of obesity.</s><s>In a magnetoencephalographic (MEG) study with obese and lean humans it could be demonstrated that cortical beta activity can be increased by insulin in lean subjects but not in obese patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>This study is partly in line with what we could show in our data set and underscores the hypothesis that insulin might play an important role in the context of hormonal and possibly disease related modulation of brain rhythms.</s><s>In a recent EEG study elevated cortical beta activity was identified in overweight women depicting a linear relationship between relative beta band power and body fat mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>While MEG/EEG-based approaches are limited to the analysis of cortical activity, invasive recording approaches allow the assessment of subcortical components of the cortico-striatal system.</s><s>Utilizing this invasive approach gamma oscillations have been identified to organize top-down signaling to the hypothalamus enabling food seeking behavior in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Our data show a more pronounced alteration of oscillatory activity in the NAC compared to mPFC suggesting a pivotal role of subcortical areas for the generation of oscillatory signaling.</s><s>Based on the well investigated role of insulin as a brain satiety signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> interfering with dopaminergic neurotransmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> and the discovery of exaggerated beta oscillatory activity in the dopamine depleted basal ganglia system of parkinsonian patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , it is tempting to formulate the hypothesis that beta oscillatory activity and coherence in obesity might constitute a relevant modality of reward regulation through central insulin signaling.</s><s>To investigate the potential role of brain insulin signaling in this context, we performed an additional set of experiments evaluating the change of NAC beta oscillatory power following a direct insulin injection in the third ventricle.</s><s>This approach of delivering  insulin directly into the brain has been used in a number of animal studies to explore central insulin action as a satiety signal in discrimination to its glucose lowering effect in the periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>While the potential of brain insulin signaling to lower food intake is well established, in a recent animal study it has been demonstrated that the action of appetite suppressant drugs is mediated by dopaminergic signaling and associated with changes in beta, theta and delta band LFP oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>The results of our experiments show that central insulin application induced an increase in NAC beta oscillations.</s><s>The frequency peaks of this increased beta oscillatory activity vary between systemic glucose and i.c.v.</s><s>insulin application, potentially indication that insulin is relevant but not the only factor mediating this effect.</s><s>Since we are at this point unable to address the question of what increased beta oscillatory signaling means for neuronal computation in obesity, it is interesting to consider what is known from other contexts.</s><s>Data from animal and human studies in various fields led to the formulation of the hypothesis that beta band activity has a primary role in health and disease.</s><s>On the one hand, under physiological conditions beta oscillations seem to promote the maintenance of the current sensorimotor or cognitive state <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>On the other hand increased beta activity is associated with a pathological persistence of the current sensorimotor state, which might directly result in the disease symptoms in PD that are characterized by a lack of movement and problems in initiating movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Since these investigations on oscillatory activity have given rise to a number of promising novel neuromodulatory approaches like closed-loop deep brain stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> or patterned transcranial stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , a further characterization of oscillatory network activity could help to facilitate the development of novel therapies for obesity.</s><s>In fact preclinical and clinical studies on DBS in obesity have brought first evidence that this therapy might be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Our experimental design comes with a number of relevant limitations.</s><s>A drawback is that we have conducted our experiments under general anesthesia with urethane.</s><s>Urethane like almost all general anesthetics has been described to have an impact on various hormone levels especially with respect to the glucose metabolism.</s><s>Systemic administration of urethane leads to a sympathetic response with release of insulin antagonistic hormones inducing a raise of glucose values and an attenuation of insulin's capacity to lower serum glucose levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>These effects can clearly be recognized in the metabolic characterization of the animals investigated in our experiment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>While the rather constant increase in blood glucose and insulin levels after the systemic challenge facilitates the analysis of oscillatory activity with respect to metabolic parameter, it exemplifies the non-physiologic condition of the used approach.</s><s>Nevertheless, the relative differences between the groups match the expected metabolic changes following a 4 week high fat diet feeding in terms of an up to 20% increase in body weight, accompanied by an impaired glucose tolerance in the GTT as measured by AUC glucose and insulin levels without manifestation of a different baseline glucose level.</s><s>Despite that, the usage of urethane anesthesia has a number of essential advantages for testing the hypothesis of a potential neuro-endocrine interaction.</s><s>It produces a stable and long lasting anesthesia that allows performing electrophysiological experiments for hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>It is therefore possible to record and analyze signals that are not compromised by sensory stimuli (e.g.</s><s>pain and stress during blood sampling) and specific behaviors with respect to metabolic alterations.</s><s>The two very well defined cortical activation states -slow wave activity (SWA) and activated state (AS) -occur spontaneously under urethane anesthesia.</s><s>While the SWA state resembles cortical activity during natural sleep, the AS shows many characteristics of brain activity patterns that can be found in awake and attentive individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>Admittedly, as an AS might resemble some characteristics of the awake state, it is not identical to it and specific neuronal responses can substantial vary when comparing urethane versus awake recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless the careful analysis of thesetwo stereotypic cortical activation states -slow wave activity (SWA) and activated state (AS) -secures a high level of comparability between recordings in different animals and therefore diminishes interindividual variations that can lower the sensitivity for the detection of differences between experimental groups.</s><s>Urethane leaves neurotransmission in subcortical areas and in the peripheral nervous system relatively unaffected, which is why it is a suitable anesthetic to study basal ganglia function and cortico-basal ganglia interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>The electrophysiological phenotypes that can be detected under urethane anesthesia have been reproduced in awake recordings in numerous cases making the approach a widely used method for preclinical research despite the limitations associated with the application of general anesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> .</s><s>In this regard, it is important to note that we have found no indication of an overall difference in oscillatory brain activity under urethane anesthesia between the groups of animals.</s><s>By comparing the amplitude of low frequency oscillations (0-2 Hz), that signals the depth of the anesthesia, we can exclude that this might be an alternative explanation for the observed phenotype.</s><s>Accordingly, even when adjusting for frontal slow wave activity as well as the animal's body weight and the measurement time the highly significant association between baseline insulin levels and baseline NAC beta peak power persisted in a linear regression model.</s><s>Another limitation of the present study is that we were not able to quantify cerebral insulin levels, which might be of importance to differentiate its effect on beta activity especially against the background of the potential relation between transport of insulin into the CSF to peripheral insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s><s>While beta oscillatory activity and coherence clearly differentiate between the two groups our investigation does not allow to clarify if obesity itself, high fat diet exposure or insulin resistance are the main drives behind the observed different electrophysiological patterns.</s><s>In summary, the exploration of metabolic processes under a general urethane anesthesia comes with a number of limitations but it might offer the specific opportunity to explore an interaction between endocrine parameters and default-state network activity.</s><s>We therefore propose the combined approach of endocrinological testing and analysis of default-state oscillatory signaling as novel complementary approach to explore neurohumoral interaction.</s></p></div>
