<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Tobacco companies are increasingly relying on price-manipulating strategies to promote cigarette sales including price discounting, coupons and direct mail marketing.</s><s>According to the Federal Trade Commission, retailer and wholesaler price discounts, coupons and direct mail marketing comprised 86% of the total cigarette advertising and promotion expenditures in 2014, compared with 68% in 2002. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In 2014, tobacco companies spent US$567 million on direct mail and coupons.</s><s>While it is a relatively small proportion of the total expenditure (7%), many adults in the US reporting exposure to these direct-to-consumer marketing strategies.</s><s>For example, data from the 2001 New Jersey Adult Tobacco Survey showed that 11% of never/former smokers, 22% of recent quitters, and 35% of current smokers reported receiving tobacco direct mail materials during the 6 months prior to the survey. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>More recently, 49% of a representative sample of smokers in Minnesota reported receiving cigarette discount coupons in the past 12 months in 2009. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>Among young adults, one study found that 17% of 18-23 year-olds in the US reported ever receiving tobacco direct mail marketing materials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> while another study found that 25% of 18-34 years-old in the US reported receiving tobacco direct mail in the past 6 months. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>ased on internal documents from the tobacco industry, these price-manipulating strategies are designed to build relationships with smokers and influence their smoking behavior, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and to offset tobacco tax increases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>There is some evidence that such strategies are achieving these expected influences on smoking behavior.</s><s>In a longitudinal study among Minnesota young adults (aged 22-28 years), young adult nonsmokers who received cigarette direct mail coupons were more likely than young adult nonsmokers who did not receive these coupons to become current smokers a year later. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>he same study also found that current young adult smokers who received cigarette direct mail coupons were more likely than current young adult smokers who did not received these coupons to continue cigarette smoking a year later.</s></p><p><s>There is also evidence that certain price-manipulating strategies are being targeted at vulnerable populations, which could widen tobacco-related health disparities in priority populations including young adults, racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status (e.g., lower income and education levels).</s><s>For instance, among a cohort of Minnesota young adults aged 20-28 years, receipt of tobacco direct mail and cigarette coupons was more prevalent among those with less than high school education compared with those who completed college. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Tobacco companies' internal documents revealed a long history of strategies for at least four decades to target women from low socioeconomic status and racial minority populations by utilizing discount coupons with food stamps, providing discount offers at point-of-sale or through direct mailing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Availability of lower priced cigarettes is associated with increased cigarette consumption and reduced smoking cessation rates which disproportionately affects smokers from lower-income populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>owever, while the overall impact of lower cigarette prices on smoking behaviors have been previously examined, the current literature on direct mail coupons as a specific marketing strategy and their effects on smoking behavior is limited.</s><s>First, no national studies to date have examined the prevalence of exposure to tobacco direct mail coupons among US adults, and the characteristics associated with the exposure.</s><s>Second, only one longitudinal study assessed the association between exposure to tobacco direct mail coupons and subsequent smoking behaviors among Minnesota young adults; 8 the effect of tobacco direct mail coupons on smoking behavior among US adults has not been reported.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we analyzed the data from the US Population Assessment on Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study adult sample to address the above-mentioned knowledge gaps.</s><s>Specifically, we examined the prevalence of receiving tobacco direct mail coupons and sociodemographic characteristics associated with receiving these coupons.</s><s>We also assessed whether receiving tobacco direct mail coupons was associated with progression to current smoking among nonsmokers, and continuation of smoking among current smokers.</s><s>We further analyzed whether current smokers who received tobacco direct mail coupons were more likely to progress to or continue with daily smoking compared with those who did not receive direct mail coupons.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our analysis represents the first US national study to examine the prevalence and correlates of receiving tobacco direct mail marketing among adults, its targeted populations, potential influences on promoting progression of smoking among nonsmokers and continuation of smoking among current smokers.</s><s>Our analysis reveals the extensive reach of tobacco direct mail marketing in the US population; over 21 million adult nonsmokers and 17 million adult current smokers are estimated to be exposed to this marketing strategy.</s><s>Receipt of these direct mail marketing materials was disproportionately more prevalent among certain populations that experience greater tobaccorelated health disparities.</s><s>For example, we found that individuals with lower education and those closer to poverty line, regardless of their smoking status, were more likely to report receiving tobacco direct mail/email coupons.</s><s>This corroborates tobacco industry documents indicating tobacco companies are targeting these populations when promoting their products, which coincides with the higher prevalence of tobacco use in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations than the general population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>The finding that female current smokers were more likely than male current smokers to receive tobacco direct mail coupons is supported by a previous US regional study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>This gender difference may be due, in part, to women being more likely than men to use coupons generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and the tobacco industry's targeted distribution of discount coupons to women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>e observed that exposure to tobacco direct mail coupons is associated with progression of smoking among nonsmokers.</s><s>This finding supports that of a previous longitudinal studies among young adults in Minnesota. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>We further explored whether the association could be explained by nonsmokers at T0 became current smokers between T0 and T1 and sought these coupons prior to T1.</s><s>The PATH Study collected information on whether participants had signed up for email alerts about tobacco products, read articles online about tobacco products, or watched a video online about tobacco products during the 6 months prior to the survey.</s><s>We found that among nonsmokers at T0 who became current smokers at T1, only 6.0% responded that they had engaged in these activities.</s><s>Therefore, it is unlikely that coupon seeking behavior occurring after becoming a current smoker fully explain the association.</s><s>Future longitudinal studies need to be carefully designed to collect data at the appropriate intervals to fully disentangle the temporal relationships between exposure to tobacco direct mail coupons and changes in smoking behaviors.</s><s>Nonetheless, marketing theory suggest that coupons lower the cost of experimentation with a product (in this case, cigarettes) and are therefore capable of promoting product experimentation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>e found that exposure to tobacco direct mail coupons is associated with continuation of smoking among current smokers, and increasing to/sustaining daily smoking.</s><s>Cost of smoking has been reported by smokers as one of the most common reasons to quit smoking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Through manipulating cigarette prices via discount coupons, tobacco companies are able to promote smoking, and discourage cessation and reduction, particularly among smokers from lower socioeconomic positions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Therefore, interventions to reduce the exposure to tobacco direct mail coupons (e.g., prohibit distribution of discount coupons for tobacco products) and/or to reduce the impact of this marketing strategy on smoking behavior (e.g., prohibit redemption of discount coupons for tobacco products) could be beneficial to the public, especially among individuals from lower socioeconomic positions.</s></p><p><s>Our analysis has several limitations.</s><s>First, while we were able to reconstruct participants' smoking status at 12 months prior to the survey (T0), we were unable to distinguish former smokers, never smokers, and experimenters (those who smoked &lt;100 cigarettes in a lifetime) at T0. Therefore, we were unable to test if receipt of tobacco direct mail coupons is associated with smoking initiation and relapse.</s><s>We performed a sensitivity analysis to examine the association between receiving coupons and progression to smoking among nonsmokers at T0 who never smoked &gt;100 cigarettes in a lifetime at T1, and found that the regression estimate was substantially similar to the original analyses.</s><s>Meanwhile, participants' smoking frequency at T0 was not measured, and therefore could not be controlled for in the analysis.</s><s>Second, because the timing of exposure to these coupons and smoking behaviors were not measured, the temporal sequence of receiving tobacco direct mail coupons and smoking behavior at T1 is ambiguous.</s><s>However, the relationship between receipt of tobacco direct mail coupons and smoking behaviors could be reciprocal that exposure to these coupons leads to progression or continuation of smoking behaviors which subsequently leads to seeking and receiving more of these coupons.</s><s>In such a scenario, the concept of singular temporality may not apply.</s><s>Third, the PATH study did not ask about the type of tobacco products promoted by these coupons, although previous studies showed that most of them were for cigarettes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>n conclusion, our analysis provides new insights into the potential impact of tobacco direct mail coupons on progression and continuation of cigarette smoking on a national scale, particularly among disadvantaged populations.</s><s>In sum, we found that direct mail tobacco coupons may promote progression of smoking among nonsmokers and continuation of smoking among smokers in a nationally representative US adult population.</s><s>These findings will provide the rationale for more restrictive policies to curtail tobacco direct-to-consumer marketing strategies including mailed/emailed discount coupons and health promotion interventions to reduce or eliminate practices that potentially widen tobacco-related health disparities in priority populations.</s></p></div><figure
