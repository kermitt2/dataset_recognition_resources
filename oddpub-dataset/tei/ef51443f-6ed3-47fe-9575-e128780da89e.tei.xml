<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of the vitreomacular interface</head><p><s>SD-OCT scans were used to obtain data on central retinal thickness (CRT) values.</s><s>The CRT was computed automatically using built-in retinal mapping software.</s><s>SD-OCT video clips (Spectralis OCT; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) from all included patients were evaluated by a senior investigator (NL) masked to clinical findings, including visual acuity and treatments received; the status of the posterior hyaloid and VMI at baseline and at the last follow-up was graded (see below) and recorded.</s></p><p><s>SD-OCT video clips enabled detection of foveal and extrafoveal traction as well as changes outside the central macular area and also differentiation between epiretinal membranes and taut posterior hyaloid.</s><s>The SD-OCT appearance of the inner retinal surface was graded based on the International Vitreomacular Traction Study Group classification of vitreomacular adhesion, traction, and macular hole as follows: (a) normal VMA, (b) VMT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), (c) full-thickness macular hole (FTMH), (d) lamellar macula hole (LMH), (e) epiretinal membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) and (f) combined epiretinal membrane (ERM) and VMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The status of the posterior hyaloid face (PHF) was also graded based on the presence or absence of a PHF attachment as (a) totally attached (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>), (b) partially attached, or (c) fully detached (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) at baseline.</s><s>The occurrence of a partial or complete detachment of the PHF was also recorded at the last follow-up visit.</s><s>The number of images with insufficient quality for grading as well as those in which determining the status of the PHF was not possible was also recorded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>The statistical analysis of the data was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Windows version 21 (SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY).</s><s>The distribution of continuous variables was assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the transformation was performed, if necessary, to achieve normal distribution.</s><s>Categorical variables were compared using Pearson's chi-square test.</s><s>Continuous variables were compared using the independent samples t test.</s></p><p><s>General estimating equations (GEE) were used to undertake the multivariable regression analysis to enable data from both eyes to be included.</s><s>GEE models account for the correlation between two eyes from one patient.</s><s>A multivariable modelling controlled for age and gender was undertaken.</s><s>A second model was also run controlling for those covariates shown to be significant in the univariate analysis.</s><s>p values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</s></p><p><s>In patients with both eyes meeting eligibility criteria, data from both eyes were used.</s><s>The authors confirm that data collection conformed to the local policy at the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust; this study was registered with the audit department (number 4966).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The study cohort included 146 eyes of 100 consecutive patients with a mean age of 63.5 years at the time of presentation (range 24-88 years).</s><s>One hundred thirty-eight eyes (94.5%) exhibited severe macular oedema, which includes retinal thickening or hard exudates involving the centre of the fovea.</s><s>Eighty-two eyes (56.1%) had no previous macular laser treatment at baseline.</s><s>The descriptive characteristics of the 100 patients (146 eyes) studied are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; examples of the features investigated in the study are depicted in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1  and 2</ref>. Patients were followed up for a mean of 9 months (range 2-14 months).</s><s>Eyes were treated with ranibizumab only (i.e.</s><s>no other anti-VEGFs used) during this period.</s><s>9/ 146 eyes were lost to follow-up before month 6.</s><s>The number of injections per month of follow-up was 0.8 (SD 0.3).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors associated with VMIA at baseline</head><p><s>Signs of VMIA were detected in 28 eyes (18.5%); 19 of these (70%) had an ERM, 8 (28.5%) had VMT and one (0.5%) had both VMT and ERM.</s><s>A statistically significant difference in mean BCVA was observed between patients with and without VMIA, with patients with VMIA having worse vision (45 ETDRS letters in eyes with VMIA compared to 55 ETDRS letters in eyes without VMIA; p = 0.007).</s><s>Eyes with VMIA were more likely to have undergone panretinal photocoagulation but less likely to have had macular laser than eyes without VMIA (p = 0.006).</s><s>There was no association between CRT at presentation and the presence of VMIA.</s><s>A higher proportion of patients with VMIA had undergone cataract surgery (p = 0.01).</s><s>There was no association between the presence of VMIA and the duration of diabetes, HbA1C level, history of hypertension or kidney disease.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Presence of VMIA at baseline and treatment outcomes</head><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> shows the results of the multivariable regression analysis undertaken to evaluate associations between the presence of VMIA at baseline and treatment outcomes adjusted for age, gender, retinopathy stage at baseline and history of previous cataract surgery or laser therapy.</s><s>No statistically significant associations between the presence of VMIA at baseline and outcomes following ranibizumab treatment, including the   change in BCVA or CRT from the baseline to the last followup, and the presence or absence of fluid at the macula at the last follow-up were identified.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development/resolution of VMIA during the follow-up</head><p><s>In this series, no eyes developed VMIA or had resolution of pre-existing VMIA during the follow-up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors associated with the change in the posterior hyaloid interface during follow-up</head><p><s>Partial or complete detachment of the posterior hyaloid interface was observed in 22 eyes during the follow-up (15%).</s><s>A history of kidney disease (p = 0.019) was the only factor found to be statistically significantly associated with this occurrence.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment outcomes and changes in the posterior hyaloid surface during follow-up</head><p><s>Multivariable regression analysis did not reveal any statistically significant difference between detachment of the posterior hyaloid during follow-up and change in BCVA, number of injections per month, changes in CRT and status of macula at follow-up, when corrected for age, gender and history of kidney disease (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>There was an association of borderline significance (p = 0.052) between posterior hyaloid detachment and absence of macular fluid at the last follow-up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the current study, VMIA, as defined by the International Vitreomacular Traction Study Group, were detected in 18.5% of patients with DMO, the majority of these being ERM (70%).</s><s>VMIA were more common in patients that had previously undergone panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) and cataract surgery and less frequent in those that had received macular laser.</s><s>Patients with VMIA presented with lower levels of vision.</s><s>The presence of VMIA at baseline did not dampen the functional (VA) or structural (CRT) response to ranibizumab treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VMIA in patients with DMO</head><p><s>The prevalence of VMIA in patients with DMO identified in this study appears to be within the previously reported range (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>It is lower than that reported in a recently published study, which found an ERM prevalence of 43% in a group of 77 patients (104 eyes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>This study included eyes with higher stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR) at presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Previous PRP was associated with the presence of VMIA.</s><s>ERM formation may occur as a result of laser panretinal photocoagulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>It has also been proposed that PRP induces an angiofibrotic switch by lowering VEGF levels and increasing the ratio of connective tissue growth factor over VEGF, which may subsequently trigger changes in the vitreomacular interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, as PRP is applied to patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a causal relationship between the pathogenic events related to advanced of disease and the occurrence of VMIA cannot be ruled out.</s><s>Interestingly, of those patients with VMIA, only 18% had previously had macular laser when compared with 50% of those without VMIA.</s><s>It is not clear how macular laser could exert this apparent protective effect on the development of VMIA.</s></p><p><s>VMIA were also identified more frequently in patients who had undergone cataract surgery.</s><s>Pseudophakia is associated with an increased incidence of posterior vitreous detachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, epidemiological studies have established a link between ERM and previous cataract surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, and changes in the vitreomacular interface following cataract surgery in otherwise healthy eyes have been documented using OCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that in the context of DR and DMO, inflammation may promote a firmer attachment of the vitreous to the macular area.</s><s>Under these circumstances, it is possible that, following cataract surgery, detachment of the vitreous outside the macula with incomplete separation at the macula would lead to VMIA.</s></p><p><s>Lower visual acuity at presentation was found in patients with VMIA when compared with those without them.</s><s>This agrees with findings of other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s></p></div>
