0.22, two-sided test) evidence of association was found for the other 10 genes.</s><s>In all cases (with the possible exceptions of ABO and 5q33) our estimates of the odds ratio were close to 1 and our 95% CI did not include previous estimates, suggesting, at least for the remaining 8 SNPs (at or near CAMK4, C3orf21, GRIK2, IL6, RGS7, CADM2, MINPP1 and ANKRD20A9P), that our non-replication did not arise solely from lack of power.</s><s>Consistent with our previous reports 4 , we found age-specific and sex-specific effects of the lead SNPs in the APOE and CHRNA3/5 loci.</s><s>For APOE, the hazard ratio (SE) of the lead SNP was 1.07 (.01) for men and 1.13 (.01) for women, whereas for CHRNA3/5 it was 1.07 (.01) for men and 1.04 (.01) for women (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, for APOE, hazard ratios stratified by age were 1.06 (.01) for ages 40−75 and 1.14 (.01) for ages 75+, whereas for CHRNA3/5 they were 1.08 (.01) for 40−75 and 1.03 (.01) for age 75+ (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>), with similar patterns when stratifying by age and sex at the same time, (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>), although the distinctions between men and women for CHRNA3/5 disappeared beyond age 75.</s><s>For LPA, CDKN2B and SH2B3, there was no statistically significant evidence of age-specific or sex-specific effects, while the HLA and FOXO3 variants showed age but not sex-specific effects (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a, b</ref>), with the HLA locus having a greater effect at younger ages (40−75) while, conversely, the FOXO3 locus had greater effect at older ages(75+).</s></p><p><s>We tested the four SNPs identified in the discovery phase (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) for association with other ageing traits, using PhenoScanner 8 , an on-line tool which searches 88 complex trait GWAMAs and three GWAS catalogues.</s><s>For the SNP in the LPA region, associations were found with blood lipids and coronary traits.</s><s>For the SNP in the HLA region, we found associations with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.</s><s>For the CHRNA3/5 region, we found associations with traits which associate with smoking behaviour: nicotine dependence, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and schizophrenia.</s><s>Finally, for the APOE region, we saw associations with Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration, blood lipids, adiposity, cardiac and cognitive ageing traits (Supplementary Data 4).</s></p><p><s>Genetic correlation of complex traits with lifespan.</s><s>We estimated the genetic correlation between 113 complex quantitative and disease susceptibility traits and lifespan using LD Score regression 9 : 46 showed meaningful genetic correlations (rg) with lifespan (statistically significant, |rg| &gt;

(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, Supplementary Data 5).</s><s>We found that the beneficial trait clusters for education and happiness group together, as do a core group of factors (obesity, dyslipidemia/waist-hip ratio (DL/ WHR), type 2 diabetes, CAD and smoking) which show stronger correlation not only to mortality but also among each other, while albuminuria and blood pressure seem to form their own risk cluster.</s><s>We next considered whether and to what extent the observed correlations between mortality and the trait clusters are mediated through other clusters, using partial correlations.</s><s>In most cases, there was relatively little difference between correlations and partial correlations with mortality (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and the direction of effects remained the same.</s><s>On the whole, the correlation of each risk cluster is therefore not mainly mediated via other clusters.</s><s>However, the entire correlation of the DL/WHR cluster with lifespan was 0.41, whereas its partial correlation was −0.18, implying that one or more of the other clusters influenced the genetic correlation, likely CAD with which it is strongly correlated and whose partial correlation did not fall in the same manner.</s><s>Similarly, the entire correlation of the education cluster with lifespan fell from −0.50 to −0.18 as a partial correlation, in this case apparently due to mediation through smoking behaviour.</s><s>Blood pressure and age at menarche also showed reductions in partial rg, to near zero for age at menarche, consistent with mediation by other traits.</s></p><p><s>Causal relationships with lifespan.</s><s>Finally, we used MRbase 10 and further summary statistics for breast cancer (BCAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> ) and C-reactive protein (CHARGE-CRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ) made available to us to  <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> CHARGE P, the p-value for the two-sided test of association between proxy and longlivedness in CHARGE, Dir.</s><s>direction of effect of a1 in CHARGE: " + " means long-livedness increasing, "−" means long-livedness decreasing, Freq.</s><s>frequency, N(000) count (thousands of parents with lifespan and subject genotype information), HR, Hazard Ratio, P p-value for the Wald test of association between imputed dosage for a1 and lifespan, Proxy, the closest proxy SNP in CHARGE, r 2 the linkage disequilibrium between the discovery SNP and its CHARGE proxy, in the 1000 genomes EU panel, SE, Standard Error, Years the number of additional years of lifespan expected for a carrier of one additional copy of a1.</s><s>There are four overlapping cohorts between the two studies; EGCUT, NTR, PROSPER and RS1, but only RS1 contributed cases to the CHARGE: out of all 5406 cases analysed in CHARGE, 892 cases (from RS1) overlapped the 300,000 genotyped subjects studied in discovery and the phenotyped individuals were in any case not the same perform two-sample Mendelian randomisation to investigate causal influences on lifespan.</s><s>Of more than 90 tested phenotypes, seven risk factors (cigarettes smoked per day, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, fasting insulin, systolic blood pressure and CRP) and six disease susceptibilities (Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, CAD, ischaemic stroke, squamous cell lung cancer and type 2 diabetes) significantly associated with mortality (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Smoking causally reduced lifespan by 6.8 years for lifelong smoking of one pack of 20 cigarettes a day, BMI reduced life by 7 months per unit, while education causally increased lifespan by 11 months for each further year spent studying.</s><s>In contrast to the genetic correlations (rg CRP: mortality = 0.35), genetically raised CRP seems to have a life-lengthening effect: 5.5 months of increased lifespan per log mg/L.</s><s>We compared the relative strengths of these different phenotypic effects on lifespan using a measure independent of scale: extrapolating the genetic effects across the interquartile phenotypic range.</s><s>Variation in smoking and systolic blood pressure had the strongest causal life-shortening effects (5.3 and 5.2 years, respectively), followed by fasting insulin, body mass index and CAD, while years of education showed by far the most beneficial effect (4.7 years), when comparing the estimated effect of moving from the first to the third quartile of the phenotype distribution.</s><s>Similarly, we estimate moving from the bottom to the top of the interquartile phenotypic range of CRP increases lifespan by 0.7 years.</s></p></div>

ANKRD20A9P, our findings appear inconsistent with the previous work, suggesting those findings were either false positive associations, or differences in effects are due to the differences between the types of lives studied by us and other studies.</s></p><p><s>The use of different cohorts from a diverse range of countries with common shared ancestry is common in GWAMA and potentially gives rise to heterogeneity in effect sizes, whatever the trait under consideration.</s><s>However, a study of lifespan is perhaps particularly susceptible to such effects, as mean lifespans vary by cohort (Supplementary Data 2) and genetic effects might vary by environment.</s><s>Nonetheless, such heterogeneity is not relevant under the null hypothesis (effect size = 0 in all cohorts) and so will not have induced false positives.</s><s>On the other hand,   heterogeneity may have reduced power and estimated effect sizes should perhaps be considered as (sample-weighted) averages over the cohorts participating.</s><s>The lack of observed genetic correlation between mortality and schizophrenia is perhaps surprising, given the known increased risk of early death due to schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , however, here we study lifespan after the age of 40, where the effect of schizophrenia relative to other causes of mortality is less pronounced.</s><s>We conjecture that a study of early mortality might show a different pattern, but believe the parent-offspring kin-cohort method would be less suitable, as parents would have to survive beyond reproduction to be available for study.</s><s>The albuminuria cluster, which correlated with mortality, is understood to be a consequence of poor glomerular filtration arising from chronic kidney disease, often attributable to diabetes or high blood pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Our finding that the happiness cluster (depressive symptoms and subjective well-being) has a beneficial correlation with lifespan (rg = 0.24), is in line with a recent meta-analysis which has shown a life-lengthening effect of subjective well-being on lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, depression has been shown to increase mortality, and is one of the strongest quality-adjusted life expectancy losses, twice as much as better-studied risk factors such as smoking, heart disease, stroke and diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Our results thus reinforce the importance of public policy focusing not only on physical health but also on general well-being in order to increase life expectancy and quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In general the results of the MR analyses appear consistent with those of the LD score regression estimates.</s><s>This might be expected since the main difference is that MR compares two phenotypes using just a small number of SNPs which the underlying GWAS were powered to find, and LD score regression uses the whole genome.</s><s>Nevertheless, as a result the latter may indicate a shared heritable confounding factor, rather than a causal effect, which appears to be the case for our CRP results, as the measured effect of CRP on lifespan is in the opposite direction to the genetic correlation.</s><s>CRP's effects per se are not well understood, but our results lead us to speculate it may have a protective function, rising in the presence of disease, rather than causing it, despite observational associations with disease and consequent attempts to develop a drug to reduce it <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>If true, this pattern is somewhat analogous to findings for the N-terminal fragment of pro-BNP, which is a protective molecule, but observationally positively associates with cardiac failure and adverse cardiovascular outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Our finding that a reduction in one BMI unit leads to a 7-month extension of life expectancy, appears broadly consistent with those recently published by the Global BMI Mortality Collaboration, where great effort was made to exclude confounding and reverse causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>We also found each year longer spent in education translates into approximately a year longer lifespan.</s><s>When compared using the interquartile distance, risk factors generally exhibited stronger effects on mortality than disease susceptibility.</s><s>Although both CAD and cigarette smoking show a very similar genetic correlation with lifespan, the measured effect of smoking is twice as large as that of CAD, perhaps because smoking influences mortality through multiple pathways.</s></p><p><s>Our results show that longevity is partly determined by the predisposition to common diseases and, to an even greater extent, by modifiable risk factors.</s><s>The genetic
