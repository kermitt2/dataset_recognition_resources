<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this TransATAC population, we found that both EP and EPclin were highly prognostic across the 10 years of follow-up and both scores also identified early and late relapse events.</s><s>This is in agreement with previous reports in ER-positive, HER2-negative patient cohorts from the ABCSG-6 and -8 trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, EP and EPclin were prognostic in all assessed subgroups.</s></p><p><s>We also compared the prognostic information provided by EP and EPclin with that of the widely used Oncotype DX RS.</s><s>This study is the first direct comparison of the clinical performance of EP/EPclin with RS.</s><s>EPclin, as opposed to RS, includes information from clinical factors, making it more clinically useful but also making fair comparisons with RS complicated.</s><s>Therefore, as well as direct comparisons, we conducted analyses to determine how much information was added by the respective scores to CTS.</s></p><p><s>We found that EP was similar to RS in years 0 to 5 but was superior in years 5 to 10. EPclin markedly outperformed RS across the 10-year follow-up period and also in all additional univariate analyses, except in node-negative patients in the early time window.</s><s>These findings suggest that: 1) In years 0 to 5, EPclin predicts recurrence better in the overall population than RS because of the clinical components included in EPclin; and 2) in years 5 to 10, the superior performance of EPclin compared with RS is partly because of the inclusion of clinical variables in EPclin but also because of a molecular component that predicted late recurrences better.</s><s>The latter is also reinforced by the very similar prognostic value of EP in the early and late follow-up periods, in marked contrast with RS, where performance diminished beyond five years.</s></p><p><s>EP's overall better performance over RS might be attributed to the differences in the training populations.</s><s>The EP algorithm was trained on a HER2-negative, mixed node-negative and -positive population, unlike RS, which was optimized on a mixed HER2-negative and -positive, node-negative population.</s><s>These differences may explain the better prognostic ability of EP, in particular in node-positive patients and in patients at risk of a late relapse.</s></p><p><s>A previous analysis of EP components in ABCSG-6 and -8 trial samples showed that proliferative genes contributed to early prediction and ER-signaling genes provided prognosis beyond five years <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, we reported our analysis of RS components in ERþ/HER2-TransATAC patients that pointed to the loss of prediction by the ER module as the main reason for its weak performance after five years while the proliferation RS module was prognostic throughout the 10 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>The different behavior of the proliferation and ER-associated genes in the two scores may be because of the different identity of genes used and their weighting in the respective algorithms.</s><s>Further analysis is necessary to understand fully the differing behavior of these prognostic scores.</s></p><p><s>The integration of nodal status into the EPclin score allows the algorithm to be used in both node-negative and nodepositive patients, supported by the observed DR rates in the populations identified as low risk in the respective nodal groups.</s><s>It was notable, however, that when the algorithm was applied as a continuous variable in the node-negative population it identified one-third of the node-negative population with an extremely low DR of just 0.5% at 10 years.</s><s>Categorization of a patient in such a low-risk group could be highly reassuring.</s><s>Our earlier publication showed the differing relationship of RS with risk of DR according to nodal status <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>The current data emphasize that RS should not be used in node-positive patients to estimate recurrence risk without appropriate calibration of the relationship of RS with DR for such patients.</s></p><p><s>Of note, a recent report from the TAILORx trial described the very low risk of DR rate in patients with RS of 10 or lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>; this was, however, only over the first five years of follow-up.</s><s>Generally, patients in a low-risk group would not be recommended to receive chemotherapy treatment because of their perceived low recurrence risk.</s><s>Previously, ABCSG-6 and -8 observed 10-year DR rates by EPclin classification that were 4% in the low groups for both studies, 28% and 22% in the high-risk groups for the two trials, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Our analysis showed similar 10-year recurrence rates at 5.8% and 28.8% in the low and high EPclin groups of TransATAC, respectively, in contrast with 10.1% and 23.5% observed for the RS low and non-low groups.</s><s>An NRI favorable to EPclin indicated that EPclin classification aligned better with observed risk than RS and therefore provided superior risk stratification when compared with RS.</s></p></div>
