for different oil refining operations.</s><s>These processes utilize huge amounts of solid inorganic catalysts to speed up different chemical reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akcil et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Hydroprocessing catalysts usually consist of molybdenum <ref type="bibr">(Mo)</ref> or tungsten (W) supported on an alumina carrier with the aid of cobalt or nickel as promoters that encourage the removal of sulfur, nitrogen, and metals from the treated oil by means of hydrodesulfurization (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), and hydrodemetallation (HDM) reactions, respectively <ref type="bibr">(Marafi et al. 2003)</ref> The fresh catalysts are poisoned and deactivated during the different catalytic processes due to the deposition of hazardous metals (Ni and V) and coke originating from the treated feedstock <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Marafi and Stanislaus 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">2008b)</ref>.</s><s>The amount of spent catalysts generated by the petroleum industry worldwide was estimated at 150,000-170,000 tons/year <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dufresne 2007)</ref>.</s><s>At the current rate of consumption, ca 178,000 tons/year of hydrotreatment catalyst and 358,000 tons/year of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst is required <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahmed and Menoufy 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Srichandan et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This amount is steadily increasing due to the increase in the processing of heavier feedstocks and the growing demand for cleaner fuels <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shahrabi-Farahani et al. 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The spent catalyst generated by the petroleum refining industry is designated by United States Environmental Protection Agency as a toxic and environmentally hazardous waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Akcil et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Although spent refining catalysts consititue only ca 4% (weight) of the overall refinery wastes, they are classified as one of the most hazardous wastes generated by petroleum refineries <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Liu et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Akcil et al. 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, it requires proper handling and disposal.</s><s>Heavy metals such as V, Ni, <ref type="bibr">Mo, and</ref> Co present on the spent catalysts can be leached by water after disposal and therefore exacerbate environmental pollution.</s><s>Furthermore, spent hydroprocessing catalysts can liberate toxic gases upon exposure to water.</s><s>Coke deposition on the hydroprocessing catalysts that contain a substantial amount of nitrogen can lead to the formation of the hazardous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas.</s><s>Accordingly, environmental regulations regarding the handling of the spent refining catalysts are becoming increasingly stricter <ref type="bibr">(Marafi and Stanislaus 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Different strategies have been applied to treat or handle spent refining catalysts, such as disposal in landfills, rejuvenation or regeneration for reuse, and recovery of valuable metals via physicochemical treatments <ref type="bibr"

number of cycles.</s><s>Eventually, the spent catalyst is irreversibly deactivated and must be discarded and replaced with a fresh batch <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pradhan and Kumar 2012)</ref>.</s><s>It is also not possible to reactivate spent catalysts that are deactivated by thermal degradation or phase separation <ref type="bibr">(Marafi et al. 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, conventional rejuvenation processes are facilitated by physicochemical treatments that are associated with environmental and economic constraints.</s></p><p><s>Metal recovery from spent refining catalysts has been investigated to reduce the environmental hazard, minimize landfill usage, and meet current market demand for metals.</s><s>This is based on the fact that spent refining catalysts

techniques for metal extraction from various sources include hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy.</s><s>Despite reasonable extraction efficiencies, the application of these two techniques is restricted due to the use of high stregnth acids and alkalies (seconday pollutants), high enrgy consumtion (reflcted as high cost), and emssion of toxic gases that require downstream treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Srichandan et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Asghari et al. 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Biotechnology-based approaches for metal recovery, such as bioleaching

(1999)</ref> reported a similar case in their study of soil and sediment washing using the lipopeptide biosurfactant surfactin.</s><s>The authors found that surfactin at a concentration of 0.25% had metal removal efficiency higher than that performed by a 1% surfactin solution.</s></p><p><s>For Mo, there was no significant change in Mo content in all treatments except the rhamnolipid treatment R5.</s><s>This could be due to the fact that Mo is a main constituent of the catalyst matrix, which makes its removal a difficult task for the bioleaching treatments.</s><s>In this context, the apparent decrease in Mo content due to water treatment is statistically insignificant and falls within experimental error range.</s><s>Nonetheless, it appears that the concentration of rhamnolipids used in the treatment R5 was sufficiently powerful to extract Mo from the spent catalyst matrix to cause significant decrease.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of the Ni content revealed a pattern similar to that observed for Mo.</s></p><p><s>Most interestingly, among the biosurfactant treatments, those containing rhamnolipids (R3, R4, and R5) caused significant decrease in Ni content in a concentration-dependent manner.</s><s>For V content, also the rhamnolipid treatments caused the highest reduction in V content as compared to other biosurfactant treatments and the corresponding negative control treatment.</s><s>However, the water treatment also caused significant decrease in Ni and V content as compared to the untreated catalyst and most of the biosurfactant treatments.</s><s>This suggests that Ni and V were more easily accessible than Mo for removal just by water.</s><s>In summary, the rhamnolipid biosurfactants appear to have better potential than lipopeptides and sophorolipids for metals removal from the spent HDS catalyst <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mulligan et al. 2001)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The low metal removal rates observed for most of the treatments could be due to blocking the pore mouth on the spent HDS catalyst surface by carbon deposition.</s><s>This might reduce the accessibility of the entrapped metals to leaching solutions containing biosurfactants.</s><s>This also could be the reason for the observed low surface area and pore volume.</s><s>We analyzed the metal content using the treated solid catalyst, which could be the reason for the large error bars observed in some treatments.</s><s>This could be circumvented in future studies by measuring the metal content in the bioleaching solution instead.</s></p><p><s>The ability of water to leach metals from spent refining catalysts has been reported <ref type="bibr">(Marafi and Stanislaus, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>However, this raises the question; why and how water leached more metals from the spent catalyst as compared to most biosurfactant treatments?</s><s>Although the data reported in this study do not allow direct and clear answer to this question, potential causes could be proposed.</s><s>First, perhaps the biosurfactants used in the study were not the best choice for metal leaching from the spent HDS catalyst.</s></p><p><s>Second, biosurfactants activity depends on several parameters such as pH, temperature, salinity, the nature of the substrate, presence of co-contaminants, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Sriram et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Franzetti et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These factors need to be optimized to harness the best possible activity.</s><s>These conditions have not been optimized in the current study.</s><s>That is why the metal leaching capabilities did not reveal the best, which biosurfactants could do.</s></p><p><s>It is, nonetheless, interesting that the strong metal removal mediated by the rhamnolipid treatment R5 did not require any pretreatment (de-coking or de-oiling) of the spent HDS catalyst.</s><s>Although metal recovery is known to be more efficient with decocked catalyst, we performed our bioleaching experiments without de-oiling or decoking, while depending on the known oil displacement capabilities of biosurfactants.</s><s>This can have beneficial environmental and economic consequences.</s><s>It further indicates that there is a room for improvement of the metal leaching capability.</s></p><p><s>Several studies have demonstrated the capability of some microorganisms to remove metals from spent refinery catalysts via bioleaching.</s><s>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amiri et al.
