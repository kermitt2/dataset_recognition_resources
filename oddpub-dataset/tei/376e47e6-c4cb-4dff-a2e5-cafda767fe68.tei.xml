<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The first genome assembly for a tick vector of disease.</s><s>The assembly, IscaW1, comprises 570,640 contigs in 369,495 scaffolds (N 50 Â¼ 51,551 bp) representing 1.8 Gbp, including gaps (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>The ab initio annotation of 18,385 scaffolds 410 Kbp in length and representing 1.2 Gbp (57% of the genome) predicted 20,486 protein-coding genes, and 4,439 non-coding RNA genes (Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1-6</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Ixodid ticks typically have haploid genomes that exceed 1 Gbp (ref.</s><s>8).</s><s>In contrast, the 90 Mbp genome of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a horticultural pest, is the smallest of any known arthropod, and contains o10% transposable elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Repetitive DNA is estimated to comprise B70% of the I. scapularis genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , reflecting an extreme case of tandem repeat and transposable element accumulation.</s></p><p><s>The I. scapularis genome possesses 26 acrocentric autosomes and two sex chromosomes (XX:XY) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-based physical mapping was used to develop a karyotype and physical map <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>; Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">12 and 15</ref>).</s><s>Mapping revealed that tandem repeat accumulation in centromeric or peri-centromeric regions, also noted in some other arthropods <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , is high in I. scapularis and comprises B40% of genomic DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>The low complexity tandem repeat families, ISR-1, ISR-2 and ISR-3, account for B8% of the genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> (Supplementary Text).</s><s>The most abundant ISR-2 (95-99 bp; B7% of the genome) is localized at the nearterminal heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The moderately repetitive fraction of the genome (B30% of genomic DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> ) contains numerous copies of Class I and Class II transposable elements (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">13 and 14</ref> and Supplementary Text).</s><s>For example, 41 well-represented elements (that is, comprising a full-length canonical and/or consensus sequence (Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure">7 and 8</ref>)) of the long-terminal repeat (LTR) retro-transposon family, estimated to make up o1% of the genome, were identified.</s><s>Thirty-seven members of the Ty3/gypsy group were identified, with the remainder being Pao/Bel-like.</s><s>Two (Mag and CsRn1) of the six well-known insect Ty3/gypsy lineages were confirmed in the tick and two new clades, Squirrel and Toxo, are likely specific to the subphylum Chelicerata (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Structural characterization of elements belonging to these lineages revealed shared features that include the CCHC gag and GPY/F integrase domains, and two ORFs matching gag and pol.</s><s>The LTRs possess the TG..CA pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and their integration generates a duplication of 4 bp.</s></p><p><s>Non-LTR retro-transposons comprise about 6.5% of the genome.</s><s>Sequence conservation and transposable element copy number suggest recent activity in the I. scapularis CR1, I and L2 clades; these elements are also abundant in birds, mammals and lizards, and the possibility of horizontal transposable element transmission warrants further investigation.</s><s>The R2, RTE and LOA non-LTR retro-transposon clades found in mosquitoes and Drosophila were not identified in the tick.</s><s>Seemingly intact mariner and piggyBac transposable elements were identified, indicating possible recent or active transposition, and 234 miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were annotated.</s><s>These MITEs range in copy number from 50 to 14,500 and occupy B5% of the genome.</s><s>Collectively, these findings suggest a genome permissive to high repeat accumulation.</s></p><p><s>Approximately 60% of tick genes have recognizable orthologs in other arthropods, about half of which are maintained across representative species of the major arthropod lineages (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Approximately 50% of the remaining genes have homologs and B1/5th of tick genes appear unique (T.</s><s>urticae has a similar proportion of unique genes); these provide an important resource to understand tick-specific processes and develop highly selective interventions.</s><s>Analysis of gene models and 20,901 tentative consensus sequences (the Gene Index Project; compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi)</s><s>compiled from 192,461 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) identified B22% of I. scapularis genes as paralogs (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">11</ref>).</s><s>This is in line with estimates for Homo sapiens (15%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (20%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>Complementary analyses of paralogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> suggest two duplication events in I. scapularis, involving hundreds of genes that took place within the last 40 million years, consistent with the radiation of ticks through Europe, America and Africa.</s><s>The tick mitochondrial genome retains the inferred ancestral arthropod organization as predicted by its phylogenetic position <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The genome-scale quantitative molecular species phylogeny (Supplementary Text) inferred from single-copy orthologs from OrthoDB <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , confirms the expected position of Chelicerata as basal to crustaceans and insects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>The rate of molecular evolution of I. scapularis genes is slightly slower than that of other representative arthropods, and considerably slower than the rapidly evolving dipterans.</s><s>Quantification of shared intron positions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) and lengths (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>) among orthologs reveals that I. scapularis shares greater than 10 times more intron positions exclusively with the non-arthropod species compared with the crustacean Daphnia pulex (Supplementary Figs 11-14 and Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">7-10</ref>).</s><s>The species tree topology is reconstructed using only intron presence/absence data, but its branch lengths reveal that I. scapularis intron positions are more similar to those of the outgroup species, than to the other arthropods.</s><s>This distinction is underscored by the contrasting length distributions of shared introns; I. scapularis lengths are most similar to those of mouse and other vertebrates, and an order of magnitude greater than in D. pulex and the representative insect species analysed.</s><s>Ancestral eukaryotic genes likely possessed high intron densities similar to those of modern mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>The tick genome, therefore, supports an intron-rich gene architecture at the base of the arthropod radiation and more similar to that of ancestral metazoans than extant pancrustaceans.</s><s>Ticks as parasites.</s><s>Tick mouthparts (chelicerae and barbed hypostome) attach to and create a feeding lesion in the dermis of the host (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>).</s><s>Tick saliva consists of a complex mixture of peptides and other compounds that facilitate attachment and disarm host haemostasis, inflammation and immunity, thereby enabling prolonged blood feeding.</s><s>Antimicrobials in the saliva <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> presumably prevent bacterial overgrowth within the ingested blood and/or feeding lesion.</s><s>Transcriptome analyses indicate that tick saliva is exceptionally diverse compared with that of  haematophagous insects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Also, genes encoding salivary gland products are evolving rapidly in comparison with other gene families, possibly due to the immune pressure imposed by the host.</s><s>Notably, the genome reveals an expanded repertoire (74, 0.4% of the predicted proteome) of proteins containing a Kunitz domain (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">16</ref>), implicated in protease inhibition and channel-blocking activity, with roles in inhibiting coagulation, angiogenesis and vasodilation.</s><s>The tick genome is the richest source of this gene family identified to date.</s><s>In contrast, only 0.05% of human and 0.1% of bovine proteins have this signature domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , while the mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae have only five, eight and four proteins with this domain, respectively.</s><s>Other tick gene expansions of note include the lipocalins (40 genes), linked to anti-inflammatory activity in other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , and the metalloproteases (34 genes), which are involved in fibrin degradation and inhibition of angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Ticks have evolved a novel mechanism for haemoglobin digestion.</s><s>Haemolysis of host erythrocytes occurs in the midgut but the digestion of blood meal proteins takes place within specialized vesicles of midgut epithelial cells following internalization by pinocytosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>).</s><s>Haemoglobin digestion occurs via a cascade of proteolytic enzymes resulting in dipeptides and free amino acids that are transcytosed into the haemolymph (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">21</ref>).</s><s>Orthologs of Ixodes ricinus haemoglobinolytic enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> were identified in the I. scapularis genome that contains multiple genes for cathepsin D (three genes), cathepsin L (three genes), and serine carboxypeptidase (four genes), suggesting the relative importance of these enzymes in haemoglobin digestion.</s><s>Haemoglobinolytic enzymes have also been identified in other tick species <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , suggesting that this mode of haemoglobin digestion is widespread throughout the Ixodida.</s><s>Liberated haem is transported from the digestive vesicles by transport proteins to haemosomes, unique storage vesicles where haem is detoxified by formation of haematin-like aggregates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Thus, haemoglobinolysis in ticks is similar to that in endoparasitic flatworms and nematodes.</s><s>However, tick-specific intracellular digestion in midgut epithelial vesicles and haem detoxification in specialized haemosomes could offer novel acaricide targets (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">21</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Haem is associated with multiple essential functions as it complexes with proteins that perform oxygen transport and sensing, enzyme catalysis and electron transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>However, ticks are incapable of de novo haem synthesis, and it has been proposed that they rely on haem recovery from the diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>The identification of orthologous genes in I. scapularis for the  enzymes hemF, hemG and hemH associated with the production of protohaem (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">20</ref>) suggests these may be remnants of a once functional haem synthesis pathway that became redundant following adaptation to a blood diet.</s><s>In the absence of de novo synthesis, haem storage in ticks is likely essential, especially during the extended periods that occur between blood feeding and during egg development.</s><s>In ticks, two families of storage proteins ensure haem availability and protect against the toxicity of a haem-rich diet: haemlipoglyco-carrier proteins (CPs) and the yolk proteins, vitellogenins (Vgs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>).</s><s>CPs are predominant in all tick developmental stages except the embryo.</s><s>In contrast, Vg is produced in the fat body and midgut of adult females during vitellogenesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>), and is transported via the haemolymph to the developing oocyctes where it is stored as vitellin.</s><s>Vitellin is the main protein in the egg and the likely source of haem for developing embryos <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Ten putative CP genes, the most described from a tick to date, and two Vg genes were identified in the I. scapularis genome (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">16</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">22</ref>).</s><s>The genome contains orthologs for at least 39 invertebrate neuropeptide genes (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">25-28</ref>), including peptides that regulate ecdysis, cuticle synthesis, hardening and tanning.</s><s>Orthologs involved in insect moulting <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , that is, corazonin, eclosion hormone, cardioactive peptide and buriscon a and b, were identified (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Additional novel putative neuropeptide genes were identified based on the presence of tandem repeats in conserved C-terminal sequences, including the canonical sequences for amidation and dibasic (or monobasic) cleavage signals (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">25</ref>).</s><s>ESTs matching corazonin, eclosion hormone and bursicon a and b were found in the synganglion transcriptome of adult Dermacentor variabilis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , which do not moult, suggesting previously unrecognized roles for these neuropeptide hormones.</s><s>Companion analyses 36 identified major differences in gene expression between I. scapularis and the soft tick, Ornithodoros turicata (Argasidae) in response to feeding that may explain how synganglion neuropetides regulate different life styles of the two tick families.</s><s>The identification of orthologs of neuropeptides known to regulate insect moulting provides a much needed starting point to understand the regulation of development in ticks and in the modification of cuticle to accommodate the approximately 100-fold increase in size that occurs during blood feeding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In ticks, over-hydration from large blood meals is counterbalanced by hormonally controlled salivary secretion into the host, presumably regulated by neuropeptides and their G-proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s><s>The homologs of many insect neuropeptides, protein hormones, biogenic amines and associated GPCRs 37 (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">25-28</ref>) that steer processes such as diuresis, behaviour, reproduction and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , were identified in I. scapularis.</s><s>Some of the neuropeptide genes identified encode multiple neuropeptides.</s><s>Of note is the extreme number of copies (19) of the kinin gene, which ranges from one to eight in other arthropods <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">28</ref>), suggesting that high peptide copy number is also needed for effective diuresis.</s><s>In accordance, four kinin GPCRs are present (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">28</ref>).</s><s>The tick has 20 GPCRs for five biogenic amines, a number similar to that for all other sequenced arthropods <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , suggesting an early evolutionary origin of these molecules and a core set of highly conserved arthropod signalling molecules.</s><s>Typically in insects, each neuropeptide interacts with one, or at most two, GPCRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>Remarkably, the numbers of some neuropeptide GPCRs have expanded significantly (up to 10-fold) in I. scapularis (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">26 and 28</ref>).</s><s>This includes the GPCRs for AKH/corazonin-related peptide, allatostatin-A, diuretic hormones (calcitonin-and CRF-like), inotocin, kinin, pigmentdispersing-factor, sulfakinin, and tachykinin (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">28</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>In insects, these GPCRs are involved in regulating meal size (kinin), satiety (sulfakinin) and diuresis (kinin, tachykinin and calcitonin-like diuretic hormone) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>In ticks, the increased efficacy and fine regulation of diuresis may be accomplished through an increased repertoire of diuretic GPCRs rather than via corresponding neuropeptides, emphasizing their potential as targets for tick control.</s></p><p><s>Blood feeding is essential for reproduction in adult female ticks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>In lower insects, reproduction is largely regulated by juvenile hormone III. Biochemical evidence suggests that ticks do not synthesize juvenile hormone III and instead employ ecdysteroids to initiate vitellogenesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>, reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> ).</s><s>In insects, the final hydroxylations for the synthesis of ecdysteroids are performed sequentially by cytochrome P450s (CYP450s)  encoded by the Halloween genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">17</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">19</ref>).</s><s>Genes for all steroidogenic CYP450s except for phantom were identified in the I. scapularis genome and putative gene duplications were identified for disembodied and the spook/spookier clades, suggesting conservation of ecdysteroid regulated processes between ticks and insects.</s><s>Genes for seven of the nine enzymes in the insect mevalonate pathway that produces the juvenile hormone precursor, farnesylpyrophosphate (farnesyl-PP), were identified in the tick genome (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">18</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">18</ref>).</s><s>There are five insect enzymes involved in the conversion of farnesyl-PP to juvenile hormone III.</s><s>Only the gene for farnesol oxidase in the juvenile hormone branch was found in the I. scapularis genome (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">18</ref>) and is transcribed in the synganglion of I. scapularis and D. variabilis.</s><s>The tick genome reveals a striking expansion of the methyl transferase family (44 genes) and EST data indicate that at least 26 of these are transcribed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">19</ref>).</s><s>However, the I. scapularis methyl  transferases studied so far lack the juvenile hormone binding motif.</s><s>An ortholog of the insect cytochrome P450 (CYP15A1) that adds the epoxide to methyl farnesoate to produce juvenile hormone III was not found in either the tick genome (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">18</ref>) or synganglion transcriptomes.</s><s>The neuropeptides, allatostatin and allatotropin, which perform a variety of functions in insects, including the regulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis, were also identified in the tick (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</s><s>Important questions remain as to the role of the mevalonatefarnesal pathway in tick reproduction and development.</s><s>In a complementary study, transcripts for genes in the mevalonatefarnesal pathway were identified from the synganglion of two hard and one soft tick species <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>The I. scapularis genome reflects a parasitic lifestyle requiring detoxification of multiple xenobiotic factors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>We identified a record 206 CYP450 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">23</ref>) and 75 carboxylesterase/cholinesterase-like genes, including five putative acetylcholinesterase genes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">24</ref>).</s><s>CYPs are haem-containing enzymes that catalyse biological oxidation reactions, many of which detoxify xenobiotics, including acaricides.</s><s>In contrast, the body louse, Pediculus humanus, also an obligate blood-feeding ectoparasite, has 36 CYPs, the fewest known in an animal 40 , while the plant feeding mite, T. urticae has 81 (ref.</s><s>9).</s><s>Carboxylesterases are also associated with metabolic detoxification in animals.</s><s>While the function of these enzymes is not known, the abundance of these genes in I. scapularis may reflect the need to detoxify large blood meals from diverse hosts and toxicants encountered during off-host stages.</s></p><p><s>As a parasite that lives largely off-host, I. scapularis has developed unique mechanisms for host detection that are reflected in the genome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>).</s><s>The sensory system in ticks includes setiform sensilla for chemo-, mechano-, thermo-and hygroreception, non-setal sensilla and dorsal light-sensing cells.</s><s>Chemoreception occurs presumably through the unique Haller's organ located on the tarsi that are presented when ticks 'quest' for a host.</s><s>In insects, smell and taste are mediated by families of membrane receptors and extracellular ligand-binding proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>The chemoreceptor genes identified in the tick genome belong to the gustatory receptor and ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR)-related ionotropic receptor families.</s><s>Sixty-two gustatory receptors were identified that fall into three major clades (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">20</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">29</ref> and Supplementary Note 1).</s><s>The largest of the clades (43 genes) is exclusive to I. scapularis and the relatively short branch lengths compared with those for other representative species, suggest a recent lineage-specific expansion.</s><s>Although phylogenetically distant, this clade is related to the Dipteran sugar receptors and a set of three distinctive D. pulex gustatory receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>The second clade includes 16 tick gustatory receptors, also more closely related to the sugar receptors than to other representative gustatory receptors, with branch lengths suggesting an early diversification.</s><s>The remaining clade (three genes) clusters with the largest D. pulex expansion.</s><s>Of the 29 IR/iGluR genes identified, 15 are likely of the chemosensory type (ionotropic receptor) and 14 are canonical iGluRs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">21</ref> and Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">30 and 31</ref>).</s><s>Members of the insect odorant receptor, odorant-binding protein (OBP) and chemosensory protein B families <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> were not identified in the tick and only one member of the chemosensory protein (CSP) family was found.</s><s>Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the origin of insect odorant receptors and OBPs occurred after the split of the lineages Hexapoda and Crustacea (B470 Myr ago) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> ; the CSPs, however, are predicted to appear before the split of the Chelicerata and Pancrustacea lineages.</s><s>Phylogenetic analyses
