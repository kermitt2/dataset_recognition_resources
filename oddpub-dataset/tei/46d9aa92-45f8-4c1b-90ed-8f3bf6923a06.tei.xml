interventions are particularly challenging in remote areas with high poverty.</s><s>Of all health indicators, maternal mortality reveals the greatest disparity between rich and poor countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Skilled birth attendance (SBA) during labour and delivery has been identified as "the single most important factor in preventing maternal deaths" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and is also very unequal between the richest and poorest quintiles within countries.</s></p><p><s>In Uganda, maternal mortality is estimated at 360 deaths per 100,000 live births <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Evidence suggests that inequities in access to health services have grown over the last decade, while key health indicators, including maternal and infant mortality rates, have stalled or worsened among the poor <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>The percentage of births in Uganda with SBA is 88 % in the wealthiest quintile, but only 44 % in the poorest <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Regional and urban-rural inequities persist.</s><s>Percentages of health facility births are estimated at 90 % in urban areas but 53 % in rural settings.</s><s>Met need for emergency obstetric care, captured via the numbers of EMOC facilities per 100,000 population is estimated at 24 % nationally, but 14 % in the North <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Global data show clear evidence that antenatal care (ANC) attendance is associated with higher SBA utilisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>There appears to be a "dose-response" relationship between ANC and SBA, with women receiving ANC "early and often" being most likely to also receive SBA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>While association does not imply causation, data indicate that in low and middle-income countries, SBA is six times more likely among women who attended ANC at least once during pregnancy than among women who did not attend at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, research data also demonstrate a gap between a much higher level of ANC attendance than of SBA utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>The gap has been confirmed in Africa <ref type="bibr"

target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Stekelenburg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> concluded, "The large difference between the reasonably high ANC attendance and the lower supervised delivery percentage is still not fully understood".</s></p><p><s>At the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)-supported health centre in Lalogi (Gulu district), service statistics illustrate the existence of the "ANC-SBA gap".</s><s>While the annual number of first ANC visits and deliveries has held relatively constant over the years, the disparity between the annual number of new ANC visits and the annual number of health facility deliveries is approximately 3:1 or even 4:1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Women were apparently able to access health services despite the conflict, but far greater proportions used ANC than SBA.</s></p><p><s>Our study sought to examine the reasons for the gap between women's use of ANC and SBA services (typically only available in health facilities) in Northern Uganda, where approximately 95 % of pregnant women use ANC but only 54 % deliver at a health facility <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, the study focused on identifying reasons why this gap existed even in the presence of a fully-staffed and equipped MSF-supported health centre, with free, 24-hour 7-day-aweek SBA services.</s><s>The study also aimed to assess and take into account women's and community perceptions, experiences, and needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study aimed to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> identify key factors underlying the gap between high rates of ANC attendance and much lower rates of health facility delivery; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> examine the association between health workers' advice at ANC to deliver at a health facility and the actual place of last delivery; (3) investigate whether ANC services attempt to actively link women to SBA services in the conflictaffected Gulu District of Northern Uganda; and (4) make recommendations for policy-and program-relevant implementation research to enhance use of skilled birth attendance services.</s><s>This study targeted a public-sector Ministry of Health (MoH) facility ("Lalogi") in Northern Uganda's Gulu District, supported by MSF.</s><s>The facility was located inside an IDP camp to eliminate distance and insecurity as barriers to service utilization.</s></p></div>

(Qualitative results)</s></p><p><s>Based on interviews, we identified the following fundamental reasons underlying the "ANC-SBA gap" in order of importance: poor perceived quality of SBA care, including women's fear or experience of being mistreated or neglected by health workers, coupled with increased vulnerability during labour and delivery; lack of timely access to health facilities (long distances, lack of transport, limited window of time during labour); poverty, including inability to procure all essential items for health facility delivery (socalled "requirements"); health systems deficiencies, including shortage of competent, motivated and adequately remunerated midwives/skilled birth attendants, as well as lack of essential medicines, supplies, and ambulances; lack of early and adequate birth planning and preparation, together with abrupt or sudden onset of labour and delivery; socio-cultural issues, including lack of perceived need for health facility delivery; and lack of support and active involvementwhether physical, financial, logistic, or emotionalfrom husbands or male partners.</s><s>Barriers are discussed below.</s><s>[Note: quotations are from female FGD and interview participants, unless otherwise noted].</s></p><p><s>Quality of Care: Fear, shame, and maltreatment as barriers to health facility delivery A number of respondents poignantly described their fear or past experience of being hurt, shamed, humiliated, or treated negligently at the hands of health workers.</s><s>One , when she was carrying the baby using a pullover.</s><s>So such words deter women from going to the hospital."</s><s>Another woman described being "a laughing stock" (in the eyes of health workers and peers), a view confirmed by a male focus group participant: "If I go with my wife when she is not looking very well and without other requirements that health workers need, sometimes the language used is not good….</s><s>[health workers may] abuse or look down on you.</s><s>Sometimes [there are a lot of] people around, but they [use] such bad words, and people laugh at you while you die of shame."</s></p><p><s>Respondents expressed fear of being neglected and invisible if they go to the hospital for delivery.</s><s>As one woman put it: "[Women] fear, yet it's not fear.</s><s>At times, she could have observed something bad in the hospital.</s><s>That can stop a woman from going back to deliver.</s><s>Many think, 'This hospital, even if I go, nobody will help me.</s><s>I'd better deliver at home.' Then she just delivers [at home]."</s><s>Another woman spoke of the trauma experienced by many women who found they were left alone or abandoned in their hour of need: "Women do not like the welcome of the health workers when they go to the hos-pital….</s><s>They will just pass by you as if they have not seen you.</s><s>[They] are blind to see people…."</s><s>And another echoed: "Even if you are too sick and very weak… the [health workers] should help you.</s><s>But you find [they are] gone.</s><s>[They] come back at the time when you are about to die.</s><s>That is why deaths are so many."</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Access Barriers, timing and progression of labour, and a critical window of time</head><p><s>Although access can pose a problem for ANC, the problem becomes more critical during labour and delivery.</s><s>The delivery site may be farther from home than sites capable of providing ANC; the woman is often weak and in pain and cannot walk far, especially alone; and she is racing against time.</s></p><p><s>Lack of available and affordable transport, including a functional referral system, is a critical concern.</s><s>As one female health worker vehemently explained, lack of access can present a life-or-death barrier in emergency referrals:</s></p><p><s>"You need to give money summing 30,000 UGX [~$15 USD] onward for fuel [for the ambulance].</s><s>[If] you fail to produce it, you [stay behind] and die.</s><s>You are referred and that is the problem [of] the mother who cannot afford getting such amount.... It's not catered for by the policy -because if it was so, the distributed ambulances, they know that they are going to [need] fuel, and now they are saying there's no fuel".</s></p><p><s>From a policymaker's perspective, "[There is a] shortage of ambulances….</s><s>This affects referral services.</s><s>[You] can't run from one end to another at some points.</s><s>[So] a mother's life may not be saved because there's not enough time".</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Poverty: many faces, few choices (socio-economic factors)</head><p><s>The complex cycle of poverty appears more insurmountable at delivery than at ANC. Women who attend ANC often receive incentives such as mosquito nets and "mama kits" (a clean delivery kit that includes plastic sheet, gloves, razor blade, string, clean cloth).</s><s>In contrast, women who deliver at a health facility do not routinely receive any incentives, but are expected to provide their own items, called "requirements", such as soap, basin, baby blanket, and other supplies.</s><s>Several respondents described the financial and emotional stresses endured by women and families living in poverty.</s><s>The agony of choice was captured in human terms by one respondent: "[You] use the money you would have used for your children to go to school [in order] to go to the health facility".</s></p><p><s>As one female health worker shared: "There are others who really…cannot afford to buy a basin.</s><s>They feel like when they come with an old basin to the health centre, she will be looked down upon and [people will say], 'This one is the poorest' or 'This one is very ignorant' …so they normally have that fear of coming with what they have at home".</s></p><p><s>Another respondent said, "People think about going for ANC, but don't go for health facility delivery because of requirements.</s><s>If you go without them, you'll be chased away".</s></p><p><s>The sense of exclusion and "defeat" that poverty inflicts on these communities was summed up by a male FGD respondent in seven words: "Poor people cannot deliver at the hospital".</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Socio-cultural and gender barriers: Perceptions and realities</head><p><s>Women understand the need to attend ANC at least once in order to obtain their ANC card as a kind of entry ticket, in case they experience complications at delivery and need health centre assistance.</s><s>However, women do not perceive delivery at a health facility as equally crucial.</s><s>There is no alternative to attending ANC clinic for obtaining the ANC card, but women view delivery by traditional birth attendants as an alternative to delivery at a health facility.</s></p><p><s>Culturally, home delivery is perceived as normal while hospital delivery is considered suitable for the sick or those with complications.</s></p><p><s>"The general tendency is for home delivery because it's more comfortable… and there's no need for health facility delivery if the woman is not unwell….</s><s>The reason to go to health facility is if [she] thinks something may go wrong back home.</s><s>Women go to ANC to get the card and get registered so they are not blamed if they go to health facility for delivery, in case of complications…."</s><s>(male policymaker) Another female interviewee affirmed this: "Through ANC service, a woman is told whether the fetus is healthy, in a good position, or doing weakly in the womb.</s><s>Hence, [she] knows whether [she] has to deliver in hospital or at home."</s><s>Once a woman has given birth at least once, there is a sense that she now knows the dynamics of labour and can henceforth deliver from home.</s></p><p><s>Both male and female policymakers confirmed this perspective, revealing deeply rooted traditions: "It's a general belief that a strong woman can deliver alone.</s><s>This is also a belief amongst our people here.</s><s>A strong woman should be able to deliver alone.</s><s>Or, she should be able to go to the health facility and within two hours get out" (male policymaker).</s></p><p><s>As revealed through qualitative data, one Ugandan doctor/policy maker interviewed for this study from outside the study zone had innovated to make his hospital more welcoming.</s><s>The hospital now encourages women to bring a birth companion to delivery, installs stools so the companion can sit by the bedside of the labouring woman, and organises community "Safe Motherhood Days", including tours of maternity wards.</s><s>Based on observations and communications with this doctor, one policymaker indicated that these strategies made a positive difference at a minimal cost and could potentially be replicated elsewhere in Uganda.</s></p><p><s>The supply side: human resources management and health systems challenges in implementing a universal SBA policy Key challenges highlighted by both health workers and policymakers included: addressing staff shortages and working conditions; ensuring staff competencies and training; recruiting, maintaining, and motivating staff, particularly in a region devastated by decades of conflict; staff salaries and housing; ensuring adequate supplies, equipment, and logistics; and providing a functional referral system.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>What health workers say matters: association between advice at ANC and place of delivery ANC service providers can play a key role in encouraging pregnant women to seek SBA services and increasing the proportion of deliveries at health facility <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>After controlling for potential confounders, reporting having received ANC advice to deliver at a health facility was significantly associated with reporting having delivered at a health facility.</s><s>This confirms results from other African settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref> indicating that the likelihood of delivering in a health facility is significantly higher among women counseled at ANC about possible pregnancy complications than among those not counseled.</s><s>While this represents a window of opportunity for intervention, just over half of women reported being so advised.</s><s>While it is possible that women who ended up delivering in a facility recalled being advised to do so to justify their decision, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) including birth planning and advice to deliver in a facility showed the same thing prospectively.</s></p><p><s>Quality of care and client-provider interaction as a primary barrier Of serious concern is women's fear or experience of maltreatment by health workers, which is the barrier to health facility delivery reported most often.</s><s>This finding echoes others from Uganda <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41]</ref> and other African countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>.</s><s>All these studies underscore the importance of women's perceptions or expectations of treatment by health workers as a primary factor in deciding whether to deliver at a health facility.</s><s>Women's particular vulnerability during childbirth may make them more afraid of such maltreatment during delivery compared to ANC.</s></p><p><s>There are many ways to help health facilities become more "woman-friendly" and respectful of individual women and their socio-cultural beliefs and traditions.</s><s>It is not clear whether health workers and policymakers are aware of the extent to which poverty, perceived disrespectful treatment, and lack of respect for traditions prevent women from delivering at health facilities.</s><s>Such facilities could provide soap, basin, and the other "requirements", ensure that all women are treated with dignity and respect, encourage women to have a birth companion, provide an area to heat water for bathing, and allow traditional blessings to be performed after birth.</s><s>Clean birth kits could be provided during delivery not ANC, to make women feel more welcome.</s></p><p><s>The report on the Ugandan doctor who had made the maternity a more "woman-friendly" environment, implied doing so did not require complex or expensive technology, a major overhaul, or significant costs.</s><s>Rather, it implied listening to and observing the experience and feelings of women patients, encouraging and supporting staff to embrace change, and monitoring the process and data to observe the impact.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>above.</s><s>To identify and evaluate specific interventions that may improve the situation, potentially useful studies include:</s></p><p><s>An analysis of why health workers do not consistently and universally advise ANC clients to deliver at health facilities; whether they have made the shift from the high-risk profiling approach in ANC to promoting SBA for all; and whether they are aware of the ANC-SBA gap in their own health facility's service statistics; Testing and comparing the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and sustainability of various strategies for improving quality of care and client-provider interaction, as perceived by women clients, especially the poor and vulnerable.</s><s>A comprehensive review examining all relevant programmes and policies on maternal and newborn health in Northern Uganda, using a "post-conflict" and a "pro-poor" lens to assess: 1) whether the repatriation has worsened the situation and, if so, how this deterioration of accessibility can be prevented, and 2) how policies and practices (e.g., "requirements") disadvantage the poor; Evaluating various "pro-poor" strategies, such as demand-side financing to assess which ones might effectively alleviate the problem of pervasive poverty in the region and increases uptake of SBA;</s></p><p><s>A pilot study, conducted in selected sub-counties of Gulu District, of a community-based support and follow-up system to be quickly activated when a woman going into labour needs emergency transport.</s><s>The follow-up system could involve Village Health Team members and traditional birth attendants to help ensure availability of such transport; monitor and promote women's attendance at ANC and SBA; and track maternal and neonatal outcomes.</s><s>A systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[65]</ref> concluded that evidence is promising, albeit limited, that community referral and transport schemes may increase uptake of SBA and EmOC.</s><s>If such a pilot proved effective, feasible, and acceptable, a larger trial could be designed and conducted.</s></p></div>
