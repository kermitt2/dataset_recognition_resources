Keating, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>These cells migrate further to appropriate locations and differentiate to populate the new tissue.</s></p><p><s>An important aspect in understanding regenerative processes is the knowledge about the cellular origin of the regenerated tissue.</s><s>In general, cells of renewed tissues can be generated by two mechanisms, either involving stem or progenitor cells, or by dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation of existing cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Poss, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>The main cellular origin during fin regeneration has been suggested to involve dedifferentiation of cells rather than multipotent stem cells.</s><s>However, the question of cellular origin during fin regeneration is still a subject of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Tanaka &amp; Reddien, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Zebrafish fin regeneration has been also used to identify conserved gene functions during regeneration.</s><s>Several signalling pathways including Fgf, Wnt, Tgf-b, Bmp and Hedgehog signalling have been described to be crucial for fin regeneration in zebrafish.</s><s>Disruption of Fgf signalling, for example by inactivation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) gene, blocks blastema formation and expression of the homeobox domain gene msxb which marks the cells in the distal part of the blastema <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akimenko et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Thummel et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Inhibition of Wnt/bcatenin signalling also prevents the early specification of the distal blastema <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Stoick-Cooper et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Wehner et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Both pathways have been reported to be involved in all stages of regeneration from wound closure to regenerative outgrowth.</s></p><p><s>The regenerative capacity does not only differ among species and organs but also depends on developmental stage and age.</s><s>In humans, for example, only children show an enhanced ability to regrow lost fingertips, whereas adults have lost this ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Douglas, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Illingworth, 1974)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, young mice renew digit tips much more effectively than mature animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Borgens, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Reginelli et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, an interesting question is whether highly regenerative species such as fish keep their regenerative potential throughout their lifespan.</s><s>To study possible age-related effects on the regenerative capacity, we used a short-lived teleost fish species, the turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri.</s><s>It has a maximum lifespan of 4-14 months depending on strain and origin, which is the shortest reported maximum lifespan of a vertebrate species in captivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Valdesalici &amp; Cellerino, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>This short lifespan has been considered to result from the unpredictable habitat as the fish live in ephemeral ponds in south-eastern Africa, an area of distinct dry and rainy seasons.</s><s>During the dry season, the ponds can desiccate and the population survives as drought-tolerant embryos.</s><s>When the ponds are filled with water, the embryos hatch, rapidly grow and reach sexual maturation after 3-5 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Blazek et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We and others have demonstrated that the short lifespan of N. furzeri is associated with rapid aging as shown by an early onset of aging biomarkers, a decline in learning and behavioural capabilities, agerelated telomere shortening and an age-related impairment of mitochondrial function <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Terzibasi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hartmann et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hartmann et al., , 2011))</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we addressed the questions whether different aspects of epimorphic fin regeneration are affected during aging in N. furzeri.</s><s>We therefore performed a comprehensive study analysing outgrowth kinetics, number of proliferating and apoptotic cells, and gene expression at different ages.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>To study the influence of aging on the regenerative potential, we analysed caudal fin regeneration at different ages of the wild-derived Nothobranchius furzeri strain MZM-0703.</s><s>A lifespan experiment of singlehoused male animals (n = 74) revealed a mean lifespan of 43.5 weeks and a maximum lifespan (10% survival) of 60 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Based on the survival curve, we decided to study fin regeneration in four different age groups.</s><s>The young age group consisted of 8-week-old fish that can be considered as young adults, because the animals reach sexual maturity at an age of 3-5 weeks.</s><s>Ninety-nine per cent of the population was alive at that age.</s><s>Middle-aged fish had an age of 20 weeks when 90% of the population was alive.</s><s>Old fish had an age of 36 weeks (73% of the population was alive) but did not represent the most long-lived individuals.</s><s>Instead, this age rather marks the beginning of increased mortality (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The group of very old fish were 50-60 weeks old with a mean age of 54 weeks representing the oldest 24% of the population.</s></p><p><s>As known for other teleost fish species, N. furzeri has the potential to completely regenerate its fins.</s><s>We assessed regeneration of the caudal fin by determining the relative length of fin outgrowth every second day after amputation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Each age group (8 weeks, 20 weeks, 36 weeks and 54 weeks) consisted of six to twelve male MZM-0703 fish.</s><s>Animals from all age groups had the potential to regenerate their caudal fins, however, to a different degree (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>The 8-week-old fish were able to nearly completely (98%) regenerate their amputated caudal fins within 27 days, whereas the 20-week-old fish only reached 78% of their original fin size.</s><s>The ability to fully regenerate further declined in the 36-week-old fish that reached an average size of 57%.</s><s>Strikingly, very old fish with a mean age of 54 weeks were only able to regenerate 46% compared to their original fin size.</s><s>In addition, the majority of very old fish (five of eight fish) did not uniformly regenerate across the entire fin with some parts not showing outgrowth at all (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>This phenomenon of partial regeneration was only observed in the very old fish and not in any other age group.</s><s>The difference in the relative length of outgrowth between young and very old fish was already significant at 3 days post amputation (dpa) and increased with time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>From 9 dpa onwards, the difference in outgrowth was significant between all age groups.</s></p><p><s>Because temperature is one of the important environmental factors influencing zebrafish fin regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boominathan &amp; Ferreira, 2012)</ref>, we wanted to know whether this holds also true for N. furzeri.</s><s>Keeping 8-week-old fish at 33 °C compared to 27 °C resulted in an increased outgrowth at 3, 5 and 7 dpa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>However, final outgrowth length was temperature independent, suggesting that temperature does not influence overall regenerative capacity.</s></p><p><s>We also determined the relative growth rate as the increase in outgrowth length between two time points.</s><s>Young fish had significantly higher growth rates at 3, 5, 7 and 9 dpa than the very old fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>The relative growth rates of the different age groups followed a similar pattern with the exception that the maximum growth rate of the two young age groups peaked at 7 days post amputation (8-week-old fish: 17.7% at 7 dpa, 20-week-old fish: 15.2% at 7 dpa).</s><s>However, the two older age groups had similar growth rates at 7 and 9 dpa (36-week-old fish: 9.6% at 7 dpa and 9.8% at 9 dpa, 54-week-old fish: 7.8% at 7 dpa and 7.8% at 9 dpa).</s><s>Overall, the growth rate pattern of the aged groups indicated a delayed regenerative process.</s><s>Turquoise killifish continue to grow throughout their life under optimal conditions, although body growth usually declines with increasing age.</s><s>We noted that the 8-weekold fish had a higher overall growth rate than the old fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we recalculated the length of outgrowth by taking the body growth into consideration.</s><s>Even though relative outgrowth length changed, the difference between the age groups remained significant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because of the early difference in outgrowth kinetics (from 3 dpa onwards), we hypothesized that early events are crucial for the agerelated differences in regenerative potential.</s><s>We therefore focused on early time points and performed Alizarin Red staining at the second, third and fourth day post amputation to visualize bone formation  The regeneration process of individual fish (n = 6-12 per age group) was monitored by taking pictures every second day.</s><s>The length of outgrowth was related to the original fin size and given in percentage.</s><s>Differences between all age groups were significant from 9 dpa onwards (Tukey's HSD test at 9 dpa: 8 vs. 20 weeks, P &lt; 0.05; 20 weeks vs. 36 weeks, P &lt; 0.01; 36 vs. 54 weeks, P &lt; 0.05).</s><s>(C) The relative growth rate was determined by the increase in length between two time points.</s><s>(D) Bones of the fin rays were stained with Alizarin Red at 2, 3 and 4 dpa in all age groups.</s><s>Bone formation in the regenerating tissue was detectable at 3 dpa in the 8-and 20-week-old fish and at 4 dpa in all age groups (black arrows).</s><s>White dashed line represents amputation plane.</s></p><p><s>(E) Length of newly formed bones was measured and related to outgrowth length in 4-6 rays of 4-5 animals per time point and age group.</s><s>Significant differences between age groups were detected using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test (**P &lt; 0.01).</s><s>(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>There were no newly formed bones visible at 2 dpa in any of the age groups.</s><s>At 3 dpa, newly formed bones were visible in the 8week-old and 20-week-old fish, but not in older age groups.</s><s>Interestingly, 54-week-old fish showed a strong delay in bone formation with only 5% mineralization at 4 dpa, at which we detected 10-fold higher values for 8-week-old fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Differences in bone formation were significant between all age groups.</s><s>We were further seeking insights into the proliferative state of the cells in the regenerating tissue.</s><s>For that, we intraperitoneally injected EdU, which is incorporated into DNA during S phase, 30 min prior fixation.</s><s>At 2 and 3 dpa, EdU-positive cell nuclei were mainly found in the proximal blastema region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>Towards 4 dpa, EdU-positive cells were also observed along the epidermal region of each fin ray in the 8-week-and 20-week-old fish.</s><s>For quantification of EdU-positive cell nuclei, we analysed five sections per fin ray and used four to six fin rays per animal.</s><s>Three to five animals were used for each time point and age group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</s><s>We observed the highest percentage of EdU-positive cells (31%) at 2 dpa in the 8-week-old fish.</s><s>This number decreased to 24% at 3 dpa and to 21% at 4 dpa.</s><s>A similar distribution was observed for the other age groups, except that both old age groups had their maximum percentage of EdU-positive cells at 3 dpa.</s><s>At all time points, the 8-week-old fish showed a significant higher amount of EdU-positive cells than any other age group.</s><s>Furthermore, we analysed phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone H3 (H3P), which serves as a marker of chromosome condensation during mitosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nechiporuk &amp; Keating, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>H3P staining of regenerating fins in N. furzeri revealed a similar pattern as the EdU staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>At all time points, 8-week-old fish had the highest percentage of H3P-positive cell nuclei, followed by 20week-old fish, 36-week-old fish and 54-week-old fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).</s><s>At each time point, the difference between youngest and oldest fish was significant.</s><s>Interestingly, an overlay of EdU-and H3P-positive cells indicating a G2 phase of less than 30 min was only found at 3 and 4 dpa in the 8-week-old-fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>, inset).</s></p><p><s>To measure DNA content of newly formed cells and to determine the fraction of cells in S phase and G2/M phase, we used FACS analysis of 8-, 20-and 36-week-old fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D, E</ref>).</s><s>At all time points and in all age groups, the percentage of cells in S phase was higher than that in the nonregenerating fins (0 dpa).</s><s>In accordance with the EdU staining, the highest percentage of cells in S phase was observed at 2 dpa for the 8week-and 20-week-old fish and at 3 dpa for the 36-week-old fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>).</s><s>The highest percentage of cells in G2/M phase was found at 4 dpa for all age groups with 11.1% for the 8-week-old fish, 9.7% for the 20-week-old fish and 6.4% for the 36-week-old fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref>).</s><s>Next, we asked whether there are differences in the degree of apoptotic cells between the age groups during regeneration.</s><s>TUNEL staining revealed that very old fish (54-week-old) had the highest proportion of apoptotic cells at all time points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A,B</ref>).</s><s>Determining the amount of apoptotic cells via DNA content analysis revealed a similar pattern as the TUNEL staining.</s><s>At all time points, most apoptotic cells were present in the oldest (here: 36-week-old) fish (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also wanted to know whether we could detect age-dependent differences in gene expression within the regenerating tissue.</s><s>We selected eight genes that have been shown to be involved in fin regeneration of zebrafish and identified the orthologous genes in N. furzeri using the recently established transcript catalogue <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Petzold et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Selected genes included wnt10a, axin2a, fibroblast growth factor 20a (fgf20a), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (fgf1), muscle segment homeobox b (msxb), retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), sonic hedgehog (shh) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (lef1).</s><s>Expression of all genes was significantly increased in the regenerating fin at 2, 3 and 4 dpa compared to nonregenerating fin (0 dpa) among all age groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A-H</ref>).</s><s>Highest elevated expression levels were detected for shh, wnt10a, msxb and fgf20a (relative fold change ranged from 6-to 40-fold), while moderately elevated expression levels were observed for raldh2, lef1, fgf1r and axin2a (relative fold change ranged from two-to fivefold).</s><s>Enhanced expression of msxb and shh was specific to regenerating fin tissue as shown by in situ hybridization (Fig. <ref type="figure">5I</ref>).</s><s>When comparing peak expression within the same age group, four genes (shh, fgf20a, fgfr1 and wnt10a) had their expression maximum at 3 dpa in the 8-week-old fish, while the expression of the  <ref type="bibr">(apoptotic)</ref> was related to total cell number.</s><s>Old fish had significantly higher numbers of apoptotic cells than young fish.</s><s>Significant differences between age groups were detected using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test (*P &lt;
