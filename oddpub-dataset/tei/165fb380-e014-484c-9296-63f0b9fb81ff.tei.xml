<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>A number of neuroimaging studies have now shown that the level of brain activity that occurs immediately prior to a stimulus being presented influences how the stimulus will be perceived or responded to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boly et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hesselmann et al., 2008a</ref><ref

target="#b23">Northoff et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Coste et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Such pre-stimulus brain activity is taken to be intrinsic in nature (also described as spontaneous) as there is no specific external input in the period prior to the target stimulus being presented.</s><s>This effect has been shown in simple sensory tasks, such as tone detection, where whether or not the participant will perceive a stimulus is determined by the brain state prior to its presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sadaghiani et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It has also been observed in more complex tasks, such as viewing the Rubin's vase-face picture, where not just whether a stimulus is perceived but how it is perceived is determined by the prestimulus activity state <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hesselmann et al., 2008a)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, intrinsic activity fluctuations have also been linked to behaviour in a free-decision button press task <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Soon et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In this, intrinsic activity was found to predict what response the participant was going to make before they were aware of making the decision as to which button to press and pressing it.</s><s>Taken together, these studies show that intrinsic brain activity can be a key determinant factor in both action and perception.</s></p><p><s>A set of brain regions known as the default-mode network (DMN) shows a particularly high level of activity when no specific external task or stimuli are present (the so-called resting-state) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Raichle et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Such resting-state activity in the DMN is often taken to be analogous to the intrinsic activity studied in the previously described studies and has been linked to internally oriented and self-related processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fox et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mason et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, many DMN regions overlap with those that respond to self-related stimuli and tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Qin et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tacikowski et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nakane et al., 2015)</ref>, highlighting the possible link between activity in these areas and the self <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Qin and Northoff, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Whitfield-Gabrieli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Molnar-Szakacs and Uddin, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr"

al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These previous studies investigating the link between brain activity and self-related processes have focussed upon stimulus-induced activity, however, leaving open the question as to whether or not pre-stimulus intrinsic activity can influence self-related perception.</s><s>As many of the described intrinsic activity studies find that it is within modality-specific regions that pre-stimulus activity is related to outcomes (e.g.</s><s>within vision-related regions for visual tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">-Hesselmann et al., 2008a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sadaghiani et al., 2009)</ref>, it seems a reasonable assumption that pre-stimulus activity within DMN regions will indeed be related to self-relatedness.</s></p><p><s>The overall aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate whether pre-stimulus activity, as measured with fMRI, influences whether a stimulus will be perceived as self-related or not.</s><s>Self-relatedness is a multifaceted phenomenon, covering functions ranging from the processing of self-specific stimuli, such as one's name, to the embedding of experience in a longterm personal narrative <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Qin et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>To investigate the relationship between pre-stimulus activity and self-relatedness it is necessary to have a discrete stimulus for presentation that can be made ambiguous to allow a binary judgement.</s><s>The subject's name is ideal for this role as it is individually specific, is short and self-contained and can be effectively masked to create perceptual ambiguity.</s><s>As well as this, the presentation of one's name has also been shown to trigger other self-related processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tacikowski et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To make the processing as basic as possible and avoid any confounding effects from the external stimulus we presented contentless auditory stimuli (i.e.</s><s>white noise) but instructed the participants that either their name or the name of a stranger was audible within it.</s><s>These stimuli were created by masking recordings of the relevant names with white noise such that the names could not be distinguished, as confirmed behaviourally and from the fMRI responses.</s><s>Upon hearing the noise, participants had to judge which name they thought they heard.</s><s>The stimuli where participants reported hearing their own name were classified as self-related and those where they reported hearing another's name non-self-related.</s></p><p><s>The task was analysed in two ways.</s><s>In a first step, auditory stimuli were split into self and non-self (according to the participants judgements) and then the peak of stimulus-induced brain responses compared in order to show (a) that neural responses to self-and non-self-relatedness judgements could be distinguished; and (b) that the regions that showed a difference in response were ones that have previously been implicated in self-related processing.</s><s>This was further confirmed by applying the regions identified to a previously acquired selfrelatedness task dataset and testing for a difference in activity between self-and non-self-related stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Qin et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Based on prior results, we hypothesised that stimuli that were perceived as self-related would induce greater activity in cortical midline regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Qin and Northoff, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In a second step, we then analysed the activity 2 s prior to the presentation of the stimuli, hypothesising that pre-stimulus levels in sections of the DMN would predict the subsequent assignment of self-relatedness to the stimuli.</s><s>DMN regions were identified from a separate restingstate scan.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Eighteen healthy participants took part in the experiment (15 females, three males; mean age ¼ 27.1 years, age range ¼ 20-34 years).</s><s>Participants were screened for any current or previous neurological or psychiatric disorders.</s><s>All of the participants had first names consisting of two syllables.</s><s>One participant reported discomfort during scanning and withdrew from the experiment.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, who were paid for their time.</s><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Freie Universita ¨t Berlin.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental protocol</head><p><s>The task that participants undertook in the scanner involved being presented with an auditory stimulus and then being asked to judge whether it was their own name or another that was presented.</s><s>The stimulus consisted of actual names spoken by the same male researcher, unknown to the participant, overlaid with a burst of white noise.</s><s>The names used were the participant's own name and two other names (of a friend and a stranger).</s><s>The names of others were grouped together in the analysis.</s><s>As per the inclusion criteria, all names were two syllables long with a mean duration of 529 6 91 ms (mean 6 s.d.).</s><s>The white noise that was used to obscure the names had a longer duration (700 ms) and a greater intensity than them (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>The stimuli were presented to the participants prior to the experiment and were asked if any names could be heard.</s><s>All participants reported that they could not hear the names.</s><s>That the actual names could not be distinguished was confirmed by the behavioural results from the experiment (see 'Behavioural results' section).</s><s>During the experiment, auditory stimuli were delivered via MRI-compatible headphones to both ears.</s></p><p><s>During the experiment, there was a total of 180 trials spilt over four runs (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> for a schemata of the experiment).</s></p><p><s>Participants were asked to make a judgement as to which name was presented in two-thirds of these trials (120 trials) and to passively listen in the other third (60 trials).</s><s>The passive listening trials were not analysed here.</s><s>In each trial, the auditory stimulus was first presented (700 ms), followed by a gap of 1-3 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boly et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>A white fixation cross was shown on a black background during both these periods.</s><s>The question 'Was this your name?' (presented in German: 'War dies Ihr Name?') was then shown on the screen (white text on black) and the participants required to respond via a button press within 1 s.</s><s>Trails in which the participant did not respond within 1 s were excluded from the analysis.</s><s>Trials were separated by an inter-trial interval jittered between 11 and 13 s during which a fixation cross was displayed.</s><s>Participants were familiarised with the task prior to entering the scanner.</s><s>They were instructed that their own name would be presented in one-third of the trials.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural analysis</head><p><s>To ensure that the responses that participants gave were not influenced by the name underlying the white noise, their subjective judgements were analysed according to a signal detection theory approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Pessoa et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>For each participant, the probability of reporting 'own name' given that the target was not an own name (i.e.</s><s>false alarm), and the probability of reporting 'own name' given that the target was an own name (i.e.</s><s>hit) was calculated.</s><s>The sensitivity to their own name, d', was then calculated from the hit and false alarm rates.</s><s>A d' around zero would mean that the participants could not distinguish which name truly underlay the noise (i.e. they could not distinguish signal from noise) and that they were making self/other ascriptions unguided by any external cue.</s><s>One participant with a d' &gt;1 was excluded and the d' for the remaining participants compared with zero using a one-sample t-test (two-tailed).</s></p><p><s>The absolute frequencies of own name or other judgements were calculated and compared through a paired sample t-test.</s></p><p><s>Each participant had at least 25 instances of each response type.</s><s>Mean reaction times were compared for the two judgement types (own name or other) using a paired sample t-test.</s></p><p><s>To establish if participants were responding according to some structured pattern we tested whether one choice was more likely to be preceded by a particular other response using Mann-Whitney U-tests for each participant.</s><s>One participant did show such a pattern (P ¼ 0.012) and so was excluded from further analysis.</s><s>We also tested to so if a self or other was more likely to be preceded by a particular length of inter-trial interval, there was no such effect in any of the participants.</s></p></div>
