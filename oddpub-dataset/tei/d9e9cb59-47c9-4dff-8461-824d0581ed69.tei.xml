<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HF-REF) may become clinically apparent with moderate to severe symptoms (classified as New York Heart Association [NYHA] class III or IV) or rather mild symptoms (NYHA class I or II).</s><s>Because of the lack of overt disease in patients with mild symptoms, it is reasonable to expect that HF may frequently remain undiagnosed and often undertreated.</s></p><p><s>To date, the major clinical trials for the treatment of HF have primarily included patients with REF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤35%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> There is broad evidence to support the use of 3 classes of neurohumoral antagonists: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), β-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), in patients with HF-REF and NYHA class III/IV symptoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>More recent evidence suggests that neurohumoral antagonists are also beneficial for patients with HF-REF and NYHA class II symptoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>-9 This has been incorporated into the 2012 version of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure, which state that optimal medical therapy (OMT) for patients with HF-REF and a NYHA class ≥ II should include all 3 classes of neurohumoral antagonists (ie, ACEI/ARB, β-blocker, and MRA) plus a diuretic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">10</ref></s><s>he Registry in Germany Focusing on Level-Specific and Evidence-Based Decision Finding in the Treatment of Heart Failure (REFLECT-HF) survey was a crosssectional, observational, multicenter survey of treatment patterns of hospital-based cardiologists (HBCs), officebased cardiologists (OBCs), and general practitioners (GPs).</s><s>The aim of the present analysis was to assess the use of OMT in patients with REF but mild symptoms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The REFLECT-HF survey was conducted in 10 regional clusters across Germany, in which either an HBC (n = 5) or an OBC (n = 5) served as a main center, with 5 satellites per center that were either OBCs (when the center was an HBC) or GPs (when the center was an OBC) in the respective area.</s><s>In the end, a total of 384 patients were included at 5 HBCs, 26 OBCs, and 18 GPs.</s><s>Physicians received a compensation of ¤100 per patient for the complete documentation of their patients.</s></p><p><s>The recruitment target was consecutive patients (age ≥18 years) with a documented history of chronic HF, with 20 patients for each HBC, 10 for each OBC, and 5 for each GP.</s><s>Patients were required to have a NYHA class of ≥ II, and/or a LVEF &lt;50%.</s><s>Patients who were unable to complete the questionnaires because of psychiatric reasons, dementia, or other neurological diseases were excluded.</s></p><p><s>Information was collected on each participating physician, on patient demographics, the diagnosis of heart failure (NYHA class, LVEF), medical history, device and pharmacological treatments (drug classes were recorded, but not specific compounds or dose levels), quality of life (using the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure [MLHF] questionnaire), hospitalization-related parameters, electrocardiography (rhythm, branch blocks, heart rate, and QRS interval), and laboratory values.</s></p><p><s>The study protocol was approved by the International Ethics Committee in Freiburg, Germany, on September 26, 2011.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>Quantitative data (eg, patient age) in the tables and figures are presented by using either mean ± SD or 95% confidence intervals, and qualitative data (eg, patient sex) are expressed as respective proportions.</s><s>Group differences were evaluated by applying χ 2 tests for qualitative and Wilcoxon tests for quantitative data; P values for the latter were derived from the 2-sided test situation.</s></p><p><s>Simple and multiple logistic regression models were also performed.</s><s>For models accounting for multiple variables, stepwise selection was applied based on the P values of the parameter estimates: Only such variables remained in the final model where respective P values of the Wald statistic were &lt;0.1.</s><s>Variables with a large amount of missing values were not included into the model-selection process to reach a high number of evaluable patients for the model calculation.</s><s>Other possible reasons for variables not being included were lack of variability or collinearity issues.</s><s>Results of the logistic regression models are presented in terms of estimated odds ratio and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.</s><s>All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Characteristics</head><p><s>The REFLECT-HF survey included a total of 384 patients documented at 48 physicians between January 16 and August 30, 2012.</s><s>This analysis includes data from 364 As depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>, the majority of patients seen by HBCs had NYHA class III/IV (70.0%</s><s>vs 30.0%), whereas OBCs and GPs saw a greater proportion of patients with NYHA class II (60.8% and 59.8%, respectively) compared with NYHA class III/IV (39.2% and 40.2%, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001 for NYHA class II vs III/IV, all 3 physician groups).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment Patterns</head><p><s>The majority of patients with REF received ACEIs and/or ARBs (94.7% in NYHA class II vs 92.0% in NYHA class III/IV), β-blockers (93.0%</s><s>vs 92.0%, respectively), and diuretics (80.7% vs 88.5%, respectively), with no significant differences between the REF/NYHA class II and REF/NYHA class III/IV groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>There were, however, nominal differences for the proportion of patients receiving diuretics (80.7% and 88.5%), MRAs (54.4% and 64.4%), anticoagulants (38.6% and 51.7%), and for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD; 0.0% and 8.3%</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors Associated With Optimal Medical Therapy</head><p><s>The frequency at which OMT was prescribed was greater for patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms who saw an OBC, as compared with an HBC or a GP (P = 0.0453).</s><s>No other significant differences were observed in the frequency of OMT prescription when assessed by physician group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>For patients with REF and either NYHA class II or class III/IV symptoms, there were no notable differences in the prescription of OMT with respect to physician sex, their working experience, the type of physician (HBC, OBC, or GP), the number of HF patients treated per day, patient sex, or the patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate.</s><s>On the other hand, in the NYHA class III/IV group, the REF group, as well as the REF/NYHA class II and REF/NYHA class III/IV groups, older patients (&gt; median vs ≤ median) had a reduced likelihood of receiving OMT (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, irrespective of LVEF, physicians with a long work experience (&gt; median vs ≤ median) were less likely to prescribe OMT to patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms, as were GPs vs OBCs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors Associated With Being New York Heart Association Class II Despite Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ≤35%</head><p><s>Univariate analyses for being NYHA class II with REF were performed using the following 6 variables: age (&gt; median), female sex, body mass index (&gt; median), ischemic origin of HF or prior myocardial infarction, hypertensive heart disease, and heart rate (&gt; median).</s><s>The only one of these 6 variables that influenced the probability of being NYHA II with REF was female sex, which was a negative correlation.</s><s>Multivariate analyses demonstrated that female sex was independently associated with a reduced likelihood of being NYHA class II despite REF (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors Predictive of Receiving Optimal Medical Therapy</head><p><s>The frequency of patients in the present subanalysis who were receiving OMT was highest in the REF/NYHA class III/IV group (53%) and lowest in the LVEF &gt;35% subgroup (30%), with an intermediate value for the REF/NYHA class II group (42%).</s><s>Because the rate of prescription of the 3 well-established drug classes for HF was high and relatively uniform across groups, the less-than-adequate administration of OMT appears to be primarily associated with the underuse of MRAs.</s><s>In the case of older patients, physicians may be less willing to prescribe MRAs, possibly because of the presence of risk factors such as reduced renal function.</s><s>A survey performed in France also indicated that underprescription of OMT was more frequent among older patients, as well as those with renal dysfunction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">27</ref></s><s>In addition, a recently published study highlighted the requirement for better adherence to guidelines for monitoring creatinine and potassium levels in patients with HF following the initiation of an MRA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">28</ref></s><s>Improvements in monitoring of renal function in patients receiving MRAs would allow dosage modifications or discontinuation of treatment, potentially resulting in fewer adverse events and this class of drug being associated with a better benefit-risk profile.</s></p><p><s>With regard to the increased likelihood of receiving OMT for patients who saw an OBC, this may in part be reflective of differences in the patient population at each type of clinical setting.</s><s>For example, the REFLECT-HF analysis indicated that patients cared for by GPs were more often females, and tended to be older, with reduced renal function and a lower NYHA class.</s><s>The frequency of patients with atrial fibrillation was also higher for GPs.</s><s>Furthermore, it may be expected that patients who require treatment in a hospital setting have greater morbidity than those who visit OBCs or GPs.</s><s>In the present subanalysis, differences were also observed in the patient population seen by each physician type, with HBCs caring predominantly for patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms.</s><s>The patient population seen by each type of physician may contribute to variations in the implementation of guidelines for 2 reasons: (1) the inherent characteristics of a patient may preclude treatment with a particular agent (ie, patients may have other comorbidities or contraindications that complicate drug prescription); and (2) the relative experience of each type of physician with particular patient populations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Limitations</head><p><s>Although the REFLECT-HF survey comprised data from the 3 main groups of physicians who treat patients with HF in Germany, and is thus reflective of real-world clinical practice, the study has some limitations.</s><s>In particular, because REFLECT-HF was a cross-sectional study, data on the time since diagnosis of HF, as well as morbidity and mortality rates, were not obtained.</s><s>Other limitations of this study have already been discussed in the primary publication of the REFLECT-HF survey. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11</ref></s><s>These include a change of guideline recommendations recommending the use of MRAs in patients with NYHA class II HF and REF.</s></p><p><s>Finally, though the findings may apply to the German health care system, they should be validated in different health care systems.</s></p></div>
