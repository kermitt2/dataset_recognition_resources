<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The practice of dichotomisation has been strongly criticised due to the clear loss of information and because dichotomisation fails to show the true relationship between an outcome and its possible predictors as shown by Breitling et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The distributional method for the dichotomisation of continuous outcomes provides a solution to some of these difficulties.</s><s>We have shown in this paper how this method could be applied to the results of a linear regression.</s><s>The precision or the significance of a statistical test will not depend on the choice of threshold contrary to when the data are directly dichotomised as pointed out by Altman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> because the only statistical test performed is based on the comparison of mean values of the continuous outcome.</s><s>The distributional estimates obtained from a linear regression reflect the same relationship between covariates as with the continuous outcome.</s><s>Previous work has been concerned of the effect of dichotomisation in individual studies when meta-analyses are performed.</s><s>Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20]</ref> have recently proposed a method for meta-analysis with heterogeneous outcomes using summary statistics and Ofuya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>  dichotomisation of continuous outcomes, because it could be applied using only summary statistics, could be useful when the study outcomes were heterogeneous.</s><s>However, the distributional method applied to adjusted means required the knowledge of the marginal means for the various levels of exposure which are not usually provided in study reports and therefore limits the use of the method presented in this article in meta-analyses.</s></p><p><s>When the error term is not normally distributed and this cannot be corrected by adding the relevant explanatory variable (e.g.</s><s>gestational-age to explain the tail in the distribution of birthweights) then there is an alternative distributional method which can be used for perturbation to the normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref> using the skew-normal distribution as we did for gestational-age.</s><s>If the standard deviation is not the same in different levels of exposure, a correction factor can be applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with other regression models</head><p><s>We have compared the results obtained by using the distributional method for the dichotomisation of continuous outcomes to other existing modelling approaches using the same covariates.</s></p><p><s>We wanted to show how the distributional method compares to other regression models where the effect of a risk factor in predicting the group at risk can be estimated.</s><s>The logistic regression model is the 'data' equivalent of the distributional method for dichotomisation applied to linear regression, i.e. it is the analogue of the use of the data in estimating the proportion at risk (i.e.</s><s>number at risk divided by the total) as opposed to estimating this proportion from the distribution of residuals and regression parameters estimates.</s><s>Because the distributional method gives results based on marginal effects, we compared results of the distributional method with results of the logistic regression based on the marginal proportions.</s><s>Moreover it has been recommended that researchers provide results of a logistic regression based on marginal effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref> to improve the comparability across studies.</s><s>The results of the logistic regression were less precise than the ones using the distributional method because the later has an equivalent precision to a linear regression and uses all of the data, unlike logistic regression which uses the dichotomous outcome corresponding to what has been observed in terms of sample size in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and using simulation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> in previous work.</s><s>Hence, while the distributional method and logistic regression are modelling the same object, the estimates are obtained using two different modelling strategies which can lead to differences in estimates for the comparison of proportions.</s><s>Moreover, and this is the problem the distributional method aims to solve, proportions estimated from the data (logistic regression) can be volatile if the sample size is small.</s><s>In regression models with several covariates, some subgroups can be small leading to unstable estimated probabilities that are strongly affected by small differences in the data.</s><s>Logistic regression might be the only alternative when model assumptions for the distributional method for dichotomisation are not satisfied and it can also be applied if the continuous outcome has been previously dichotomised and is no more available.</s></p><p><s>Quantile regression is a useful tool to estimate the effect of a risk factor as a predictor of being in a group at risk but it is not a modelling tool for proportions.</s><s>The group at risk can only be identified as being included in a particular tail of the distribution, e.g.</s><s>10th percentile.</s><s>If a threshold exists, its value can be compared to the values of the percentile modelled.</s><s>If the relationship between covariates is dependent on which part of the distribution the outcome is in then the assumptions of a linear model are not satisfied.</s><s>In this situation a linear model would be misspecified and a quantile regression is an alternative which can provide useful information.</s><s>Obtaining a plot of quantile regression parameters per quantile is also a useful exploratory tool to assess the hypothesis of distribution shift.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future work</head><p><s>A limitation of the methodology is that it can be only applied if the hypotheses underlying the linear model are satisfied, i.e. the error term is normally distributed and the standard error is constant over all subgroups (distribution shift).</s><s>If these assumptions are strongly violated the results might not be reliable.</s><s>In this work we have not performed new simulations for the comparison between the various methods due to its illustrative nature.</s><s>However, evidence have been obtained in previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for unadjusted differences where the method was validated and compared to a direct comparison of proportions.</s><s>Nonetheless it would be interesting to obtain a systematic power comparison between logistic regression and distributional method for the dichotomisation of continuous outcomes for various types and numbers of covariates.</s><s>This goes beyond the scope of this paper and should be the topic of further work.</s></p><p><s>The present work considered only categorical exposure levels.</s><s>A review of the practice in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref> showed that in 86 % of the reviewed papers, continuous exposures were categorised.</s><s>Developing the method for continuous exposure is the object of further work.</s><s>Also the extension of the method to other distributions for the residuals of the linear regression have not yet been addressed.</s></p><p><s>The misclassification of dichotomised variables is a consequence of measurement errors in the continuous variable.</s><s>It has been shown that a measurement error in the outcome (unlike for covariates) can be ignored in a linear regression because the additive modelling of the error does not affect the relationship with covariates.</s><s>Only the power and precision are affected by adding an error term <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However this is not the case for the dichotomised outcome because the misclassification into the wrong category has no equivalent additive model.</s><s>In that case misclassification is a source of bias.</s></p><p><s>This means that the presence of an independent measurement error in the continuous outcome (i.e.</s><s>independent of the outcome and its covariates) does not affect the linear relationship between covariates and outcome.</s><s>This is the basis of the estimation of the distributional comparison of proportions.</s><s>Therefore those estimates are free of misclassification bias whereas those obtained from logistic regression are not.</s><s>However this issue should be further investigated.</s><s>It has been argued by Shentu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref> that in the presence of more complex forms of systematic error in the continuous outcome, a dichotomised outcome may perform better than the continuous one.</s></p></div>
