INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Radiation therapy aims to control the cell growth of tumor targets by delivering radiation dose to the target.</s><s>To spare healthy tissue during treatment, high precision of the beam delivery and the beam shape is required, but anatomical motion during treatment causes misalignment between anatomy and beam shape.</s><s>To reduce this intrafractional misalignment, tumor tracking has been introduced to synchronize the beam shape with the tumor motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref> .</s><s>This synchronization is done by modifying the position of the beam during treatment.</s></p><p><s>Intrafractional target motion in MLC tracking radiotherapy requires the MLC to deliver online modified beam shapes.</s><s>These shapes are different from the previous planned tumor shapes.</s><s>After the target has moved during treatment and the new position is detected in real time, the MLC adapts the planned shape and delivers a modified beam shape.</s><s>Managing complex motion pattern as well as complex beam shapes demand a systematic approach for MLC adaptation.</s><s>Additionally, this shape adaption results in three different types of MLC aperture errors 7 .</s><s>The first error, which due to the tar-get position can only be estimated, is called localization error.</s><s>Second, the leaf fitting errors are caused by the finite leaf width and finally, the leaf adjustment errors 55 are due to the finite leaf speed.</s><s>Full-fledged re-planning in real-time would be the most ideal solution to overcome these problems.</s><s>However, this is impractical due to heavy computation and on as-yet unresolved quality assurance issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> .</s></p></div>
