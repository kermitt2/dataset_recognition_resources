type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref> and first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Explorations into non-proton MR applications involved localized 31 P cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and cardiac gated sodium imaging of the heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21]</ref>.</s><s>The implications of these pilot studies feed into a broad spectrum of cardiology, radiology, biomedical engineering and other related fields of clinical research.</s><s>Arguably, it is too early in the development process to make ultimate statements since UHF-CMR is still in its infancy and the potential of UHF-MR is as yet untapped.</s><s>It is no secret that the advantages of UHF-CMR are sometimes offset by a number of concomitant physics related phenomena and practical obstacles which can make it a challenge to even compete with the capabilities of CMR at lower fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>As UHF-CMR applications become increasingly used for research, they should however help to advance the capabilities of MR for the assessment of cardiovascular diseases but still need to continue to be very carefully validated against CMR applications established at 1.5 T and 3.0 T.</s></p><p><s>En route to broader UHF-CMR studies it is of relevance to examine how UHF-CMR examinations are tolerated by subjects.</s><s>Practical concerns evoked by the physical size, the mere bore length of today's 7.0 T MR scanner and the paucity of data about ergonomic constraints, (dis) comfort and sensory side effects are driving the notion that UHF-MR constitutes a challenge for subject tolerance of 7.0 T examinations per se.</s><s>Recognizing this potential, UHF-MR institutions observe subjective acceptance during UHF-MR examinations very carefully <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The lack of data prompted research into human exposure to ultrahigh magnetic fields and related biophysical and biological effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref><ref

target="#b37">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Explorations into subject tolerance, subjective perception and sensory side effects during UHF-MR examinations include pioneering single-and multi-centre studies covering static magnetic fields of 7.0 T and higher, RF power deposition induced temperature sensations and spatially varying or rapidly switching magnetic field gradients as potential root causes for discomfort <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While being very important and valuable the results obtained from these pioneering studies are largely constrained to brain imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref> so that the conclusions drawn on subjective acceptance do not involve the specific characteristics of UHF-CMR.</s><s>These particularities include the use of local cardiac-optimized transceiver RF coil arrays covering the upper torso by means of anterior and posterior coil sections rather than volume RF coils surrounding the head.</s><s>This difference in the setup has implications for subjective discomfort and distress potentially caused by space constraints and the weight of the anterior RF coil section, as well as for RF power deposition considerations and for thermal isolation of the upper torso induced by the relatively large-area RF coil covers.</s><s>It is common in brain MRI to attach a mirror to the head coil, which enhances subject comfort by allowing a view out of the magnet bore or onto a display featuring animations; an approach which is not common in CMR.</s><s>Unlike brain MRI the head is not positioned in the magnet's iso-center for UHF-CMR which might affect the propensity to vertigo, dizziness, metallic taste and light flashes.</s><s>Likewise, the travel distance of the subject being positioned on the patient table from the home position to the target position is pronounced for UHF-CMR versus brain imaging.</s><s>With the upper torso being positioned in the magnet's iso-center for an UHF-CMR examination rapidly switching magnetic field gradients bear the potential to provoke peripheral nerve stimulations (PNS) rates owing to induced electric currents in the body which might differ from PNS rates and regions reported for brain UHF-MR.</s><s>Extra sensors, ancillary hardware and cabling used to record and track physiological motion for gating/triggering might provide another factor that governs subjective tolerance during UHF-CMR.</s></p><p><s>Realizing the limitations of previous reports on subjective tolerance during UHF-MR and recognizing the particularities of cardiac MR this study examines the subjective acceptance during UHF-CMR examinations.</s><s>To meet this goal, a cohort of healthy 165 subjects who underwent a cardiac MR examination at 7.0 T in our institution was asked to fill out a questionnaire under supervision of a study nurse.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study adds to the literature by detailing the subjective acceptance of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging examinations at a magnetic field strength of 7.0 T.</s><s>Among the two most common experiences that generated discomfort was transient muscular contraction or involuntary muscle twitching due to peripheral nerve stimulation induced by switching of magnetic field gradients.</s><s>This observation does not accord with previous reports on the subjective tolerance obtained for brain imaging at 7.0 T and at 9.4 T <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>, which outlined lower incidence rates of transient symptoms of muscular contraction and peripheral nerve stimulation.</s><s>Notwithstanding this difference these reports included the same gradient coil and technical specifications for maximum slew rate, maximum gradient amplitude and maximum duty cycle used here <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>.</s><s>Even if more powerful gradient coils were used for brain MRI including maximum gradient amplitudes of up to 70 mT/m and slew rates of 400 mT/m/ms twitching and muscular contraction was less frequently reported as a cause of discomfort versus dizziness <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>.</s><s>It should be noted that the switching frequencies used for CMR are commonly ranging between 300-600 Hz and hence are similar or even below the switching frequencies generally employed for anatomical (approximately 200-600 Hz) and functional brain imaging (approximately 1000-3000 Hz).</s><s>Also, it is fair to assume that the peak integrals of the magnetic field gradients are smaller for CMR versus brain imaging due to the use of larger slice thicknesses and field of views.</s><s>However, to meet the speed constraints of CMR it is common that the maximum gradient amplitudes used for slice selection, phase encoding, dephasing read-out and spoiler gradients are larger for CMR versus brain MRI.</s><s>Our data suggest that male subjects are more strongly affected by involuntary muscle contraction due to peripheral nerve stimulation.</s><s>This difference might be related to differences in body cross-section which effects the size of the current loops, and hence the magnitude of the current density.</s><s>An experimental study at a lower magnetic field strength noted that the gender of the subject affects the magnitude of the peripheral nerve stimulation threshold but not the position of the stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Mean stimulation thresholds of healthy male subjects were found to be lower than those of healthy female subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref>.</s><s>This observation was attributed to the larger stature of males <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref>.</s><s>To this end it should be noted, that the average height of the male subjects involved in our study was 7% larger than the average height of the female subjects.</s></p><p><s>Vertigo was found to be the second effect among the two most frequent causes for discomfort in our UHF-CMR study cohort.</s><s>Magnetic field related vertigo like sensations are thought to result from magnetic susceptibility differences between vestibular organs and surrounding fluid, and from induced currents acting on the vestibular hair cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref>.</s><s>Thresholds for motion induced vertigo have been estimated to be around 1 T/s for greater than 1 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53]</ref>.</s><s>This translates into a recommendation derived from numerical simulations that a moving speed of 1 m/s should not be exceeded when accessing an area closer than 1 m to the front/rear ends of a 7.0 T magnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref>.</s><s>The recent ICNIRP guidelines for limiting exposure to electric fields induced by movement of the human body in a static magnetic field and by time-varying fields below 1Hz recommends that the change of the magnetic flux density B should not exceed 2 T during any 3 s period <ref type="bibr">[55]</ref>.</s><s>For the same reason there is a need to ensure that subjects are moved slowly into the 7.0 T magnet bore resulting in a recommendation that patient table motion is set to be lower than 0.66 T/s.</s><s>To meet this requirement the speed profile of the table motion is adjusted to B 0 Ã(grad(B 0 )) by some vendors including the MR system used in our UHF-CMR study.</s><s>This might explain why previous brain UHF-MR studies reported an incidence rate of approximately 25-34% for vertigo and dizziness <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">56]</ref>, which is more pronounced than the 12.7% rate observed in our UHF-MR study.</s><s>In the previous studies subjects were positioned on a non-motorized table and were moved manually into the scanner bore at a constant speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, a constant speed was used for automatic table motion <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Unlike our UHF-CMR study no attempt was made to reduce the table speed in the vicinity of the highest gradient of the magnetic field <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The 12.7% incidence rate of vertigo observed in our UHF-MR study is in line with a very recent publication which reported vertigo for 10.5% out of 504 subjects enrolled into UHF-MR examinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref>.</s><s>For this study a constant table speed of 20 mm/s <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref> was used which is similar to v poti = 25 mm/s used in our study.</s><s>Our data do not match a very recent report that women are more strongly affected by dizziness in static magnetic fields of 7.0 T <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[58]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It should be also noted that it is common to use extra pads to reduce bulk head motion in brain UHF-MR.</s><s>This measure should work in favor of reducing motion induced vertigo.</s><s>On the other hand, pillows or full size pads that conveniently conform to the shape of the head commonly used in CMR might provide enhanced comfort versus thin layer pads commonly used in brain imaging and hence might contribute to a lower incidence of magnetic field induced vertigo.</s></p><p><s>In addition to vertigo and nausea being potentially induced by movement in a static magnetic field, a direct interaction of the magnetic field with the vestibular system cannot be excluded [55].</s><s>Glover et.al.</s><s>reported an altered sense of balance for subjects positioned stationary in proximity to a 7.0 T MR magnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref>.</s><s>Notwithstanding the potential role of spatially-varying magnetic fields for induction of vertigo, important recent findings provide strong evidence that static magnetic fields stimulate rotational sensors in the brain resulting in involuntary slowphase eye movements, designated as nystagmus <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref> which is thought to share a common mechanism with static magnetic field evoked vertigo <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[60]</ref>.</s><s>This indicates that magnetic vestibular stimulation makes magnetic field induced nystagmus and vertigo possible while simply lying in the static magnetic field of an MR scanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">61]</ref>.</s><s>Nystagmus strength depends on the static magnetic field strength, not motion through the magnetic field.</s><s>Eye movement measurements using infrared video cameras while the subjects laid still in a 7.0 T MR scanner showed that horizontal nystagmus direction is related to the static head pitch angle, which describes the angulation of the chin towards the chest <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref>.</s><s>For a head pitch angle of approximately 10°t o 30°-which resembles a static head pitch commonly used in a CMR setup-a horizontal slow phase eye motion velocity close to zero was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref>.</s><s>In comparison, the largest slow phase eye motion velocity was observed for a head patch angle of approximately -10°; an arrangement which approximately resembles the positioning of the head in a head RF coil <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref> used for brain MRI.</s><s>This phenomenon might provide another plausible interpretation for the decreased occurrence of vertigo reported in our UHF-CMR study versus previous ultrahigh field brain imaging examinations.</s></p><p><s>Five percent of the 165 volunteers reported that dizziness persisted after the UHF-MR examination but disappeared within 10 min after completion of the study.</s><s>This observation was underscored by a very recent study, which carefully examined the duration of such effects by quantitatively assessing the vestibular performance including measurements of postural instability and rotational divergences <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref>.</s><s>To this end, a recent report demonstrated that Diphenhydramine-a medication used to prevent motion sickness-reduces the strength of vertigo and nausea in UHF-MR-even at a low dose-and may be even used preventively <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[62]</ref>.</s><s>Yet, this application should be considered very carefully on a case-by-case basis, taking potential side effects and interactions into account.</s></p><p><s>Approximately 10% of the study population reported metallic taste which accords very well with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref>.</s><s>A similar accordance was found for the occurrences of electromagnetically-induced visual flashes of light due to retina stimulation reported in our study with previous UHF-MR brain imaging studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>.</s><s>None of the subjects reported claustrophobia, which is in agreement with recent UHF-MR studies that reported seven scan abortions due to claustrophobia out of 3467 examinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref>.</s><s>This rate might appear to be rather low when compared to previous observations at clinical field strengths of 1.5 T and 3.0 T but can be explained by the solely voluntarily nature of the subject recruitment and the careful preparation of the volunteers.</s></p><p><s>Acoustic noise was not reported as a reason for discomfort in our study.</s><s>This observation seems to contradict recent results derived from brain imaging at ultrahigh fields, which showed acoustic noise as the second frequent cause for discomfort with incidence rates of up to 33% of the study population <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>.</s><s>This difference is not as much of a surprise as it appears to be at first glance.</s><s>Sophisticated UHF brain MR includes anatomical and functional scans with scans times of 10 min and even much longer running at sound pressure levels of up to 112 dB.</s><s>This setup bears the potential to constitute acoustic noise induced discomfort.</s><s>In comparison, short breath-hold, cardiac gated scans were used in our UHF-CMR study, which offsets the potential for acoustic noise related discomfort.</s><s>Another reason for the difference between the rates reported for acoustic noise induced discomfort in our study and previous brain imaging studies might be the use of different acoustic noise protection approaches.</s><s>In this study earplugs plus headphones were used for acoustic noise protection.</s><s>Space constraints dictated by the RF coil configurations tailored for brain imaging-where it is common to use a helmet design that closely fits to the head for signal reception-render the use of headphones unsuitable so that acoustic noise protection is primarily accomplished with earplugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The requirements of patient comfort are likely to pave the way for further advances in technology tailored for CMR at 7.0 Tesla, including novel safety concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[63]</ref> and innovative RF coil designs.</s><s>Though the broad spectrum of applications makes it somewhat challenging to identify a single optimal RF coil design for UHF-CMR, the selected design should meet certain minimum requirements.</s><s>This should include RF coil casings that afford thermal exchange to offset heat related sensory effects as a root cause for subjective discomfort.</s><s>These efforts might go as far as printing circuits onto T-shirts or vests that fit the upper torso <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">65]</ref>.</s><s>One could also envision flexible coil designs attached to vacuum pillows, which hold the promise to provide a subject specific fit to the torso while ensuring customized, semi-permanent stabilization.</s><s>Another important development is the move towards shorter 7.0 T MR systems, which will be far more compatible with installations in clinical imaging suites but which will also help to improve the subjective acceptance during UHF-CMR examinations.</s></p><p><s>It is a recognized limitation of this study, that only 165 subjects were involved.</s><s>Taking into account that cardiac MR at 7.0 T is a field in a state of creative flux we felt that it is important to begin by reporting on the details and on the implications of subjective acceptance of UHF-CMR for clinical imaging before the new technology will be placed in the hands of a broader group of clinical colleagues.</s><s>Also, the study is constrained to subjects undergoing UHF-MR examinations without considering side effects and transient symptoms due to occupational exposure of research and healthcare staff to static or varying magnetic stray fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[66]</ref>.</s></p></div>
