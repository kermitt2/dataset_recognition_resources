<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA did not interfere with DOXO cell-killing capacity</head><p><s>To investigate whether treatment with FA reduces the main tumour cell-killing effects of DOXO, we employed the human cervical epithelial adenocarcinoma HeLa cell line and the human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cell line treating them with different doses of DOXO and FA.</s><s>DOXO in the absence or presence of FA at various concentrations exerted similar cytotoxic effects in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the antitumour activity of DOXO was not affected by FA.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA blunted DOXO-induced mortality</head><p><s>DOXO resulted in 70% mortality 10 days after injection, which was decreased to 45% by pre-treatment with FA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>At baseline, body weights were similar in all groups.</s><s>DOXO produced a significant loss of body weight versus the corresponding sham group, which was not significantly affected by FA (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA normalized DOXO-induced left ventricular structural and functional changes</head><p><s>DOXO led to significant reductions in LVIDd and LVIDs, LV weight and LV lumen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A-D</ref>).</s><s>These DOXO-induced structural changes had the functional consequence of decreased stroke volume versus the corresponding sham group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2E</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, pre-treatment with FA attenuated all these deleterious changes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A-E</ref>).</s><s>Heart rate was not significantly affected in any group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2F</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA attenuated DOXO-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy, cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis</head><p><s>Investigating the underlying cellular mechanisms, we found that the LV myocardium of mice receiving DOXO alone displayed a reduction in cardiomyocyte width and increases in collagen content and apoptosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A-D</ref>).</s><s>FA exerted significant protective effects against these DOXO-induced deleterious effects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A-D</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA prevented DOXO-dependent impairment of mitochondrial function and ultrastructure</head><p><s>DOXO has been shown to inhibit complex I of the electron transport chain and concomitantly induces mitochondrial dysfunction, while nitrate supplementation has been shown to protect mitochondrial oxygen respiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we hypothesized that FA, as NOS modulator, might exert further protective effects against mitochondrial dysfunction.</s><s>As in our preliminary measurements we did not find any significant differences between the sham and FA-sham groups, we merged the two groups into a single one to lower the number of animals used.</s><s>We found that while ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (state 3) was diminished in the DOXO group, it was maintained in mice pre-treated with FA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Ultrastructural analysis of the sham group showed normal mitochondrial structure with preserved internal architecture and surrounding organized myofibrils (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>).</s><s>Samples of DOXO mice demonstrated prominent patchy myofibrillar loss and disarray.</s><s>Moreover, mitochondria showed significant abnormalities, such as enlargement, contour irregularities, increased spacing between cristae and disruption of the internal architecture.</s><s>Pre-treatment with FA markedly prevented DOXO-induced mitochondrial ultrastructural degeneration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA blunted DOXO-induced oxidative stress, eNOS and antioxidant dysregulation</head><p><s>To unravel the molecular underpinnings of the FA-mediated protection against the deleterious effects of DOXO, we studied the effects of FA on DOXO-induced oxidative stress.</s><s>Indeed, superoxide anion production was significantly increased in LV homogenates from DOXO mice versus sham mice, which appeared to be largely NOS-dependent, as it was markedly attenuated by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A-D</ref>).</s><s>DOXO did not lead to changes in nNOS and iNOS levels or the respective monomer:dimer ratios (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S2</ref>).</s><s>However, DOXO increased the eNOS monomer:dimer ratio, indicative of eNOS uncoupling, and decreased eNOS phosphorylation at S1177, indicative of reduced eNOS activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5E and F</ref>).</s><s>S-glutathionylation of eNOS has been recently found as the trigger of eNOS uncoupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we assessed the levels of eNOS S-glutathionylation and found a significant increase related to DOXO versus sham (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5G</ref>).</s><s>S-glutathionylation occurs due to elevation of glutathione disulphide (GSSG, oxidized glutathione) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The ratio GSSG to glutathione (GSH, reduced glutathione) was increased in DOXO versus sham group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5H</ref>).</s><s>In parallel, more than 50% superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was decreased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5I</ref>).</s><s>DOXO reduced myocardial NO production by 50% versus sham mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5J</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Notably, pre-treatment with FA restored eNOS and antioxidant enzymes dysregulation, which were associated with an increase in NO production and a decrease in NOS-dependent superoxide anion formation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A-J</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA modulated DOXO-induced transcriptomic changes</head><p><s>To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of FA-mediated protection against DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of LV samples.</s><s>To extract biologically useful information, we examined those genes with an unadjusted P &lt; 0.01 as performed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Our analysis revealed that 152 transcript clusters were regulated by DOXO alone versus the sham group (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>), while 68 transcript clusters were differentially regulated between the FA-DOXO and DOXO groups (Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, 71 transcript clusters were found significant by the interaction analysis (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s><s>Among the most up-regulated genes by DOXO, we identified a ca.</s><s>10-fold increase in metallothionein-2 (Mt2), a gene that is involved in oxidative stress, and apoptotic factor lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) with a ca.</s><s>fivefold increase compared with controls.</s><s>Furthermore, we found that the desmosomal gene Adam4 was repressed in DOXO-treated mice by ca.</s><s>30%, while its expression was restored in FA-DOXO-treated mice.</s><s>Also, several members of the cysteine protease inhibitors (stefins) were induced in DOXO-treated mice versus controls, while their expression was normalized by FA.</s></p><p><s>To validate genes involved in DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy and modulated by FA, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis selecting several candidates that exhibited significant induction.</s><s>Similar to the microarray data analysis, we found that DOXO induced the expression of Mt2, Lcn2, and Serpina3n, which was decreased by FA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6A-C</ref>).</s><s>We further analysed the expression of foetal genes and found a decrease in Acta1 and an increase in Nppa and Nppb expression in the DOXO group, which was normalized in the FA-DOXO group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6D-F</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In a mouse model of DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy, we report for the first time that pre-treatment with FA, an eNOS modulator, attenuated DOXO-induced mortality and markedly reduced LV structural damage.</s><s>Oral supplementation of FA attenuated cardiomyocyte atrophy, cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis, maintained mitochondrial integrity and reduced superoxide anion production.</s><s>Mechanistically, our data suggest that these cardioprotective effects of FA may be mediated via eNOS recoupling, with enhanced phosphorylation

interstitial fibrosis and apoptosis are prominent features of DOXOinduced cardiomyopathy and likely contributed to the effects of DOXO on LV dysfunction.</s><s>FA not only attenuated these pathological changes, but also reduced DOXO-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy, thereby blunting the loss of LV mass.</s><s>Furthermore, it was demonstrated that DOXO results in desmin disruption and myofibrillar disorganization <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>As desmin adheres to mitochondria, desmin disarray might be related with mitochondrial dysfunction.</s><s>Along this line, previous studies have suggested the involvement of mitochondria in DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, we confirmed DOXO-induced mitochondrial  FA regulates intracellular eNOS signalling via indirect or direct mechanisms, including eNOS phosphorylation at multiple residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, leading to NO release and restoring the balance between NO and superoxide anion production, which is associated with cardioprotection.</s><s>However, the role of eNOS in DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy remains incompletely understood.</s><s>It was reported that DOXO generates superoxide anion, which was decreased in eNOS KO mice and increased in mice with overexpression of eNOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>These results suggested that DOXO induces superoxide anion via an eNOS-dependent mechanism, and removal of dysfunctional eNOS is beneficial against DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy.</s><s>However, the authors did not find eNOS uncoupling at day 5 in WT mice, while we found eNOS uncoupling at day 10.</s><s>Importantly, we found that pre-treatment with FA prevented eNOS uncoupling and normalized the phosphorylation of eNOS at S1177, resulting in decreased superoxide anion generation and restored myocardial NO production, thereby leading to an adaptive response preserving cardiac function, ultimately providing cardioprotection and improving mortality.</s><s>Therefore, it would be very informative to obtain data on eNOS uncoupling on a later time-point  or in mice overexpressing eNOS, which could be compared with the data presented here.</s></p><p><s>We also found a significantly decreased total LV SOD activity in DOXO mice, which was blunted by pre-treatment with FA.</s><s>In addition, S-glutathionylation of eNOS, which can be a direct result of elevated GSSG levels or an indirect result of the formation of unstable protein radicals, may adversely modulate eNOS structure and function and generate superoxide anion <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it is important to understand the effect of this oxidative modification and modulate S-glutathionylation.</s><s>Interestingly, we found that DOXO increased the GSSG:GSH ratio, leading to S-glutathionylation of eNOS, and that this was blunted by pre-treatment with FA.</s></p><p><s>There are other mechanisms by which DOXO can lead to altered cardiac metabolism and induce superoxide anion generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>These include DOXO-induced ROS generation through topoisomerase II-dependent DNA double-strand breaks, which lead to apoptosis and mitochondrial damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, a novel mechanism on the involvement of late sodium current (I Na ) in the modulation of cardiac redox balance in DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, it was shown that ranolazine, an I Na inhibitor, protects against DOXO-induced cardiac dysfunction and remodelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, both DOXO and FA have been shown to produce alterations in DNA methylation status in the heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>On the basis of these observations, it is possible that other effects of FA may have also contributed to the protection against DOXO-induced toxicity.</s></p><p><s>The molecular signalling pathways linking ROS with gene modifications involved in pathophysiological remodelling of the heart are not fully understood.</s><s>Therefore, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis, which revealed marked DOXO-induced up-regulation of Nppa and Nppb, which are markers of cardiac dysfunction, and down-regulation of the desmosomal gene Adam4 and the cysteine protease inhibitors stefins.</s><s>Desmosomes are crucial for tissue homoeostasis and cardiac integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>The cysteine protease inhibitors stefins have been proposed as prognostic and diagnostic tools for cancer and may have an important role in desmosome-mediated cell-cell adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>The role of this regulatory family in the heart is unknown and warrants further investigation.</s><s>Although in the present study we did not measure protein abundance or activity, we put forward that these may be additional mechanisms involved in the protective effects of FA against DOXOinduced cardiomyopathy.</s></p><p><s>Our study was limited to a single dose of acute DOXO administration in mice in the absence of cancer, while in patients DOXO is chronically administered.</s><s>However, this is an established model of DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy that shares features with the cardiomyopathy observed in patients following chronic administration of DOXO <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, and our in vitro data showed that co-administration of FA did not affect the tumour cell-killing capacity of DOXO.</s><s>Nevertheless, further experiments are necessary to investigate the effects of FA in a chronic model of DOXO administration, which may reflect the clinical situation more closely.</s><s>Moreover, in our study, mortality reached 70% after 10 days of DOXO administration, which might be considered relatively high.</s><s>However, 50% mortality was previously reported after 8 days of DOXO administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, at which point we observed 60% mortality, and even 90% mortality after 10 days of DOXO administration has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>It has to be noted, however, that this might be a strain-specific effect, as ca.</s><s>21% mortality was reported after 9 days of DOXO administration in CF-1 outbred mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we limited ourselves to a single dose of FA, which does not exclude varying effects at different doses.</s><s>Nevertheless, our study indicates that FA decreased acute DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy and mortality even at supratherapeutic levels of DOXO.</s><s>Considering the sex differences in DOXO cardiotoxicity recently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, it would also be interesting to assess whether the efficacy of FA to attenuate DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy might differ between the sexes.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the development of therapeutic strategies targeting eNOS via FA supplementation may prove a major step forward in addressing DOXO-induced cardiomyopathy.</s><s>Considering its robust safety profile and its widespread use as dietary supplement, FA may hold promise for oncologists and haematologists to prevent DOXOinduced cardiomyopathy and mortality (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3278 ª
