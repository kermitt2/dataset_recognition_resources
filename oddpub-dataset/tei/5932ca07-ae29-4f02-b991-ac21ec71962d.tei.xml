<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>There is a growing body of evidence that treatment of AS with anti-TNF agents provides long-term benefits.</s><s>The progressive restriction of physical function typically experienced by patients with AS negatively affects their HRQoL.</s><s>Slowing or halting this progressive loss of function over the long term is thus an important goal of AS therapy.</s><s>This current study is the first to report data for up to 5 years in terms of improvement in spinal mobility with adalimumab.</s><s>Adalimumab treatment resulted in improvements in spinal mobility, as measured by the composite BASMI lin score, which appear to be due to improvements in lumbar side flexion, intermalleolar distance and cervical rotation components.</s><s>In contrast, lumbar flexion and tragus-to-wall flexion measurements remained similar to baseline throughout the study.</s><s>These improvements in spinal mobility are consistent with shorter-term findings with adalimumab <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[23]</ref> and long-term findings with other anti-TNF agents <ref type="bibr">[3638]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The baseline BASMI lin scores in the current analysis were higher than the baseline BASMI 2 score previously reported by van der Heijde et al.</s></p><p><s>[21] for the ATLAS study population originally randomized to treatment with adalimumab.</s><s>However, this is not surprising as mean status scores for BASMI 2 have been shown to be lower compared with BASMI lin scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The current analysis demonstrated that improvements in physical function and disease activity were maintained over 5 years.</s><s>Consistent with these data, HRQoL improvements observed after 12 and 24 weeks of adalimumab treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[27]</ref> were sustained till the end of the 5-year study.</s><s>By year 5, most patients remaining in the study had reached the MID for both ASQoL and SF-36 PCS.</s><s>These results were observed despite the finding that   progression of structural damage in AS (as determined by radiographs) does not appear to be inhibited by 2 years of adalimumab treatment <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Radiographic data with longer follow-up are not available.</s><s>Multivariate regression analyses in a study of infliximab treatment demonstrated that HRQoL in AS is determined by physical function and disease activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[41]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, multivariate regression showed that physical function is dependent on spinal mobility and disease activity; the degree of spinal mobility, in turn, is determined by irreversible structural damage and reversible inflammation of the spine <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">42]</ref>.</s><s>However, the association between structural damage and spinal mobility is highly variable among individual patients <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>.</s><s>This discordance may be due to the influence of spinal inflammation on spinal mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, maintaining a high HRQoL by improving physical function and reducing disease activity is an achievable goal for patients with AS treated with anti-TNF therapy.</s><s>The second objective of the current analysis was to determine whether spinal mobility correlated with other AS clinical, functional and HRQoL outcomes.</s><s>Significant correlations between BASMI lin and BASDAI, total back pain, SF-36 PCS and ASQoL were observed, although they were weak.</s><s>The weakness of association between these variables was further confirmed by multivariate regression analysis, in which these measures were not a statistically significant contributory factor to BASMI lin .</s><s>The BASMI lin correlated best with BASFI at both week 12 and at year 5.</s><s>This moderate correlation suggests that improvements in spinal mobility lead to enhanced physical function throughout extended treatment with adalimumab.</s><s>The multivariate regression analysis confirmed the significant nature of the positive association between spinal mobility and physical function.</s><s>In a previous study of 70 patients with AS who completed 6 months of pamidronate therapy, changes in the BASMI 2 also significantly correlated with changes in BASFI (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.44; P &lt; 0.001) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[43]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The main strength of this study is the duration of the long-term follow-up.</s><s>ATLAS is the largest long-term clinical trial of anti-TNF treatment of AS to date.</s><s>Limitations of long-term analyses include the fact that patients for whom  efficacy is suboptimal are less likely to remain in the study, enriching the continuing study population with patients who are doing relatively well.</s><s>Also, the open-label nature of the extension period may have resulted in bias.</s></p></div>
