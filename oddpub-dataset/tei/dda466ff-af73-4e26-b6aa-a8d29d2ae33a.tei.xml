<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>AKI has been associated with significantly increased health care costs.</s><s>Data from 23 Massachusetts hospitals over 2 years demonstrated that AKI resulted in higher hospital resource utilization, as both median direct hospital costs and hospital length of stay were increased by $2,600 and by 5 days, respectively, in patients with AKI vs. patients without AKI.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Furthermore, Chertow et al. demonstrated that even uncomplicated AKI was associated both with greater hospital costs and longer lengths of stay.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> In the current and future eras of limited healthcare budgets, it is critically relevant to evaluate the potential costs and economic impact of novel diagnostic tests.</s></p><p><s>Measurement of urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) has been demonstrated to be an early, non-invasive marker of AKI due to a variety of etiologies, such as cardiac surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, intravenous contrast administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, critical care settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and kidney transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>NGAL is the most studied marker of AKI and was demonstrated to be sensitive and specific in the detection of AKI in the ED and for the prediction of a composite clinical outcome of death and dialysis after in-patient admission <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>It is the most prominently studied because i) it has an enormous dynamic range ii) responds in a dose-dependent fashion to injury iii) responds within 3 hours of injury, which is important in emergency rooms iv) responds to a wide range of injuries v) is easy to measure vi) due to the recent availability of clinical platforms including a new NGAL dipstick vii) the test has been approved in Japan, Korea, and parts of Europe.</s><s>It is currently being reviewed by the FDA in the US.</s><s>In comparing a variety of potential biomarkers for study, the authors found NGAL tracks with significant changes in levels of creatinine, and had a better AUC/ROC.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Thus, uNGAL values may then be used to initiate AKI patient care algorithms earlier than sCr alone, and the application of uNGAL to AKI diagnostics and management may potentially lead to improved patient outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Although multiple investigations have demonstrated that uNGAL is a promising AKI biomarker with a potential application in the ED and other acute settings, little data exist regarding its potential impact upon costs and resource utilization.</s><s>Therefore it is at this time that a cost analysis is particularly valuable at this time.</s><s>Even though patients present to the ED with a variety of conditions, which may or may not include AKI, our study chose to focus exclusively on creatinine, the AKI diagnosis, and its cost implications.</s><s>We therefore investigated the economic impact of uNGAL measurement on AKI detection and management in patients presenting to the ED with sCr levels !</s><s>1.5 mg/dL.</s><s>From a diagnostic perspective this level of sCr is relatively non-specific as it may represent prerenal azotemia or stable CKD, in addition to AKI.</s><s>Moreover, a sCr above this cutoff, in the absence of baseline kidney function data, would likely trigger clinicians to initiate an AKI clinical care pathway.</s><s>We hypothesized that early and accurate AKI detection by uNGAL, in conjunction with sCr, would lead to more efficient and less expensive patient care.</s></p><p><s>With limited clinical and economic data, the relationship between cost and efficacy of an additional diagnostic biomarker becomes even more important for EDs when considering adopting such a test.</s><s>Given the lack of complete and perfect information, economic modeling techniques are employed to determine cost-effectiveness.</s><s>Such a model allows one to synthesize data from a variety of sources and estimate the clinical and cost outcomes on different populations.</s><s>Sensitivity analysis of the model allows one to verify the assumptions made in the model and test the validity of uncertain data (including costs) usually obtained from a variety of sources.</s><s>Knowing the limitations of such modeling, we constructed a decision model to compare the effectiveness of the addition of uNGAL to sCr versus sCr alone.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model structure</head><p><s>On the basis of the recommended clinical management of patients presenting to the ED with AKI, the model was composed of two alternatives: sCr alone (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) and sCr + NGAL <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1B)</ref>.</s><s>This decision-tree was constructed based on previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and qualitative analysis with expert opinion.</s><s>The decision-tree framework provided the clinical testing pathways.</s></p><p><s>For evaluation of sCr alone, patients with a level below the cutoff were not evaluated further for kidney injury (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>For uNGAL+sCr, four outcomes were possible (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B):</ref> (1) both tests above cutoff levels; (2) sCr above cutoff level but uNGAL below cutoff level; (3) sCr below cutoff level but uNGAL above cutoff level; and (4) both tests below cutoff levels.</s><s>In case 1, all patients were referred for further AKI testing.</s><s>In case 4, no patients were referred for further AKI testing.</s><s>In case 2, patients were referred for further AKI testing unless they had known stable chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in case 3, patients were referred for further AKI testing unless they had evidence of urinary tract infection (UTI).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input parameters</head><p><s>Data collected at NYP-Allen and SIUH provided the prevalence of both elevated sCr and uNGAL, of UTIs, SIRS, and sepsis.</s><s>For the baseline case, an elevated sCr level was assigned a value !1.75 mg/dL and an elevated uNGAL level was assigned a value !</s><s>125 ng/dL.</s><s>In both the sCr alone and uNGAL+sCr groups, a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients with suspected AKI were evaluated and "run through" the model.</s><s>Based on adjudication results of the study completed at each site, we determined the prevalence of each condition.</s><s>The prevalences then allowed the calculations for the sensitivity and specificity in detecting AKI for sCr and uNGAL.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model assumptions</head><p><s>There are three sets of assumptions inherent to this analysis.</s><s>The first set of assumptions is dependent upon the false negative-AKI rate: (1) Patients in the ED with a sCr level below the cutoff are sent home; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> This results in a number of false negative-AKI diagnoses and a delay in management; and (3) Those patients with a false-negative diagnosis based on sCr alone will return to the ED, with a more severe disease state.</s></p><p><s>The second set of assumptions is dependent on the false positive-AKI rate: (1) Patients assigned a false-positive AKI diagnosis were admitted to the hospital for an elevated sCr; (2) A percentage of these hospital admissions were unnecessary (i.e.</s><s>stable CKD, they could have been discharged); and (3) Unnecessary testing was performed.</s></p><p><s>The third set of assumptions is dependent on the treating physician's clinical approach: (1) All patients in the ED with sCr above the cutoff level received AKI diagnostic testing;</s></p><p><s>(2) Additional testing was obtained in those patients admitted to the hospital.</s><s>Clinical criteria and results of these tests determined whether the patient had the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis, and whether they would be admitted to the general wards or the intensive care unit (ICU).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient population</head><p><s>Between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008, 1,120 consecutive patients were recruited from the EDs at Staten Island University Hospital (SIUH) and the Allen Hospital of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital (AH-NYPH) as part of a multicenter clinical study, which is detailed elsewhere.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> Data regarding sCr values, clinical history and diagnostic tests were collected.</s><s>Due to poor specificity for discrimination of AKI, prerenal azotemia and stable CKD at high levels of sCr, we restricted the cohort to only those patients having sCr levels !</s><s>1.5 mg/ dL and from this used a sCr value of !</s><s>1.75 as elevated.</s><s>We hypothesized that above this threshold, an AKI patient care algorithm, including serial sCr testing and renal ultrasound, may likely be required to accurately discriminate AKI from other forms of kidney dysfunction and that uNGAL testing could potentially provide useful diagnostic information regarding kidney function for this set patients.</s><s>This restriction left a sample of 476 patients as SIUH and 373 patients at AH-NYPH.</s></p><p><s>Patients !18 years old in the ED, without a history of end stage renal disease (ESRD) and without a need for renal replacement therapy, who were being admitted to the hospital were enrolled from the ED at each site.</s><s>One urine sample was collected and patient medical records were accessed.</s><s>Study team members were not in contact with treating physicians, except to obtain permission to enroll patients.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical efficacy and model outcomes</head><p><s>The primary clinical effect of the decision pathways was either hospital admission from the emergency department or discharge to home.</s><s>The model incorporated other clinical events such as the recognition of a UTI, SIRS, or sepsis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Costs</head><p><s>Data on hospital unit costs (e.g., daily costs for an inpatient stay) were obtained from Medicare cost reports (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Baseline sCr cost was assumed to be $100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> with a range of $50-$200 if bundled with other tests.</s><s>For uNGAL, baseline cost was $50, with a range of $25-$100 used in sensitivity analysis [personal communication, Abbott Laboratories].</s><s>Other costs included additional testing to identify AKI and possible complications (e.g.</s><s>SIRS and sepsis).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Testing to identify AKI included renal ultrasound, urinalysis, urine culture, and complete blood cell count with differential.</s><s>Additional testing to determine the presence of sepsis included blood cultures.</s><s>Total hospital and ICU length of stay were obtained from patients' medical records at each center.</s><s>Hospital and ICU length of stay for patients with and without AKI were compared and used to derive an incremental length of stay due to kidney disease.</s><s>An estimate for this incremental length of stay was varied throughout a wide range of values in the sensitivity analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analysis</head><p><s>Due to uncertainty in the value of model inputs and the range of values and costs likely to be captured in multiple different settings, sensitivity analyses were performed Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Each cost component was varied from one-half to twice its baseline value.</s><s>A range for elevated sCr and uNGAL values were also modeled in the sensitivity analysis: 1.5 to 2.0 for sCr and 100 to 150 for uNGAL.</s><s>Ranges in the sensitivity analysis for the probability of elevated sCr and uNGAL tests were based on their associated cutoff value ranges.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the past 15 years, renal diagnosis has been simplified by the use of the term acute kidney injury (AKI).</s><s>AKI severity can be stratified by either RIFLE, AKIN, or KDIGO criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>; higher AKI severity has been linked to poorer AKI-associated clinical outcomes.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> AKI refers to 2 criteria: rise in serum creatinine and decrease in urine output.</s><s>The current definition as per KDIGO criteria is independent of etiology or type of injury.</s><s>This change in nomenclature has the benefit of homogenizing the approach to the patient; however, it does not account for the fact of the different causes for the rise in creatinine have different treatments.</s><s>Elevated sCr due to CKD, prerenal azotemia, or medication administration have no distinction from one another in KDIGO despite their drastically different clinical outcomes.</s><s>Therefore, an AKI biomarker with improved specificity could improve both stratification of AKI severity and prediction of poor clinical outcomes.</s><s>The NGAL gene and protein rise in the setting of ischemic and inflammatory damage to the kidney, but do not become elevated in volume depletion or related diseases like heart failure or liver failure.</s><s>In the setting of AKI, uNGAL has been demonstrated to rise 24-48 hours before sCr and to more accurately differentiate AKI from prerenal azotemia.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Consequently, the fractionation of patients with elevated serum creatinine levels into 2 different diagnostic categories (NGAL+/Cr+, NGAL-/Cr+) demonstrates patients will respond to fluid therapy and those that will not.</s><s>Distinguishing various forms of AKI is a vexing problem.</s><s>The time required for creatinine to reach a meaningful threshold is indeterminate: milligram quantities of creatinine must accumulate in the bloodstream from muscle.</s><s>Consequently, the level of creatinine on presentation to the ED can

co-morbid conditions.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> For example, a patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a patient with AKI may present to the ED with a similar sCr.</s><s>Therefore, accurate identification of AKI in an acute ED setting based upon sCr is challenging.</s><s>Because to date AKI is defined by the level of creatinine, rather than biochemical outcomes and measures, consequently it is difficult to define what clinical parameters constitute a false positive elevated creatinine.</s><s>As a result, creatinine is only useful as a retrospective biomarker of kidney function.</s><s>In contrast biomarkers, such as NGAL, respond immediately to an injurious stimulus: they lack the delayed responses of serum creatinine.</s><s>This is valuable for patients in the ED and triage decision-making.</s><s>The potential to identify AKI both early and more accurately would greatly assist assignment of patients to proper levels of care and potentially improve clinical outcomes.</s><s>In other words, earlier detection of AKI may permit timely interventions that may improve patient management and reduce costs.</s></p><p><s>The incidence of AKI in hospitalized patients ranges from 5-7% and is rising rapidly.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref

target="#b27">[28]</ref> and when present in conjunction with other conditions, AKI is associated with higher mortality.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> Although no treatment to reverse AKI exists, early detection assists pre-emptive assignment of patients to higher levels of care.</s><s>In JACC 2012, the authors found that Cr+/NGAL-or Cr-/ NGAL+ have a 5% chance of dialysis or death within 7 days.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> In contrast, NGAL+/Cr+ had a risk of 15% in 7 days.</s><s>Nearly identical data were obtained when KIM-1 was studied.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Hence, the authors demonstrated, the combination of biomarkers represents a higher risk state than either alone.</s><s>Indeed, the high morbidity and mortality of AKI in part reflects poor early detection due to the lack of an acute kidney injury biomarker and delay in placement to a higher level of acuity care.</s></p><p><s>Our investigation suggests that when sCr is in a relatively non-specific range for the diagnosis of AKI, using a combination of uNGAL and sCr leads both to a clinical benefit and an economic savings over sCr alone.</s><s>The use of uNGAL in the ED leads to better triage decisions and a $408 per patient and $522 per patient savings at NYP-Allen and SIUH, respectively.</s><s>Although in populations where sCr has high diagnostic accuracy for AKI the additional use of uNGAL may not result in cost savings, it may lead to improved patient management and by inference, better clinical outcomes.</s><s>Our sensitivity analysis further shows that the superiority of using uNGAL and sCr is contingent on the total hospital costs, length of stay, and costs of additional testing when AKI is suspected.</s><s>Additionally, the ability to identify patients with CKD is another area where the addition of uNGAL is economically beneficial.</s></p><p><s>Despite growing evidence to support uNGAL as an AKI diagnostic test, there are no data regarding its economic impact.</s><s>Our investigation provides the first cost analysis of uNGAL utilization in AKI detection.</s><s>We developed a model that assumed that the "real world" clinical implementation of uNGAL would be in conjunction with sCr.</s><s>Patient data to support this analysis was derived from patients who presented with suspected AKI to the EDs at two U.S. medical centers located in New York City that serve two very different communities: one an inner-city academic center and the other a community-based hospital.</s><s>Although this model suggests that the addition of uNGAL to sCr for AKI detection may lead to higher up-front direct costs, these initial costs are offset by potential savings due to reductions in delayed diagnosis and treatment.</s><s>These models demonstrate that uNGAL+sCr resulted in 1,578 and 1,973 fewer patients experiencing delayed diagnosis and treatment at Center 1 (AH-NYPH) and Center 2 (SIUH), respectively.</s><s>These findings are not surprising given the poor specificity of sCr in the population of patients selected for this analysis.</s></p><p><s>Cost estimates in these analyses are likely "conservative."</s><s>We expect higher costs would result from treatment delays due to delayed diagnosis, leading to greater illness severity, and therefore poorer clinical outcome and higher levels of inpatient care.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> Therefore, these results suggest that cost savings achieved by adding uNGAL to sCr are proportional to avoiding those additional costs incurred with delayed diagnosis.</s><s>Treatment delays increase costs because patients improperly diagnosed as being AKI-negative return for repeat testing in addition to eventual treatment and inpatient admission.</s><s>Although treating patients unnecessarily adds costs, we expect false positive diagnoses would have short hospital stays, mitigating cost increases due to unnecessary treatment.</s><s>Hence in this analysis, errors of commission (e.g., treating patients unnecessarily) are less costly then errors of omission (e.g., inappropriate diagnoses and treatment delays).</s><s>Likely patients will be admitted for other diagnoses for which for the sake of simplicity our model does not account.</s><s>However, early recognition of AKI will lead to early treatment and lower costs.</s></p><p><s>This investigation has limitations.</s><s>First, this is a simulation model rather than a prospective investigation.</s><s>Typical for these models, data must be collected from a variety of sources, including published studies and cost reports; clinical judgment and assumptions are utilized in cases where the former is unavailable.</s><s>Model inputs may have varying accuracy or relevance in different medical settings.</s><s>The model also assumes that patients, initially who were false-negatives, on follow-up would be at the same AKI severity level as when they were initially evaluated.</s><s>However, we choose study sites serving different socioeconomic groups with different prevalence rates of comorbidities in order to increase the generalizability of our models.</s><s>Furthermore, the results are robust in sensitivity analysis where the underlying variables are tested throughout a wide range of values likely to be encountered in clinical practice; the cost advantage of uNGAL+sCr persists over a wide range of costs and clinical values.</s><s>For example, although one source was used to estimate the cost of creatinine, multiple values were tested through the sensitivity analysis.</s><s>The savings benefit of uNGAL+sCr relies upon the total hospital costs, length of stay, the costs of additional testing when AKI is suspected, and the ability to identify patients with CKD.</s><s>Although these models do not account for acute dialysis, quality of life, and mortality, we would expect these poor clinical outcomes to increase cost, in particular for those patients inappropriately given a false negative AKI diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>This analysis of uNGAL as an AKI diagnostic test suggests that combining uNGAL with sCr results both in clinical and cost benefits in specific settings.</s><s>When sCr is in a non-specific range for AKI detection, combining uNGAL with sCr may lead to earlier AKI detection and treatment and avoidance of an inappropriate false negative diagnosis of AKI.</s><s>Per patient savings ranged from $408-$522 at two separate centers.</s><s>Longitudinal studies are necessary to investigate the cost-effectiveness of uNGAL, used both with and without sCr, for the diagnosis of AKI.</s></p></div>
