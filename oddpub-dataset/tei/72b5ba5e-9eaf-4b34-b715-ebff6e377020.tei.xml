<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS Patients</head><p><s>A retrospective analysis was performed including all patients with BSCR who were treated at our institution with MMF or MPS and who had a follow-up of at least 1 year.</s><s>BSCR was diagnosed according to the criteria established by an international consensus panel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> In all patients, an extensive uveitis work-up was performed to exclude other diseases that can cause multifocal choroidal lesions.</s><s>Additionally, HLA-A29 typing was performed in all patients.</s></p><p><s>A full ophthalmological examination, including the assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), tonometry, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fundus exam, was performed in all patients.</s><s>Additional ophthalmological investigations including fluorescein angiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT), visual field and electroretinography (ERG) were performed in most patients.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment</head><p><s>MMF was administered at a dose of 1000 mg twice daily, defined as a standard dosage for MMF.</s><s>MPS was given at a dose of 720 mg twice daily, defined as a standard dosage for MPS.</s><s>Depending on the activity of intraocular inflammation, systemic prednisolone in an initial dosage of 1 mg/kg/days was administered in 21 patients.</s><s>Prednisolone was gradually tapered on a weekly basis (in 10 mg steps to 30 mg/days, in 5 mg steps to 20 mg/days, followed by 2.5 mg steps) to a maintenance dose of ≤10 mg daily.</s></p></div>
