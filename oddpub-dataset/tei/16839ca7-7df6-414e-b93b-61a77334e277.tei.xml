<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The availability of low-cost whole-exome sequencing (WES) has revolutionized the study and diagnosis of rare diseases.</s><s>WES has enabled the discovery of the genetic cause for well over 180 Mendelian diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Boycott et al., 2013]</ref>, opening up new avenues to diagnostics and treatment.</s><s>While some disorders have been solved by identifying a cohort and discovering a commonly mutated gene, or by investigating the inheritance of a suspected genetic variant through a large family (linkage), many others are not amenable to such approaches due to the lack of family history, including extremely rare recessive disorders and dominant disorders caused by de novo mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[Beaulieu et al., 2014]</ref>.</s><s>Even when WES screening identifies a single candidate variant in a previously uncharacterized disease gene, this is typically insufficient evidence to implicate it in the disease.</s></p><p><s>A promising method for identifying the causes of such rare conditions is the comparison of the exomes or genomes of unrelated individuals with a specific disorder.</s><s>However, identifying multiple unrelated patients with similar indications is a nontrivial task.</s><s>Such patients will likely be seen by different clinicians at different hospitals, and the clinician working with one family will often be unaware of other cases.</s><s>Historically, such cases have been shared by clinicians through case reports, while attending "unsolved" symposia, or through other interactions, where one clinician may present an unsolved case and another recalls a similar case.</s><s>While the causes of some rare diseases have been identified in this manner, such interactions are serendipitous and may take years to occur, if ever.</s><s>A centralized Web portal that enables clinicians to effectively share undiagnosed patient information could allow similar patients to be instantly found anywhere in the world and significantly shorten the time to gene discovery and diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>The effective sharing of phenotypic and genetic data between clinicians is fraught with social and technical challenges.</s><s>On the social level, in addition to privacy constraints, it is necessary to build trust between the two individuals; information about rare disease patients is scientifically valuable, and many clinicians have a natural tendency not to share the data if it may be used without appropriate attribution.</s><s>Thus, in any solution, one user should not be able to access data contributed by another user without that person's knowledge or consent.</s><s>Once trust is established, there are additional difficulties.</s><s>Sharing of standard rare disease names, for example, based on OMIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Amberger et al., 2015]</ref> or Orphanet (http:// www.orpha.net/) is not practical when the very goal of data sharing is the diagnosis of a disorder.</s><s>Further, standardized data such as billing codes (ICD-9) and even SNOMED CT terms typically have insufficient granularity and completeness to describe rare disorders.</s><s>Finally, sharing free-form textual descriptions of patients makes comparison complicated, as different clinicians (depending on their specialization) may collect and record different granularity of patient data, and may use different terminology to describe the same set of clinical features.</s></p><p><s>The recording of detailed and standardized phenotypes for patients displaying a broad variety of indications requires a rich vocabulary with clear semantic relationships between the terms, to allow for the identification of similar (yet not identical) indications.</s><s>Although the London Dysmorphology Database presented one of the first efforts to organize phenotypes typically seen by a clinical geneticist, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Köhler et al., 2014]</ref> is currently the most complete vocabulary available for recording patient phenotypes for genetic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[Winnenburg and Bodenreider, 2014]</ref>.</s><s>However, the broad use of the HPO is hindered by its size and complexity: the HPO has over 11,000 terms, and only a small fraction of these are relevant for a specific patient.</s><s>Intuitive user interfaces, such as PhenoTips <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Girdea et al., 2013]</ref>, can help clinicians record precise descriptions of their patients and allow for the use of synonyms and variable granularity of presentations.</s><s>Further, when clinical features are encoded using an ontology such as the HPO, cases can be compared not just based on the annotated features, but also the corresponding semantic annotations of these features.</s><s>The HPO defines the terminology (and synonyms), as well as the relationship between terms (e.g., both "focal seizures" and "tonic/clonic seizure" are subtypes of "seizures," which in turn is a subtype of "neurological abnormality"), allowing for computational reasoning about similarities between patient descriptions.</s></p><p><s>Many similarity measures exist for comparing terms, or sets of terms, from an ontology.</s><s>Foundational methods, such as Resnik's measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[Resnik, 1995]</ref> and Jiang's and Conrath's measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[Jiang and Conrath, 1997]</ref>, were developed for lexical analysis and rose to prominence in the field of bioinformatics with their application to the gene ontology (GO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Ashburner et al., 2000]</ref>.</s><s>Additional measures, such as simGIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Pesquita et al., 2007]</ref>, were developed specifically for use with the GO.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Pesquita et al. [2009]</ref> provides an excellent review of the most popular similarity measures and their performance on GO-related tasks.</s><s>More recently, the HPO has enabled the use of semantic similarity measures to predict clinical diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[Köhler et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bauer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Zemojtel et al., 2014]</ref>, to find representative model organisms for gene prioritization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Smedley et al., 2013]</ref>, and most recently, to identify similar patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Gottlieb et al., 2015]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The HPO also maintains links between phenotypic terms and known rare diseases (including those in Orphanet and OMIM) and their associated genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Köhler et al., 2014]</ref>, which provides an effective bridge from phenotype to genotype within the rare disease domain.</s><s>A number of recently published methods have focused on using HPO terms to improve the prioritization of candidate genes from exome sequence data, including PHIVE <ref type="bibr">[Robinson et al., 2014]</ref>, Phevor <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[Singleton et al., 2014]</ref>, Phen-Gen <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[Javed et al., 2014]</ref>, and PhenIX <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[Zemojtel et al., 2014]</ref>.</s><s>However, to our knowledge, no existing methods attempt to address these two problems simultaneously: finding similar patients and identifying associated genes for those matches.</s></p><p><s>Here, we present the PhenomeCentral Web portal, a restricted-access network for clinicians, researchers, and scientific consortia to share patient phenotype and genotype data and discover similar patients across the world.</s><s>PhenomeCentral allows clinicians and researchers to enter deidentified patient phenotype and genotype data through a user-friendly Web interface, discover the existence of other similar patients along with potential shared genetic mechanisms, and contact the submitters of these cases to share case reports and foster worldwide collaborations.</s><s>To enable the discovery of genetic mechanisms for a disease in a hypothesis-free manner, PhenomeCentral simultaneously identifies patients likely to have the same disease and predicts genes that are potentially responsible.</s><s>PhenomeCentral serves as the data repository for several rare disease consortia, including the FORGE Canada and Care4Rare Canada projects, US NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Project, Neuromics, and ANDDIrare, and at the time of writing had 1,027 case reports and 391 users across five continents.</s><s>PhenomeCentral is part of the Matchmaker Exchange (MME) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Philippakis et al., 2015]</ref>, and has implemented the MME API <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Buske et al., 2015]</ref> to enable submitted cases to be matched with records at other MME sites.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The PhenomeCentral Web Portal Portal overview-The PhenomeCentral Web portal enables clinicians and researchers to quickly and easily find similar patients submitted by other contributors.</s><s>Users can enter deidentified patient data directly into PhenomeCentral through a user-friendly Web interface based on the PhenoTips software <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[Girdea et al., 2013]</ref>, by pushing existing patient records from private PhenoTips installations, or by uploading them in bulk (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Rather than a traditional database that users query using a sophisticated language, users "query" the PhenomeCentral repository simply by contributing a patient record.</s><s>The critical fields for match-making are "Clinical symptoms and physical findings," which allows for the selection (presence or absence) of relevant phenotypic terms from the HPO, and "Genotype information," where genetic variants can be entered and uploaded.</s><s>The phenotype terms can be selected either using quick search functionality, or through a set of (expandable) check boxes.</s><s>PhenomeCentral supports both entering a curated set of candidate genes and uploading a VCF file (with patient consent).</s><s>The VCF file is automatically processed using the Exomiser software (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/ exomiser/) to identify an additional, computationally prioritized set of candidate genes.</s><s>The set of selected phenotypic terms and candidate genes for each patient are compared with those in all other patient records in the repository, using algorithms described below.</s><s>This "query by example" approach frees the users from the responsibility of composing the right interrogation, and gives them incentive to contribute data and participate in the growth of PhenomeCentral.</s><s>The user can immediately see information about the most similar other patients in the database and contact those submitters, in a way that preserves the privacy of the patients (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D-G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The PhenomeCentral user interface incorporates many other popular components of the PhenoTips software on which it is based, including support for entering case notes, relevant medical records, and measurements; automatic plotting of growth charts; and drawing of pedigrees.</s><s>Combined, this functionality enables the recording of all relevant study data within a single portal, and allows research consortia to use PhenomeCentral as their primary data repository.</s><s>The Clinical Genetics journal has also adopted PhenomeCentral as the preferred repository for depositing structured phenotype data associated with case reports published in the journal.</s></p><p><s>PhenomeCentral facilitates collaboration between clinicians-Each patient record in PhenomeCentral can be set to one of three different visibility settings:</s></p><p><s>-Private: the record is visible only to the submitter unless explicitly shared with other users or groups, and does not participate in any matchmaking activity.</s></p><p><s>-Matchable: the record is not directly visible unless explicitly shared, but similar patients are shown to the submitter, and other contributors with similar patients can discover the existence of the record.</s><s>The matched phenotypes and genomic variants are obfuscated (phenotypes are made more general and only gene-level information is provided).</s></p><p><s>-Public: the record is visible to all registered users on PhenomeCentral and participates in matchmaking activity.</s><s>Contributors of similar patients are shown the submitter's contact details and the matched phenotypes and genomic variants.</s><s>Whenever a whole exome is provided for a public case, only the top 10 potential causal variants (ranked by the Exomiser) are shown to other users.</s></p><p><s>Private records are most useful when a consortium enforces a period of direct data sharing among its scientists before broader sharing is allowed (e.g., in the Neuromics consortium there is a 6-month waiting period before any sharing).</s><s>Matchable records allow patients that</s></p><p><s>are not yet published or consented for full sharing to participate in matchmaking activities with enhanced patient and submitter privacy.</s><s>Contacting the submitter of a matchable case is simplified with a customizable message template, allowing the user to quickly and easily choose what patient information to include in the message and add a personal message (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A rapidly growing repository of patients for matchmaking-Matches can also be found in other databases outside of PhenomeCentral through the MME API <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Buske et al., 2015]</ref>.</s><s>To further increase the number of potential matches, contributors can opt to include their patient records in matchmaking across the MME <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Philippakis et al., 2015]</ref>, a federated network of patient databases of which PhenomeCentral is a core founding member.</s><s>The contributor is then shown the most similar patients across partner sites including GeneMatcher <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Sobreira et al., 2015]</ref> and DECIPHER <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[Chatzimichali et al., 2015]</ref>, and users on these partner sites can discover the existence of this record if they have contributed a similar patient (additional details in the Methods).</s><s>This enables clinicians to instantly find and compare similar patients, even across different patient

record to PhenomeCentral enables high-quality matchmaking against a rapidly growing number of cases.</s><s>PhenomeCentral has seen a consistent rise in the number of patient records and user accounts since the first collaborators started submitting data in June 2013, with the number of patients tripling since the official launch on Rare Disease Day, February 28, 2014 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>As of April 19, 2015, PhenomeCentral contains data from 1,027 clinically phenotyped patients with rare genetic diseases (1,243 records in total, including unaffected relatives) collectively entered by 391 user accounts spanning five continents (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finding matches and identifying causal genes-For a given query patient, PhenomeCentral seeks to identify similar patients for which there is a plausible common genetic mechanism.</s><s>PhenomeCentral first calculates the phenotypic similarity between the query and every other patient in the database.</s><s>Because clinical features are encoded using terms in an ontology (the HPO), distinct terms can be compared using semantic similarity measures that take into account the structure of the ontology and the specificity of each term.</s><s>Similar patients can therefore be identified even when the two patients have no annotated terms in common.</s><s>For the most similar patients, we identify genes with predicted harmful variants in both patients, and rank these genes based on their relevance to the observed phenotypes.</s><s>Patients with overlapping manually curated candidate genes are considered similar even in the absence of phenotypic similarity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Benchmarking PhenomeCentral's Ability to Find Matches and Identify Causal Genes</head><p><s>Test data sets-We validated our approach to matchmaking using two data sets (additional details in the Methods).</s><s>First, we created a synthetic test set of 1,000 patients, each with an OMIM diagnosis, an exome spiked with a pathogenic variant in a diseaseassociated gene, and a set of HPO terms associated with the disease.</s><s>Patients were sampled in pairs with the same OMIM diagnosis, so every synthetic patient had at least one match with the same disease.</s><s>Second, we selected a subset of the real patient records in PhenomeCentral.</s><s>As of April 20, 2015, PhenomeCentral contained 720 patient records with at least five observed clinical features.</s><s>We considered two patients to match if they were submitted as part of the same cohort, diagnosed with the same disease, or annotated with the same gene as a likely candidate or confirmed cause.</s><s>These criteria resulted in 225 real cases with at least one match in the database.</s><s>To benchmark the gene prioritization methods, we selected the subset of deeply phenotyped records that also had WES data available and one or more known candidate or causal genes.</s><s>This resulted in 112 real cases with detailed phenotype and genotype data with a human-curated strong candidate gene, which we used as our gold standard.</s></p><p><s>Phenotypic matching-Because PhenomeCentral uses the HPO to represent phenotypic features, we can measure the similarity between pairs of patients using well-established semantic similarity measures.</s><s>We compared 13 measures from the literature (see Supp.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>The two best-performing measures were the PhenoDigm score <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Smedley et al., 2013]</ref> and the simGIC score <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[Pesquita et al., 2007]</ref>.</s><s>On simulated data, the PhenoDigm score outperformed all other measures and ranked the true match first for 69% of the patients after introducing random phenotypic noise and imprecision, and within the top five patients 90% of the time.</s><s>The performance was similar when the information content was computed using a smaller corpus and when it was computed using the topology of the HPO (Supp.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>On real data, the PhenoDigm and simGIC scores performed comparably, ranking the true match first for 54%-60% of patients, and within the top five matches 70%-71% of the time (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>).</s><s>However, when phenotypic noise and imprecision were added to these real patients, the performance dropped considerably, with respective top one and top five recall rates of 11% and 29% for PhenoDigm, and only 3% and 9% for simGIC.</s></p><p><s>This suggests that PhenoDigm is more robust than simGIC to the type of phenotypic noise we introduce, potentially due to the two very different ways the scores operate.</s><s>The PhenoDigm score is a normalized average of the best pairwise match for each phenotype in the patient, whereas the simGIC score assesses the overall shared information present across the clinical manifestations of the two patients.</s><s>This makes PhenoDigm less sensitive to spurious phenotypes and changes in the number of terms.</s><s>However, the PhenoDigm measure is also more complex to implement and slower to compute (10 min to perform all pair-wise comparisons of 1,000 simulated cases vs. 34 sec for simGIC in our implementations, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref>), so the relative utility of each score depends on the size of the data set and the amount of noise in the data.</s></p><p><s>Gene prioritization-PhenomeCentral currently incorporates the Exomiser for annotating and filtering exome sequence data, and for prioritizing genes by phenotypic relevance.</s><s>The Exomiser was selected because the source code was readily available and because the PHIVE score <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[Robinson et al., 2014]</ref> uses model organism data instead of human data, decreasing the likelihood that disease-gene associations (e.g., those found in OMIM) published using PhenomeCentral patients were included in the training data for the algorithm.</s><s>This means that the success rate we achieve on the real data set should be a reasonable estimate of our ability to identify novel genes associated with undiagnosed rare diseases, rather than overfitting to existing knowledge.</s></p><p><s>By leveraging the genomic data across multiple patients in the database to improve gene prioritization, PhenomeCentral is able to outperform a baseline method that only uses the data for a single patient.</s><s>Our adaptive scoring method (described in more detail in the Methods) first selects a variant harmfulness threshold, and then discounts the average score for every other case with a variant above the threshold, weighted by the phenotypic similarity of the other case.</s><s>This reduces the score of genes that are ubiquitously prioritized (such as HLA-A and TTN), while preserving high scores if a large cohort of phenotypically similar patients all have deleterious variants in the same gene.</s><s>We evaluate the performance of this approach by identifying, for each patient, the most phenotypically similar patients (using the PhenoDigm measure, discussed above) and then combining the top genes for each of the top matches using several approaches, described in the Methods.</s><s>We compare these genes to the top genes found with Exomiser's PHIVE score based on the single patient.</s><s>We find that an adaptive scoring method outperforms all other methods, increasing sevenfold the number of correctly identified causal genes in simulations with phenotypic noise and imprecision (8% vs. 63% rank the causal gene first), and doubling the number of real patients with correctly identified genes (8% vs. 15% of patients having a causal or candidate gene ranked within the top five genes) over using the Exomiser separately on each patient (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>PhenomeCentral addresses the increasing need for computational approaches to identify individuals affected by the same or overlapping phenotypes and mutations in the same gene, thereby enabling novel gene discovery.</s><s>We compared the performance of a number of popular semantic similarity measures, and found that the PhenoDigm score is best able to accurately and robustly match patients based on their phenotypes in a diagnosis-free manner.</s><s>However, for situations where speed and simplicity are important, the simGIC score is an easy-to-implement alternative that provides comparable performance on real data.</s><s>We also show that combining genetic information across phenotypically similar patients dramatically improves the prioritization of candidate genes.</s><s>Although the performance of the best method is only 15%, this is an intentionally conservative estimate and reflects our performance on novel diseases using clinical exomes without using any human data for gene prioritization.</s></p><p><s>Because in practice many of the cases submitted may be known disorders with a novel mutation or where the causative mutation was missed by the submitter, PhenomeCentral incorporates an improved scoring measure within the Exomiser [hiPHIVE; <ref type="bibr">Bone et al., in preparation; Smedley et al., in preparation]</ref> that combines model organism information in the original PHIVE score with known human disease-gene associations and protein-protein interaction data.</s><s>This version was not used for benchmarking in this manuscript as it would lead to overly optimistic results, but this functionality is included in PhenomeCentral and clinicians are able to immediately see the top genes associated with each matching patient.</s></p><p><s>We have tested PhenomeCentral's ability to identify phenotypically related cases as well as prioritize known disease-causing and candidate genes using both real data available at PhenomeCentral and simulations.</s><s>These results highlight our ability to identify similar patients and causal genes using only HPO terms and whole-exome VCF files, demonstrating the feasibility of hypothesis-free matchmaking of rare disease cases using computational tools.</s><s>Simultaneously, hypothesis-driven queries, where a gene of interest is already known, remain a prominent use case, and are also enabled by PhenomeCentral by boosting the similarity score in cases where patients share manually curated candidate genes or diagnoses.</s></p><p><s>PhenomeCentral is based on the popular PhenoTips software, which makes its user interface familiar to many clinical geneticists, and also allows for the direct transfer of patient records from any other PhenoTips instance to PhenomeCentral.</s><s>This enables institutional workflows (such as at the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program) in which clinicians use the PhenoTips software clinically, storing full patient records within the institutional firewall and then exporting the deidentified phenotypic records (HPO terms and additional needed demographics) to PhenomeCentral to enable matchmaking.</s></p><p><s>One important functionality, not available in PhenomeCentral but requested by several users and recently implemented in the GeneYenta system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Gottlieb et al., 2015]</ref>, is the ability to indicate the importance of specific phenotypes for matching.</s><s>In clinical practice, a specific phenotype may be extremely prominent or severe, and other patients with this phenotype are of especial interest.</s><s>While PhenomeCentral takes the frequency of a phenotype (in the OMIM corpus) into account, allowing the user to additionally specify such constraints is likely to improve performance as the links between the HPO and OMIM, used in our computation of information content, are incomplete.</s><s>We find our results to be similar across several different methods and corpora for computing information content, but this incompleteness in mappings can also affect the accuracy of our simulations, as well as simulations by previous authors who utilize these links to "sample" realistic patients.</s><s>We are also currently exploring adjustments to the similarity score based on additional phenotypic metadata (such as age of onset and severity).</s></p><p><s>Since its release, PhenomeCentral has been rapidly growing and now contains more than 1,100 deeply phenotyped patients with rare genetic disorders, with accounts for nearly 400 scientists and clinicians.</s><s>Most of these patients are undiagnosed, and most have exome sequence data.</s><s>The coordination with the MME also increases the number of potential matches, with the MME API enabling automated querying of GeneMatcher and DECIPHER for records with same candidate genes.</s><s>With additional sites planning to implement the MME API in the near future, storing deep phenotype and genotype data for all patients in PhenomeCentral will help ensure the maximum potential for matchmaking for these rare disease patients.</s></p></div>
