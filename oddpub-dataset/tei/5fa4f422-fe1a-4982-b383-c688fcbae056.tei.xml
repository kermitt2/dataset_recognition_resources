but even significantly increased in the case of T-bet and RORgt (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>The abundance of T-bet argued against a reduced Th1-cell presence as the mechanism underlying the low colonic IFN-g production in Cd44v7 À / À transfer recipients, and instead suggested an impaired activity of Th1 cells.</s></p><p><s>Colons of Cd44v7 À / À transfer

maintenance of colitis.</s><s>The discovery from the Mizoguchi group and our own work of the protective role of IL-22 in colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> even suggests that the lower IL-22 expression in CD44v10 À / À compared to Cd44 WT was actually the cause why CD44v10 À / À mice were as severely ill as the Cd44 WT mice.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the deletion of CD44v7 in transferred T cells neither abrogated intestinal inflammation in RB hi T-cell transfer colitis nor in OVA antigen-specific colitis.</s><s>This means that the prevention of v7-involving CD44 signaling in lymphocytes, known to provoke in some situations elevated activation-induced cell death rates by downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>  the intestinal inflammation in these two mouse models in vivo.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our data from two T-cell-dependent colon inflammation models show that the expression of v7-containing CD44 isoforms on macrophages, but not on T cells, is essential for provoking chronic colitis in mice.</s><s>By suggesting the mechanism underlying CD44v7-dependent gastrointestinal inflammation, our study not only provides novel insight into its pathogenetic cascade but also hints to novel therapeutic strategies.</s><s>In fact, we suggest CD44v7 as a primary target molecule whose inhibition might be more effective than, e.g., IL-6 targeting.</s><s>Actually, the blockade of IL-6 activity via application of anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab) and anti-IL-6 antibody (PF-04236921) showed only limited clinical response in Crohn's disease patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref></s><s>This might be due to the heterogeneity of IL-6 effects in colitis.</s><s>In fact, IL-6 is pathogenetic due to its ability to inhibit iTreg development/ function and to enhance the generation/activation of pathogenetic effector T cells.</s><s>At the same time, however, IL-6 can act on epithelial cells, inducing antiapoptotic proteins such as Bclx(L) and Bcl-3, protecting them from apoptosis, and promoting their survival. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s>Thus, it is not surprising that the inhibition of both IL-6 actions has only limited clinical effect.</s><s>In contrast, CD44v7 targeting might reduce IL-6 production specifically by APC during their interaction with T cells and positively change the proportion between iTreg and pathogenetic effector T cells.</s><s>On the other hand, the IL-6 production by other cells like IL-1b-activated fibroblasts and the resulting protective action on epithelial cells might be untouched.</s><s>Furthermore, the OPN-CD44v7 interaction altered not only the IL-6 production.</s><s>In fact, the engagement of CD44v7 on macrophages by OPN was also shown to inhibit the IL-10 production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Consequently, a CD44v7-directed therapy is expected to be associated with a greater effectiveness and long-term clinical improvement compared with direct blockade of IL-6 activity.</s><s>METHODS Animals.</s><s>The targeted mice for the CD44 variant exons v7, v6v7, and v10 8,49 were backcrossed for 10 generations onto the BALB/c background.</s><s>BALB/c mice (Iffa Credo BJico, Orle ´ans, France) were used to backcross the targeted mutation in Rag2 for 10 generations to yield BALB/c Rag2 À / À mice.</s><s>Rag2 À / À mice with additional inactivation of CD44 variant exons were generated by respective crossing.</s><s>DO11.10 transgenic (OVA-TCR tg ) mice were backcrossed for 10 generations onto the BALB/c background to yield BALB/c DO11.10 mice.</s><s>The transgenic TCR of DO11.10 mice recognizes the 323-339 peptide of OVA in the context of I-A d and is detectable with a monoclonal antibody (mAb), clone KJ1-26 (kindly provided by the German Arthritis Research Centre, Berlin,
