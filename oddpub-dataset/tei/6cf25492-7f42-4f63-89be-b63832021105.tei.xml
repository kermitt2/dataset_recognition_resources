recorded.</s><s>Results showed that all variables -average heart rate, serum lactate concentration during RST, subjective exertion and cTnT after RST -were significantly higher compared to MCT.</s><s>CK and CK-MB significantly increased regardless of exercise protocol, while ECG and TTE indicated normal cardiac function.</s><s>Our results provide evidence that RST contributes significantly to cTnT and CK release.</s><s>This biomarker increase seems to reflect a physiological rather than a pathological phenomenon in healthy, exercising subjects.</s></p><p><s>Sport and

sport, their effect on the release of biochemical markers of myocardial damage has not been addressed yet.</s><s>RS training (RST) is characterized by very short exercise bouts (maximal 30 seconds) of vigorous intensity and hence differs from long duration moderate intensity continuous training (MCT).</s><s>While increases of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were reported after high intensity continuous exercise (30 minutes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , there was no evidence of a significant release of troponin cTn after high intensity intermittent exercise of short duration in adults <ref

understanding exercise-induced releases of cardiac biomarkers may have a valuable diagnostic impact if individuals are admitted to medical care after vigorous exercise.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to test the impact of RST on biomarkers of acute myocardial necrosis by comparing results to those of traditional MCT.</s><s>Myocardial dimensions and functions were assessed by transthoracal echocardiograpic (TTE) and electrocardiographic (ECG) investigations following each exercise session.</s><s>We hypothesized, that despite its short total duration, RST training would significantly increase cTnT and CK-MB, compared to MCT of longer duration.</s><s>Hypothesis confirming results would elucidate the prevalence of an exercise-induced release of myocardial necrosis

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This is the first study to demonstrate an effect of short duration RST on cardiac biomarker kinetics in healthy adults.</s><s>We found that -in contrast to MCT -RST significantly increased cTnT; with five out of thirteen participants showing values above the upper reference level of 14.5 ng/L.</s><s>On first sight, these findings may be controversial, since George and colleagues found no release of cTnT after high intensity short-duration intermittent exercises <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>However, for their team sport athletes, blood samples were drawn 30 minutes and 24 hours after a rugby/ football game, respectively, while in our study we analyzed blood samples drawn 1 and 4 hours after RST.</s><s>A less sensitive 3 rd generation cTnT method used in the referenced study might also account for the difference between those and the present findings.</s><s>Further, not only timing and sensitivity of measurements, but also duration of single exercise bouts might have been shorter and recovery longer in previous studies compared to the RST in our study.</s><s>For instance, cTnI release after soccer specific exercise sessions was not elevated <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, intermittent exercises with longer intervals (23 × 2 minutes at velocity of 90% VO 2max with 2 minutes at 50% VO 2max velocity in between) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in adult marathon runners <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> showed that cTn was unrelated to environmental conditions.</s><s>The authors then concluded that exercise intensity seems to be a modulator.</s><s>However, considering the fact that total exercise duration in the referenced study corresponded to running times of a half marathon or even beyond, such increases of cTn are known to be common <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Thus, based on these previous findings, the impact of exercise intensity alone on markers of myocardial damage had remained uncertain.</s><s>Results of our study clearly demonstrate that -compared to exercises of longer duration and moderate intensity -short duration high intensity intermittent exercise significantly affects the release of cardiac biomarkers in a healthy adult population.</s><s>As ECG and TTE indicated normal cardiac function after both training sessions, we conclude that the release of cTnT after RST is a physiological and not a pathological phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Biomarker releases might be an indicator of an effective training stimulus, necessary to promote functional and morphological adaptation to high intensity intermittent exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Correlation analyses showed an association between cTnT release and the metabolic state of the working skeletal muscle, i.e. exercise "dose".</s><s>This indicates that peripheral anaerobic skeletal metabolism, resulting in an altered acid-balance and/or an increased production of oxidative radicals, could be a contributing factor to the loss of cardiomyocytes' integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Conclusions are preliminary, as we also found a significant relationship between cTnT with %HR peak , which stands in contrast to the findings of Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>The latter would support the view of mechanical stress on cardiomyocytes as a significant mechanism contributing to the release of cTn after exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>It has been shown in trained subjects, that stroke volume (SV) progressively increases with rising HR until maximal effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Thus, in contrast to the MCT session, RST was expected to induce SVs close to maximum and with that puts greater mechanical stress on cardiomyocytes.</s><s>In essence, exercise-induced biomarker releases after RST in young active males seem to reflect a loss of cellular integrity due to repeated maximal stretch of the cardiomyocytes and/or other factors associated with high intensity exercise.</s><s>Our findings indicate exercise intensity as a significant contributor to the cTnT-release during exercise durations ≤ 60 minutes.</s><s>A recent study reported that a single bout of maximal exercise (30 seconds) does not significantly affect cTnT release <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>However, our experiment demonstrates that repeated 30-second intervals of high, but not maximal, intensity with short recovery times can significantly elevate cTnT concentration.</s><s>The sampling strategy in the present study, including measurements at 1 and 4 hours post exercise only, might be a limitation, as others have documented an individual time dependent cTnT release during and post exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Hence, despite revealing a significant effect of exercise intensity on cTnT release, not all "responders" might have been detected.</s><s>After all, our sampling procedure was justified by the following two arguments: First, we considered a typical critical scenario at emergency care, e. g. submission of a male endurance athlete with exercise associated syncope of unknown origin; and second, other studies revealed that 2 hours following the start of a moderate intensity exercise (marathon) all participants showed elevated cTnT values <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>It remains however speculative whether the release of cTnT already indicates an exercise stimulus as sufficient to induce long-term functional and structural cardiovascular adaptations.</s><s>The physiological "damage" underlying the increase of cTn may further explain the superior effect of RST on cardiovascular function, compared to moderate continuous exercise evident in different samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In regards to the other biomarkers measured in our study, we found that total CK and CK-MB significantly increased after either exercise protocol.</s><s>Our study supports both: previous findings of increased CK-values in athletes, and the notion that CK-values above reference limits are the rule rather than exception in active young males or athletes even under resting conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> .</s><s>After RST more participants showed CK-values above the upper reference compared to after MCT.</s><s>As this result appears in line with the release of cTnT after RST, a myocardial origin of the measured CK-MB after RST is not unlikely <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>This result supports the notion of an increased myocardial stress induced by RST.</s><s>However, in contrast to our hypothesis the impact of the exercise type on CK-MB was statistically not significant.</s><s>CK-MB was above 6% of total CK both at rest and after exercise.</s><s>This leads to the conclusion that %CK-MB has no incremental diagnostic value in active young males with suspected acute myocardial infarction.</s><s>However, the time course of such (nonspecific) markers may be instrumental to improve the medical decision making process after an exercise-associated hospital submission.</s><s>A typical constellation in healthy individuals after high intensity short duration exercise seems to be an increase in total CK from POST + 1 to POST + 4, while CK-MB remains at a stable level.</s><s>In addition, there was a statistical trend (p = 0.07) for a decrease of %CK-MB from POST + 1 to POST + 4.</s><s>This suggests that a progressive decline of %CK-MB in the first hours after training indicates an exercise associated "physiological" release of CK-MB without any relevant pathology, as confirmed by perfectly normal myocardial function.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our data support the notion that exercise intensity is an important factor to explain moderate increases in cTnT <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>While 60 minutes of continuous endurance exercise at moderate intensity did not trigger a significant release of cTnT, high intensity intermittent exercise did.</s><s>Because the release of cTnT exceeded normal limits in almost half of the studied individuals, we advise that the type of exercise should be considered whenever moderate increases of myocardial markers are noticed.</s><s>A better understanding of an exercise-induced release of cTnT and CK-MB might be of diagnostic importance if an individual is admitted to medical care after exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>It remains to be investigated whether healthy subjects with a more pronounced elevation of cTnT after intermittent exercise ("responders") might benefit more from RST in terms of SV increases (e.g. via eccentric cardiac hypertrophy) than "non-responders".</s><s>The significant correlation between normalized left-ventricular dimensions suggests that non-specific total CK might be a trigger of morphological adaptations in response to regular exercise.</s><s>When considering HR during TTE as covariate, results show that the type of training hardly affects post-exercise echocardiographic indices of myocardial function in healthy active men.</s><s>Compared to baseline there was also no sign of impairment after either training session.</s></p><p><s>Admission to emergency care after strenuous exercise with associated cTnT elevations has frequently led to extensive but unnecessary clinical workup.</s><s>Clinicians should be aware that exercise-induced releases of cTnT, CK and CK-MB are not only limited to result from prolonged endurance exercises, like marathon running, but may also occur after short duration intermittent activity, like repeated sprint training or game sports.</s><s>We suggest that with a better understanding of the proposed exercise and seromarkers relation in both trained and sedentary individuals, some futile workup based on a false positive diagnosis can be avoided <ref type="bibr"
