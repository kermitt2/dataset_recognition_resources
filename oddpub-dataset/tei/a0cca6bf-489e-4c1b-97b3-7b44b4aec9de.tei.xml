(i.e.</s><s>8185.54</s><s>IU/L) could cause the proangiogenic effects in HUVECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Usually a maximum dose of 100 ng/mL 37 or lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> of rhFSH is able to cause the cAMP response in granulosa cells.</s><s>Much higher (2-3-fold) concentrations are needed to stimulate

be physiologically meaningful, for which reason we stimulated the HUVECs and HUV-ST also at lower rhFSH concentrations.</s></p><p><s>HUVECs are not the best in vitro model to study NO formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Along with passaging (keeping for longer periods) these cells lose the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and consequently NO formation decreases significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>We also observed a very low basal total nitrite concentration suggesting low NO formation even by early passages 1 and 2 of primary HUVECs.</s><s>Additionally, the lack of changes in NO production after L-NAME constitutive NO synthase inhibition further suggested their low basal levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>Both lines positively responded to estradiol stimulation, used often as a positive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, around 6-fold lower total nitrite concentration observed in HUVEC and HUV-ST cells stimulated in HBSS for 1 h in comparison to basal culture medium for 4 h may suggest nitrite/nitrate contamination of the latter.</s><s>Although the same assay was used to measure total nitrite in the former study, the concentrations obtained in their experiment were below the kit's assay range (3.12-200 Œº mol/L) and even for the mean minimum detectable dose (0.25 Œº mol/L), which may have affected the quantitative reliability of their results <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>They stimulated HUVECs in T75 flasks and concentrated collected medium 5-fold using 10,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifugal filters before assay

Griess reaction, which was used in the applied assay to measure total nitrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>The tube formation assay is one of the most common assays to demonstrate the angiogenic activity of vascular endothelial cells in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>This assay involves endothelial cell adhesion, migration, protease activity and tubule formation.</s><s>The endothelial cells form capillary-like structures on basement membrane matrix and this process is accelerated or inhibited in response to proangiogenic or antiangiogenic signals found in conditioned media, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>The tube formation by endothelial cells occurs quickly within 1-2 h and lumen-containing tubules within 2-3 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>In contrast to the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , we did not observe any significant effects on tube formation in HUVEC and HUV-ST cells after 4 h of rhFSH stimulation vs. control.</s><s>On the contrary, our control non-stimulated cells were able to form capillary like structures with full lumens.</s><s>This was in line with the earlier studies presenting tube formation on basement membrane extracted from murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , where endothelial cells could form capillary-like structures even without additional stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>A plausible explanation for the lack of capillary-like structures in the control group in the earlier study could be due to the fact that their primary HUVECs (bought from Invitrogen) were already differentiated and/or lost their endothelial phenotype in culture.</s><s>We also found that tube formation along with the time course, at later time points was almost lost in the control and rhFSH-stimulated HUVECs.</s><s>Only stimulation with the positive angiogenesis inducer rhVEGF significantly sustained their tube-like structures.</s><s>The weaker response to rhVEGF stimulation in HUV-ST could be due to their immortalization process and perhaps to their higher passage numbers, as the original functional characteristics of this cell line showed formation of capillary-like structures in contact with Matrigel <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>Similarly to the above experiments, rhFSH stimulation did not affect the wound healing process in HUVEC and HUV-ST cells vs. control.</s><s>Only rhVEGF stimulation as positive control closed the wounds within 36 h of incubation.</s><s>The scratch/gap in wound healing assay performed in the earlier study was created manually using a 200 Œº L pipette tip (one well at a time) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>It has been shown that, making the scratch with a pipette tip may damage the extracellular matrix due to too much non-coordinated pressure, which can affect the migration rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>To overcome this problem in our experiment, we used an automated device with multiple pins designed especially for wound healing assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>Another important technical issue in the earlier study could be the rhFSH stimulation time of HUVECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>They showed 20% (1/5 of analyzed area) of wounds were healed already after 4 h of rhFSHR stimulation.</s><s>It is well known that wound healing requires both cell migration and proliferation in order to cover a gap made in confluent monolayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>As the HUVEC cells presents with a doubling time for ~24 h, 4 h for this experimentation is too short a time for the cells to migrate and proliferate.</s></p><p><s>The lack of FSH-stimulated cAMP production and AKT phosphorylation additionally supported our negative results on functional FSHR expression in HUVEC and HUV-ST cells.</s><s>The unexpected phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) in 4 h-starvated control as well as in rhFSH-stimulated cells in the previous study could be due to too short cell starvation time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>When we starved HUVECs for 8 h, no pAKT signal was observed in control and stimulated cells.</s><s>This implies that 4 h of starvation in HUVECs might not be enough to suppress phosphorylation of AKT <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> questioning the impact of rhFSH on HUVECs angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Taken together, stimulation with rhFSH showed in our experiments no effect on proliferation, nitric oxide production, wound healing, tube formation assay, phosphorylation of AKT or cAMP production in HUVECs.</s><s>Numerous methodological differences, resulting in hard-to-interpret findings in the previous study could explain the difference between these data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and ours.</s><s>Our results were not able to confirm the earlier finding of FSHR expression in HUVECs or in immortalized HUV-ST cells.</s><s>Consequently, our data do not support the novel concept that FSH-FSHR activation is involved in the placental vasculature and their angiogenesis process.</s><s>Thus, it remains open whether it is justified to conclude that FSH stimulation of the angiogenic process in HUVECs contributes to placental development and maintenance of healthy pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Without FSHR expression in endothelial cells, FSH cannot be considered as a proangiogenic factor as VEGF.</s><s>A weak FSHR signal in the nonpregnant human myometrium, which becomes upregulated in pregnant non-laboring human myometrium, as well as in muscle fibers, in the myometrial vessels has been shown earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>We were not able to detect FSHR signal in human myometrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> , both at mRNA or protein levels and on the contrary to the earlier sudy we sequenced our positive controls PCR products to reconfirm the PCR findings.</s><s>Thus the recent study showing novel FSHR signaling pathway regulating myometrial contractibility in pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> , is also in need of further confirmation.</s><s>In light of our findings, more studies are definitely needed to validate the recently discovered extragonadal FSHR expression and function, especially in the endothelial cells of different vascular vessel types in normal and tumor tissues.</s></p></div>
