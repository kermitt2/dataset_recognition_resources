<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KCNQ5 expression in pyramidal cells and interneurons.</head><p><s>KCNQ5 is widely expressed in many brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>In the hippocampus, mRNA hybridization (Allen brain atlas, http:// www.brain-map.org/) and immunohistochemistry revealed higher KCNQ5 expression in the CA3 than CA1 hippocampal region <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Immunolabelling with our KCNQ5 antibody was intense in strata oriens and radiatum, regions that harbour extensive synaptic contacts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>In CA3, there was a gradient of KCNQ5 expression from CA3a (close to CA2) towards the CA3c area (close to dentate gyrus).</s><s>In the absence of mice lacking KCNQ5 expression, the specificity of KCNQ5 labelling was confirmed with Kcnq5 dn/dn knock-in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , which express a dominant-negative (dn), non-conducting pore mutant (G278S) of KCNQ5 (ref.</s><s>20).</s><s>In these mice, the pattern of KCNQ5 labelling of the hippocampus was changed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Labelling was reduced in the CA1 area, suggesting that the mutant protein might be less stable.</s><s>In CA3, KCNQ5 immunoreactivity was shifted from the stratum (st.) radiatum and st.</s><s>oriens to pyramidal cell bodies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We neither detected compensatory changes in the expression of other KCNQ family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> or of several Kir K þ channels (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The overall normal brain histomorphology of Kcnq5 dn/dn mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and the unchanged expression of several synaptic proteins in these mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) further suggested that the reduced KCNQ5 labelling of st.</s><s>radiatum and oriens is not owed to neurodegeneration.</s><s>As KCNQ4 channels with an equivalent pore mutation (G285S) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> show diminished plasma membrane localization in heterologous expression systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> and in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , we rather suspected abnormal protein trafficking as the underlying cause.</s><s>Indeed, when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, KCNQ5 <ref type="bibr">G278S</ref> subunits carrying an extracellular HA-tag displayed reduced plasma membrane localization compared with similarly tagged wild-type (WT) KCNQ5 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c,d</ref>).</s><s>This effect was observed either when KCNQ5 <ref type="bibr">G278S</ref> was expressed alone or together with KCNQ3, which can form heteromers with KCNQ5 (refs 19,20).</s><s>Hence, the altered staining pattern of Kcnq5 dn/dn hippocampi likely resulted from impaired trafficking of the mutant non-conducting protein.</s><s>Instead of reaching their normal peripheral position on neurites, KCNQ5 G278S mutant channels remain in somata of pyramidal cells, similar to the recently described retention of this mutant in somata of vestibular ganglion cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to confirming the specificity of our immunolabelling experiments, the trafficking defect of the KCNQ5 G278S mutant facilitated the identification of cell types expressing KCNQ5.</s><s>The shift of immunoreactivity from st. oriens and st.</s><s>radiatum to pyramidal cell somata (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>) indicated that a sizeable portion of KCNQ5 is present on neurites of pyramidal cells.</s><s>In Kcnq5 dn/dn , but not in Kcnq5 þ / þ hippocampi, immunostaining revealed KCNQ5-positive cell somata also outside of the pyramidal layer, for example, in the st.</s><s>radiatum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>This preferential labelling of Kcnq5 dn/dn somata likely results from a retention of the mutant protein in cell bodies, where, in contrast to the WT situation, it can be distinguished from diffuse background labelling.</s><s>Indeed, in situ hybridization revealed similar labelling outside the pyramidal cell layer in Kcnq5 þ / þ and Kcnq5 dn/dn mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,b</ref>).</s><s>To examine whether these cells corresponded to inhibitory interneurons, we crossed Kcnq5 dn/dn mice to GAD67-GFP mice that specifically label GABAergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Indeed, 12.3% (98/781 cells from three mice) of GFP-positive cells in Kcnq5 dn/dn Â GAD67-GFP þ / À mice were robustly labelled for KCNQ5.</s><s>KCNQ5labelled interneurons were found in the st.</s><s>radiatum, oriens and lacunosum-moleculare (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,d-f</ref>).</s><s>The KCNQ5 signal in Kcnq5 dn/dn mice overlapped with markers for various types of interneurons like parvalbumin and somatostatin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,f</ref>) and calretinin and neuropeptide Y (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-c</ref>).</s><s>A sizeable fraction of interneurons stained with any of the interneuron markers was unambiguously labelled for KCNQ5 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, combining in situ hybridization with immunohistochemistry, parvalbumin-and somatostatin-positive interneurons were found to express Kcnq5 mRNA in both Kcnq5 þ / þ and Kcnq5 dn/dn hippocampi (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c-f</ref>).</s><s>Hence, in addition to hippocampal pyramidal cells, KCNQ5 is widely expressed in hippocampal interneurons of different subtypes.</s></p><p><s>Increased excitability of Kcnq5 dn/dn interneurons.</s><s>The KCNQ5 G278S mutant does not yield K þ -currents by itself and exerts dominant-negative effects on co-expressed KCNQ3, -4 and -5 subunits <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Kcnq5 dn/dn mice, which carry the G278S mutation on both alleles, are therefore expected to lack currents from homo-or heteromeric channels carrying at least one KCNQ5 subunit.</s><s>By contrast, the consequences of a deletion of KCNQ5 in Kcnq5 À / À mice are difficult to predict.</s><s>In some cells, the number of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels may increase because KCNQ5 no longer competes with KCNQ2 for KCNQ3 binding.</s><s>As KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromers yield large K þ -currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , Kcnq5 À / À mice may display phenotypes resulting from both a decrease and increase of specific K þ currents.</s><s>Our approach, that is, the use of Kcnq5 dn/dn mice avoids all these complications and allowed us to specifically investigate the role of KCNQ5 in hippocampal slices and in vivo.</s></p><p><s>The identification of KCNQ5 in interneurons prompted us to investigate intrinsic excitability of interneurons in the CA3 after blocking synaptic transmission.</s><s>To identify interneurons, we crossed Kcnq5 dn/dn mice with mice expressing GFP under control of the GAD67 promotor.</s><s>Recorded cells were filled with biocytin by the patch pipette and 59 cells could be subsequently classified morphologically into basket, bistratified and orienslacunosum-moleculare interneurons.</s><s>All three types of interneuron (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-c</ref>) displayed increased excitability in Kcnq5 dn/dn mice as indicated by a larger number of action potentials in response to depolarizing current injections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d-i</ref>).</s><s>We likewise observed an increased excitability in non-classified interneurons in st.</s><s>radiatum (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to interneurons, the excitability of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells appeared unchanged (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b,c</ref>).</s><s>Resting membrane potential was not altered in either cell type (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d,e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Enhanced hippocampal GABAergic inhibition in Kcnq5 dn/dn mice.</s><s>The increased excitability of interneurons suggested that the functional loss of KCNQ5 would boost synaptic inhibition in the CA3 area.</s><s>Indeed, we observed an increase in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in Kcnq5 dn/dn CA3 pyramidal cells and a shift of their mean amplitudes to larger values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-d</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, neither frequency nor amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were altered in Kcnq5 dn/dn CA3 pyramidal cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4f</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, inhibition of extrasynaptic GABA A receptors in voltage-clamp experiments suggested that ambient GABA (g-aminobutyric acid) was increased in Kcnq5 dn/dn CA3 pyramidal cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4g,h</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because KCNQ channels can be inhibited by muscarinic M1 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and since hippocampal circuits are modulated by cholinergic input <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , we tested the effect of the muscarinic agonist carbachol.</s><s>Transient application of carbachol (20 mM) markedly increased both sIPSC amplitude and frequency in WT CA3 pyramidal cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-d</ref>).</s><s>This effect was absent in Kcnq5 dn/dn slices, indicating a major contribution of KCNQ5 to acetylcholine-mediated
