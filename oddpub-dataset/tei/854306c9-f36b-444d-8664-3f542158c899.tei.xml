(2,3) and long-term risk for obesity in offspring <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>These occur throughout the range of glycemia, even at levels below the diagnostic cut-off for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>Evidence suggests that even modest glycemic improvement in pregnant women with mild glucose intolerance improved perinatal outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>Current dietary approaches towards glycemic control have mostly focused on diet quantity and quality, with relatively little information available on food timing and eating frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Eating or fasting at appropriate times and restricting eating hours may offer an innovative and feasible strategy to preventing gestational hyperglycemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Humans have developed intrinsic 24-hour cycles, called circadian clocks that are entrained by light and food to regulate daily physiological events, including glucose metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion exhibit circadian oscillations, such that progressive reduction of insulin sensitivity, Î²-cell response and glucose tolerance is seen as the day progresses, with insulin sensitivity reaching a nadir at night <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>A defined period of feeding and fasting is a dominant determinant of circadian rhythms in metabolic pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, dietary regimens that restrict food intake to within specific windows and fasting thereafter, particularly when done in coordination with daily circadian rhythms following light/ dark phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, have been shown to improve glucose regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>This helps to reset the body's circadian (peripheral) clocks, restore circadian rhythmicity in gene expression, and consequently enhance glucose and energy metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The importance of circadian timing of eating, which refers to eating schedules in relation to dark/ light and rest/ activity phases during the day, has been demonstrated in animal studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Rodents given 8 to 12 hours food access during their active phase (i.e.</s><s>night-time hours) were protected from the metabolic consequences of a high fat diet, compared to rodents fed under an ad libitum regimen <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>The literature on human studies which consider feeding and fasting intervals in sync with daily circadian rhythms has been very limited.</s><s>A recent epidemiologic study from the United States reported that night-time fasting interval in women was inversely associated with 2-hour glucose and HbA1c <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Reduced eating episodes through ensuring adequate fasting intervals between meals may also improve glycemic control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s><s>This finding was however inconsistent with other studies, possibly due to variability in diet composition and small sample size <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, frequent meals with high protein content have been shown to reduce glucose response throughout the day <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date, no study has explored the association of circadian fasting intervals and eating episodes with blood glucose levels in pregnant women, a high risk population vulnerable to hyperglycemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>A better understanding of how fasting intervals and eating episodes associate with glucose levels in pregnant women may lead to improved strategies in gestational glycemic control.</s><s>Singapore (located 1.3Â° North, 103.8Â°</s><s>East) is a country which experiences sunrise and sunset daily at a consistent time (i.e.</s><s>sunrise at ~0700h and sunset at~1900h), with fairly constant day length of 12 hours throughout the year <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>This provides us a good opportunity to examine the association of circadian timing and episodes of eating with glycemic levels in free-living pregnant women.</s><s>Using data from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study involving a multi-ethnic Asian population <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, we tested the hypotheses that longer maternal night-fasting interval (1900 to 0659h) was associated with lower plasma glucose concentrations; while more frequent eating episodes per day was associated with higher plasma glucose concentrations in women during the late-second trimester of pregnancy.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In an Asian cohort, pregnant women were found to have an average of 9.9 hours of nightfasting intervals and 4.2 eating episodes each day.</s><s>This study provides new evidence showing that longer maternal night-fasting intervals were associated with lower FG; whereas more frequent daily episodes of eating were associated with higher 2-hour glucose in women during the late-second trimester of pregnancy, after accounting for various demographic and lifestyle factors, as well as diet composition.</s><s>These findings suggest that both circadian timing of food intake and number of eating episodes should be considered in managing gestational glycemia.</s><s>Maternal FG could be controlled through modifying fasting intervals at night, which allows synchronization with the body's circadian resting rhythms; while maternal 2-hour glucose could be controlled by adjusting the number of eating episodes per day.</s></p><p><s>Across time, human activity and feeding have generally occurred during the day, while rest and fasting typically occurred at night.</s><s>We speculate that shortened night-fasting intervals might lead to misalignment with the day-night rhythms of glucose homeostasis.</s><s>This could disrupt functions of metabolic regulator pathways implicated in glucose homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36)</ref>.</s><s>In mice, synchronization of the feeding-fasting cycle with dark-light phases of the day improves oscillations of circadian clock components in the liver and hepatic glucose metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, maintains intestinal barrier integrity and minimizes bacterial translocation which can promote systemic inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, impairing hepatic glucose regulation.</s><s>In addition, reduced eating episodes with a longer fasting interval between meals may help to generate sharp feeding-fasting cycles, which consolidate circadian patterns in gene expression and circadian activation of various metabolic pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the current study, we showed that longer maternal night-fasting intervals were associated with lower FG.</s><s>This finding took into account macronutrient intakes, suggesting that besides diet composition and quality, it is important to also consider the circadian timing of food intake when managing gestational glycemia.</s><s>This finding is also supported by animal studies where rodents with 12-hour restricted feeding during the active phase (dark phase) had reduced FG <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>, independent of the diet composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, we found no association between maternal night-fasting intervals and 2-hour glucose.</s><s>This stands at odds with a recent epidemiologic study involving 1066 women from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>The authors found that increased night-fasting interval was associated with lower 2-hour glucose; however FG was not examined in the study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>The NHANES study defined night-fasting as the time between the last and first meal intake of the next day, which could have included extended fasting resulting from events such as breakfast skipping.</s><s>Our study defined night-fasting using a narrower period by restricting it within a specified time from 1900 to 0659h, consistent with the dark phase of the day.</s><s>Extended fasting may result in different glycemic response and was not examined in this study.</s></p><p><s>Our finding of frequent eating and higher 2-hour glucose is consistent with several previous randomized crossover trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>, but not others <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>.</s><s>Trials involving healthy adults showed that consumption of frequent meals at 6 or 14 times resulted in higher glucose levels across the day compared to those who consumed 3 meals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>, suggesting that frequent eating episodes results in poorer glycemic control.</s><s>However, this observation contrasts with findings from Solomon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> and Kanaley et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> who found no difference in glucose response over a period of 8 to 12-hour when comparing a high frequency (6 or 12 meals) and a low frequency (2 or 3 meals) eating pattern in lean and obese adults.</s><s>Similarly, no association was observed between eating episodes and 2-hour glucose in the United States NHANES study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Discrepancies in findings may be partly due to differences in the diet composition and definition of eating episodes used across studies.</s></p><p><s>Maternal glycemia has been shown to significantly impact offspring metabolic health.</s><s>Evidence from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study involving 23,316 pregnant women reported strong, continuous associations of maternal FG and 2-hour glucose levels below those diagnostic of diabetes with increased birth weight, cord blood serum C-peptide values (an index of fetal Î²-cell function) (1) and neonatal adiposity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, data from our GUSTO cohort also demonstrated continuous associations between maternal glucose levels and excessive neonatal adiposity which extended across the range of glycemia (3).</s><s>In particular, raised FG was associated with increased offspring adiposity in the first 36 months of life among non-obese women (4).</s><s>This indicates that even moderate changes in glucose levels may influence fetal growth.</s><s>Although it raises the possibility that shortened night-fasting intervals and increased eating episodes during pregnancy can adversely impact offspring metabolic health through increased maternal FG and 2-hour glucose respectively, this hypothesis needs to be addressed in further studies or randomized trials.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of this study included a large sample of pregnant women and the ability to factor for a wide array of socio-demographic, health and lifestyle variables in our analyses.</s><s>However, we recognized and considered the following limitations.</s><s>First, the use of single day self-reported dietary data to assess women's night-fasting intervals and eating episodes might be subjected to response bias and inter-day variations.</s><s>Information on intakes of complex vs simple carbohydrates, and plant vs animal protein was not available for these analyses.</s><s>However, our findings were supported by results based on sensitivity analyses using the 3-day food diaries.</s><s>Second, no glucose measurement was done in between FG and 2-hour glucose, and thus we were not able to determine the post-OGTT response using the trapezoid method (41) which serves as a better measure for glucose tolerance.</s><s>Our findings were also limited by the lack of data on serum insulin, C-peptide and insulin growth factors, which would have allowed for the assessment on insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell response to mechanistically explain our findings.</s><s>In addition, blood samples and dietary assessment were only collected at one-time point in the late-second trimester which restricted our ability to evaluate the time course effects of eating behavior on glycemic control.</s><s>Third, we did not aim to examine the impact of snacking on glucose levels, therefore eating episodes were not differentiated between main meals and snacks.</s><s>Forth, differences in age and ethnicity were noted between included and excluded women.</s><s>This could introduce a potential selection bias, but were controlled for in the analyses.</s><s>Fifth, no objective measure was used to capture physical activity and sleep data.</s><s>Sixth, the effect estimates might be affected by unadjusted or residual confounding factors that remained such as artificial light exposure at night.</s><s>Finally, our study recruited Asian participants which may limit the generalizability of our findings to populations of other ethnic groups.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this to our knowledge is the first study to demonstrate that fasting for a longer interval during the night and eating less frequently throughout the day were independently associated with reduced FG and 2-hour glucose respectively in women at the late-second trimester of pregnancy.</s><s>Although we found modest reductions in glucose levels which may appear trivial, these improvements over time may have a cumulative effect which can help to prevent the consequences of gestational hyperglycemia.</s><s>We recommend that the current nutritional management should include the practice of preserving a natural rhythm of daytime feeding and night-time sleeping patterns rather than to eat at night <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, as well as to maintain a moderate eating frequency.</s><s>This will hopefully provide a novel, simple, feasible and sustainable dietary strategy for pregnant women to improve glycemic control.</s><s>However, this observational study does not imply causality; long-term and large-scale randomized trials are warranted to confirm our findings and evaluate the clinical practice applicability in order to support the public health recommendations.</s><s>In countries which experience seasonal variations, study design needs to be season specific and different cut-offs for feeding-fasting timing are required.</s><s>Future studies should also evaluate the diurnal variations of blood glucose and, most importantly, the underlying biological and/ or social mechanisms.</s><s>Characteristics of GUSTO pregnant women according to night-fasting intervals and eating episodes per day 1      Table <ref type="table">3</ref> Associations of maternal
