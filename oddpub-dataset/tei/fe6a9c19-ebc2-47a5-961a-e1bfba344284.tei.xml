<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods:</head><p><s>We used a prospective case-control design nested within a larger cohort study of help-seeking young people at ultra-high risk (UHR) of developing psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>All participants were part of a cohort of 416 young people aged 15 to 30 years, who were help-seeking and met criteria for being at UHR for psychotic disorder.</s><s>The participants were recruited from a specialist clinicthe Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) clinicin a publically funded youth mental health service in Melbourne, Australia.</s><s>The referral characteristics of the PACE clinic <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , and the UHR features for psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , have been previously described.</s></p><p><s>Briefly, all participants had one or more of the following criteria: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms; (ii) brief limited intermittent psychotic symptoms; and/or (iii) trait vulnerability for psychotic illness (schizotypal personality disorder or history of psychosis in a first-degree relative) along with deterioration in functioning or chronic low functioning.</s><s>The exclusion criteria for entry to PACE clinic included a previous psychotic episode, an organic cause for presentation, and past total antipsychotic exposure equivalent to a haloperidol dosage of more than 15 mg.</s><s>A detailed description of the cohort has been previously published <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>In addition, participants with full threshold BD I or II at baseline were excluded from the examination of incident mania in this study.</s><s>Participants included in this study were recruited from five baseline studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> including two intervention studies (involving lithium and risperidone).</s><s>The lithium intervention was not aimed at (sub)threshold manic or affective symptoms, but was an open label intervention for attenuated psychotic symptoms related to UHR status.</s><s>Assessments in these studies were conducted by trained research assistants.</s><s>The studies associated with this project were approved by the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent.</s></p><p><s>Baseline Measures and risk factors/variables: The baseline data on subthreshold symptoms, use of substances or antidepressants and family history were extracted by the first author (AR, a consultant psychiatrist) from a number of sources including: (i) the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders SCID-I/P, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , including additional notes made by baseline assessors; (ii) Family Interview for Genetic Studies FIGS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> ; and (iii) patients' clinical files.</s><s>In case of discrepancies across these sources, these were resolved using clinical judgment of the primary author (a psychiatrist).</s><s>BD I or II at baseline were excluded as possible diagnoses for all participants in the current study using SCID-I/P.</s><s>records.</s><s>Cannabis and alcohol use severity was measured as the frequency of use in the preceding month as well as lifetime use;</s></p><p><s>v. symptom severity measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale -total score (BPRS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ), Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ), Hamilton</s></p><p><s>Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ) , and the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> ).</s><s>The different domains of the CAARMS included disorders of thought content, perceptual abnormalities, conceptual disorganization, motor disturbances, disorders of concentration/attention/memory, disorders of emotions and affect, subjectively impaired energy and impaired tolerance to normal stress;</s></p><p><s>vi. functioning as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22 )</ref> scale and Heinrich's Quality of Life Scale (QLS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>Follow-up:</s></p><p><s>Among the participants initially assessed between 1993 and 2006, 74.8% (311) were followed up between 5 and 13 years later.</s><s>The participants included in the study were followed up in two waves;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In a sample of help-seeking youth with a clinical high-risk state for psychosis, the numbers making a transition rate to mania over the 5 to 13-year follow-up period was low.</s></p><p><s>Subthreshold manic symptoms, antidepressant use and lower functioning were associated with later episodes of mania.</s></p><p><s>Comment [SJ6]: I think you need to describe the analyses in this table a bit, particularly the difference in mania symptom frequency</s></p><p><s>Overall, the association with subthreshold manic symptoms points to the utility of the prodromal approach for mania particularly in staging models for severe mental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Previous prospective studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> have also identified the occurrence of subthreshold manic symptoms prior to threshold manic episodes.</s><s>The higher prevalence of antidepressant use may point to their potential contribution in switch from depression to mania <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Alternatively, this may also indicate that persons with greater severity of depression may beare more likely to be prescribed antidepressant medication, consistent with clinical practice guidelines.</s></p><p><s>Greater severity of depression has been previously identified to be associated with transition to mania among adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The identified association with lower functioning may point to the possibility of this being associated with the incipient risk of transition to psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , which occurred in a majority of the UHR-manic sample.</s><s>Thus, lower functioning could represent a clinical phenotype that has greater risk of transition to BD with psychosis, as outlined in staging models for this disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>This has been supported by the finding of lower psychosocial functioning in people with comorbid psychosis in the months following an acute mood episode in BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations:</head><p><s>The small number of conversions to mania in the cohort limited the power to detect smaller differences between groups.</s><s>However, the small number of conversions to mania is itself indicative of the possibility that samples with standard UHR criteria for psychoses may be relatively less useful in prevention paradigms for mania.</s><s>This may be consistent with the low rate of incident BD reported in a large cohort of UHR participants from North America, though the length of follow-up in that study may have been lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The confounding effect of the risk for psychosis in the sample is also an important examination of factors more specific for BD.</s><s>However, given the high genetic and/or clinical loading for psychosis at baseline for all participants, as well as the large proportion that also transitioned to psychosis by follow-up, it was not possible to parse out the risk for psychosis in the current sample.</s><s>Determination of diagnosis of eight control participants and two manic participants using non-interview based means (i.e., mental health registries) may be another limitation.</s><s>However, it is unlikely that significant episodes of mania were missed, as these usually lead to contact with public mental health services.</s><s>The lack of availability of some data particularly with respect to substance use both at baseline and in the intervening time points before the onset of mania limits the ability of the study to control for these confounding variables.</s><s>However, substance-induced manic episodes were excluded using SCID interviews.</s><s>Lack of blinding and or extraction of data by independent raters may have increased the risk of observation and expectancy bias.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance for pre-onset identification and interventions:</head><p><s>This study validates the subthreshold symptom approach in predicting the onset of mania.</s><s>The identified characteristics may help improve risk prediction tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> for the onset of mania among help-seeking young people with an at-risk mental state for psychosis but possibly also other help-seeking young people with clinical symptoms, distress or family history.</s><s>The Bipolar At-Risk (BAR) criteria are an example of such a risk prediction tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , which have been associated with prospective transition risks of 11% within one year of follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>These criteria incorporate concepts of subthreshold mania, cyclothymic features, depression and genetic risk among youth at a similar age group as those with UHR criteria.</s><s>Incorporation of reduced functioning in such criteria may be important given the association with transition to mania and/or psychosis.</s></p><p><s>This finding also points to the possible trans-diagnostic significance of deterioration in functioning prior to the onset of severe mental disorders.</s><s>The trans-diagnostic enriching of these disorders is also indicated by the finding that those with UHR criteria and baseline BD were at a greater risk of transition to psychosis in short to medium term follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , a finding that was not identified with non-bipolar depressive mood disorders or anxiety disorders.</s><s>The association with antidepressant use may be of clinical relevance in considering the risks of prescription of these medications for help-seeking young people when other risk factors of latent bipolarity such as subthreshold manic symptoms or family history of severe mental disorders are present.</s><s>Future well-powered cohort studies with cross-diagnostic outcomes will help clarify the predictive power of these risk factors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Subthreshold symptoms of mania, antidepressant use as well as lower global functioning in UHR patients at baseline should raise clinical concern about the possibility of transition to manic episodes with or without comorbid psychosis.</s><s>Incorporation of these factors into atrisk states for psychoses may help develop broader cross-diagnostic risk criteria among helpseeking youth.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Can you reference the trial here?</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
