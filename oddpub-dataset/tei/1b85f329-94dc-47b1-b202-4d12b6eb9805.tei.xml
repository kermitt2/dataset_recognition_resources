<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>We spend a considerable amount of our lives looking at and scrutinizing human faces.</s><s>This is not surprising because at least in vision these stimuli are of outstanding importance for successful social communication.</s><s>For major cognitive functions like face processing it is of prime importance to identify and explicitly describe those computational steps which are realized by specialized neuronal ensembles (modules).</s><s>This will deliver deep insight into cerebral function and biologically inspire technical applications which are still far off the efficiency of real brains.</s></p><p><s>Currently it is still controversial whether face processing is at least partially modularized.</s><s>Partial means that for example neural mechanisms of recognition / identification are modularized whereas others, e.g. the evaluation of facial expression, are not.</s><s>Evidence from brain imaging with selective activations in occipitotemporal cortex, namely the fusiform gyrus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and various case reports of acquired prosopagnosia (aPA), a deficit of familiar face recognition, e.g.</s><s>caused by ischemic infarction are taken as evidence for a face selective module <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Opponents of this view claim that faces are exceptional due to massive overlearning because this leads to activations in the same locations for artificial objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Also, in many instances acquired prosopagnosia is accompanied by general deficits of object recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We understand modularity in a Fodorian sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>A thorough discussion of this complex term can be found in Pernet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Based on this discussion a cognitive module is instantiated by a set(s) of neurons that carry out a single specific task if and only if they are confronted with a well-defined piece of information (here: certain aspects of a face).</s><s>The operation of the module cannot be carried out elsewhere in the brain (by any other set of neurons).</s><s>Consequently its impairment cannot be directly compensated for and the corresponding function gets lost (here: impaired recognition of familiar faces).</s><s>This does not necessarily imply overt behavioural confinement for the individual as the loss of a specific modular function can be compensated for by existing neural machinery; e.g., a person can be reliably recognized by his/ her characteristic gait and stance.</s></p><p><s>More recently, by elegantly combining fMRI and single cell recordings in macaque monkeys Tsao, Freiwald, Tootell and Livingstone <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> could identify an area in which 97% of all neurons under study were highly face selective with a mean face selectivity index of 0.9 which is close to being specific.</s><s>A few cells also gave a significant response to clocks and round fruits probably because these stimuli share the feature roundness with faces.</s><s>This finding is indicative of modular processing, but first its behavioural consequence has to be shown and second a correspondence in humans has to be revealed.</s></p><p><s>Over the last years a form of prosopagnosia has attracted attention that presents itself without any indication of damage to the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Because of lifelong impairment and familial clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> this condition has been termed "congenital prosopagnosia".</s><s>The core deficit in cPA is the impaired recognition of familiar faces which has been used as the defining neuropsychological criterion, e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Evidently analysis of this condition may significantly advance our understanding of face processing.</s></p><p><s>However, impaired face recognition performance in congenital prosopagnosia (cPA) is not sufficient to decide whether this condition is caused by dysfunction in core structures of face processing or e.g. by deviant social behaviour like in autism with malfunctioning outside of a face processing system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The majority of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging were unable so far to show consistent differences in activations between persons with cPA and controls in brain regions, implicated in face processing, especially in the so-called core face system <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>It is well conceivable that the alteration of a transient face processing step evades the slow BOLD response (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for the same argument).</s><s>More recently though fMRI reveals functional as well as structural differences between subjects with cPA and controls: Furl et al. could significantly relate face selectivity of fusiform gyrus as measured by fMRI and face identification ability as measured behaviourally in subjects with cPA and controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> using diffusion tensor imaging reports that reduction of white-matter tracts in ventral occipitotemporal cortex of persons with cPA-compared to controls-correlates with low performance in face recognition.</s><s>This is complemented by two studies of the same group which use different fMRI paradigms to probe face processing and reveal a functional dissociation between the so-called "core" regions of face processing and "extended" regions outside <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>Surprisingly, also methods with high temporal resolution (EEG, MEG) have failed to provide conclusive results in cPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically the N170 (and its magnetoencephalographic analogon, the M170) which is considered as the earliest face-selective evoked response <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> lose their face selectivity only in a subset of persons with cPA.</s><s>To account for the variability of results it has been argued <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref> that cPA comprises separate entities with impairment of different stages of face processing.</s></p><p><s>Given the current evidence we hypothesize that in face processing an early processing step (in the Bruce and Young Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> the structural encoder) tagged by N/M170 which codes the characteristic basic configuration that constitutes a face, i.e. the regions of eyes mouth and nose and their geometrical relation, is modularized and a necessary step in a chain of processes that lead to successful face recognition/ identification.</s><s>We further hypothesize that this step is dysfunctional in congenital prosopagnosia.</s><s>The circumscribed nature of the neural deficit in cPA implies that a corresponding behavioural impairment should be confined to aspects of face processing that directly rely on configural processing, e.g.</s><s>recognition / identification.</s></p><p><s>We provided behavioural evidence for impaired configural processing in cPA for the same sample of subjects who participated in the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>According to our hypothesis of early modularized dysfunctional face processing as evinced by electrophysiology and in order to show task independence of the predicted result we implemented two different continuous target detection tasks.</s><s>In the first experiment subjects had to respond to the direction of motion of a face or a house target.</s><s>In the second experiment subjects had to respond to an individual famous face (e.g. Bill Clinton) or house (e.g.</s><s>Brandenburger Tor) target, which was memorized before the beginning of the experiment.</s><s>We are aware of the fact that non-invasive imaging techniques cannot prove modularization of certain processing steps of cognitive function.</s><s>But-as in the case of face processing-they can add evidence to corroborate the hypothesis of modularity.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stimulus presentation and task</head><p><s>In the experiment 1, participants viewed a random sequence of unknown face and house greyscale photographs (for details see <ref type="bibr">Fig 1)</ref>, 200 in each stimulus category.</s><s>85% (170/200) of the face stimuli and 85% (170/200) of the house stimuli were stationary non-targets.</s><s>15% (30/200) of faces and 15% (30/200) of houses were moving targets.</s><s>Participants had to selectively respond to the target stimuli (for details see below).</s><s>The entire experiment was divided into two blocks with a short break in between.</s></p><p><s>A non-target trial went on as follows: first, a face or a house stimulus appeared for 350ms, followed by an interstimulus interval of variable length between 800 and 1100ms due to a fixed interval of 800ms and a randomized interval between 0 and 200ms.</s><s>The purpose of the randomization was to prevent synchronization of the alpha rhythm with the heartbeat.</s><s>Second, an individually scrambled version of the face or the house was shown, again for 350ms.</s><s>Scrambling was realized in the usual way by first dividing the face or house stimulus in squares that were randomly rearranged.</s><s>The main purpose of the scrambled stimuli was to serve as difference stimuli in a localization procedure, but they are irrelevant in the context of the present analysis.</s><s>The scrambled stimulus was also followed by a variable ISI which finished the trial.</s></p><p><s>A target trial was identical in timing and stimulus structure to a non-target trial, except for the fact that the face or the house stimulus could now move in vertical or horizontal direction which had to be indicated by key press with the left or the right index finger (motion discrimination).</s><s>A motion sequence is detailed as follows: first, the stimulus was presented in the centre, second it randomly appeared at a position to the left/ right or up/ down of the initial position.</s><s>Shift size was approximately 1 degree of visual angle.</s><s>Third, the stimulus reappeared at the centre.</s><s>Presentation time at all three positions was 75ms.</s><s>Such a sequence creates the well-known illusion of apparent movement.</s></p><p><s>The rationale for this task was to have minimal impact on face and object processing in ventral occipitotemporal cortex because motion is analysed in area V5 being well removed from the fusiform face area <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The main purpose of experiment 2 was to replicate the results of experiment 1 with a task of different cognitive load.</s><s>It should be noted that experiment 1 is an attentive fixation task with no operation explicitly required to be performed on facial attributes since participants had to respond to the direction of motion.</s><s>In experiment 2 subjects had to respond exclusively to a rare famous face or famous house target being inserted in a random sequence of frequent unfamiliar faces and houses (non-targets), for details see Fig 2 <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>The reason to use unfamiliar nontargets was to exclude a priori any confounding due to the fact that the neural representation of familiar faces is hypothesized to be dysfunctional in congenital prosopagnosia.</s><s>The timing of this experiment was identical to that of experiment 1 except for the fact that no scrambled stimulus was shown.</s><s>In 16 subsequent blocks participants alternately had to respond to a face or to a house target.</s><s>The face and the house target appeared 5 times each, amongst 25 unfamiliar faces and houses.</s><s>Thus a single block consisted of 60 stimuli adding up to 16 x 60 = 960 stimuli over the entire session.</s><s>In total, 400 unfamiliar faces and 400 unfamiliar houses were shown which gave 200 stimuli per condition (unfamiliar / familiar face or house) to average over.</s><s>To maximize target recognisability-crucial for the persons with cPA-a set of 10 potential face and house targets was shown prior to the experiment.</s><s>Each subject was asked to choose one famous face or house which he thought to recognize best.</s><s>This face or house target was subsequently used.</s><s>A further purpose of the second experiment was to replicate results from Lueschow et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> and Furey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> according to which the M170 is not modulated by selective attention and we hypothesized that also in the present experiment this should be the case.</s></p></div>
