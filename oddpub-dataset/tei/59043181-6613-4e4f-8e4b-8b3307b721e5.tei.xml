<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Among a community sample participating in a longitudinal observational cohort study, we found that in comparison with exclusive smokers, established dual users were more likely to be younger, have more than a high school education, be white, have a psychiatric history (ie, self-reported history of diagnosis or treatment for depression and/or ADHD), and live with someone who uses e-cigarettes.</s><s>We also found that dual users, on average, were more motivated to quit smoking combustible cigarettes (mean of 3.68 of 10), smoked three fewer cigarettes per day, had a lower cigarette dependence (FTCD) score, and delayed smoking their first cigarette in the morning than exclusive smokers.</s><s>However, there was no difference in motivation to quit or FTCD score between dual users and exclusive smokers when dual users smoking fewer than 5 cigarettes/day were removed from the sample in the sensitivity analyses.</s><s>The change in motivation score was small (3.68-3.63),</s><s>suggesting the change in significance might be a function of reduced sample size.</s><s>However, the change in FTCD score was more substantial (4.47-4.15),</s><s>but it could reflect the artifact of the different cigarettes per day inclusion criteria for the two groups.</s><s>Dual users' lower levels of NNAL are consistent with significantly less exposure to cigarette smoke.</s><s>However, dual users did not differ from smokers in their carbon monoxide or nicotine metabolite levels.</s><s>Expired carbon monoxide may not reflect daily smoke intake as it has a short half-life and is very sensitive to the time from the last cigarette.</s><s>However, urine cotinine and the cotinine+3HC are strong indicators of daily nicotine intake. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Our results indicate that smokers and dual users take in approximately the same amount of nicotine per day, suggesting that dual users may compensate for smoking fewer cigarettes by obtaining supplemental nicotine from e-cigarettes.</s><s>Another recent study found that saliva cotinine levels were similar in dual users and in exclusive e-cigarette users, suggesting a similar average desired daily level of nicotine intake among users of tobacco products that can be satisfied by any combination of conventional and e-cigarettes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>he dual users used e-cigarettes at a sufficiently high frequency so that such compensation seems possible (on average, near daily use and 10 uses/day), even though the mean puffs/use event (2.2) was low compared to other survey studies of dual users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>Although a laboratory study of puffing behavior did suggest that the majority of vaping sessions involve five or fewer puffs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> the self-report data from this study are likely limited by participants' ability to provide a single mean number of puffs/vaping session.</s><s>Some of these findings are consistent with the extant literature, such as the finding that dual users are less dependent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>Shahab et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> similarly found that dual users smoked approximately 3 cigarettes/day fewer than exclusive smokers but did not differ in cotinine levels.</s><s>However, in contrast to the present findings, Shahab et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> found that dual users' levels of NNAL were similar to those of exclusive smokers, although their sample size was small (n = 36).</s></p><p><s>These findings are also consistent with past findings that dual users rate e-cigarettes as less satisfying than combustible cigarettes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>However, although we found that dual users reported greater motivation to quit smoking than did exclusive smokers, Brose et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> did not find such a difference in a population-based study.</s><s>Brose et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> also found that daily e-cigarette use was positively related to increased quit attempts.</s><s>Thus, this research contributes to the mounting evidence that smokers use e-cigarettes to help them quit, and such use is associated with higher quitting motivation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>9]<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> However, more research, including longitudinal cohort research, is needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> to identify the relations of e-cigarette use with smoking cessation since conflicting data exist. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>Future analyses of these data will examine whether dual use is related to subsequent smoking cessation activity in this sample.</s></p><p><s>There was a decrease in total NNAL levels in this study, but the reduction was modest.</s><s>It is unclear whether a modest reduction in NNK exposure is clinically meaningful with respect to reducing cancer risk. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Urine NNAL is highly correlated with exposure to other tobacco smoke toxicants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>Insofar as tobacco-related disease is linearly related to exposure to toxicants, one might expect some reduction in disease risk in dual users.</s><s>However, this is not likely the case for cardiovascular disease.</s><s>A recent meta-analysis found that even 1 cigarette/ day substantially increases cardiovascular risk, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> suggesting that a modest reduction in smoke exposure may not meaningfully reduce cardiovascular risk.</s></p><p><s>The finding of higher levels of psychiatric comorbidity among dual users compared to exclusive smokers agrees with some prior findings.</s><s>For instance, adults (including smokers and nonsmokers) who had been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or another mental health condition were significantly more likely to have tried e-cigarettes and be current users of e-cigarettes than were individuals without such psychiatric issues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Further, adults who already smoke combustible cigarettes and had mental health issues were more likely to try e-cigarettes than were smokers without such conditions (60.5% vs. 45.3%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Conversely, though, national survey data show that both exclusive smokers and dual users had elevated psychological distress compared to nonsmokers, but that smokers had higher psychological distress than dual users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>he strength of the inferences permitted by this research is limited by the use of nonrandomized, naturally occurring comparison groups and by different smoking heaviness inclusion criteria for the two groups.</s><s>The change in inclusion criteria resulted in the inclusion of 30 dual users (11.7%) who smoked fewer than 5 cigarettes/ day.</s><s>Although this may increase the external validity of the sample (ie, it may be that many dual users are not smoking 5 cigarettes/ day <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ), it does influence the comparability of the two samples.</s><s>However, the sensitivity analyses that excluded dual users smoking less than 5 cigarettes/day revealed consistent demographic or biomarker results.</s><s>Despite these limitations, this study illustrates similarities and differences between exclusive smokers and dual users that should be considered when attempting to anticipate</s></p></div><figure
