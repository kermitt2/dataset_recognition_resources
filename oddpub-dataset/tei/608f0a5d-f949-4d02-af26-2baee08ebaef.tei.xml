healthy controls.</s><s>Subjects matched for age, sex, BMI and major CVD risk factors (low traditional risk population).</s><s>Our study demonstrates, that microvascular impairment in AS is associated with disease activity.</s><s>Anti-TNF-α treatment restores microvascular function and diminishes peri-capillary edema assessed by capillaroscopy in patients with high disease activity.</s><s>While impaired microvascular function has been shown recently by smaller studies using invasive methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> or in mixed un-defined arthritis populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , we have used appropriately powered population size of subjects with AS with low traditional CV risk.</s><s>We also demonstrated that simple, non-invasive techniques, available in most rheumatology clinics may be useful in assessing microvascular status.</s><s>Finally, we have shown that TNFi effects persist past the therapy initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , and are very clear at 3 month timepoint.</s><s>Several chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased cardiovascular risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Most previous studies have focused on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>The data regarding spondyloarthropaties, including AS are limited, although CV mortality and morbidity increase is evident <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>It is not clear however, if increased CV risk is caused by inflammatory disease activity or is secondary to traditional risk factors, such as dyslipidemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> or hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , that are often present in AS.</s></p><p><s>Numerous model and observational studies and more recently clinical randomized trials, such as CANTOS, indicate an important role of inflammation in mediating increased cardiovascular risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</s><s>Inflammatory cells and mediators induce endothelial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , subsequent plaque formation and plaque instability resulting in acute coronary syndromes.</s><s>Thus, anti-inflammatory therapies may provide several protective mechanisms in vascular dysfunction in atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>A recent meta-analysis suggests that TNF-α inhibitors improve endothelial function in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Comparable effects in AS may be attributed to reducing systemic inflammation present in these two diseases.</s><s>On the other hand, inflammation is less pronounced in spondyloarthropaties, so the effects may be weaker and more difficult to confirm.</s><s>Studies of inflammatory mechanisms of cardiovascular risk focus on macrovascular dysfunction and disease.</s><s>While this is important for acute MI development or ischemic strokes, numerous chronic conditions are associated with microvascular dysfunction, which may be a key mechanism for heart failure development, cognitive impairment and vascular dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, it has been reported that microvascular dysfunction may lead to CV events even in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, identification of profoundly impaired microvascular flow mediated endothelial function and abnormalities within microvessel morphology may have numerous long term clinical consequences.</s><s>Thanks to careful selection of study population without CAD or diabetes with low prevalence of other classical risk factors and matching for age, sex and BMI, we were able to assess effects particularly attributable to AS itself.</s><s>This was further supported by links to disease activity and improvement with TNFi therapy.</s><s>While the fact that we studied patients treated using different TNF-α inhibitors could be considered as limitation, it also suggests, that the observed effects are not limited to one biologic agent.</s><s>The question remains whether the type of TNF-α inhibitor is of importance and affects the quantity and kind of changes in the microcirculation.</s><s>This could be essential in the treatment choice for patients with high CVD risk and such large randomized studies will hopefully clarify this in the future.</s></p><p><s>We used much simpler methodology of assessment than used in a seminal study of van Eijk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Approach presented in this study is non-invasive, reproducible and poses little discomfort to the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Thus, it is potentially valuable for vascular risk assessment in AS patients, accessible in the rheumatology clinics.</s><s>The measurements consisted of assessment of basal flow and dynamic PORH tests, which reflect ability of the vasculature to respond to external factors.</s><s>Dynamic variables such as peak hyperemia and time to peak are more sensitive in establishing endothelial dysfunction.</s><s>Indeed, the observed relationships were visible particularly in PORH.</s><s>Basal flow was increased only in reference to TNFi treatment which may be attributed to a greater potency of this factor than disease activity itself.</s><s>Reversibility of these microvascular changes with clinically effective therapies show that such improvement is aligned with the fact that low disease activity or TNFi therapy reduce inherent CVD risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and atherosclerosis progression in AS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Although LDF and PORH are considered valuable tools to study microcirculation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , they have some disadvantages such as indirect blood flow measurement and lack of standardization.</s><s>Skin vascular bed is also very sensitive to environmental factors which may affect the results and decrease reproducibility.</s><s>Most important are skin and room temperature and patient's stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>To overcome this, we controlled environmental temperature before measurements and measured skin temperature before examination which showed no differences between groups (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, Bland-Altman plots showed good reproducibility of the performed measurements (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>An unexplained issue remains the mechanism of endothelial function improvement after TNFi treatment.</s><s>LDF assessments were performed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment.</s><s>Such design made it impossible for us to distinguish whether these effects were chronic or acute.</s><s>However, the improvement in endothelial function after TNFi treatment is more pronounced and affects post-occlusive as well as basal flow indices, compared to active/ inactive disease analysis.</s><s>Based on that we can speculate that the effect of TNFi can be attributed not only to stabilization of the disease activity and inflammation but also to some other mechanisms -probably neutralization of the direct effects of circulating TNFα.</s></p><p><s>Nailfold capillaroscopy is also widely used in rheumatology, mainly in diagnosing and monitoring Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).</s><s>It describes the morphological state of microvasculature, and may be affected by ongoing inflammation.</s><s>SSc capillary pattern may be sometimes observed in other connective tissue disorders such as polymyositis/dermatomyositis, SLE, undifferentiated connective tissue disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> and Sjögren's syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>We characterized substantial changes in nailfold capillaroscopy between AS patients and healthy controls.</s><s>Increased occurrence of capillary ramifications and distinct heterogenous shape are hallmarks of ongoing neoangiogenesis.</s><s>The presence of pericapillary edema may indicate local plasma extravasation or synthesis of extracellular matrix.</s><s>Microvascular abnormalities in AS are not only limited to functional changes but also affect the morphology, similar to other connective tissue diseases.</s><s>Neoangiogenesis was not accompanied by other alterations such as capillary loss as in late SSc pattern.</s><s>Thus, structural changes seem to be secondary to functional impairment which lead to abnormal blood flow, hypoxia and angiogenesis.</s><s>Interestingly, such morphological abnormalities were already observed in subjects with low disease activity.</s><s>3 months of TNFi treatment, in the active disease group, led to a decrease in pericapillary edema, while other parameters were unchanged indicating that while functional changes and edema are reversible, morphological remodeling and number of capillaries is not.</s><s>While there is no direct evidence of clinical prognostic significance of capillaroscopic measurements in the long term follow up studies, pericapillary The limitation of the study are relatively small study groups.</s><s>However, these were sufficient for achieving sufficient statistical power and were comparable to numerous previous publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>As treatment was performed according to clinical indication rather than in randomized double blinded fashion, the results should be verified using RCT.</s><s>Vascular study investigators, were however blinded to the study groups in the initial part of the study, were not part of rheumatology treatment team and did not have access to data regarding treatment of the patients.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this work demonstrates that Ankylosing Spondylitis is associated with changes in microvascular function and morphology, which may explain the increased cardiovascular risk seen in this chronic condition.</s><s>Microvascular changes were more pronounced in patients with high disease activity and treatment with TNF-α inhibitors
