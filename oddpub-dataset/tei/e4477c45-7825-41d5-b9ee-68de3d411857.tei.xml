that recently published by Dougall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> They included 115 patients undergoing treatment for lung or pleural cancer and found that PTSD rates were between 5% and 16% when measured with the PTSD Checklist-Specific version PCL-S (a slightly different version of the PCL than the one we used). <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>However, when PTSD was measured with the PCL-S cutoff method, rates were only 3% to 8%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>It is important to note that this study had a significant number of dropouts (n = 93 baseline; n = 57 by the 4-month followup), so results should be interpreted with caution.</s><s>Further studies specific to lung cancer are required to investigate PTSD rates.</s><s>Second, we included a longitudinal study design, whereas most prior work is cross-sectional in nature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and we measured outcomes in the short term (up to 6 months following diagnosis) rather than in the longer-term survivorship phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Our results showed a worsening of PTSD symptoms over this time by a mean difference of 7 points.</s><s>This change is greater than the minimum threshold (difference of 5 points) considered to represent a reliable change (not resulting from chance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ; however, it is below the 10-point threshold for minimal clinically meaningful change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Our findings of worsening symptoms contradict the prior longitudinal studies in other cancer types, which generally show a considerable decline (improvement) in PTSD symptoms over the first 3 months after diagnosis and after treatment cessation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Given that people with lung cancer experience significant decline in functional ability over the first 6 months from diagnosis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> it would not be surprising if PTSD symptoms also worsened.</s><s>Our results similarly showed that people had a reduction in global quality of life, physical function, role function, emotional function, cognitive function, nausea/vomiting, insomnia, constipation, anxiety, and distress also over this time.</s><s>Because poorer health outcomes are seen in people who have PTSD, including poorer adherence to cancer treatments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> early detection and treatment is vital in the context of cancer.</s></p><p><s>Third, in our cohort, we had a high proportion of patients who were not made aware of their cancer diagnosis.</s><s>These patients were more commonly female and had worse HRQoL and higher depression levels at the time of diagnosis.</s><s>This is an interesting topic in the context of health care in China.</s><s>All patients in our study were of Chinese nationality, and 66% of these patients at initial diagnosis were unaware that they had lung cancer.</s><s>The concept of death in Chinese culture is strongly influenced by Confucianism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> and in Chinese culture, cancer is strongly related to death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>ccording to Confucianism, nondisclosure in Chinese health care is common and presents a barrier for medical professionals to discuss death.</s><s>Therefore, at the instruction of patients' families, often, patients are not informed of their cancer diagnosis by the doctor (or others). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>This is especially the case if the family believes that the patient does not have the ability to cope with this information.</s><s>Our data support this, in that these patients had worse HRQoL and higher depression levels at the time of diagnosis, suggesting that potentially, their families did not tell them of their diagnosis because they were worried about how the patient may cope with the knowledge.</s><s>It is customary in conventional Chinese culture for medical professionals to respect this decision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref></s><s>It is also common for families to hide factors from the patient that could identify their diagnosis to them, such as asking for the patient to be treated away from oncology settings-for example, respiratory rather than oncology wards.</s><s>Therefore, in this scenario, without the psychological reaction to being diagnosed with lung cancer, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> we hypothesize that these patients may be less likely to develop PTSD, depending on what type of illness they believe they are suffering from (whether or not this is a traumatic stressor).</s><s>Andrykowski et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> demonstrated that 37% (n = 70/189) of their patients with lung cancer (mean ± SD of 16 ± 2 months postdiagnosis) recognized that a lung cancer diagnosis and treatment was a traumatic stressor for them (based on meeting the DSM-IV stressor criteria). <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s>Unfortunately, we did not collect details of the diagnosis that the patient was given-that is, if they were told that they had a respiratory illness or another condition for which they were undergoing treatment-and although the traumatic event does not need to involve death to satisfy PTSD criteria (ie, it can be a threat to physical integrity), <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> we do not know how this theoretical threat may be perceived by the patient.</s><s>We did find that these patients experienced a similar increase in PTSD symptoms over 6 months, and there was no difference in PTSD symptoms at 6 months between patients who knew versus did not know of their diagnosis.</s><s>Further investigation of the cultural factors associated with the development of PTSD symptoms is required to understand how this information can be generalized for survivorship care across countries and cultures.</s></p><p><s>Although we had a low PTSD rate, we did find that at 6 months 64% of patients had mild PTSD symptoms and 8% had moderate PTSD symptoms.</s><s>Similarly, Jeantieu et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> reported a 51% incidence of PTSD symptoms (measured with the Impact of Events Scale-Revised) in their cohort of 48 patients with lung cancer in France 3 months after surgery.</s><s>They found preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain to be predictive of PTSD symptoms at 3 months after surgery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s>We found that predictors of higher PTSD scores 6 months after diagnosis included people diagnosed at a younger age, who had a lower smoking history and/or were more active, as well as those who had worse HRQoL and symptoms at diagnosis.</s><s>These are 2 distinctly different groups, and as such, the mechanisms behind their PTSD symptoms may vary.</s><s>The first is a young and generally healthy cohort at the time of diagnosis who are starting off at a higher health level; one could speculate that these individuals have the potential to experience greater magnitude of reduction in physical and psychological health from cancer causing a more significant impact on their daily life.</s><s>Prior studies have also found younger age to be a predictor of PTSD in lung and breast cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>The second group are in stark contrast.</s><s>They already had poor HRQoL and high symptom burden at the time of diagnosis.</s><s>It is well established that both poor HRQoL and high symptom burden at diagnosis are predictors of mortality in lung cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref></s><s>Our results suggest that these factors may also predict people who are at risk for experiencing symptoms of PTSD as well.</s><s>It was beyond the scope of our study to investigate the mechanisms behind the occurrence of symptoms of PTSD.</s><s>However, this is an important question for further investigation.</s><s>Also, comparisons of incidence of PTSD between patients in western countries and China would be interesting.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of this study include that it was reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and conducted prospectively.</s><s>It is limited by the inclusion of a convenience sample and a 19% rate of missing follow-up data, although a number of our missing cases were a result of death.</s><s>Additionally, we did not measure prior negative life stressors, and this is a known risk factor for PTSD in the cancer population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Further measures at 12 months may also be warranted in future research.</s><s>We did not ask participants about passive smoking, and this may explain the relatively low smoking rates in the study.</s></p></div>
