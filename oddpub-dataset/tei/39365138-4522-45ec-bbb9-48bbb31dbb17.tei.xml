<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scale Development</head><p><s>The construction of the DFS was guided by <ref type="bibr">Baumeister et al.'s (1998)</ref> Strength Model of Self-Control and extant literature on decision making under risk and uncertainty.</s><s>Conceptually, the authors constructed the DFS to capture the dominant features of decision fatigue: altered emotional regulation and cognitive processing, increased mental effort expended to make decisions, and impulsive decision making.</s><s>It is intended to be a brief, subjective measure that can be easily administered across settings and types of decisions.</s><s>The initial DFS was initially developed by the authors and consisted of 13 items.</s><s>Subsequently, individual interviews with scientific experts in the fields of ethics and behavioral decision making, and surrogate decision makers of critically ill patients, were conducted to assess content validity.</s><s>During the interviews, these content experts were asked to affirm that the scale items represented the dominant features of decision fatigue, and they provided feedback for revising the phrasing of the scale's items.</s><s>Based on their recommendations, three items were removed, resulting in the 10-item version of the DFS used in this psychometric evaluation.</s></p><p><s>The 10-item version of the DFS was evaluated in this report.</s><s>It was designed as a unidimensional measure to capture the influence of dysregulation in emotion regulation (emotional distress), cognitive processing (mental exhaustion), and impulsive decision making (behaviors) as perceived by the respondent across one week.</s><s>Having the respondents recall their level of decision fatigue perceived across a specified period of time overcomes the within and between-day variations in decision fatigue severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Norquist, Girman, Fehnel, Demuro, &amp; Santanello, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Respondents were prompted to reflect on how they felt when making decisions during the last week and endorse the scale items on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (strongly disagree) to 3 (strongly agree).</s><s>Total scores for the DFS are derived by summing the scale items, and the range of total scores is 0 to 30; higher total scores are posited to correlate with the intensity of perceived decision fatigue by the rater.</s></p><p><s>The DFS was intended to be easily administered using conventional interview formats and comprehended by individuals with low literacy.</s><s>According to the Flesch-Kincaid readability tests, the 10-item DFS is fairly easy to read (Flesch reading ease score of 73% range: 0% = very difficult to 100% = very easy to read).</s><s>Further, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level estimate indicated that the DFS scale items can be read and comprehended by individuals with a 5 th grade U.S. education level or higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kincaid, Fishburne, Rogers, &amp; Chissom, 1975)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the DFS has been conceptualized as a brief, subjective measure of decision fatigue that can be easily administered across individuals with varied levels of education and literacy.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p><s>This psychometric evaluation used data generated from a descriptive correlational study of surrogate decision makers of decisionally impaired patients verified by an attending physician or advanced practice nurse in an ICU.</s><s>Surrogate decision makers were administered a battery of psychosocial measures, such as the DFS, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Decision Conflict Scale (DCS), and a neurocognitive task, approximately 24-96 hours following the presentation of a healthcare decision by the critical care team (T1), and administered the battery of self-report measures eight weeks later (T2).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample</head><p><s>A convenience sample of 101 surrogate decision makers was recruited from one of three (i.e., surgical, medical, and neurosciences) ICUs at an academic medical center located in Northeast Ohio.</s><s>All participants met the following eligibility criteria: (1) aged 18 years or older, (2) able to understand English, (3) the next of kin or legal representative for healthcare decision making for a decisionally impaired patient (i.e., Glasgow Coma Scale Motor score &lt; 6 and Eye response score &lt;3) who required three continuous days of acute mechanical ventilation and a healthcare decision (e.g., tracheostomy, hemodialysis, gastrostomy, artificial nutrition, do-not-resuscitate [DNR] order, or surgical procedure).</s><s>Individuals were excluded from participating if they: (1) had a preexisting psychiatric disorder with current medication and/or psychotherapy, (2) history of a neurocognitive impairment, or (3) profound vision and/or hearing impairment that would preclude variable measurement.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p><s>Prior the initiation of the study screening and recruitment procedures, institutional review board approval (IRB) was obtained.</s><s>Screening consisted of a two-staged process to determine a patient's eligibility conducted by research assistants each weekday to eligible patients.</s><s>Once a patient was deemed eligible for this study, the research assistant approached the attending physician or nurse practitioner providing care to the patient to: (1) verify the patient's cognitive status, (2) confirm that the patient has an available surrogate decision maker, and (3) determine if the critical care team had presented a healthcare decision to the surrogate decision maker.</s><s>If the critical care team confirmed the eligibility status of the patient and identified a surrogate decision maker, the attending physician or nurse practitioner introduced the research assistant to the eligible surrogate decision maker.</s><s>At that time, the research assistant conducted secondary eligibility screening of the surrogate decision maker, and if that individual remained eligible to participate, the research assistant asked for written informed consent.</s></p><p><s>All subjective data were collected through structured interviews (e.g., face-to-face or via telephone).</s><s>Each interview was approximately 45-60 minutes and, on average, the DFS was completed in less than 5 minutes.</s><s>Participants who completed an interview received a $20 gift card to a retailer of their choice.</s><s>The data generated by the conduct of this research was directly entered by a research assistant into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Harris, Taylor, Thielke, &amp; Payne, 2009)</ref> and then exported to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for data analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approaches to the Assessment of Validity &amp; Reliability</head><p><s>Using SPSS, the statistical approach was carried out in three stages.</s><s>In the first stage of the statistical analysis, descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, means, and standard deviations) were conducted to describe the sample characteristics and the endorsement of the scale items.</s><s>The second stage consisted of the conduct of an exploratory factor analysis and assessments of the bivariate correlation coefficients among the total scores of the Decision Fatigue Scale, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, and Decision Conflict Scale were used to assess discriminant validity with the DFS.</s><s>In the final stage, evaluation of the internal consistency reliability of the DFS was assessed by interpretation of the Cronbach's alpha coefficients.</s><s>A detailed review of the statistical approaches used to determine the construct validity and internal consistency reliability is provided hereafter.</s></p><p><s>Construct Validity-Two forms of validity, factorial and discriminant, were evaluated for the DFS among surrogate decision makers of the critically ill.</s><s>A form of construct validity, factorial validity is the comparison of the theoretical and empirical organization of instrument items, which are most often assessed through the conduct of an exploratory factor analysis (EFA; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bagozzi, Yi, &amp; Phillips, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1978, p.111)</ref>.</s><s>Conceptually, the DFS was designed as a unidimensional measure of decision fatigue that captures several dimensions of decision fatigue.</s><s>Therefore, the authors conducted an EFA using principal axis factoring as the extraction method with a nonorthogonal rotation, direct oblimin rotation, to evaluate the interrelatedness of the scale items within latent dimensions (or factors) of the DFS.</s></p><p><s>Exploratory Factor Analysis-Several procedures were implemented to ensure the quality of the exploratory factor analysis.</s><s>Prior to the determination of factor structure of the DFS, an assessment of the sample adequacy was performed.</s><s>The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test [KMO = 0.83] and Bartlett's test of sphericity [χ 2 = 395.1,</s><s>p &lt;.001] were used to verify the adequacy of the 10:1 ratio of participants (N = 101) to the total number of scale items (n = 10).</s><s>Based on these statistics, the sample size of 101 subjects was sufficient to proceed with the conduct of the EFA.</s></p><p><s>Specification of Factor Structure-Inspection of the Cattell's scree plot, a graphical representation of eigenvalues plotted in descending order, and the application of the K1 method proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kaiser (1960)</ref>, which specifies that only factors with eigenvalues greater than one are retained for interpretation, were used to specify the number of factors (dimensions) to retain.</s></p><p><s>Item Retention-Items with primary factor loading coefficients &gt; 0.40 were retained and items with secondary factor loading coefficients &gt;0.20 were not retained.</s><s>For those items that did not meet the retention criterion, each item was sequentially removed and the EFA repeated until a parsimonious factor structure was identified that compromised of items that met the item retention criterion.</s><s>In the event that more than one factor was identified for the DFS factor structure, a thematic analysis of the content of the items within a factor was planned to label each factor.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Zait and Bertea (2011)</ref>, discriminant validity assumes that constructs which are not alike will not have a strong statistical association.</s><s>Discriminant validity was evaluated after identification of the most parsimonious factor structure revealed by the conduct of the EFA.</s><s>Given the hypothesized positive relationships among decision fatigue, impaired emotional regulation, severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and decisional conflict, it was assumed that discriminant validity would be confirmed if the scores for these constructs produced bivariate correlation coefficients of |r|&lt; 0.70 <ref type="bibr">(Zait &amp; Bertea, 2011)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Internal Consistency and Stability Reliability</head><p><s>Internal consistency and stability (test-retest) reliability of the 9-item DFS was confirmed through the interpretation of the Cronbach's alpha and bivariate correlation coefficients across an eight-week period.</s><s>The DFS had sufficient internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients of 0.87 and 0.90 at T1 and T2, respectively.</s><s>Across eight weeks, the total scores were stable (r = 0.56, p &lt;.001) and met the a prioricriterion of r &gt; 0.30.</s><s>Thus, the modified 9-item version of the DFS achieved sufficient internal consistency and stability reliability estimates.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Decision fatigue is a construct that can manifest from psychologically and cognitively taxing conditions, and contributes to self-regulatory failure and diminished decision making quality.</s><s>Given its theoretical linkages to health and healthcare decision making, decision fatigue is a relatively novel construct that may provide new insights on why people choose to engage in certain behaviors or choose a course of action.</s><s>Despite the broad application of this construct, there has been minimal effort made to develop a self-report measure of decision fatigue.</s><s>This article presents the reliability and validity of the Decision Fatigue Scale (DFS), the first self-report measure of decision fatigue, in a cohort of surrogate decision makers who have made a healthcare decision for a critically ill patient.</s></p><p><s>As a unidimensional measure, the DFS is valid and reliable among surrogate decision makers of the critically ill.</s><s>An EFA was conducted to assess the factor structure of the 10item DFS.</s><s>The findings from the EFA revealed that the most parsimonious factor structure was a 9-item, single factor solution.</s><s>To further examine the validity of the modified, 9-item version of the DFS, discriminant validity assessments were conducted between DFS scores and scores of two reliable and valid measures of emotional regulation and decisional conflict.</s><s>Based on the a priori criterion for discriminant validity, the DFS was established to possess sufficient discriminant validity with subscales scores of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), as well as the total scores of the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS).</s><s>Additionally, the valence (e.g., positivity or negativity) of the correlation coefficients between the DFS scores and the ERQ, HADS, and DCS scores were as hypothesized.</s></p><p><s>The reliability of the modified version of the DFS was captured through the assessments of internal consistency and stability (test-retest) reliability.</s><s>Our reliability estimates confirmed that the modified DFS had satisfactory internal consistency and stability reliability across eight weeks.</s><s>Yet, with no prior subjective measure of decision fatigue available, we are unable to comparatively evaluate the DFS with other measures of decision fatigue or its performance across clinical populations at this time.</s><s>This article provides the initial psychometric data that establishes the 9-item version of the DFS as a valid and reliable measure of decision fatigue among surrogate decision makers of the critically ill.</s></p><p><s>Decision fatigue is a construct that varies across time.</s><s>However, the construction of the DFS may have contributed to recall bias, resulting in a floor effect in the measurement of decision fatigue across time.</s><s>In the present study, there was a relatively low intensity of decision fatigue at baseline and eight weeks in this cohort of surrogate decision makers, as evidenced by the mean total DFS scores and the range of the scores.</s><s>Despite the relatively low intensity of decision fatigue, there was a modest increase in decision fatigue among surrogate decision makers across the eight-week period.</s><s>This trend in the intensity of decision fatigue is consistent with the theory underpinnings of the construct and a body of empirical evidence that adds credence to our suspicion that individuals exposed to psychologically and cognitively taxing conditions for prolonged periods of time can experience self-regulatory failure, cognitive burden, and chronic states of negative affect (e.g., depression, anxiety), which has been posited to precipitate symptoms of decision fatigue.</s><s>As suspected, the intensity of decision fatigue varied across time, which likely a response to the magnitude of noxious stimuli (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression, grief, sleep deprivation) that enhance an individual's state of cognitive and psychological burden.</s></p><p><s>The construction of the DFS aimed to account for the daily variation in decision fatigue and may have contributed to the low intensity of decision fatigue reported in this cohort of surrogate decision makers.</s><s>Recall bias may account for the low self-report ratings of decision fatigue demonstrated in this sample.</s><s>It is our supposition that asking the respondent to reflect on their level of decision fatigue across a week attenuated the daily variations in the rating of decision fatigue and produced recall bias.</s><s>To address recall bias, previous studies have recommended shortening the interval of recollection to enhance validity and accuracy of the desired data <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kjellsson, Clarke, &amp; Gerdtham, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Another plausible contributor to the floor effect is that two-thirds of this sample of surrogate decision makers reported prior decision making experience on the behalf of another individual.</s><s>It is plausible that prior performance in the surrogate decision maker role resulted in cognitive and psychological priming that may have contributed to the lower than anticipated scores on the DFS.</s><s>Nonetheless, we recommend that instructions to the respondents be augmented to address recall bias and instructions that prompt the respondents to reflect on how they felt across the last 24 hours be used in future studies which use this scale to capture decision fatigue.</s></p><p><s>This psychometric evaluation of the DFS has several limitations.</s><s>The first limitation is relatively small sample size (N = 101).</s><s>Although the sample size provided the minimum number needed to conduct an EFA, a larger sample size would provide more than sufficient statistical power for the assessments of construct validity and reliability.</s><s>The second limitation is the lack of diversity of the sample, which affects the external generalizability of the findings.</s><s>Despite this lack of diversity, the sample does adequately represent the characteristics of surrogate decision makers of the critically ill.</s><s>Lastly, the likelihood of recall bias due to the original scale's instructions prompted participants to reflect on their intensity of decision fatigue across a week.</s><s>The rationale for the instructions to recall symptoms of decision fatigue was to mitigate the effects of time on a participant's report of decision fatigue.</s><s>However, based on the floor effect demonstrated, the authors recommend a shorter recall period or simply asking the participant how they feel at the moment in an effort to reduce recall bias and the likelihood of measurement error.</s><s>Despite these limitations, this report provides preliminary evidence that the modified version of the DFS is a reliable and valid self-report measure which captures the intensity of decision fatigue in a cohort of surrogate decision makers.</s></p><p><s>Given the promise of this new measure of decision fatigue to the advancement of nursing and behavioral science, the authors recommend that the modified version of the DFS be used as a tailoring variable in future interventional research or to describe the effectiveness of decision support interventions.</s><s>Although this preliminary investigation provides evidence to support its use in a clinical population of surrogate decision makers who have contemplated a healthcare decision for a critically ill patient, the DFS has been constructed for use for any individual faced with selecting a course of action under conditions of uncertainty, broadening its applicability beyond the context of health and healthcare decisions.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 Sample Characteristics (N = 101)</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table><row><cell>Variables</cell><cell>n (%)</cell></row><row><cell>Gender</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Female</cell><cell>63 (62.4)</cell></row><row><cell>Male</cell><cell>38 (37.6)</cell></row><row><cell>Race/Ethnicity</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>White</cell><cell>71 (70.3)</cell></row><row><cell>Non-White</cell><cell>30 (29.7)</cell></row><row><cell>Relationship to Patient</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Spouse</cell><cell>42 (42)</cell></row><row><cell>Child</cell><cell>34 (34)</cell></row><row><cell>Guardian/Durable Power of Attorney</cell><cell>11 (11)</cell></row><row><cell>Other Relative</cell><cell>13 (13)</cell></row><row><cell>Education</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>High school or less</cell><cell>26 (26)</cell></row><row><cell>1-4 Years of College</cell><cell>63 (63)</cell></row><row><cell>Graduate studies</cell><cell>10 (10)</cell></row><row><cell>Employment Status</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Employed</cell><cell>58 (58)</cell></row><row><cell>Retired/Disabled</cell><cell>28 (28)</cell></row><row><cell>Unemployed</cell><cell>10 (10)</cell></row><row><cell>Annual Household Income</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>$20,000 and less</cell><cell>12 (12)</cell></row><row><cell>$21,000 to $49,999</cell><cell>28 (28)</cell></row><row><cell>$50,000 and greater</cell><cell>58 (58)</cell></row><row><cell>Marital Status: Yes</cell><cell>66 (65)</cell></row><row><cell>Prior Decision Making Experience: Yes</cell><cell>56 (55)</cell></row></table></figure>
