<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Traditionally, emotion regulation has been studied apart from self-control.</s><s>Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that both types of control have similarities, as both involve the overriding of automatic responses in favor of controlled ones.</s><s>Furthermore, in everyday life they are often interconnected: Imagine your overall long-term goal to lose weight is challenged by a disgusting meal replacement shake.</s><s>In situations like this, regulating your emotions, for instance by reappraising the shake as primarily healthy and not disgusting, sub-serves successful self-control.</s><s>In the past, both types of control have been studied extensively on their own, but not in conjunction.</s><s>Here we set out to study their relation in a within-subject design.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-control</head><p><s>Self-control can be described as the ability to pursue overarching goals despite short-term temptations, distractions or aversive states <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Tangney et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baumeister et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>This encompasses the capacity to intentionally alter one's thoughts and behavioral response tendencies, thus overriding impulsive behavior in different domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Tangney et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The concepts of self-controlled and impulsive behavior oppose each other but both contribute whenever we make a decision (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bechara, 2005</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Ludwig et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Individuals with high self-reported self-control achieve higher grades, are more successful in controlling their eating behavior and show generally stronger health-promoting behavior and well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Tangney et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kreutz et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hofer et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, higher impulsivity is associated with alcohol consumption and aggression <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dahlen et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Hair and Hampson, 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The neural correlates of self-control have been studied mainly in the field of decision-making.</s><s>Overall, these studies support the assumption that self-control is related to effortful top-down modulation by higher-order PFC regions over lowerorder PFC regions or sub-cortical areas, and that this modulation is indicated by changes in activity and functional connectivity.</s><s>For example, individuals who exerted self-control to favor healthy over unhealthy food, showed increased DLPFC activation and reduced value signals for unhealthy food supposedly encoded in the vmPFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hare et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, these value-related signals were modulated by changes in functional connectivity between both regions, indicating that specifically the functional coupling between brain areas plays a crucial role in self-controlled behavior.</s><s>In line with this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Peters and Bu ¨chel (2010)</ref> showed that reducing individuals' impulsivity experimentally in a temporal discounting paradigm was associated with modulation in functional PFC connectivity.</s><s>In this study, future thoughts about intentions regarding the offered amount of money were induced.</s><s>This manipulation did not only reduce the discounting of delayed rewards but was also associated with differences in the activity and functional connectivity between PFC and sub-cortical regions.</s><s>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kober et al. (2010)</ref> showed that thinking about long-term consequences of smoking successfully reduced craving.</s><s>Also here, resisting a temptation was associated with higher activation of control-related PFC areas and mediated by reduced activity in sub-cortical areas like the striatum.</s></p><p><s>There is some evidence that the connectivity between frontal and sub-cortical networks might not only be associated with these state-related changes of self-control or impulsivity, but also with trait-related individual differences.</s><s>For example, functional connectivity strength between PFC and midbrain regions not only predicts behavioral success of long-term goal pursuit but also correlates with self-reported individual impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Diekhof and Gruber, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Diekhof et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, based on previous findings there is much evidence suggesting a close overlap between self-control and emotion regulation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-control involved in emotion regulation</head><p><s>This assumption is supported by several observations.</s><s>First, self-control and emotion regulation share a high degree of conceptual overlap.</s><s>Emotion regulation is even assumed to be one form of self-control (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Gross, 1998b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Muraven et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Gross, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Second, a relation between both types of control is also indicated by their correlation with similar outcome variables such as academic success <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Tangney et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Graziano and Reavis 2007)</ref>, greater health <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Salovey et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Kreutz et al., 2008) and</ref><ref type="bibr">well-being (Co ˆte ´et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hofer et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>More direct examinations have shown that children and adults with higher self-control cope more easily with emotional distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gramzow et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gailliot et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly high self-control has been associated with greater emotional stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Tangney et al., 2004)</ref> and the strength of self-control in children even predicts their emotional coping ability several years later <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Shoda et al., 1990)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Behaviorally, it has often been observed that when a selfcontrol task is executed after an emotion regulation task, performance is usually worse compared with when it is executed first (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Muraven et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hagger et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Even though it is highly debated whether this depletion effect shows up in a statistically robust manner (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carter and McCullough, 2014</ref> for criticism; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hagger and Chatzisarantis, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Inzlicht et al., 2015</ref> for reply to this criticism), proponents of its presence argue that it demonstrates shared resources by different task categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Muraven et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>The fact that tasks involving forms of emotion regulation (e.g.</s><s>expressive suppression) are commonly used to induce this depletion effect (which again is attributed to be a self-control-related effect) demonstrates the so far overall assumption that emotion regulation and self-control conceptually highly overlap.</s></p><p><s>On the brain level, areas of the fronto-parietal network involved in emotion regulation are consistently recruited in tasks requiring self-control, as outlined above <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Peters and Bu ¨chel, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>From a simple dual-processing view, both emotion regulation and self-control are assumed to involve reflective processing presumably exerted by the PFC and intuitive evaluation by more basal brain regions.</s><s>Thereby the vmPFC particularly attracts the attention, as this region is assumed to provide a link between PFC regions and the amygdala during emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Urry et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Etkin et al., 2011)</ref> and also takes part in valuation processes that are relevant for self-controlled behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hare et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Whether individual differences in self-control are associated with the ability to regulate one's emotions and whether this is associated with individual differences in brain activity and/or PFC-sub-cortical functional connectivity is still an open question.</s><s>Investigating spontaneous emotion regulation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Drabant et al.

(2013)</ref>, we did not find trait control related differences in the 'activation' of the regulation-related network or the 'down-regulation' of the amygdala.</s><s>Instead, we observed that dependent on trait self-control, the amygdala showed stronger functional 'connectivity' to cognitive-controlrelated PFC and parietal regions.</s><s>Parts of these regions overlapped with the regulation-related network, like the MFG, IFG, mPFC and IPL, as observed in previous functional connectivity studies of distancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Erk et al., 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schardt et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>On the one hand, this lack of a significant relation of self-control and PFC activity might be based on the fact that our participants were all relatively high in trait self-control.</s><s>This restricted variance of the self-control score might have reduced the power of the correlations.</s><s>On the other hand, this observation is in so far interesting, as it contradicts the assumption of a simple dual process account.</s><s>Finding that not the activity in one specific PFC region, but the amygdala-PFC connectivity is related to the strength of self-control might be indicative for a more complex account.</s><s>Considering studies about cognitive control, the PFC regions observed in this study may be involved in the reappraisal of emotions by an interplay of specific functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Ochsner and Gross, 2005)</ref>: Lateral parts like the MFG and IFG might keep a representation of the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(D'Esposito et al., 1999)</ref> and be responsible for the actual task implementation by inhibiting prepotent appraisals <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chikazoe, 2010)</ref>, respectively.</s><s>The mPFC might play a role in comparing changing of the inner emotional state, while the IPL, which has been shown to be exclusively activated in distancing compared with other strategies of emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Do ¨rfel et al., 2014)</ref>, might be crucial for multisensory integration of self-other-related information <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Silani et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thus, stronger functional connectivity between these regions and the amygdala in HSCs might indicate that these individuals are more effective in recruiting/exerting cognitive control to down-regulate their emotions by distancing.</s><s>This would explain why they experienced reduced negative feelings compared with LSCs.</s><s>Further studies are required here to investigate the specificity of changes in amygdala connectivity and the modulation of negative feeling.</s></p><p><s>Alternatively, based on previous studies one might have expected that the vmPFC plays a special role when investigating successful emotion regulation dependent on self-control.</s><s>On the one hand, the vmPFC is assumed to be involved in self-control-related valuation processes (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Hare et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand the vmPFC has also been observed to show stronger connectivity with the amygdala during emotion regulation (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Banks et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Johnstone et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Delgado et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Based on sparse anatomical connections between the lateral PFC and the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ghashghaei et al., 2007)</ref>, it has been suggested that the vmPFC might act as an interstation between cognitive control regions and amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Urry et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Etkin et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Following this, in our study the vmPFC might have been expected to serve as an interface between the appraisals of emotional events by modulating the amygdala and the strength of applied self-control by valuating individual goals.</s><s>In contrast to other studies which found amygdala-vmPFC connectivity to be related to individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Urry et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Johnstone et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Schardt et al., 2010)</ref>, we did not observe a relation between the strength of self-control and vmPFC activity or amygdala-vmPFC connectivity during emotion regulation.</s></p><p><s>Generally, the literature is divided when it comes to vmPFC involvement in reappraisal.</s><s>In contrast to a meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Diekhof et al. (2011)</ref> a more recent one by <ref type="bibr">Buhle et al. (2013)</ref> did not observe the vmPFC to be consistently activated during cognitive reappraisal.</s><s>Also in this study, we did not observe the vmPFC to be involved in emotion regulation per se.</s><s>This might be related to the specific regulation strategy.</s><s>Directly comparing four different emotion regulation strategies indicated that dorsomedial but not ventromedial areas of the PFC are involved in distancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Do ¨rfel et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, there are also studies which found the vmPFC to be activated during distancing <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Ochsner et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>From our results we can only speculate that even if valuation processes in the vmPFC are involved in distancing, the strength of self-control does not affect them.</s><s>Rather our data suggest that stronger self-control is related to greater engagement of cognitive resources in terms of stronger connectivity of the amygdala with other medial and lateral PFC regions.</s><s>This would also be in line with the theory proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">McClure et al. (2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">McClure et al. ( , 2007))</ref>, stating that the vmPFC is part of a valuation network which is activated when immediate rewards are involved, while the lateral PFC is involved in the exertion of control in favor of long-term goals.</s><s>Equivalent to the self-control-related modulatory relationship between the DLPFC and vmPFC in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Hare et al., 2009)</ref>, in emotion regulation PFC regions might have modulatory effects on the amygdala according to the current individual long-term goal.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Amygdala down-regulation over time</head><p><s>In our study, high and low self-controllers differed in terms of amygdala down-regulation over time.</s><s>Although HSCs showed similar amygdala down-regulation throughout the experiment, LSCs failed in down-regulation towards the end.</s><s>This might be due to the fact that exerting self-control is an exhausting process and might lead to a gradual decline in self-control performance (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Baumeister, 1998)</ref>.</s><s>These effects might occur only in LSCs because self-control might be a limited resource <ref type="bibr">(Baumeister, 1998</ref>; but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Carter and McCullough, 2014)</ref> and HSCs might have access to greater resources.</s><s>However, as these depletion effects can be diminished, for instance by paying performance-dependent sufficient incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Muraven and Slessareva, 2003)</ref> or personal engagement in the task <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Hockey and Earle, 2006)</ref>, motivation might be an additional crucial factor that mediates these effects.</s><s>For instance, opportunity-cost models assume that a cost-benefit analysis between the mental effort and the current task goal is computed and competes with costs and values of alternative actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hockey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Kurzban et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The process-model account by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Inzlicht et al. (2014)</ref> further suggests that this priority-selection depends on how much self-control has recently been executed and also allows for adjustments according to other factors like performance feedback.</s><s>Although in our study initially all participants might have been motivated to engage cognitive effort in favor of avoiding the experience of negative emotions (e.g. to increase well-being, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arthaud-day et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> or to reduce stress, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Feldman et al., 1999)</ref> or another task-related overarching goal (e.g.</s><s>pleasing the experimenter; demonstrating competence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Ryan and Deci, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">gratifying curiosity, Kashdan et al., 2004)</ref>, HSCs might have remained longer in a motivated state that supports pursuing these goals.</s><s>Conversely, LSCs might have switched earlier to a motivational state that favored other personal goals over task-related goals.</s><s>The observed greater functional connectivity in HSCs may reflect this difference in task engagement and reflect a more effective and enduring application of cognitive control.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Importantly, we point out that the association between selfcontrol and emotion regulation is of correlational nature and does not provide information about whether it is a direct or indirect relation.</s><s>Analyzing several variables, which are generally related to controlled behavior indicated that IQ, self-efficacy beliefs or effort did not mediate the observed relation between self-control and emotion regulation (Supplementary Materials).</s><s>However, of course there might be many other factors which influence controlled behavior but we did not asses in our study (e.g.</s><s>childhood SES in self-control: <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Moffitt et al. (2011)</ref>; and emotion regulation: <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Eisenberg et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, our results provide a proper basis for further investigations, investigating the exact relation between self-control and emotion regulation.</s></p><p><s>Further, our approach to define the amygdala as a seed region for the PPI analysis restricts our findings to networks or mechanism which assume that the down-regulation of the amygdala is necessarily involved when down-regulating negative emotions.</s><s>As set up in the introduction, we defined this criterion based on evidences from previous studies.</s><s>However, for instance very low self-controlled individuals might involve other networks in emotion regulation compared with relatively high self-controlled individuals.</s><s>Using multidimensional connectivity procedures in future studies might allow for investigating alternative networks, which are not directly or not only related to amygdala down-regulation.</s></p></div>
