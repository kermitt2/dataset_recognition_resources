<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p><s>This study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee at Yale School of Medicine.</s><s>Written informed consent for the study was obtained from all patients.</s></p><p><s>Subjects.</s><s>Subjects were 18 consecutive adult patients undergoing icEEG monitoring in the Yale Comprehensive Epilepsy Center/Yale New Haven Hospital for surgery for medically intractable localization-related epilepsy, in whom the intracranial monitoring was free of complications and the seizure onset area (SOA) could be identified and was unilateral.</s><s>The average age of the subjects was 32.39 yr, and 8 of 18 subjects were women (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Six of the subjects had medial temporal onset of seizures, and 12 had neocortical seizure onset.</s></p><p><s>Intracranial electrode placement and localization.</s><s>Three types of icEEG electrodes were used for intracranial monitoring, subdural strip and grid electrodes and depth electrodes (AdTech Medical Instrument, Racine, WI).</s><s>Depth electrodes were stereotactically implanted with MRI guidance and a computerized planning system that allows interactive previewing of electrode trajectories.</s><s>Subdural strip and grid electrodes were implanted under visual guidance.</s><s>Between 100 and 332 electrode contacts were placed in the 18 subjects.</s><s>Most of the electrode contacts were subdural strip or grid electrode contacts, and a few were depth electrode contacts.</s><s>To determine the location of electrode contacts, individual contacts were marked on a postoperative CT image.</s><s>The CT image was then coregistered to a postoperative MR image with a six-parameter rigid transformation, and the postoperative MR image was coregistered with a preoperative MR image using a nonlinear grid-based transformation to account for the distortion of the brain that occurs as a result of craniotomy <ref type="bibr">(Srikinjar et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The SOA was identified by a standing multidisciplinary team in the Yale University Comprehensive Epilepsy Center using standard clinical criteria.</s><s>The number of seizure onset contacts ranged from 1 to 12 in the 18 subjects.</s></p><p><s>Intracranial EEG acquisition.</s><s>Subjects were monitored continuously (for 5-8 days) with a clinical EEG acquisition and storage system (Natus Medical/Bio-logic Systems, San Carlos, CA).</s><s>icEEGs were recorded with respect to a peg electrode placed within the skull at a distance from the icEEG electrodes.</s><s>A contact on an inverted strip electrode placed in subgaleal space was used as the ground electrode.</s><s>Up to 128 channels of icEEG, EEG, EMG, and EOG were recorded at a time and stored along with a time-synchronized video signal of the patient.</s><s>The icEEGs were sampled at 256 Hz.</s><s>The entire icEEG monitoring period was recorded for the 18 subjects.</s><s>Subsequently we identified a 1-h epoch from day 2 or 3 of the monitoring, at least 6 h from a seizure, when the patient was awake and resting quietly, i.e., not talking or eating.</s><s>The time period was identified after an examination of medication records, seizure times, the video, and icEEG.</s><s>Day 2 or 3 was selected because it was considered to be sufficiently removed from the surgery and it was before the time that the subjects experienced seizures.</s><s>Subsequently, a second epoch was similarly identified for each patient after the patient's AEDs had been tapered or stopped.</s></p><p><s>Analysis and power spectral density.</s><s>EEG epochs were segmented (segment length 1 s), the mean of each signal segment was subtracted, and the segments were weighted with a Hann window and zeropadded to 512 samples before calculation of the fast Fourier transform.</s><s>The total power and power for the delta (0 -4 Hz), theta (4 -8 Hz), alpha (8 -13 Hz), beta (13-25 Hz), gamma (25-55 Hz), and high (65-128 Hz) frequency bands were obtained for each 1-s icEEG segment by use of the fast Fourier transform.</s><s>Unfiltered and filtered icEEGs were examined and marked for artifacts at a 1-s time resolution, and 1-s segments with artifacts were removed from the analysis.</s><s>Power and band power estimates of artifact-free segments were obtained for each electrode contact studied and averaged over the 1-h epoch to obtain average measures for each contact.</s><s>The electrode contacts were then sorted by the amount of delta power measured.</s><s>The contacts with values below the median value were considered to be low values.</s><s>We subsequently traversed the sorted value list, starting at the median value, and considered each next greater sorted value.</s><s>If the next greater sorted value exceeded the mean Ï© 3 SD of the current pool of values, that value was considered to be a threshold value for the detection of high delta electrode contacts.</s><s>Values equal to and greater than the threshold value were considered to be the high delta values.</s><s>For each patient and epoch, lower thresholds of 2 or 2.5 SDs were also examined (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Delta power at each site was ranked and plotted from low to high delta power.</s><s>Sites showing higher delta power (Ï¾3 SDs) than the mean delta power were considered to be sites with high delta power.</s><s>Visual examination of these recording sites confirmed the occurrence of rhythmic delta at each site.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>We recorded icEEG from Ï³116 electrode contacts in 18 patients (range 101-118 electrode contacts in the 18 patients) placed over widespread neocortical sites, including prefrontal, frontal-parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>These recordings were obtained when patients were awake as scored by examination of the video and icEEG.</s><s>Four criteria were used for selecting a 1-h epoch for analysis from each patient: the patient was not interacting with anyone else; the patient was not eating; the patient was not asleep as measured by the EEG and as scored in the video; and the patient had not been asleep (the hour) just before the recording began and did not fall asleep (the hour) immediately after this epoch ended.</s></p><p><s>Our recordings reveal that the icEEG in the awake human neocortex is not uniform.</s><s>Individual recording sites in occipital and temporal lobe can show high levels of delta rhythm-at sites distant from the SOA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>)-while other recording sites show no evidence of high delta, i.e., the raw icEEG traces at Ï³90% of the recording sites show what appears to be an activated cortex, i.e., little evidence of runs of rhythmic lowfrequency, 1-4 Hz, delta rhythm.</s><s>Contacts with high delta could be isolated in a single cortical lobe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) or could be scattered over the cortical mantle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) or clustered together on multiple contacts in a single lobe (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although most raw records show little evidence of lowfrequency fluctuations, the distribution of delta power was skewed, with some recording sites containing high amounts of delta power (Ï¾3 SDs more than other contacts over the hour-long recording; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>This distribution of delta power-shown here for three patients-was typical.</s><s>The histogram of delta power reveals that some recording sites have more delta power than others (sites on the right-hand side of the distribution, shown in black, display 3 SDs or more delta power than the mean delta power).</s><s>As expected, lowering the threshold to 2.5 or 2 SDs included more recording sites that had a sample with high delta power.</s></p><p><s>An examination of the unprocessed EEG at these recordings sites reveals large-amplitude, rhythmic delta (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>While these Ï³10% of recording sites (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) show clear evidence of large-amplitude, rhythmic delta, the rest of the recording sites show what appears to be an activated state, in which the EEG has no large-amplitude, low-frequency fluctuations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>; median and low delta power in 3 patients).</s><s>At these other recording sites, that is, at the majority of the recording sites, the cortex can be said to be in an activated state.</s></p><p><s>The average power spectral density function of delta power in all patients reveals that some sites do indeed contain significantly more delta power than others (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) both while AEDs were being tapered off and after the drugs had been stopped (P Ï½ 0.01, paired t-test, comparing 12 recording sites in 18 patients with high delta to 12 recording sites with low delta power).</s><s>Correcting for differences in average power at these recording sites does not affect the results: some cortical areas have significantly (P Ï½ 0.01, paired t-test) more delta power than others.</s></p><p><s>The possible implication of the presence of the delta rhythm even in 10% of the recording sites in awake people is that a portion of the brain is in a slow-wave sleep-like operational regime while the rest of the cortex is in an activated state.</s><s>Is this portion of cortex permanently in high delta?</s><s>To examine the persistence of delta, we looked at whether high delta persisted over days and whether high delta power was uniform during these hour-long epochs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>We examined two separate hour-long recording sessions-the first when patients were still ostensibly on AEDs Ï³2 days after surgery for Sites of seizures are marked with yellow dots; sites with high delta in excess of 3 SDs from the mean are marked with blue dots.</s><s>Note that contacts with high delta can be clustered together (B) or separated into multiple cortical sites (A and C), even bilaterally.</s><s>Furthermore, the sites with high delta can overlap the seizure onset area, but this is atypical.</s><s>Finally, sites with high delta can show high delta power over 2 recording sessions separated by 3-4 days (before and after AEDs had been tapered off), though this is not necessarily the rule.</s></p><p><s>implantation of intracranial electrodes and the second Ï³5 days after surgery, when AEDs had been tapered or withdrawn.</s><s>Our analysis of recording sites that have a highest amounts of delta in the 18 patients revealed that 69 of the 116 (Ï³60%) recording sites with high delta show persistently high delta rhythm, over both days (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for examples).</s><s>These data indicate that some cortical sites (60%) were in an operating regime dominated by low-frequency rhythms over days of monitoring.</s></p><p><s>Next we examined whether delta power fluctuated during the hour-long recordings.</s><s>We measured delta power over 1-s-long epochs and looked at whether delta power fluctuated or was persistently elevated for minutes on end.</s><s>Our estimate (deviation around mean delta power) revealed that at 34.4% (40 of 116 sites with high delta power) of the recording sites delta rhythm was not constant;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Our results provide support for both the accepted idea that in the awake human being delta rhythm is not commonplace and the idea that there are indeed local cortical regions where slow waves and rhythmic delta can dominate.</s><s>Our work suggests that these regions vary from patient to patient and are not necessarily associated with the clinically and surgically determined locus of seizures, although, by their very nature, intracranial recordings in human beings are only performed in cases where pathology is suspected and surgery is indicated.</s><s>Nevertheless, our results suggest that just as in rodents, during conscious states, in the absence of seizures, irrespective of whether the person is on AEDs or not, rhythmic delta occurs in nonepileptic portions of the human cerebral cortex.</s></p><p><s>These results in concert with observations of delta rhythm in awake rodents and nonhuman primates suggest that rhythmic delta in the awake human being could sometimes be a manifestation of a normal operating regime of neocortical circuits.</s><s>The exact level, frequency, and depth of delta power in the LFP, EEG, multiunit activity, and intracellular membrane potential vary <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Haider et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hromadka et al. 2013</ref> The number of electrode contacts within the seizure onset area (1st column) and with high delta (2nd column) and the overlap between the two (3rd column) for the 18 patients studied are listed.</s><s>The number of simultaneously recorded sites is shown in the last column.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Petersen et al. 2003</ref>; although note that in cats wakefulness is not associated with delta power in the membrane potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Steriade et al. 2001)</ref>].</s><s>The low-frequency fluctuation of quiet wakefulness evident in the LFP, EEG, and membrane potential is abolished by movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bennett et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Crochet et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Petersen et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Polack et al. 2013)</ref> , or by activity in motor cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Zagha et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Although most of the recent work showing surprising amounts of delta in awake animals is in rodents, rhythmic delta has also been reported in awake nonhuman primates, where membrane potential, multiunit activity, and LFP fluctuate at low frequencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lakatos et al. 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lakatos et al. , 2008;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tan et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>A: distribution of delta power.</s><s>For each patient, and each recording site, the delta power over 1 h of recording was estimated.</s><s>The delta power at each site was ranked and plotted from lowest to highest value.</s><s>Sites showing higher delta power (Ï¾3 SDs) than the mean delta power are highlighted in black, with Ï¾2.5 SDs in gray and Ï¾2 SDs in brown.</s><s>Some recording sites have excessively high delta power (black bins).</s><s>B: EEG traces.</s><s>Representative EEG traces with high (black) and median and low (gray) delta power from 3 patients are shown here.</s><s>Sites with high delta power show EEG with rhythmic delta.</s><s>Drugs were still being tapered in patients 1 and 2 but had been completely withdrawn in patient 3.
