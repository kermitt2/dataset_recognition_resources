<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>We have sequenced the genomes of 110 small cell lung cancers (SCLC), one of the deadliest human cancers.</s><s>In nearly all the tumours analysed we found bi-allelic inactivation of TP53 and RB1, sometimes by complex genomic rearrangements.</s><s>Two tumours with wild-type RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 (encoded by the CCND1 gene), revealing an alternative mechanism of Rb1 deregulation.</s><s>Thus, loss of the tumour suppressors TP53 and RB1 is obligatory in SCLC.</s><s>We discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 that create an oncogenic version of this gene, TP73Dex2/3.</s><s>In rare cases, SCLC tumours exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for individual patients.</s><s>Finally, we observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family genes in 25% of human SCLC.</s><s>Accordingly, activation of Notch signalling in a pre-clinical SCLC mouse model strikingly reduced the number of tumours and extended the survival of the mutant mice.</s><s>Furthermore, neuroendocrine gene expression was abrogated by Notch activity in SCLC cells.</s><s>This first comprehensive study of somatic genome alterations in SCLC uncovers several key biological processes and identifies candidate therapeutic targets in this highly lethal form of cancer.</s></p><p><s>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancers, arises in heavy smokers, and the tumour cells express neuroendocrine markers.</s><s>Although chemotherapy is initially effective in the treatment of SCLC, recurrence arises rapidly in the vast majority of cases, usually killing the patient within only a few months <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</s><s>SCLC is rarely treated by surgery and few specimens are available for genomic characterization.</s><s>Previous studies applying mostly exome sequencing in a limited number of tumour specimens have revealed only a few recurrently mutated genes 2,3 .</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that complex genomic rearrangements, which are undetectable by exome sequencing, might further contribute to the pathogenesis of SCLC and thus performed whole-genome sequencing of 110 human SCLC specimens (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1-4</ref>).</s><s>One of the hallmarks of SCLC is the high frequency of mutations in TP53 and RB1 (refs 2-7).</s><s>As mice lacking Trp53 and Rb1 in the lung develop SCLC <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">9</ref> , we also sequenced 8 of these murine SCLC tumours in order to identify mutations that may promote SCLC development following loss of Trp53 and Rb1 and that may overlap with such accessory genes in human SCLC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">10</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples and clinical data</head><p><s>We collected 152 fresh-frozen clinical tumour specimens obtained from patients diagnosed with stage I-IV SCLC under institutional review board approval (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>The tumour samples were enriched for earlier stages and consisted of primary lung (n 5 148) and metastatic tumours (n 5 4) obtained by surgical resection (n 5 132), biopsy (n 5 4), pleural effusion (n 5 1) or through autopsy (n 5 15).</s><s>We performed whole-genome sequencing on 110 of these tumours and their matched normal DNA.</s><s>A total of 42 cases were excluded from the analysis because of insufficient quality or amount of DNA.</s><s>Most of these 110 tumours were treatment-naive, with only five cases obtained at the time of relapse.</s><s>We analysed transcriptome sequencing data in 71 of the 110 specimens that had undergone genome sequencing and in 10 additional specimens.</s><s>Finally, 103 of the 110 genome-sequenced specimens and 39 additional specimens were analysed by Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Eight tumour samples from preclinical SCLC mouse models were analysed by whole-exome sequencing (n 5 6) or whole-genome sequencing (n 5 2) (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recurrent somatic alterations in SCLC</head><p><s>SCLC genomes exhibited extremely high mutation rates 2,3 of 8.62 nonsynonomous mutations per million base pairs (Mb).</s><s>C:G.A:T transversions were found in 28% of all mutations on average, a pattern indicative of heavy smoking (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">2  and 3</ref>).</s><s>The smoking history or clinical stage of the tumours did not correlate with the type and number of mutations (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The median tumour content was 84% (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, murine SCLC tumours showed a low number of somatic alterations (on average 28.5 protein-altering mutations per sample on average) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">10</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In order to assess the amount of genetic heterogeneity of SCLC, we developed a subclonality score, which can be interpreted as the probability that an arbitrary point mutation in a randomly selected cancer cell is subclonal throughout the entire tumour (Methods).</s><s>A reliable reconstruction of the subclonal architecture was possible in 55 of the cases (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>A comparison to lung adenocarcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">11</ref> indicated a threefold lower subclonal diversity in SCLC (P 5 0.00023, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), pointing to pronounced differences in the evolution of SCLC and lung adenocarcinoma <ref type="bibr"

mutation.</s><s>To this end, we first estimated the tumour purity, absolute copy numbers, and subclonal copy number changes using our previously described method 2 and computed for each mutation the expected allelic fraction under clonality assumption.</s><s>The quotient between the observed allelic fraction of a mutation with its corresponding expected allelic fraction then yields the

subclonal populations; Q i is the CCF of each population (thus, Q 0 &lt; 1), and m i is the number of mutations assigned to cluster i.</s><s>This subclonality score can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected mutation present in a single cancer cell is subclonal throughout the entire tumour.</s></p><p><s>As a low sequencing depth limits the robust identification of subclonal populations, we computed the genome-wide average contribution of a single mutated read to the CCF.</s><s>For a given tumour purity p, average ploidy p, and mean coverage c, this measure is given by: Average increase of CCF per read~2 (1{p)zpp pc</s></p><p><s>The smaller the average increase of CCF per read, the more accurately the subclonality score can be determined since more subclonal mutations can be called from the sequencing data.</s><s>In this study, the most limiting factor for assessing the subclonal diversity is the relatively low sequencing depth (353 on average).</s><s>We therefore used this measure to select the samples that are suitable for a reliable calculation of the subclonality score.</s><s>To this end, we systematically scanned from the
