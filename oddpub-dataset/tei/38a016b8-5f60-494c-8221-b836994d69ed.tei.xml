<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The neocortex is a highly organized laminar structure.</s><s>Neurons within each layer adopt specific identities and form appropriate local and long-distance connections.</s><s>The proper formation of these synaptic connections is instrumental for cognitive and motor abilities, and defects in these developmental processes have been associated to ASD6.</s><s>The different subtypes of cerebral cortical projection neurons (CPNs), distinguished by their molecular, physiological and connectional properties, have characteristic layer distribution.</s><s>Neuronal positioning and acquisition of laminar and projectional identity are concomitantly controlled by cell type-specific and layer-specific transcriptional programs7.</s><s>Sequence and copy number variations in the genes encoding key transcription factors modulating neuron positioning and identity, such as FEZF2 (also known as FEZL or ZFP312), SATB2, SOX5 and TBR1, have been found in patients with ASD or disabilities frequently associated with ASD, such as developmental and language delays or intellectual disability (ID)8-11.</s></p><p><s>Recent spatiotemporal analysis of the human brain transcriptome has positioned teashirt zinc finger homeobox family member 3 (TSHZ3; also known as ZNF537) as a hub gene in a module (M8) of co-expressed genes with the strongest levels of expression in early cortical development; "hub genes" being defined as having the highest degree of connectivity, suggesting functional importance, within the module12.</s><s>The module notably contains TBR1, FEZF2, FOXG1, SATB2 and EMX1, which have been functionally implicated in the development of CPNs13-21.</s><s>Linkage analysis implicated 19q12 in autism22,23 and a genome-wide association study24 mentioned TSHZ3 as a potential autism susceptibility gene among 860 candidate genes, but no follow-up study has been performed.</s><s>These data raise the core question of the role of TSHZ3 in cortical development and in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.</s><s>We previously provided evidence that Tshz3 is required for the proper differentiation and/or survival of a neuronal subpopulation in the developing mouse hindbrain involved in the control of breathing25.</s><s>As a consequence, Tshz3 lacZ/lacZ mice fail to breathe and die at birth.</s><s>Tshz3 is also expressed in the developing and adult mouse cortex26, where its function remains unknown.</s></p><p><s>Here, we identify the gene TSHZ3 as the minimal region of overlap of 19q12q13.11</s><s>heterozygous deletions found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.</s><s>By combining mouse genetics, RNA-seq analyses, electrophysiology and behavioral testing, we provide strong experimental evidence for a causal relationship between Tshz3 heterozygosity, functional defaults in cortical projection neurons and ASD.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TSHZ3 haploinsufficiency causes neurocognitive impairment</head><p><s>We identified seven new patients from six unrelated families with 19q12q13.11</s><s>deletions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>Patients 1, 2 and 5 have large overlapping deletions (2.4,</s><s>4.02 and 2.87 Mb, respectively), defining a minimal region of overlap of 0.83 Mb that encompasses a unique protein-coding gene, TSHZ3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Patients 3a, b, 6 and 7 have smaller deletions (1.0, 0.46 and 0.05 Mb, respectively), which also overlap only TSHZ3; the 50 kb microdeletion found in patient 7 deletes the second exon and part of the intron of TSHZ3.</s><s>Interestingly, TSHZ3 is also deleted in 7 previously reported cases with 19q12q13.1 deletions27-30, 3 of which do not delete the previously described minimal region of overlap on 19q13.11</s><s>(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>These 3 literature cases share characteristic clinical features with the 7 cases reported here, including developmental delay (in particular absence or delay of speech), ID, autistic features and renal tract abnormalities, but not microcephaly or ectodermal dysplasia that are unique features associated with the 19q13.11</s><s>microdeletion syndrome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Notably, among the 22 patients (7 patients in our cohort and 15 previously reported cases) with 19q12q13.11</s><s>deletions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>), those diagnosed with ASD (patients 2, 6 and 7 from present study; patient 6 from27 and 5 from28), atypical autism (patient 3a) or ASD-related deficits (1 and 5 from this study) have TSHZ3 deletion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the present study, we identified the TSHZ3 gene as the smallest region of overlap of 19q12q13.11</s><s>deletions in a new cohort of 7 patients and in 7 previously reported subjects27-30.</s><s>The characteristic clinical features encompass neurodevelopmental disorders, including autistic traits, speech disturbance and intellectual disability, as well as renal tract abnormalities.</s><s>Most deletions were de novo, supporting their association with the new syndrome described.</s><s>Reduced penetrance can explain the inheritance of the deletion from unaffected parents.</s><s>The autistic features presented by the patient who has the smallest (50 kb) deletion involving only the TSHZ3 gene lead to consider TSHZ3 as the gene of interest responsible for the neurocognitive phenotype of these patients.</s><s>Thus, our data validate the GWAS-identified TSHZ3 gene24 as an ASD risk gene.</s><s>A possible explanation for the scarcity of studies that have associated TSHZ3 with ASD could be that TSHZ3 is a dosagesensitive gene whose haploinsufficiency is linked to high developmental lethality.</s><s>In mice, Tshz3 heterozygosity is 50% lethal on CD1 background25 and 100% on C57BL/6J background39.</s><s>We thus speculate that TSHZ3 mutations define an ASD subtype characterized by the clinical association of autistic features with other syndromic features, especially genito-urinary tract defects.</s><s>Importantly, such an association should help identifying additional TSHZ3 patients.</s><s>The link between TSHZ3 deletion and this newly reported syndrome is strengthened by the studies in the mouse.</s><s>For instance, Tshz3/TSHZ3 is expressed at key stages of the developing metanephros51 and neocortex in mouse as in human, and Tshz3 mutation in the mouse recapitulates features of the human phenotype: hydroureter and ASD-relevant behavioral abnormalities.</s><s>Interestingly, mutations in several genes have been associated with complex phenotype including both ASD features and renal tract abnormalities52-55.</s></p><p><s>There is strong evidence for spatiotemporal convergence among groups of disease-related mutations, all known to lead to ASD, in midfetal L5/6 glutamatergic CPNs5.</s><s>Interestingly, our coexpression network analysis of the developing human neocortex using TSHZ3 as a seed identified 34 ASD candidate genes among the 49 genes with highest correlation to TSHZ3, including TBR1, FEZF2 and SOX5.</s><s>Moreover, 5 out of the 49 TSHZ3-connected genes in the human module are differentially expressed in Tshz3 lacZ/lacZ mice and have been associated to ASD: FEZF2, KLHL1, PRDM8, SLA and SLC44A5 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>These data provide support to the hub position of TSHZ3 in a cortical transcriptional regulatory network associated with ASD.</s></p><p><s>Our study in the mouse, by showing gene expression variation in the cerebral cortex, enrichment of ASD-related genes in orthologs of DEX genes, functional alteration in neural circuit formed by CPNs and behavioral abnormalities associated with Tshz3 deficiency, provide some clues on the link between TSHZ3 deletions and ASD.</s></p><p><s>During prenatal development, we found that Tshz3 function is dispensable for cortical layering but required for normal expression of marker genes of subplate and deep layer cortical neurons, with enrichment for GO terms related to neuron and axon development when considering DEX genes categorized as deep CPN markers.</s><s>In particular, the cortex of Tshz3 lacZ/lacZ mice showed increased expression of Fezf2 in L6.</s><s>Knowing that Fezf2 is normally down-regulated in L6 while being maintained at high level in L5 at the end of embryogenesis14,18, it can be suggested that high Fezf2 expression is aberrantly retained in L6 neurons in Tshz3 lacZ/lacZ mutant cortex, as reported previously in Sox5 -/-31,32 and Tbr1 -/-16 mice neocortex.</s><s>Tshz3 deletion also phenocopies the gene expression changes reported in Tbr1 mutant for Bhlhe22 (also known as Bhlhb5), Crym, Pcdh20, Ngfr and Tshz217, suggesting that Tshz3 may contribute to TBR1-dependent regulatory mechanism.</s><s>However, contrarily to what has been observed in Tbr116 and Sox531 mutants, we found that axon pathfinding is preserved in Tshz3 mutants at E18.5, suggesting that Tshz3 may rather participate in the postnatal functional maturation of circuits formed by CPNs.</s><s>This is consistent with the PANTHER analysis of DEX genes in these mutants showing enrichment for pathways related to neurotransmitter/neuropeptide receptor signaling.</s><s>Perinatally in the mouse, axons from layer 5 CPNs of all cortical areas project towards the spinal cord and, from P0 to P6, they form a similar set of collaterals56.</s><s>Then, between P6-P14, axon branches are selectively eliminated in an area-specific manner56.</s><s>While defects in either collateral formation, selective branch elimination and/or synapse refinement might occur in Tshz3 mutant, the early neonatal lethality of Tshz3 lacZ/lacZ makes it currently difficult to test this hypothesis.</s><s>In the subplate, a highly dynamic sector of the developing neocortex, we observed altered expression of Fezf2 and Ngfr, which are critical for corticofugal connectivity and for giving information to thalamocortical incoming connections, respectively14,15.</s><s>It is noteworthy that genes expressed in a subplate-specific manner during development show a statistically significant enrichment for association with ASD and schizophrenia37.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, Tshz3 +/lacZ mice, which closely model the condition of patients with heterozygous TSHZ3 deletion, also show altered gene expression in the embryonic and postnatal cortex, and their behavioral phenotype includes the two clinical traits characterizing ASD according to DSM-51: they display both poor sociability and poor interest in social novelty, not imputable to sensory deficits, and fulfill the restricted field of interest and repetitive behavior condition.</s><s>The altered gene expression in the post-natal cortex of Tshz3 +/lacZ mice suggests that post-natal defects in CPN development or function can contribute to the ASD-like phenotype linked to Tshz3 heterozygosity.</s><s>There is substantial evidence associating the corticostriatal circuitry with ASD40,57 and changes in corticostriatal function, although heterogeneous, have been evidenced in mouse ASD models, such as knock-outs for Shank358 or neuroligin-159 and in 16p11 +/-mice60.</s><s>Here we provide evidence for altered corticostriatal synaptic transmission (increased APdependent glutamate release) and plasticity (enhanced LTP) in Tshz3 +/lacZ mice, suggesting increased functional corticostriatal connectivity, consistent with functional imaging data from ASD patients57.</s><s>The results from our mouse model thus reinforce the gene/phenotype relationship between TSHZ3 haploinsufficiency and autistic features we evidenced in patients with TSHZ3 deletion.</s></p><p><s>This study, from human to rodent model, identifies TSHZ3/Tshz3 as a novel gene linked to ASD, essential for CPN development and function.</s><s>Its deletion affects the cortical expression of a number of genes related to ASD and induces ASD-relevant deficits, associated with functional changes at synapses formed by deep layer CPNs without obvious alterations in neuron viability, layering and pathfinding.</s><s>Our data point to TSHZ3 as a key member of a transcriptional regulatory network whose alteration at different nodes (such as TBR1, FEZF2, SATB2) can lead to a convergence of brain phenotypes centering on ASD, and to murine Tshz3 mutants as novel candidate animal models of ASD.</s></p></div>
