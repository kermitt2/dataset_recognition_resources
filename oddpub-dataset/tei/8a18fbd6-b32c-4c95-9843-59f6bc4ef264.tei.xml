<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The molecular trigger of CNS myelination is unknown.</s><s>By targeting Pten in cerebellar granule cells and activating the AKT1/mTOR pathway we increased the caliber of normally unmyelinated axons and the expression of numerous genes encoding regulatory proteins.</s><s>Surprisingly, this led to the expansion of genetically wildtype OPCs, oligodendrocyte differentiation, and the de novo myelination of parallel fibers.</s><s>Thus, a PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent neuronal program is sufficient to trigger all steps of myelination.</s></p><p><s>In the peripheral nervous system, the 'trigger' of myelination is axon size (&gt;1µm), a threshold mediated by Nrg1 type III on the axon surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Since Nrg1 is not required for CNS myelination <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , we asked whether axon size can be experimentally increased here by the absence of PTEN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , i.e. with PI (3,4,5)P3 stimulating the AKT1/mTOR pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>To specifically enlarge cerebellar granule cells (GC) and their naturally unmyelinated parallel fiber (Pf) axons, we generated Tg(m6)-Cre*Pten loxP/loxP mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>By reporter gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , recombination begins at P9 in predominantly postmitotic GC.</s><s>The cerebellum of Tg(m6)-Cre*Pten loxP/loxP mice (hereafter termed Pten cKO or 'mutants') revealed a loss of Pten mRNA (-63%; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) and protein (-80%; n=3 each genotype; p=0.0025, t=6.788, d.f.=4, two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) compared to Pten loxP/loxP mice (hereafter termed 'controls') at age 3.5 months.</s><s>Loss of PTEN resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of well-known downstream targets of the PI3K pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Mutant mice appeared healthy (Supplementary Video1), but cerebellar GC layer (GL)   and molecular layer (ML) progressively enlarged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Immunostaining of GABAA receptor 6 revealed a gradual size increase of GC somata (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Older mice developed ataxia and tremor (Supplementary Video2), possibly due to hamartomas at advanced age (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; Supplementary Information).</s></p><p><s>The diameter of Pf also increased over time, as quantified by electron microscopy (EM), reaching 0.61±0.009µm in mutants over 0.16±0.002</s><s>µm in controls at 1 year of age (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>,g; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, radial Pf growth in mutant brains was associated with significant myelination beginning at age P40 (2.30.6% myelinated Pf) and progressing over time (3 months: 9.51% myelinated Pf), up to 403% of Pf being myelinated at 1 year with an average g-ratio of 0.84.</s><s>Myelination was visualized by Gallyas silver impregnation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>), anti-CNP immunohistochemistry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>), including whole-mount immunolabelling combined with light sheet and 2-photon microscopy (Supplementary Video3), as well as EM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i-k</ref>).</s><s>We determined a 'size threshold' of approximately 0.25 µm for myelination at all ages tested (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1k,l</ref>).</s><s>Myelinated Pf segments were very rarely seen in controls.</s></p><p><s>De novo myelination included the formation of nodes and paranodes with septate -like junctions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1j</ref>) and the clustering of Caspr and NaV1.6 on axons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1m,n</ref>).</s><s>GC synaptic contacts to Purkinje cell dendrites were restricted to Pf 'nodal' regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1o</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The ML harbors normally very few oligodendrocytes and only scattered OPC s, as demonstrated in Plp1-DsRed*Ng2-EYFP double-transgenic mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>In Pten mutants at P45, mature oligodendrocytes were increased in the GL (+33%) and more prominent in the ML (+750%), yet unaltered in cerebellar white matter (WM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether OPCs proliferate in the ML or are recruited from the GL, we combined immunostaining with BrdU labeling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>After 20 days of daily BrdU injections (P25-45), OPC proliferation (BrdU+,Olig2+) was the same in GL or WM of mutants and controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>However, OPC proliferation in the mutant ML was 4.4fold increased.</s><s>Even at age 6-7 months, we found a 4.7-fold increase of BrdU+,Olig2+ cells.</s><s>This suggests that local proliferation is stimulated (directly or indirectly) by GC axon-derived signals, which must still be present at older ages.</s><s>At that time, oligodendrocyte lineage cells were 10-fold increased over controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>By following different BrdU protocols we identified a time window (P20-30) at which proliferation of OPCs was already increased, but the number of (CNP+) oligodendrocytes was not yet altered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,f</ref>).</s><s>This strongly suggests that OPC proliferation is not merely a homeostatic mechanism to replace differentiated OPCs, but is an early response to the neuronal trigger.</s><s>Accordingly, (BrdU+,Olig2+) OPCs were uniformly distributed in the ML and not preferentially detected in proximity to newly generated (MBP+) oligodendrocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>Double-labeling for BrdU and carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), a marker of mature oligodendrocytes, confirmed that newly generated OPCs had responded to elevated differentiation signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h</ref>).</s><s>At 7 months, the ML in Pten-mutant brains still contained 'maturating' oligodendrocytes, as revealed by in situ hybridization of Myrf mRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2i</ref>), an early marker almost undetectable in fully mature cells (B.</s><s>Emery, personal communication).</s><s>Taken together our data suggest that Pten-mutant GC and thus a PI (3,4,5)P3-dependent neuronal program is sufficient to drive oligodendrocyte lineage cells through all developmental stages.</s><s>However, we cannot formally exclude the theoretical possibility that normally myelinated axons recruit OPCs and induce myelination by completely different mechanisms.</s><s>Formally, activation of neuronal Akt1/mTOR would not be the "initiating" event itself, if other more rate-limiting steps are regulated upstream.</s></p><p><s>OPCs receive synaptic input that could modulate proliferation and myelination <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Using acute slices from mutant and control mice (additionally expressing a Ng2-EYFP transgene 7 ), we whole-cell patch clamped both Purkinje cells, having input predominantly from Pf, and fluorescent OPCs in the ML.</s><s>This allowed us to determine GC spiking activity as well as the synaptic inputs from Pf to OPCs.</s><s>Importantly, we found no difference between mutant and control OPCs for the frequency of spontaneous synaptic Pf inputs, nor the inputs to Purkinje cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2j</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Also the fraction of OPCs that received detectable input was not different (controls: 39%; mutants: 47%; Χ1=0.87, p=0.4,</s><s>Chi-square test).</s><s>Thus, de novo myelination is unlikely owed to an underlying alteration of Pf spiking activity or changes of synaptic input to OPCs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; Supplementary Information).</s></p><p><s>Theoretically, Pf myelination could be caused by down-regulating inhibitory neuronal signals.</s><s>We addressed this by targeting only a small fraction of sparsely distributed GC, using Nex-CreERT2 mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>After 5 days of tamoxifen (P10-15), reporter gene expression marked &lt;4% of all GC (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>However, when analyzed 28 weeks later (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>), we still found a significant increase of mature OL and myelinated area in the ML of Nex-CreERT2*Pten loxP/lox P mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6c-f</ref>), making it highly unlikely that soluble inhibitors, still expressed by 96% of non-recombined GC, must be down-regulated to initiate myelination.</s><s>In these mice de novo myelination was also observed when tamoxifen was given at age 7 months (not shown), arguing strongly against a critical period in development at which the identified PI (3,4,5)P3-dependent neuronal program can trigger myelination.</s></p><p><s>Searching for promyelinating factors, we laser captured stripes of GL from cryosections of 3 months old mutants and controls for transcriptome analyses (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>A resulting list of candidate genes, upregulated in Pten cKO, was further selected by annotation (Supplementary table1) and validated with qPCR (not shown).</s></p><p><s>To confirm the significance of these findings in vivo, we tested Bdnf 9 , reasoning that its inactivation might affect de novo myelination.</s><s>Surprisingly, Tg(m6)-Cre*Pten flox/flox *Bdnf flox/flox mice (hereafter termed Pten*Bdnf double mutants) exhibited a higher (not lower) number of oligodendrocytes in the ML compared to Pten single mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b,c</ref>).</s><s>Also by immunostaining, the myelinated area of the ML was not smaller but larger (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d,e</ref>).</s><s>By EM, we confirmed that Pf calibers were as enlarged as in Pten single mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure">3f</ref>).</s><s>However, by g-ratio analysis myelin was thinner in Pten*Bdnf double mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure">3g,h</ref>).</s><s>Thus, in the absence of Bdnf, mutant oligodendrocytes are more numerous in the ML, but each fiber is only thinly ensheathed.</s><s>Most likely, OPCs respond to either proliferation or differentiation signals, but not to both.</s><s>In the absence of Bdnf (a differe ntiation signal) the weight of proliferation signals might increase, driving the number of OPCs up.</s><s>However, differentiation signals will compensate later and turn all OPCs into oligodendrocytes, explaining a seemingly paradoxic result.</s></p><p><s>To test this hypothesis directly, we compared OPC proliferation in Pten*Bdnf double mutants and single mutants at only 7 weeks of age, following BrdU labeling (P25-45).</s><s>Indeed, double mutants showed 34% more BrdU-labeled (Olig2+) OPCs in the ML than Pten mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure">3i</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, the lack of Bdnf even promoted proliferation of OPCs in heterozygous Pten mutants compared to controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">3i</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that Bdnf helps controling the number of OPCs, which are likely to turnover in the absence of other myelination promoting factors.</s><s>For comparison, Nrg1 (essential for myelination by Schwann cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> ) revealed no such effects on de novo myelination in Tg(m6)-Cre*Pten flox/flox *Nrg1 flox/flox mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Because of the complexity of Bdnf effects in vivo, we studied other candidate factors (emerging from our screen) in primary oligodendrocyte cultures and myelinating neuron/oligodendrocyte co-cultures, using recombinant proteins to test their role in OPC proliferation, differentiation, and/or myelination.</s><s>Indeed, Fgf1 stimulated proliferation of OPCs (Supplementary Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">8a-d and 9</ref>;
