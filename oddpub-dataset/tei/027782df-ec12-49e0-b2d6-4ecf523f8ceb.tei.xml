however, mechanisms of cholesterol trafficking towards the plasma membrane, plasma membrane to the ER via lysosomes, ER to the plasma membrane via lysosomes, and towards mitochondria are not well understood.</s><s>Cholesterol levels in ER regulate de novo biosynthesis and uptake of cholesterol by controlling the proteolytic activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and the reesterification of cholesterol by the ER-resident acyl CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase.</s><s>For use and storage at other cellular compartments, cholesterol has to exit the lysosomes.</s><s>A model has been proposed for cholesterol trafficking at the LE/LY compartments, in which the NPC2 protein binds cholesterol in the lysosomal lumen and then transfer cholesterol to the N-terminal domain of the lysosomal membrane-spanning NPC1 protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Cholesterol is then transported out of the LE/LY compartments by some unknown mechanisms.</s><s>Cholesterol trafficking at the LE/LY compartments has gained interest recently due to its significance in understanding the mechanisms of NPC disease as well as other lysosomal storage disorders.</s></p><p><s>Cyclodextrins (CDs), a family of cyclic oligosaccharides consisting of α-D-glucopyranose molecules joined by alpha-1-4-glycosidic linkages, can form complexes with a number of poorly water-soluble molecules including cholesterol through their hydrophobic cavity and enhance the solubility of the guest molecules via their hydrophilic outer surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Because of this cholesterol-binding property, selected CD derivatives have been investigated as a potential therapy for NPC disease.</s><s>One such CD, 2hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), has been shown to alleviate the cholesterol accumulation defect in NPC1 mutant cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>In preclinical studies, a direct brain injection of HPβCD into an NPC mouse model slowed the progression of neuronal loss and improved its survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> .</s><s>Similar results were observed in a feline model of NPC disease, with an intra-cisternal administration conferring attenuated neurodegeneration and prolonged survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>More recently, an intrathecal cyclodextrin injection in a single-NPC1 patient led to an increase in cholesterol redistribution in the central nervous system and improved vertical gaze palsy, a clinical indicator of NPC-linked neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>In 2013, due to the encouraging preclinical data, the HPβCD entered into first-in-human clinical trials at the NIH Clinical Center.</s><s>The HPβCD successfully completed phase 1/2a clinical trial designed to test its safety and effectiveness.</s><s>The study showed that intrathecal injections of HPβCD decreased the progression of neurological disease in NPC patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Based on the promising data of phase 1-2 clinical trial, currently, the HPβCD is being tested in a multicenter, multinational phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT02534844).</s><s>Although the efficacy of HPβCD in NPC disease is well established, the mechanism is still unknown.</s><s>A recent study demonstrated that 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HPγCD) can reduce cholesterol accumulation in the NPC patient-derived cells and prolong survival in NPC model mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>One study also showed that another CD derivative, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), binds and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which was essential for MβCD-mediated reduction of cholesterol storage in NPC1 mutant cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>This study provided the evidence of direct binding of MβCD to the molecular target and reducing the cholesterol levels in NPC1 mutant cells.</s><s>It is important to identify the molecular target of HPβCD and HPγCD in order to develop drugs for NPC.</s><s>We recently screened twelve derivatives of α, β, and γ CDs with different functional substitutions for their ability to modulate intracellular cholesterol accumulation; of the 12 CD derivatives tested, HPβCD and HPγCD were able to rescue the cholesterol accumulation defect in NPC patient-derived cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>However, how HPβCD or HPγCD triggers the cholesterol egress from the LE/LY compartments and normalize cellular cholesterol homeostasis is unanswered.</s><s>Understanding these mechanisms will improve the cyclodextrin-based therapy and may reveal new drug targets for NPC disease.</s><s>Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which the CDs rescue the intracellular cholesterol accumulation defect and to determine the cellular proteins or pathways that are critical for modulating intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.</s></p><p><s>In the current studies, we used a proteomic approach to elucidate the mechanism of cyclodextrin-mediated exit of cholesterol from lysosomes.</s><s>We identified a number of candidate proteins differentially expressed in NPC1 mutant cells compared to the wild-type cells;

NPC1 mutant cells showed lower levels of LAMP-1 compared to the wild-type control cells.</s><s>Considering that our observation is based on only one cell line, further investigations are warranted (including more cell lines) to confirm this possibility.</s><s>It seems that an alteration in the levels of intracellular cholesterol does not directly provide a signal for the cellular machinery to upregulate LAMP-1 expression in order to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in NPC1 mutant cells.</s><s>In this scenario, treatment with cyclodextrins (HPβCD and HPγCD) has more significance for inducing LAMP-1 expression in NPC1 mutant cells (which maintain low levels of LAMP-1 otherwise) to restore cholesterol homeostasis.</s><s>Therefore, this study found a new role of LAMP-1 in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis as well as the potential for the cyclodextrinbased therapeutic strategies for NPC disease.</s></p><p><s>One of the major unanswered questions in cellular cholesterol homeostasis is how free cholesterol exits the LE/LY compartments and reaches other cellular compartments such as the ER and the plasma membrane.</s><s>It was suggested that the lysosomal luminal protein NPC2 binds cholesterol released from LDL and hands-off to the N-terminal domain of the lysosomal membrane-spanning protein NPC1, which then inserts the cholesterol into the lysosomal membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Crystallography, genetic and in vitro binding studies suggested that NPC2 and NPC1 bind to cholesterol in opposite orientation such that NPC2 exposes the 3β-OH group and buries the isooctyl side chain deep within a hydrophobic pocket; however, when NPC1 binds cholesterol, it exposes the isooctyl side chain and buries the 3β-OH group <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>This change in the orientation of cholesterol during its transfer from NPC2 to NPC1 appears to allow NPC1 to insert the isooctyl side chain of cholesterol into the lysosomal membrane prior to trafficking to other cellular compartments.</s><s>Because Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> LAMP-1 is essential for cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol export from lysosomes.</s><s>Verification of HeLa cells either overexpressing LAMP-1 (HeLa-LE) or stably carrying shRNA for LAMP-1 (Hela LAMP-1 knockdown or HeLa-kd) by western blot (a).</s><s>HeLa-LE shows significantly increased levels of LAMP-1, while HeLa-Lkd shows decreased levels of LAMP-1 compared to the HeLa cells transfected with a control plasmid.</s><s>Control or transfected HeLa cells were treated with U18666A (5 μg/ml) for 48-72 h, and metabolic activity (b) and LDH activity (c) were measured.</s><s>Data are mean ± S.E.M. and representative of three experiments.</s><s>None of transfected cell lines showed toxicity after three days of treatment with U18666A.</s><s>HeLa cells lines were analyzed for cholesterol accumulation by filipin imaging (d).</s><s>U18666A-induced cholesterol accumulation in control cells; however, LAMP-1 overexpression (HeLa-LE) suppressed U18666A-induced cholesterol accumulation.</s><s>LAMP-1 knockdown (HeLa-Lkd) did not show any protection against cholesterol accumulation and showed higher accumulation of cholesterol compared to control.</s><s>Microscope images are a representative of at least three random fields of three experimental replicates.</s><s>Scale bar = 50 μm LAMP-1 is known to bind NPC1, NPC2, and cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , it will be very interesting to study how LAMP-1 is involved in the process of cholesterol exit from the LE/LY compartments.</s><s>Further studies are necessary to understand whether cholesterol is channeled to LAMP-1 directly or cholesterol is handed-off to LAMP-1 through NPC2 or NPC1 prior to the exit from the LE/LY compartments.</s></p><p><s>It is possible that the orientation of cholesterol-binding to LAMP-1 is similar to NPC1 rather than to NPC2 (Scheme 1).</s><s>LAMP-1 is a large lysosomal membrane glycoprotein, whereas NPC2 is a relatively small protein present in the lumen of lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, NPC2 alone is not sufficient for cholesterol egress from lysosomes, and NPC1 is essential for this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Our data suggest that the LAMP-1 protein is important in maintaining cholesterol trafficking at the LE/LY compartments, in particular when NPC1 function is absent or limited.</s><s>Together, these findings support a novel role of LAMP-1 in cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol homeostasis.</s><s>However, this hypothesis needs further investigations and will be the focus of our future studies.</s></p></div>
