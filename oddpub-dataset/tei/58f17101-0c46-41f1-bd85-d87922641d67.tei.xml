<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interpretation</head><p><s>Ten years after first vaccination, the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine showed sustained immunogenicity in all age groups.</s><s>Antibody titers at Year 10 were still at least three times higher than those observed after natural infection across all age groups, and in the older age categories (≥25 years), titers were similar to or just below the plateau levels associated with long-term efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22]</ref>.</s><s>These findings were in line with the results of the primary study and consistent with our expectations, since GMTs are known to decline with increasing age at vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>These results, along with the sustained efficacy seen in another study for up to 7 years post vaccination in women aged ≥25 years, suggest that the vaccine may confer protection for up to 10 years and possibly longer, even in older subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Mathematical modeling predicted detectable anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody responses for at least 30 years after the first vaccination.</s><s>Since women are potentially at risk of exposure to HPV for a long period of time throughout their lives, these findings suggest that the duration of protection against CC conferred by HPV vaccination may be close to lifelong.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>This study confirmed the sustained immunogenicity of the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine in women aged 15-55 years, with an acceptable safety profile for at least 10 years after primary vaccination.</s><s>Mathematical modeling predicted that anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers, 30 years post vaccination would still be above natural infection levels in all age groups using a modified power-law model, and in the 15-25 years and 26-45-year age groups using a piecewise model.</s><s>Considering the time required to develop cervical cancer, this suggests that protection may be close to lifelong.</s><s>Women in age groups not targeted by pediatric or adolescent immunization and catch-up programs may still individually benefit from HPV vaccination.</s></p></div>
