<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient clinical information</head><p><s>Patient 1.</s><s>The first child was born at 41 weeks gestation following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery to unrelated parents of Maltese background, with no family history of a neurodegenerative process.</s><s>He was described as an irritable baby in infancy.</s><s>He had motor and expressive delay: he smiled responsively at 4 months of age, sat unaided at 2 years, walked at 2½ years, and did not start uttering single words until he was 3 years of age, with short phrases at 4 years.</s><s>He was noted to have bilateral horizontal nystagmus.</s><s>During childhood moderate cognitive impairment was apparent, requiring support class schooling.</s><s>At around 6 years of age, he developed an action tremor and head titubation, and his gait became ataxic.</s><s>He was in a special class for learning difficulties.</s><s>There was a fairly static course.</s><s>When last reviewed clinically at 17 years of age, height and weight were normal.</s><s>He had coarse horizontal nystagmus with normal ocular fundi.</s><s>General physical examination was normal.</s><s>Cranial nerve testing was normal.</s><s>He had normal muscle bulk with slightly reduced power.</s><s>Deep tendon reflexes were brisk with ankle clonus and extensor plantar reflexes bilaterally.</s><s>His gait was described as 'spastic ataxic', and he was unable to tandem-walk.</s></p><p><s>Normal investigations included creatine kinase, blood lactate, thyroid function tests, liver function tests, urine amino and organic acids, oligosaccharides and glycosaminoglycans, plasma very long chain fatty acids, serum transferrin isoforms, biotinidase assay, white blood cell lysosomal enzymes, karyotype, and fragile X testing.</s><s>A brain MRI scan at 5½ years of age showed marked thinning of the corpus callosum, hypomyelination of the dorsal brainstem, internal capsules and deep white matter, with high T2 signal throughout the periventricular deep white matter.</s><s>On the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences used in magnetic resonance imaging, the central white matter was hyperintense when compared to the more peripheral areas of non-myelination, confirming that there appeared to be a dys-or demyelinating process centrally and non-myelination of the periphery (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The findings were suggestive of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.</s><s>Sequencing of PLP1 only revealed a 3′UTR polymorphism (NM_000533.4 (PLP1_v001):  c.*102C4T), and GJC2 sequencing was normal.</s><s>A repeat MRI scan at 15 years of age showed that the white matter changes had been relatively stable, indicating arrest of myelination that had shown little progression over the years.</s><s>The white matter volume was markedly reduced within both cerebral hemispheres and accompanied by prominent extra-axial spaces and ex vacuo dilation of the lateral and third ventricles, which had increased slightly in size from the previous scan.</s></p><p><s>Patient 2. The second child, 2 years younger, was also born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery.</s><s>She did not begin walking until 2 years of age and had learning difficulties.</s><s>She developed nystagmus at around 4 years of age, and her gait was ataxic.</s><s>She too required support class placement at school.</s><s>She was also prone to sometimes debilitating anxiety attacks.</s><s>When last reviewed at age 12½ years, her growth was normal.</s><s>Her anxiety attacks had resolved without specific therapy.</s><s>Neuromuscular examination revealed normal tone, normal deep tendon reflexes in the upper limbs but increased in lower limbs.</s><s>Plantar reflexes were flexor bilaterally.</s><s>Cerebellar signs were minimal, although she did have dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia on earlier examinations.</s><s>She also had truncal ataxia and pendular nystagmus bilaterally.</s><s>Overall, she was less severely affected than her brother.</s><s>Her formal ophthalmological assessment confirmed a fine rotatory nystagmus of high frequency and low amplitude, as well as mild astigmatism but normal fundoscopy.</s><s>Electroretinograms and visual evoked potentials were also normal.</s></p><p><s>Their mother, whose intellect was normal, was prone to fluttering eye movements with rapid changes in fixation and was found to have multiple small foci of abnormal high signal intensity in the deep white matter on MRI of the brain.</s><s>Their father and younger brother, now aged 17, have normal general physical and neurological examinations and have had no learning problems.</s><s>Patient 3.</s><s>After an uneventful pregnancy, the male patient was born at term to consanguineous parents (first cousins of Turkish origin).</s><s>Two aunts and one uncle in the paternal line had suffered from severe incompletely characterised neurological disorders and died between 2 months and 12 years without having learnt to walk or speak.</s><s>One of these children had also had epilepsy.</s></p><p><s>The patient first came to medical attention at the age of 3 months because of poor eye fixation and muscular hypotonia.</s><s>At 10 months of age, he suffered from his first prolonged seizure, followed by intractable focal occipital epilepsy.</s><s>Additionally, he was prone to startle reactions provoked by noises.</s><s>He developed microcephaly and severe motor and speech delay: at 14 months of age he had just started to turn from a supine to prone position, was not able to sit and was only able to produce simple noises.</s><s>Ocular fundi were normal.</s><s>He developed marked spasticity in the lower limbs.</s><s>Deep tendon reflexes were brisk with ankle clonus bilaterally and extensor plantar reflexes on the left side.</s><s>He attended a special class for blind children.</s><s>When he was last examined at 18 years of age, he was able to sit unaided.</s><s>He never learned to walk, and could not stand without assistance.</s><s>General physical examination, as well as height and weight, were normal.</s></p><p><s>Normal investigations included full blood count, creatine kinase, thyroid function tests, liver function tests, blood ammonia, blood and CSF lactate and pyruvate, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, and glycosaminoglycans, fibroblast lysosomal enzymes and karyotype.</s><s>Nerve biopsy revealed multiple discrete distensions in the myelin sheath with disseminated fatty degradation.</s><s>Muscle biopsy was histologically normal, as was a bone marrow biopsy.</s><s>Brainstem evoked potentials were delayed.</s><s>Nerve conduction studies and visual evoked potentials were normal.</s><s>An EEG was abnormal with diffuse slow rhythms and multifocal epileptiform discharges.</s><s>Brain MRI was first performed at 1 year of age and repeated at 7 years of age.</s><s>Both scans revealed dys/ hypomyelination of the white matter and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, with the second MRI scan also revealing generalised cortical thinning, and on sagittal views, only the rostral part of the corpus callosum could be seen.</s><s>His mother and father and one brother were neurologically normal.</s><s>DNA from the proband and his parents was available for testing, but cultured skin fibroblasts were not available from the proband for further functional studies.</s></p></div>

The female patient was less severely affected than the male patients, with minimal cerebellar signs and normal electroretinograms.</s><s>The available MRI findings in two patients were suggestive of PMD.</s></p><p><s>Since screening of the two most common causative disease genes (PLP1 and GJC2) was normal in the affected siblings, WES was performed.</s><s>A homozygous c.[5 A4G]; p.(Asp2Gly) RARS variant was identified in patient 1 and 2. WES findings were validated by Sanger sequencing, and the parents were found to be heterozygous for the c. [5 A4G] RARS variant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>This variant has been submitted to ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/162080/).</s><s>Molecular testing in patient 3 for variants (including duplications) in the PLP gene was normal.</s><s>We subsequently performed Sanger sequencing for all 15 coding exons in the RARS (NM_002887.3) in a cohort of 45 patients with suspected PMD in whom a genetic diagnosis had not been established, including patient 3. We identified compound heterozygous RARS variants c.[1367C4T] and c.[1846_1847delTA] in patient 3 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b and c</ref>).</s><s>These variants have been submitted to ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</s><s>clinvar/variation/265854/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/</s><s>variation/265855/ respectively).</s><s>Sequencing of parental DNA revealed that the mother was heterozygous for the variant c.[1367C4T] whereas the father was variant negative (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b and c</ref>), indicating the patient's RARS deletion was possibly a de novo event or a consequence of non-paternity.We conducted in silico analyses of the RARS variants for predicted pathogenicity and determination of minor allele frequencies (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>The predicted pathogenicity of the homozygous missense variant [c.5 A4G]; p.(Asp2Gly) was variable, with the SIFT and PolyPhen-2 tools predicting it to have no effect, while Mutation-Taster and GVGD predicted it to be damaging.</s><s>In silico prediction for the c.[1367C4T; p.(Ser456Leu)] variant in patient 3 indicated a deleterious effect by all four predictive software programmes.</s><s>The c.[1846_1847delTA]; p.(Tyr616Leufs*6) variant, which introduces a stop codon at residue 621 of 660 was predicted to be disease causing by Mutation Taster.</s><s>All three variants were considered rare according to the ExAC with the reported minor allele frequency of c.[5A4G], (a previously reported variant in PMD) being 0.00013 and c.[1367C4T] being 0.00048.</s><s>There was no reported allele frequency for the c.[1846_1847delTA] variant.</s></p><p><s>The RARS protein consists of four well-defined structural domains each with specific functions: the 'N-terminal extension' domain allows for anchoring of RARS into the MSC; the 'additional domain' that allows interaction with the tRNA, made of the D-loop, and T-loop interaction; the'catalytic domain' is where the aminoacylation takes place, and the 'anticodon binding domain' interacts with the anticodon of the tRNA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>All three identified variants are found in these functionally characterised domains of the RARS protein; Asp2 is in the N-terminus domain which interacts with the MSC and Ser456 is in the additional domain and is C-terminal to the strictly conserved Arg455 in the KMSKS motif, which stabilises ATP during amino acid activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> with a possible functional impact, and the p.(Tyr616-Leufs*6) variant results in loss of part of the anticodon binding domain.</s><s>RARS protein levels were investigated in patient 1 (P1) fibroblasts using immunoblot analysis, revealing a 75% reduction in the 72 kDa RARS isoform in P1 compared to control fibroblasts.</s><s>Interestingly, the expression levels of the 60 kDa RARS isoform, which lacks the N-terminus, was at a level similar to that of the control fibroblasts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3a</ref>).</s><s>RARS quantitation could not be performed on the other patients due to unavailability of samples.</s></p><p><s>Since the p.(Asp2Gly) RARS variant lies in the N-terminal domain which interacts with the MSC; we examined assembly of the MSC in patient fibroblasts by Blue Native-PAGE.</s><s>A 99% reduction in the expression of MSC was observed in fibroblasts from patient 1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that the p.(Asp2Gly) substitution results in the failure of RARS to be incorporated into the MSC either due to the conformational change or due to lack of total protein expression or both.</s><s>A previous study has shown that the 72 kDa isoform of RARS is essential for protein synthesis and cell growth in CHO cells despite the presence of the 60 kDa isoform. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>We investigated growth of patient 1 fibroblast's in arginine depleted media.</s><s>As shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a and c</ref>, at the non-permissive temperatures of 30 °C and 40 °C in arginine depleted media, patient 1 (P1) fibroblast cell growth was reduced by 40% and 30%, respectively, compared with controls fibroblasts (C).</s><s>However, no difference in cell growth between the control and patient 1 was found at 37 °C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>).</s><s>These observations indicate that patient fibroblasts exhibit temperature-sensitive growth in the absence of the high molecular weight form of RARS.</s></p><p><s>Using HOPE in silico software, we were able to analyse the structural effects of the amino acid changes (p.(Asp2Gly) and p.(Ser456Leu). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>he wild-type residue (Aspartic acid at position 2) was larger, negatively charged and less hydrophobic compared to the variant amino acid (glycine), which is a neutral amino acid.</s><s>The altered residue was therefore predicted to be less likely to interact with the MSC.In patient 3, the first variant residue at position 456 (leucine) was larger and more hydrophobic (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/hope/).</s><s>These amino acid changes are predicted to reduce the activity of the RARS protein.</s><s>Further, calculations on the 3D coordinate of the RARS protein and its sequence annotations was performed using RasMol modelling software (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>Both Asp2 and Ser456 residues are in conserved residues of the RARS protein in higher order species.</s><s>Interestingly the N-terminus of RARS is not present in some lower species (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d and e</ref>).</s><s>Unfortunately, it is difficult to use in silico approaches to predict the structural effects of frameshift variants.</s><s>However, based on the '50-55' nucleotides rule, only nonsense variants located more than 50-55 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ most exon-exon junction are likely to be targeted for nonsense mediated decay. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s>Thus, as the c.[1846_1847delTA]; p.(Tyr616Leufs*6) variant is located less than 50-55 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ most exonexon junction is not likely to be targeted for nonsense mediated decay.</s><s>This variant will form a truncated protein, lacking part of the anticodon-binding domain and may be unstable.</s></p></div>

[5 A4G] variant may result in fundamental differences in disease severity.</s><s>Further, as there is no evidence of consanguinity in the family history, the prediction of this variant as the cause of hypomyelination can be inferred from the following two possibilities.</s><s>First, there is the possibility of mere randomness of regions of homozygosity in all populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>Second, there is the possibility of remotely shared ancestry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s>he p.(Asp2Gly) substitution in patients 1 and 2 is located in a 72amino acid domain essential for integration of RARS into the MSC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s> model of the human RARS protein with the p.(Asp2Gly) variant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) suggests a possible loss of internal interactions of the variant residue with the surrounding molecules or domains, with possible loss  of external interactions of RARS with the MSC caused by changes in physicochemical properties (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/hope/).</s><s>The in silico predictions are in agreement with the immunoblotting and fibroblast growth results showing significant reductions in the 72 kDa RARS isoform and MSC levels in patient 1, and diminished growth potential of the affected cells containing only a single form of RARS at non-permissive temperatures of 30 °C and 40 °C.</s><s>Mutation in the 72 kDa RARS isoform has been shown to exhibit temperature-sensitive growth characteristics in CHO cells.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> In patient 3, however, as only DNA and no tissue samples or cultured fibroblasts were available to us for functional studies, we had rely on Sanger sequencing, in silico prediction of disease causing for both (c.[1367C4T] and c.[1846_1847delTA]) variants and the phenotypic similarity between patient 3 and the other two patients to support the pathogenicity of the variants in patient 3.</s></p><p><s>Although the mechanism by which mutations in ARS genes lead to diseases remains obscure, in many cases there is increasing evidence that impairment of aminoacylation activity contributes to the development of neuropathy, emphasising the distinct roles of aminoacylation in neuronal function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref></s><s>Thus, establishing an approach for characterising variant alleles in all human ARS-encoding genes will be critical to understand ARS-related neurodegeneration.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our findings suggest that in the absence of a clear PMD diagnosis with mutations in PLP1, screening of the RARS gene could be included in investigations in an appropriate clinical setting.</s><s>Given our patients' clinical phenotypes, the location of each of the variants in RARS, and our in silico analysis and functional data, we postulate that the clinical phenotype of our patients can be explained by RARS variants identified in this study.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 MRI scan of Patient 1 at age 5½ years.</s><s>(a) Axial T1 IR (inversion recovery)low signal in white matter consistent with hypomyelination; (b) Axial T2-diffuse white matter hyperintensity consistent with hypomyelination (most important image); (c) Coronal T2 FLAIR_ high signal white matter; (d) Sagittal T1thin corpus callosum consistent with white matter volume loss.</s><s>(e) Axial T1 and (f) axial T2 (inverted contrast)enhanced cerebrospinal fluid spaces associated with hypomyelination and generalised cortical thinning; (g) Coronal T2ventricular dilatation; (h) Sagittal T1hypoplasia of the corpus callosum with only the rostral part demonstrable.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,305.69,69.51,228.47,468.11" type="bitmap" /></figure>
