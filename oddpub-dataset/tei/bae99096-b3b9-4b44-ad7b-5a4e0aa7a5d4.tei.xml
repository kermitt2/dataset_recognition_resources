<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Apoptosis is an evolutionary conserved process of altruistic cellular suicide that can be induced by extra-and intra-cellular stress stimuli.</s><s>Irrespective of the initiating upstream signal, apoptosis culminates in the activation of cell-death-specific cysteinyl aspartases, called caspases <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Los et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Caspase activation occurs in response to ligation of death receptors on the plasma membrane (extrinsic pathway) or following the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (intrinsic pathway).</s><s>The release of cytochrome c is regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and decisively depends on the presence of multidomain proteins (MDPs) of the Bcl-2 family, that is, Bax or Bak (also known as BAK1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wei et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shamas-Din et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The pro-apoptotic activity of Bax and Bak is counteracted by antiapoptotic 'Bcl-2-like' members, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-x L (a splice variant encoded by BCL2L1), Bcl-w (also known as BCL2L2),</s></p><p><s>Mcl-1 and A1 (also known as BCL2A1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chi et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can be inhibited in turn by a third subgroup, the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins, such as Bad, Bid, Bik (also known as Nbk), Bim (also known as BCL2L11), Noxa (also known as PMAIP1), Puma (also known as BBC3), Hrk and Bmf <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Delbridge et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Bcl-2 proteins form an intricate network that regulates apoptosis by direct protein interaction.</s><s>The interaction of BH3-only proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins has been studied in great detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Willis et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it has been shown that Bim, Bid and Puma potently bind to each anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein, whereas other BH3-only proteins specifically interact with a subset of anti-apoptotic proteins.</s><s>Certain BH3-only proteins, especially the caspase-cleaved truncated form of Bid and Puma, have been shown to directly interact and thereby activate Bax or Bak through induction of a conformational change and oligomerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kuwana et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Du et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Westphal et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins differ in their binding specificity to Bax or Bak.</s><s>Whereas Bax binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L , the homologous protein Bak preferentially binds to Mcl-1 and Bcl-x L <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gillissen et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is widely accepted that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice that are null for both Bax and Bak (denoted Bax −/− /Bak −/− ) or cells deficient for Bax and Bak, such as HCT116 Bax −/− /Bak −/− cells, are largely resistant to a wide variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wei et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang and Youle, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, the multidomain proteins Bax and Bak are considered indispensable for cytochrome c release and apoptosis induction through the intrinsic pathway.</s><s>However, the fact that Bax −/− /Bak −/− double-knockout mice can be born viable, although at a reduced rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lindsten et al., 2000)</ref>, indicates that apoptosis during embryonic development of certain organs is dispensable, replaced by another mode of cell death or that alternative mechanisms compensate for the loss of Bax and Bak.</s><s>Such a compensatory mechanism might be attributed to the third, largely unknown, multidomain protein Bcl-2-related ovarian killer (Bok) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hsu et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Inohara et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Bok is evolutionary conserved and homologous to Bax and Bak <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Surprisingly, in contrast to the vast number of investigations on Bax and Bak, only limited work has been devoted to investigate the regulation and function of Bok.</s><s>Bok is widely expressed, particularly in reproductive tissues, but its loss has apparently only minimal impact in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ke et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Even the combined deficiency of Bok in Bax or Bak single-knockout mice does not show additional phenotypic alterations as compared to the parental mouse strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ke et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Initially, Bok was assumed to function similarly to Bax and Bak, because it also forms clustered structures at the mitochondrial outer membrane that are associated with cytochrome c release <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gao et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Because these experiments were performed in MCF7 cells, which are proficient in Bax and Bak <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Neise et al., 2008)</ref>, Bok might function as a BH3-only protein, for example, like Puma <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jabbour et al., 2008)</ref>, and induce cytochrome c release indirectly by blocking anti-apoptotic proteins or by directly activating Bax and Bak, which in turn mediate cytochrome c release.</s><s>This is supported by experiments showing that Bok alone is insufficient for apoptosis induction in Bax −/− /Bak −/− MEFs and that Bok depends on Bax and Bak to mediate release of cytochrome c <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Echeverry et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, it should be considered that the inability of endogenous Bok to mediate apoptosis in the absence of Bax and Bak might be due to its low or even absent expression level in MEF Bax −/− /Bak −/− cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Echeverry et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Llambi et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In addition to mitochondria, a fraction of Bok is localized to the Golgi and ER, implying a potential role of Bok in ER-stress-induced apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Echeverry et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Carpio et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Llambi et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, in several human cancers, including ovarian and breast carcinoma, the genomic locus encoding Bok is frequently deleted, suggesting a potential role of Bok as a tumor suppressor, similar to Bax and Bak <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beroukhim et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite its early discovery, Bok is certainly the most poorly understood Bcl-2 protein and its physiological role remains enigmatic.</s><s>We, therefore, set out to characterize the pro-apoptotic function of Bok and the relevance of Bok for apoptosis sensitivity towards anti-cancer drugs.</s><s>We found that overexpression of Bok strongly induced apoptosis accompanied by oligomerization of Bax and Bak.</s><s>Interestingly, in Bax-and Bak-deficient cells Bok expression also efficiently induced the release of cytochrome c, meaning that Bok is a genuine pro-apoptotic multidomain protein.</s><s>Consequently, downregulation of endogenous Bok expression, as well as targeted disruption of the Bok gene, effectively reduced the apoptosis sensitivity of even Bax-and Bak-proficient cells.</s><s>Hence, Bok is a relevant component of the Bcl-2 network and, therefore, a potential target for anti-cancer therapeutic approaches.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overexpression of Bok activates Bax and Bak and induces cytochrome c release</head><p><s>It has been previously shown that, in MCF7 cells, overexpressed EGFP-Bok displays clustered signals at the mitochondria that are associated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gao et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Because MCF7 cells express both Bax and Bak <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Neise et al., 2008)</ref>, the release of cytochrome c might be mediated either directly by Bok or indirectly by Bok-induced activation and oligomerization of Bax and/or Bak.</s><s>In order to investigate these possibilities in further detail, we transfected MCF7 cells with pEGFP-Bok and performed immunofluorescence microscopy, detecting active Bax and Bak with conformation-specific antibodies, in parallel with detection of the mitochondrial marker Tom20.</s><s>As a control, we also transfected MCF7 cells with pEGFP-Bax or pEGFP-Bak.</s><s>Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that clustered EGFP signals of either protein coincided with the detection of active conformations of endogenous Bax and Bak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, Bax and Bak mainly colocalized, whereas EGFP-Bok colocalized with active Bax or active Bak to a lower extent.</s><s>Immunoblot analysis, however, verified that Bok was clearly detectable in mitochondria-enriched subcellular fractions in transfected MCF7 and HEK293 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, co-staining for the ER marker calnexin revealed that Bok was also partially localized at the ER (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>), consistent with the reported broader localization of Bok at intracellular membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Echeverry et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Next, we again transfected MCF7 cells with pEGFP-Bax, -Bak or -Bok and detected active Bax or Bak in parallel to cytochrome c.</s><s>As already indicated by the clustering of endogenous Bax and Bak in response to overexpressed Bax, Bak and Bok, we found that cytochrome c was readily released from the mitochondria in MCF7 cells with clustered Bax, Bak and also Bok (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C,D</ref>).</s></p></div>
