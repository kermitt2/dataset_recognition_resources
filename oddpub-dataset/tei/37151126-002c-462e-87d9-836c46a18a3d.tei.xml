use of offlabel and suboptimal formulations; and limited pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/ pharmacogenomic and dose determination studies, contribute to these treatment failures and drug disasters <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, dosing regimens for ELGANs are still being extrapolated from doses used in adults and older children with adjustments for body weight and/or size <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, or just simply by halving the adult dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, without factoring the developmental differences in retinal vasculature, the role of astrocytes during retinal development, the composition of vitreous fluid, and immaturity of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, that exist between preterm infants and adults.</s></p><p><s>Intravitreal administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs are effective for adult retinopathy, such as macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.</s><s>However, there are major developmental differences between the preterm neonate and adult vitreous fluid composition and retinal vasculature that may preclude the use of anti-VEGF therapies in neonates, particularly at the doses recommended (half of the adult dose).</s><s>For example, the human vitreous fluid undergoes age-related liquefaction.</s><s>It is almost 100% gelatinous at birth and is liquid after 4 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>Vitreous gel, compared to liquefied vitreous, lowers oxygen tensions in the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and may increase the mean resident time of drugs.</s><s>Therefore, the impact of vitreous liquefaction on the distribution and resident time of ocular drugs must be considered when ocular drugs are being used in the preterm neonate.</s><s>Furthermore, during retinal development, astrocytes are intimately associated with the retinal vasculature.</s><s>They emerge from the optic disk before the retinal endothelial cells (ECs), form a scaffold, and produce large amounts of VEGF to promote EC proliferation, migration and vascular patterning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Astrocytes ensheathe the retinal vessels providing structure and maintenance of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity.</s><s>Any disturbances in the astrocytic template adversely affect vascular patterning and contribute to the breakdown of the BRB, thus altering the metabolic profile of the tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>The effects of ocular drugs on immature retinal astrocytes and the composition of the immature vitreous fluid, have largely been ignored.</s><s>Drug development targeted for the very vulnerable premature newborn infant to prevent severe ROP is fraught with multiple barriers and challenges.</s><s>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued legislation such as the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) that provide incentives for testing and developing drugs for use in children.</s><s>Topical ocular NSAIDs, such as Acuvail (ketorolac) have been previously used for treatment of ROP in ELGANs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Our group has recently shown that the use of non-invasive topical ocular non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with systemic caffeine citrate results in a significant reduction in the severity of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) in a rat model of IH <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies in preterm infants These findings confirm that arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites play a key role in IH-induced retinopathy, and should be considered as therapeutic targets for treatment and/or prevention of severe ROP.</s></p><p><s>As part of our ongoing effort to develop "baby-friendly", effective therapies, at the right doses, for neonates at risk for severe ROP, and given the differences in vitreous composition between preterm neonates and adults, as well as the role of astrocytes in the development of severe ROP, we conducted a series of experiments to test the hypothesis that co-cultures of human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) and human retinal astrocytes (HRAs) on 3dimensional (3-D) hydrogel scaffolds is a more representative biomimetic paradigm of the dynamic BRB than 2-D cultures, and should be utilized for preclinical drug discovery and development studies in preterm infants.</s><s>To test our hypothesis, we evaluated and compared: 1) efficacy of two NSAIDs used in neonatology, ketorolac and ibuprofen, administered alone or co-administered with caffeine; 2) differential responses of mono-and co-cultures of HRECs and HRAs; 3) responses of cells cultured on Algimatrix versus Geltrex biodegradable 3-D hydrogel scaffolds; and 4) effects of hyperoxia (Hx) and intermittent hypoxia (IH), on secretion of AA metabolites.</s></p></div>
