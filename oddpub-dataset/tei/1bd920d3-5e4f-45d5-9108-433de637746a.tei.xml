<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and discussion</head><p><s>As the samples from A and C showed identical X-ray diffraction patterns (form I; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), we considered them to be the same material.</s><s>Therefore, all other chemical and biological analyses were performed with samples from A (form I) and B (indicated by XRD as a mixture of some of form I and predominantly form III).

after 45 min, the phenomenon was completed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s><s>Through the comparison of the FTIR spectra from the samples from pharmacies A and B (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), the absorptions were assigned to distinct peaks for each chemical functional group within the structure.</s><s>The observed and assigned changes in the functional groups occurred at 1184-1176 cm À 1 , 1526-1520 cm À 1 , and 1550-1552 cm À 1 related to the stretching vibration of the thiazole ring, the asymmetric stretching vibration at 1264-1286 cm À 1 of the sulfone, and amide III bands for the -CO-NH-C-group.</s></p><p><s>As observed in ssNMR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">6</ref>), C14 showed a double signal centered at 13.9 and 9.7 ppm for sample B;

All expected interactions are π…π, between 5-(thiazole) and 6-membered rings and N-H…S¼O internally.</s><s>In contrast, the overall interactions calculated for form III, were present in (de × di), as low as 1.0 Å and rose to over 2.8 Å (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>; form III) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The observed turn around the thiazole ring in polymorph III increased the amount of interactions that contributed to different dissolution behavior.</s><s>These observations not only explained the double signal of C14, but corroborated the increased intermolecular interactions seen for form III. From this data, we inferred that the intramolecular forces occurring at lower and also at higher distance in form III promoted stronger intermolecular interactions within and between the molecules inside the unit cell arrangement.</s><s>This effect will result in a lower solubility (higher interactions inside the unit cell), as experimentally observed.</s><s>In agreement with the observed behavior, meloxican was classified as class II in the Biopharmaceutical Classification System <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Through those observations, we related the results of the biological evaluation found for sample B (form I plus form III, lower activity), with adverse pharmacokinetic parameters, such as bioabsorption and distribution.</s><s>As form III presents intramolecular interactions at a lower distance (1.0 Å) in addition to higher distances (over 2.8 Å), when compared with the same parameters for pure form I, the internal cell packing forces will be increased, which results in a more difficult solubilization process.</s><s>The Hirshfeld surface analysis showed C14 close to S in the thiazole ring on one side and to the hydroxyl group in the six-membered ring in the middle of the structure.</s><s>For form I, only the hydroxyl group interaction was observed, which explained the ssNMR single signal for C14.</s><s>In this case, a reduction of the amount of solubilized form III in comparison with form I, over the same solubilization time, will affect the available drug amount after administration differently for both forms.</s></p></div>
