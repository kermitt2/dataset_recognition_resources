led to an overestimation of the true atrophy rate of the treatment phase, as an acceleration of brain volume loss was observed in other trials following the initiation of therapy with disease-modifying drugs due to the resolution of inflammation and fluid reduction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>mmunomodulatory therapies for MS have no easily discernable, if any, effect in advanced disease stages.</s><s>Consequently, it has been advocated that treatment should start soon after diagnosis, even in clinically unaffected or minimally affected patients with MS.</s><s>For the latter patients there is a great and, as yet, unmet need for safe and well-tolerated oral agents to minimise the risk during long-term immunomodulatory treatment lasting two to three decades.</s><s>The patients in this trial with their median EDSS of 1.5-2.0 are representative of this MS subgroup with only minor clinical impairment despite MRI evidence of rather pronounced inflammatory disease activity.</s></p><p><s>Indications of positive clinical outcomes in this trial are supporting evidence for a potential efficacy of the SFE, even though the trial was underpowered for the reliable evaluation for which phase IIb trials are performed.</s><s>The reduction of the ARR from the 12 months before to the 12 months after treatment begins certainly has to be attributed in part to the RTTME and to a common form of selection bias: patients who have only recently suffered a relapse are more likely to start on immunotherapy or to enter a clinical trial.</s><s>EDSS and SNRS proved to be stable throughout the observation period, while quality of life improved.</s><s>The improvement in the SDMT and the PASAT results at month 12 might at least partially reflect training effects.</s><s>However, a beneficial effect of the SFE on cognition in patients with RRMS cannot be excluded and was also indicated in a short-term, placebo-controlled trial using Boswellia papyrifera to treat cognitive impairment in 80 patients with MS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> The rather high dropout rate in our trial has primarily been associated with either non-compliance to the time-consuming study protocol or with patients reconsidering approved therapies in the face of an early relapse during the follow-up.</s><s>Only in two patients were side effects the reason for early withdrawal (urticaria or gustatory disgust).</s></p><p><s>Compared with approved oral MS treatments, the SFE showed a very good safety profile, particularly with respect to absolute and relative lymphocyte counts, which remained unaffected (figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).</s><s>Compared with the baseline observation period before the trial, the incidence of infections did not increase during treatment.</s><s>Gastrointestinal AEs had been observed in previous clinical trials with SFE 5 and were also the most frequent drug-related side effects in our study.</s><s>Whether the two rheumatologic AEs were related to SFE or coincidental is not clear at present and should be monitored in future clinical trials.</s></p><p><s>General haematological and immunological parameters show that the treatment was not immunotoxic.</s><s>While MS is a complex and heterogeneous immunological disease, there is consensus about the importance of a dysregulation of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory T cell subsets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>Immunological outcome data from the present trial imply a distinct immunological signature change in the T cell compartment and more specifically in the CD3+ Treg/TH17 subset, which is consistent with our in vitro observations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref></s><s>The data of this previous trial focused on CD4+ T cells, the results of the present study indicate that the immunomodulatory effects of SFE are, at least partly, due to reduced IL-17 production of CD8+ T cells.</s><s>This observed effect could be related to CD8+ CD161+ TH17-like Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells that have recently received increased attention because of their possible role in the pathogenesis of RRMS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>The fact that disease activity remained reduced for up to 36 months in patients participating in the extension phase, as evidenced by both MRI and clinical outcome parameters, supports the conclusion that SFE has a durable effect as long as treatment continues (figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In summary, the MRI, clinical and immunological data in this SABA phase IIa trial indicate that this SFE is safe and shows beneficial immunomodulatory effects in RRMS, which should be further investigated in randomised controlled phase IIb or III trials.</s><s>The combined analysis of MRI, clinical and immunological outcomes in an open baseline-to-treatment design with frequent monitoring is attractive for patients and investigators for early proof-of-concept studies to evaluate new treatment approaches in small patient groups.</s><s>Furthermore, due to its open design and frequent monitoring, it is also attractive from a safety perspective since investigator and patient are aware of the disease activity and can discuss a switch to a different treatment if unexpected safety issues or increased disease activity should occur.</s><s>Daclizumab (anti-CD25) can be referred to as one example.</s><s>Here, the effects on activity seen in MRI and the reduction of ARR that had been observed in an even smaller trial with a similar design 31 endured throughout clinical development and large-scale phase III testing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>However, despite our encouraging results, it is difficult to forecast the efficacy of an SFE in RRMS, and larger trials are required to demonstrate an effect on clinical outcome.</s><s>It is also clear that, despite a growing list of treatment options, the right balance between efficacy and safety profile becomes increasingly more important for a young patient population, who require long-term treatment.</s><s>The results of the SABA trial are promising from this perspective.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Trial design (a) and
