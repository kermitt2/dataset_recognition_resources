<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The human intestinal microbiota is gaining increasing attention due to its association with a broad range of immunopathological conditions including metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus), autoimmune disorders (e.g., type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, infl ammatory bowel diseases), cancer, allergies, and neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders (e.g., autism, depression, dementia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, with respect to their microbiota, "humanized" mice provide rewarding in vivo models to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying commensal bacteria-host interactions and its determinants in health and disease.</s><s>In fact, human microbiota-associated (hma) formerly germfree mice that have been reared in isolators are widely applied nowadays to unravel the effects of (epi)genetic and environmental (including dietary) factors on intestinal microbiota and host (patho)physiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>For instance, one study applying hma mice revealed that distinct microbial communities of the intestinal microbiota that had been derived from preterm infants differentially affected intestinal epithelial development with pivotal effects on developmental, defensive, and physiological processes within the intestinal epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In another report, germfree mice were reconstituted with microbiota of patients suffering from infl ammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in order to investigate susceptibility to disease depending on abundances of distinct bacterial groups derived from diseased individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Mice reassociated with human microbiota from different donors display an intestinal microbiome composition as well as metabolic profi le that is similar to those observed in donors with preservation of distinct individual-specifi c features <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>As an important prerequisite, the donor human microbiota could stably establish within the intestinal ecosystem in recipient mice with distinct similarities to the community composition in the respective donor suspensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, while some low-abundance Firmicutes, however, were shown to be absent in recipient mice resulting in an impaired response to infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, commensal bacterial species appear to be critically adapted to specifi c hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, despite a highly specifi c coexistence and mutual interaction between microbiota species and host immunity, hma mice do not entirely mirror human microbiota-host interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, given that a microbiota has been transplanted into a host with which it has not been co-evolved.</s><s>Nevertheless, despite these limitations, the hma mouse model provides a unique tool to unravel microbiota-host interactions in health and disease.</s></p><p><s>One needs to take further into consideration, however, that studies with hma mice have been undertaken in isolator-raised germfree mice with a substantially underdeveloped immune system in most cases so far.</s><s>Given that immunological differentiation and maturation are highly microbiota dependent, it becomes therefore obvious that comparisons of studies with germfree versus conventional mice are problematic per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>This point of view is shared by recent studies reporting pivotal differences in phenotypes already under basal conditions and even more pronounced in various disease states when applying isolator-raised germfree and conventionally reared mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We therefore generated secondary abiotic (i.e., gnotobiotic) mice with a virtually depleted intestinal microbiota by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment of conventionally reared mice exhibiting a fully developed immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Following peroral fecal microbiota transplantations (FMTs), the complex human microbiota established within the gastrointestinal tract of these secondary abiotic mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and was stable for over 6 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>By applying the hma mouse model, we could convincingly prove previously that the host-specifi c intestinal microbiota composition determines host susceptibily for and resistance against distinct enteropathogens including Campylobacter jejuni <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Whereas conventionally colonized mice were protected from C. jejuni infection due to their physiological colonization resistance and expelled the pathogen within 48 h following high dose infection, C. jejuni could stably infect secondary abiotic mice even when reassociated with complex human intestinal microbiota <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Following reconstitution of secondary abiotic mice with murine microbiota, however, mice exhibited fully re-established colonization resistance against C. jejuni <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Our murine in vivo data are supported by recent human investigations, given that individuals exhibiting a reduced bacterial diversity in their intestines were suscep-tibile to C. jejuni infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, our "humanized" murine in vivo model is well-suited to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen-commensal microbiota-host interactions.</s></p><p><s>Generation of hma mice, however, is time-consuming, given that mice need to be at least 8 weeks of age prior quintuple antibiotic challenge for another 8 to 10 weeks.</s><s>To assure stable bacterial colonization, mice should be further kept for at least 2 more weeks post FMT before inclusion into the respective experiment.</s><s>Thus, breeding of hma mice would be a convenient measure, saving time and resources, but a stable human microbiota colonization of the murine gastrointestinal tract over time would be a pivotal prerequistite for experimental applications.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we therefore investigated potential changes in intestinal microbiota composition in hma offspring mice and their corresponding mothers over time applying both comprehensive cultural ("culturomics") and molecular methods.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>During the past years, the endogenous intestinal microbiota has gained increasing attention regarding their impact in health and disease.</s><s>Microbial colonization and host immune development and maturation run in parallel and are essentially involved in regulation of intestinal (patho) physiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, with respect to their microbiota, "humanized" mice comprise an elegant tool to perform in vivo proof-of-principle experiments (quasi "clinical trials in mice") that unravel the effects of environmental and genetic factors on intestinal microbiota and host (patho)physiology in health and disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since generation of hma mice is very challenging and time-consuming, we addressed in the present study how the intestinal microbiota were changing in offspring of hma mice and their mothers over time.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the fi rst comprehensive kinetic survey of intestinal microbiota composition in offspring of hma mice that had been generated by FMT of seconday abiotic mice with a fully developed immune system applying both "culturomics" and molecular methods.</s><s>We were able to show that within 1 week post weaning (i.e., by the age of 4 weeks), fecal loads of commensal enterobacteria and enterococci had decreased, whereas obligate anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides/Prevotella spp.</s><s>and clostridia were stably colonizing the intestines of hma offspring at high loads.</s><s>This is well in line with an earlier study in offspring of hma isolator-raised Balb/c mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The authors demonstrated that facultative anaerobes such as enterobacteria and streptococci could be cultured from the intestinal tract as early as the fi rst day post partum, whereas anaerobes were undetectable in the fi rst week of life.</s><s>Furthermore, most of the parental intestinal bacteria colonized the intestines of the offspring of hma mice until weaning (i.e., 3 weeks post partum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>As in our survey, numbers in intestinal enterobacteria and enterococci were declining after weaning, but were still comparable to maternal loads <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, lactobacilli numbers were successively increasing until 18 weeks post weaning in both hma offspring and mothers, whereas by then, bifi dobacteria were detectable in the latter only.</s><s>Interest-ingly, fecal lactobacilli and bifi dobacteria were higher in mothers as compared to their offspring at 5 and 18 weeks post weaning.</s><s>Hirayama and colleagues showed that bifi dobacteria were eliminated from the intestinal tract of some hma mice following FMT which was depending on the respective human fecal donor suspension <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>If established in the intestines, however, bifi dobacteria virtually never became predominant in hma offspring despite high intestinal loads in their mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Applying cultureindependent molecular methods, Collins and coworkers were able to show that isolator-raised C57BL/6 mice that had been subjected to peroral human FMT maintained a stable human microbiota in their intestines over several generations upon housing under conventional SPF conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One needs to take into consideration, however, that the murine intestinal microbiota is highly depending on housing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, "humanized" mice were maintained under standard hygienic conditions with open cages, handled under aseptic conditions and fed autoclaved chow and water, thus, not mimicking human conditions at all.</s><s>Particularly, the diet is a pivotal determinant of intestinal microbiota composition.</s><s>In an elegant earlier study, Hirayama et al. could show that intestinal enterobacterial loads increased upon feeding hma mice a diet with high meat contents <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Change to a standard chow high in fi bre and gran, however, could reverse intestinal enterobacterial numbers back to basal levels.</s><s>This was further supported by our own study, where secondary abiotic mice had been fed a Western ("Cafeteria") diet for 10 weeks.</s><s>Upon Western diet, mice developed an intestinal microbiota that was comparable to that observed in hma mice as indicated by higher total bacterial loads in the colonic lumen as well as higher counts of distinct bacterial commensals including enterobacteria (such as E. coli) and Clostridium/Eubacterium spp. as compared to mice on conventional chow, whereas lactobacilli were lower in the large intestines of the former <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, feeding a Western diet to secondary abiotic for 10 weeks resulted in a weight gain of more than 40%.</s><s>Interestingly, like in overweight mice on Western diet, distinct features of intestinal microbiota composition such as increased intestinal enterobacterial loads could be determined in obese (ob/ob) mice if compared to lean wildtype controls, both on conventional chow <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, among a plethora of factors including (patho)physiological conditions, nutrition is one important (but not exclusive) determinant of intestinal microbiota composition.</s><s>When studying human microbiota-host interactions in mice, not only the intestinal microbiota composition itself but also the respective dietary regimen as its pivotal determinant should resemble human
