<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency in adults, characterized by B-cell abnormalities and inadequate antibody response.</s><s>CVID patients have considerable autoimmune comorbidity and we therefore hypothesized that genetic susceptibility to CVID may overlap with autoimmune disorders.</s><s>Here, in the largest genetic study performed in CVID to date, we compare 778 CVID cases with 10,999 controls across 123,127 singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Immunochip.</s><s>We identify the first non-HLA genome-wide significant risk locus at CLEC16A (rs17806056, P Â¼ 2.0 Ã 10 Ã 9 ) and confirm the previously reported human leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations on chromosome 6p21 (rs1049225, P Â¼ 4.8 Ã 10 Ã 16 ).</s><s>Clec16a knockdown (KD) mice showed reduced number of B cells and elevated IgM levels compared with controls, suggesting that CLEC16A may be involved in immune regulatory pathways of relevance to CVID.</s><s>In conclusion, the CLEC16A associations in CVID represent the first robust evidence of non-HLA associations in this immunodeficiency condition.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study has demonstrated a potential role of CLEC16A in the pathogenesis of CVID by strong genetic associations and its involvement in murine B-cell function.</s></p><p><s>Because of the prominent CLEC16A SNP associations in a variety of auto-immune diseases, several studies have been carried out to examine the biological function of CLEC16A.</s><s>Its Drosophila homologue Ema has been found to localize to the endosomal and Golgi membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Ema mutants show defects in lysosomal degradation and protein trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>It is also essential for autophagosomal growth and autophagy processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , which are of major importance for proper immune regulation, including regulation of inflammasome activation.</s><s>CLEC16A is evolutionarily conserved and may rescue the Drosophila Ema mutant phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Human CLEC16A has been reported to be abundantly expressed in dendritic cells, natural killer cells and B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Zouk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> demonstrated, by using a human erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell line, K562 cells, and human lymphoblastoid cell lines, that CLEC16A is localized with an endoplasmic reticulum marker, and that KD of CLEC16A did not affect T-cell co-stimulation.</s><s>Recent murine data indicated that Clec16a is localized at endosomal membrane and forms a protein complex with Nrdp1, which is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Clec16a may thus regulate mitophagy through the Nrdp1/Parkin pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Adding to this existing knowledge, the present study has shown that CLEC16A may also be involved in B-cell function.</s><s>Although we could not reproduce the complete CVID phenotype in Clec16a KD B cells, findings strongly suggest that CLEC16A, in combination with other dysregulated pathways, may contribute to the B-cell dysfunction observed in these patients.</s></p><p><s>The relationship of CLEC16A expression and its genotype status has been investigated.</s><s>We have previously shown that CLEC16A is differentially expressed based on the risk allele, reported with the protective minor allele showing a higher expression than the risk allele <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , and a similar observation was made in the present study.</s><s>The correlation is further complicated by the existence of three CLEC16A isoforms, which could lead to isoform-specific correlations.</s><s>Examining the relative expression level of the long isoforms versus short isoform, a correlation with multiple sclerosis-associated SNP rs12708716 genotype status has been observed in human thymic tissues.</s><s>However, no association was found when it was examined in whole blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the effect of SNP genotype status on CLEC16A expression could be both isoform specific and cell-type/tissue-type dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, the sample size in each study is small and may be underpowered to detect a correlation.</s><s>At this stage, although CLEC16A is a promising candidate gene to function in the pathogenesis of CVID as demonstrated in our study, we could not fully exclude the possibility that CVID-associated SNPs in CLEC16A introns are tagging other proximal genes, although we find this is unlikely.</s></p><p><s>The identification of CLEC16A as a significant CVID risk locus reflects the notion that most genetic risk loci for immune-related diseases are pleiotropic.</s><s>Significant overlap of risk loci between autoimmune disease and immune deficiency has also been found for those of rheumatoid arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>The biological explanation of the overlap probably differs from locus to locus, but the overall interpretation is that of an imperfect relationship between clinical disease phenotyping and genetically determined pathophysiology.</s><s>Importantly, the finding of CLEC16A associations in both autoimmunity, allergy and, as given by the present study, an immunodeficiency condition, characterized by impaired immune response to certain capsulated bacteria, is particularly interesting, as the mechanisms leading to persistent immune activation and autoimmunity in CVID is not clear.</s><s>Our findings may suggest that altered function of CLEC16A could be 'the missing link' between immunodeficiency and immune action in CVID.</s><s>The current identification of novel, highly robust CLEC16A associations in CVID raises conceptually novel opportunities for exploring mechanisms underlying the autoimmune comorbidity and the chronic inflammation observed in CVID.</s></p><p><s>Hypothetically, the CLEC16A-associated aspects of adult immunodeficiency states may reveal novel concepts for the basis of immune activation in autoimmunity.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have identified the first genome-wide significant non-HLA CVID risk locus at CLEC16A in the largest genetic study performed in this disease to date.</s><s>CLEC16A has previously been linked to autoimmune disorders and the fact that Clec16a-deficient mice showed decreased number of B cells suggests that CLEC16A could represent a link between autoimmunity and immunodeficiency in CVID.</s></p></div>
