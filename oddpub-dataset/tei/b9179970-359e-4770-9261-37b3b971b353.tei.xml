<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Tungiasis is highly prevalent in low-and middle-income countries but remains often under diagnosed and untreated eventually leading to chronic sequels.</s><s>The objective of the study was to assess whether tungiasis-associated inflammation can be detected and quantified by high-resolution infrared thermography (HRIT) and whether after removal of the parasite inflammation resolves rapidly.</s></p><p><s>Methods: Patients with tungiasis were identified through active case finding.</s><s>Clinical examination, staging, and thermal imaging as well as conventional photography were performed.</s><s>In exemplary cases, the embedded sandfly was extracted and regression of inflammation was assessed by thermal imaging 4 days after extraction.</s></p><p><s>Results: The median perilesional temperature was significantly higher than the median temperature of the affected foot (rho = 0.480, p = 0.003).</s><s>Median perilesional temperature measured by high-resolution infrared thermography was positively associated with the degree of pain (rho = 0.395, p &lt; 0.017) and semi-quantitative scores for acute (rho = 0.380, p &lt; 0.022) and chronic (rho = 0.337, p &lt; 0.044) clinical pathology.</s><s>Four days after surgical extraction, inflammation and hyperthermia of the affected area regressed significantly (rho = 0.457, p = 0.005).</s><s>In single cases, when clinical examination was difficult, lesions were identified through HRIT.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Tungiasis is a parasitic skin disease caused by the penetration of female sand fleas (Tunga penetrans) into the human epidermis.</s><s>The burrowed flea increases its volume by a factor of 2000 within 2 weeks after penetration, eventually reaching a diameter of up to 10 mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Burrowed sand fleas exercise pressure on the surrounding tissue triggering an acute inflammatory response characterized by intense erythema, oedema, pain and pruritus <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Usually, adults try to extract penetrated sand fleas by means of needles, pins or thorns, which result, almost constantly, in bacterial superinfections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Clostridia <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>These infections have the potential to cause severe complications such as cellulitis and tetanus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or could lead to mobility restrictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Tungiasis belongs to the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and it is endemic in many countries in Central and South America, in the Caribbean and in Sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Classical presentations of penetrated sand fleas are easily diagnosed, but hyperkeratinisation and other changes of the skin frequently occurring in patients who experience repeated infection may hamper the diagnosis, particularly when the skin is heavily pigmented.</s></p><p><s>High-resolution infrared thermography (HRIT) is a digital imaging technique in which a camera detects radiation of the electromagnetic spectrum within wavelengths from 900 to 14,000 nm.</s><s>The emitted thermal radiation of a surface is measured and translated into a matrix of temperature measurements of this surface.</s><s>Hence, HRIT can provide a visual map of skin temperatures in real time.</s><s>Since inflammation of the skin or deeper tissue layers cause an increase in skin temperature, HRIT can allow the immediate assessment of inflammation of the skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aims of this exploratory study were to map and quantify the spread of tungiasis-associated inflammation and to evaluate the resolution of inflammation after removal of the parasite.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study area and study population</head><p><s>The study was performed in Tanambe II and Tanambaovao, two resource-poor rural communities, located in Andasibe county, Moramanga district, 160 km east of Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.</s></p><p><s>The inhabitants of the two villages are subsistence farmers and cultivate rice, cassava and fruits on small fields adjacent to the villages.</s><s>Some villagers earn an extra wage as tourist guides in the nearby national park.</s><s>Most houses are constructed from wood; some are placed on stilts.</s><s>Chicken, pigs, dogs and cats are kept in the compound.</s><s>Closed shoes are only worn irregularly and considered uncomfortable compared to walking barefoot or in flip flops.</s><s>Besides, many families cannot afford shoes for all household members.</s><s>A detailed description of the study area and population has been published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Tungiasis is highly prevalent in the region.</s><s>At the time of this study, the prevalence of tungiasis in the study area in the general population was 72.9%, 95%CI (68.6-77.2) (M.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Thielecke, unpublished observation, 2011)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and protocol</head><p><s>This qualitative, descriptive study was part of a comprehensive project on the epidemiology and prevention of tungiasis at the community level.</s><s>For the HRIT substudy, patients were identified with active case finding by MT, AS and VR.</s><s>Clinical examination and thermal imaging were carried out by MT and AS at the patient home in a shadowy place on the compound.</s><s>Only when patients preferred privacy, thermal imaging was performed inside the house.</s><s>Clinical examination and HRIT were limited to the feet.</s><s>A total of 36 consecutive patients were identified and included in the study.</s><s>To keep the workload manageable, a maximum of eight patients a day was recruited.</s><s>The number of patients was limited by the availability of the HRIT camera.</s></p><p><s>Embedded sand fleas were removed surgically under sterile conditions by an experienced local health professional after baseline examination in nine patients.</s><s>The wounds were appropriately dressed, and the patients were advised to wear closed shoes.</s><s>HRIT was repeated immediately after the removal of the parasite as well as 4 days later.</s><s>In all the other 27 patients, the embedded sand fleas were removed in the same manner at the end of the recruitment period.</s></p><p><s>Both feet were carefully examined with the aid of a dermatoscope allowing a tenfold magnification (Heine, Delta 20 T, Herrsching, Germany).</s><s>Lesions were counted and classified according to the Fortaleza Classification described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Lesions in stadiums I-IIIb where considered as viable lesions, while lesions in stadiums IV-V where considered as non-viable lesions as described by Eisele et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Crater-like sores caused by manipulation with sharp instruments as well as suppurated lesions were documented.</s><s>The localization of each lesion was noted on a visual scheme.</s><s>Clinical pathology was assessed adapting the previously validated severity scores for acute and chronic tungiasis, but the assessment was limited to the index lesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>This resulted in a modified severity score for acute tungiasis (mSSAT) and a modified severity score for chronic tungiasis (mSSCT).</s><s>The mSSAT ranges from 0 to 7 and the mSSCT 0 to 6 points.</s><s>Intensity of pain and pruritus were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) varying from 0 to 4 points.</s><s>Lesions were photographed with a digital camera equipped with a macro-objective (Canon EOS 450 D, Tokyo, Japan) and a macro-flash.</s><s>The macro-objective had a magnification ratio of 1:1.</s></p><p><s>HRIT was performed with a FLIR T 660bx camera which uses a 320 × 240 pixels uncooled microbolometer focal plane array to detect infrared rays (FLIR Instruments, Wilsonville, OR, USA).</s><s>The camera has the following optical image specifications: the lens has a field of view (FOV) of 25°× 19°with a minus focus distance of 0.4 m and a spatial resolution in field of view (IFOV) of 1.36 mRad.</s><s>The camera also allows taking digital photos with a separate objective next to the infrared lens.</s><s>However, the resolution of digital pictures is rather low; therefore, this tool was not used for study purposes.</s></p><p><s>Thermographic images were taken following a standard protocol developed by HF, MT and AS.</s><s>When possible, the foot was placed on a neutral ground.</s><s>The temperature and relative air humidity were noted.</s><s>The camera was held at about 1 m from the foot, then the lesion of interest was focused and the thermographic picture was taken.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>The temperature matrix generated by the infrared camera was transformed using the program FLIR Quick Report (version 2.1 SP2, FLIR Instruments, 2009, Wilsonville, OR, USA).</s><s>Before analysis, air temperature and relative humidity were entered.</s><s>The program then adjusted the thermographic map with regard to temperature and humidity.</s></p><p><s>The program allows four visual transformations of the thermographic matrix.</s><s>The so-called iron transformation was used as standard colour rendering.</s><s>In a second step, the so-called rainbow transformation was used enabling the rendering of lower temperatures in blue-coloured spectrum.</s><s>In a third step, an inverted grey transformation was generated facilitating the comparison of hot versus cool areas of the skin.</s></p><p><s>To assess changes of skin temperatures after extraction of embedded sand flea, we developed an algorithm to compensate for differences in skin radiation, which were not related to inflammation.</s><s>In the thermal image, a standardized area around the lesion was selected using FLIR Quick Report.</s><s>Temperature pixels of the selected area were transferred to an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel, Albuquerque, New Mexico 2010, USA), and the median of all pixels of the area was calculated.</s><s>When several lesions on the same foot were present, an index area was selected.</s><s>The isotherm area above the arithmetic mean was marked in green.</s><s>The pre-and post-treatment isotherm areas above this cut-off were compared.</s><s>The thermal image of the whole foot was processed in the same way.</s></p><p><s>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS for Windows (version 16, SPSS INC, Chicago, IL, USA).</s><s>Since data were not distributed normally, we used median, interquartile range (IQR) and range to describe central tendency and data dispersion, respectively.</s><s>Spearman rank correlation coefficient, the chi-squared test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used when appropriate.</s></p></div>

target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, we found a significant association of perilesional skin temperature not only with the score assessing signs of acute inflammation but also with the score assessing chronic inflammation.</s><s>This could indicate a role for HRIT in assessing chronic skin disease such as cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease for which reproducible methods to measure the outcome of therapeutic interventions is urgently needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, accuracy of thermal imaging was proven when lesions were hidden and missed by the clinical examination.</s><s>Although we did not analyse it systematically, our findings suggest that perilesional temperatures were higher when lesions occurred in clusters as compared to isolated lesions.</s></p><p><s>Early stage lesions (stages I and II of the Fortaleza classification) which are generally more difficult to detect because of limited morphological changes were easily identified by thermal imaging.</s><s>This corroborates the previous findings wherein thermal imaging was used to detect early inflammation.</s><s>In horses, HRIT could help identifying spot flexor tendon injuries before there were any visible signs of lameness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, in patients with recurrent herpes labialis, a marked increase in temperature was observed prior to the formation of vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A common symptom in tungiasis is a boring pain at the site of the lesion which develops early after penetration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>If the pain affects particularly sensitive areas, such as the nail wall or the heel of the foot, it is incapacitating and keeps children from attending school and adults from going to work or to perform their household chores <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Our data show that localized intensity of pain is reflected by high temperature of the lesion.</s><s>These findings are similar to observations in herpes zoster where the thermal patterns correlated significantly with the intensity of pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>HRIT provided a good discrimination between patients with scleroderma spectrum disorders and those with primary Raynaud's phenomenon, both autoimmune diseases which present different pain characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Thermal imaging before and after adequate surgical extraction of embedded sand fleas showed a temperature increase of the perilesional area immediately after the extraction of the embedded parasite [Figs.</s><s>6c, e and Figs.</s><s>7c, e, g and h] and then a perilesional temperature decrease [Figs.</s><s>6f, h and Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">7f, i</ref>].</s><s>It is plausible that the surgical extraction per se causes immediate inflammation, which is reflected by a higher temperature in HRIT.</s><s>When inflammation had resolved after a couple of days, perilesional skin temperature was low compared to the median temperature of the intact foot.</s><s>Our hypothesis is that after regression of inflammation, microcirculation in the skin is downregulated causing, thereby, a slight hypothermia.</s><s>Interestingly, serial thermal imaging in a mild case of herpes zoster at the thorax showed a correlation between decreasing temperature, decreasing pain and macroscopic healing of the lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>In a patient with leprosy, Vargas et al. proved that HRIT is more sensitive than clinical examination in monitoring the regression of hypothermic skin areas during treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we think that HRIT is a useful tool to study tungiasis-associated inflammation and to monitor regression of clinical pathology after treatment.</s><s>Additionally, HRIT may be of value for the detection of early or atypical lesions that are difficult to detect by the naked eye.</s></p><p><s>Our findings suggest that high-resolution HRIT can be applied to inflammatory skin diseases, irrespective whether the infectious agents are ectoparasites, protozoa, helminths, bacteria, viruses or fungi.</s><s>Tropical diseases in which thermal imaging may provide useful information with regard to early detection, monitoring or disease progression and/or treatment are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>.</s><s>While most mentioned skin diseases probably go along with hyperthermia, in leprosy and buruli ulcer, a decrease in temperature is to be expected.</s></p><p><s>Only recently, thermography cameras have become available at affordable prices.</s><s>Therefore, handhold portable IR cameras or smartphones equipped with IR objectives could be used for thermal imaging in resource-poor settings even at the population level.</s><s>Possibly, this method will facilitate measurements of disease burden for NTDs where this has been difficult so far.</s></p><p><s>Obviously, the study had several limitations.</s><s>First, it is important to acknowledge that an isothermal temperature scale rendering will not be accurate unless all of the highlighted areas have the same emissivity and the ambient temperature is the same for all artefacts within the area.</s><s>Second, the interpretation of thermographic images is difficult in patients with very extended and multiple lesions.</s><s>Third, the interpretation of thermographic images is rather subjective <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Forth, since the study was conducted in a resource-poor rural community in Madagascar, it was not possible to standardize thermal measurements as it could have been done in a hospital setting in an industrialized country.</s><s>This impairs the quantitative comparison of the degree of inflammation between different patients before and after treatment.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
