<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Demographic data, baseline characteristics, intraoperative parameters and postoperative outcome data were not different between the study populations, except that the patients in the PPA group were significantly younger than in the ODM group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>SVI before start of liver resection was SVI ODM 49 (37; 53) ml m -2 in the ODM and SVI PCA 48 (41; 56) ml m -2 in the PPA group, respectively (p = 0.40).</s><s>In the ODM and PPA group the patients were haemodynamically stable with respect to arterial blood pressure and heart rate but in the PPA group there was an increase of norepinephrine levels up to the end of liver incision and then a decline again (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to the ODM group, the central venous pressure dropped in the PPA group during the liver incision (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Patients of the ODM group had no decline of stroke volume index during the course of surgery measured by the oesophageal Doppler (p = 0.12) and the LiDCOrapid (p = 0.57).</s><s>This was in contrast to the patients of the PPA group.</s><s>They showed a decline of stroke volume index measured by the ODM over the time of surgery (p&lt;0.01) while these haemodynamic changes were not reflected by the measurements of stroke volume index by the LiDCOrapid (p = 0.556) (Fig 3 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">, 3A1 and 3A2</ref>).</s><s>A drop of the corrected flow time (FTc) measured by the ODM (p&lt;0.01), a higher stroke volume variability before start of liver incision, an increase of pulse pressure variability (p&lt;0.01) in the PPA group and higher systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) displayed by the ODM further suggest a haemodynamic deterioration throughout the course of surgery in the PPA group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, Fig 3B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">and 3C</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, in the PPA group stroke volume index, cardiac index and FTc measured by the ODM showed a decrease and stroke volume variability (SVV) and PPV measured by the LiDCOrapid reflected an increase over the time course of the operation that was not found in the ODM group.</s><s>Interestingly, these haemodynamic differences were not accompanied by differences of the cumulative administration of the crystalloid or colloid solutions or diuresis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A total of 148 fluid challenges in 21 patients (ODM and PPA group) were performed resulting in 296 paired measurements.</s><s>In regard to absolute values Bland-Altman analysis revealed a constant bias and variance.</s><s>ODM and PPA showed a poor agreement resulting in a percentage  Although there were no differences in intraoperatively administered opioids, ketanest or clonidine patients in the PPA group had higher pain levels even though receiving more morphine equivalents during the postoperative course (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The intraoperative use of the goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm adapted for liver surgery was feasible and showed high tolerance of the assigned anaesthetists.</s><s>There were no surgical complaints of increased bleeding during liver incision and the anaesthetists followed the algorithm with a very high compliance.</s><s>The administration of a positive inotrope or nitroglycerine as a safety criterion was not indicated by the study personnel or the assigned anaesthetist.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The main findings of the study are that (1) within a goal-directed algorithm adapted for liver surgery the ODM guided group was haemodynamically stable while within the PPA guided group advanced haemodynamic parameters suggested a potential hypovolaemia which was not indicated by the course of stroke volume measured by the PPA but reflected by simultaneous measurements of the ODM, (2) that the PPA guided group had significantly higher postoperative pain levels than the ODM group even though receiving more morphine equivalents during the postoperative course; and (3) that agreement and trending between ODM and PPA was poor.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge this is the first study comparing the effect of the use of different haemodynamic monitors on the intraoperative haemodynamic parameters within a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm in a blinded fashion.</s><s>The primary endpoint of the study was stroke volume before liver incision.</s><s>In regard to univariate analysis SVI at this time point was not significantly different between the ODM and the PPA group.</s><s>However, regarding the time point after sealing the liver resection area SVI measured by the ODM was significantly higher in the ODM than in the PPA group but the measurements by the PPA were not different.</s><s>We found the same results for the analysis of the time course during the entire course of the operation with a significant decline of SVI measured by the ODM in the PPA group but no differences in SVI measured by the PPA in the PPA group.</s><s>As both monitors do not represent a gold standard for haemodynamic measurements it is not suitable to state solely by the measurements of stroke volume that patients were stable or unstable.</s><s>However, further haemodynamic indicators showed that the patients in the PPA group although being younger had a significant deterioration of norepinephrine levels, a substantial drop of the FTc and an increase of SVV and PPV during the course of surgery suggesting a potential hypovolaemia.</s><s>These indicators combined with the discrepancies in SVI measurements might indicate that haemodynamic optimization by the LiDCOrapid is not comparable to haemodynamic treatment based on the oesophageal Doppler.</s><s>This fact could also be clarified by the clinical poor agreement and trending between ODM and PPA.</s><s>The poor agreement of the absolute values of stroke volume index between ODM and PPA is consistent with the results of a recent study evaluating these monitors in colorectal surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The poor trending of stroke volume index between the ODM and the PPA seems to be the substantial issue as therapeutic decisions are based on the ability to test and confirm patient's haemodynamic response to appropriately guide haemodynamic therapy and it supports the fact that haemodynamic therapy based on these monitors might be different but as none of the monitors represents a gold standard for haemodynamic measurements conclusions of this fact have to be drawn very carefully.</s></p><p><s>A low CVP of 2 to 5 or below 5mmHg as a target for haemodynamic management in liver surgery reduces intraoperative blood losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6]</ref> and improves postoperative outcome with a reduced hospital length of stay <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Due to a higher CVP at the beginning of the operation there was a significant reduction of the CVP in the PPA and not in the ODM group.</s><s>However, in both groups the targeted low CVP was effectively reached by using the algorithm.</s><s>In the ODM group a low CVP was reached without a drop of SVI, CI or FTc or an increase in norepinephrine levels, SVV or PPV.</s><s>This indicates that the haemodynamic management within a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm guided by oesophageal Doppler was able to reduce  backflow in the liver while maintaining circulatory flow.</s><s>As this study was not planned to evaluate the clinical impact of the use of advanced haemodynamic monitors further studies are needed to direct this question.</s></p><p><s>The differences in postoperative pain levels and administrated morphine equivalents could be an indicator of clinical association of an intraoperative deteriorated haemodynamic status and the postoperative consequence of increased pain.</s><s>In acute bleeding in healthy volunteers <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[11]</ref> a drop of stroke volume was associated with a deteriorated gastric microperfusion and in chronic heart failure one of the first areas with a reduced perfusion was the upper gastrointestinal (GI) region <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[32]</ref>.</s><s>That is why we think that a reduced blood flow in the surgical area of the study patients could be a contributor to the development of postoperative pain in upper GI surgery.</s><s>This is the first study to our knowledge to show the association of a deviated haemodynamic status to postoperative pain and we think this should lead to the point that in future haemodynamic studies pain should be a secondary outcome measure.</s><s>However, we cannot exclude that the differences in pain are associated to the differences of ages between study groups, but to our knowledge there is no study published showing this relationship.</s></p><p><s>The adapted goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm to guide volume and catecholamine administration in liver surgery was feasible and showed a high clinical tolerance.</s><s>After primary preload optimization the algorithm could prevent substantial haemodynamic instability reflected by the current used open monitor up to the sealing of the liver resection area without any complaints of increased bleeding tendency during liver incision.</s><s>To our knowledge this is the first algorithm to guide volume and catecholamine administration by advanced haemodynamic monitoring measuring circulatory flow in liver surgery.</s></p><p><s>Goal-directed optimization by the oesophageal Doppler and the LiDCOrapid showed differences in intraoperative cardiovascular parameters, postoperative pain and opioid administration.</s><s>Again, it is not possible to state that one monitor might be wrong and another is better but it can be stated out of our data that haemodynamic optimization with the oesophageal Doppler is not the same as with the LiDCOrapid and vice versa.</s><s>As the recommendations to perform goal-directed haemodynamic therapy is grossly based on studies using the oesophageal Doppler it seems important to us that based on the results presented here the use of the LiDCOrapid for goal-directed haemodynamic therapy has to be confirmed in further prospective randomised controlled studies to confirm its beneficial clinical impact during anaesthesia.</s></p></div>
