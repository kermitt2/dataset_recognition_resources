<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Identification of deceased patients</head><p><s>Since the medical claims data do not contain information on the death of a patient, an identification method was developed and validated using an existing German insurance sample.</s><s>This insurance sample is a subsample of 20% of insured persons based on medical claims data and is representative for all insured persons in SHI in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>It is validated and crosschecked by the insurance companies.</s></p><p><s>Within the insurance sample, the physicians' treatments and diagnoses are recorded as well as the insured person's death <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, this sample provides the basic information to verify the validity of our methods to identify deceased persons in the larger medical claims database.</s></p><p><s>To identify the death of a patient in the data used for analysis, the following steps were taken: patients with MI in 2011 were identified and two observation periods were defined.</s><s>The first period is the ambulant post-MI-period in 2011, beginning with the quarter of the MI diagnosis.</s><s>The second period is a control-period in which the survival status of each patient is assessed, covering the years 2012-2013.</s><s>If a patient did not have at least one ambulatory care contact to any ambulatory physician during the two year control-period, it was assumed that he or she was deceased during the post-MI-period in 2011.</s></p><p><s>This procedure was then applied to the data of the insurance sample.</s><s>After applying of the methodology with a two year control period to check whether the patient is still alive, followed by matching it with the actual deceased variable which is available in the insurance sample, 99.3% of the patients were classified correctly and 0.7% of the patients were classified incorrectly.</s></p><p><s>This validated deceased-methodology was subsequently applied to the patients with MI in the full data set.</s><s>Since the medical claims data are available until June 2015, both observation periods were extended.</s><s>The post-MI-period was extended up to six quarters (18 months), beginning with the quarter of the MI diagnosis.</s><s>This observation period has the same length for every patient to be able to compare them with each other.</s><s>The ensuing control period to check the survival of patients was extended to a minimum of two years, ending for all patients with the end of June 2015.</s></p><p><s>To classify a patient as 'survived' in the 18-month 'ambulant post-MI-period', the patient had to have at least one ambulatory visit to any SHI physician during the individual subsequent two up to three year control period.</s><s>If this was not the case, the patient was marked as 'deceased'.</s><s>Based on the described results of the validation of this method within the insurance sample as well as the extended observation period, it is assumed that the misclassification bias is below 1%.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>The main strength of our study is that it entails the entire population insured in SHI, covering around 90% of the entire German population.</s><s>It is the largest and most comprehensive analysis of ambulatory care after diagnosis of MI in Germany so far.</s><s>The long term monitoring of diseases and their treatment are major advantages of these data <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to what is known from US-American studies, we showed that combined GP and specialist cardiology care was associated with a survival benefit in areas with a high, as well as areas with a low density of specialist care providers.</s><s>This finding, together with the equal care principle for all SH-insured persons in Germany, offers more robust support for the importance of specialist cardiology care after MI.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations apply.</s><s>Medical claims data are secondary data, generated for billing purpose by SHI physicians.</s><s>The claims data do not contain additional information about the patient besides general characteristics, diagnoses and treatments as described by the billing codes.</s><s>Therefore, we were unable to control for factors like social status, education, occupation, treatment preferences, medication or severity of diagnoses, which could have further impact on the survival of a patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, the billing codes for cardiological services in our medical claims data differ for GP and cardiologist and also do not allow differentiating, what exact procedures were performed on the patient.</s><s>We were not able to identify the one or (more likely) the combination of reasons that cause the observed effect.</s></p><p><s>By means of propensity-score matching, we created a control group that was comparable to the patients with cardiology care with respect to influential variables.</s><s>Nearest-neighbor-matching complemented with a Caliper is particularly suited to create controls with minimal Patient matching was performed separately for each type of district and gender.</s><s>The Relative Risk (RR) and 95% CI refer to the difference between the patient groups regarding the frequency of patients marked as deceased.</s><s>CI, confidence intervals;
