<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Assembly and maturation of synapses at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) depend on trans-synaptic neurexin/neuroligin signalling, which is promoted by the scaffolding protein Syd-1 binding to neurexin.</s><s>Here we report that the scaffold protein spinophilin binds to the C-terminal portion of neurexin and is needed to limit neurexin/ neuroligin signalling by acting antagonistic to Syd-1.</s><s>Loss of presynaptic spinophilin results in the formation of excess, but atypically small active zones.</s><s>Neuroligin-1/neurexin-1/Syd-1 levels are increased at spinophilin mutant NMJs, and removal of single copies of the neurexin-1, Syd-1 or neuroligin-1 genes suppresses the spinophilin-active zone phenotype.</s><s>Evoked transmission is strongly reduced at spinophilin terminals, owing to a severely reduced release probability at individual active zones.</s><s>We conclude that presynaptic spinophilin fine-tunes neurexin/neuroligin signalling to control active zone number and functionality, thereby optimizing them for action potential-induced exocytosis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C</head><p><s>hemical synapses release synaptic vesicles (SVs) at specialized presynaptic membranes, so-called active zones (AZs), which are characterized by electron-dense structures, reflecting the presence of extended molecular protein scaffolds.</s><s>These AZ scaffolds confer stability and facilitate SV release <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, at individual AZs, scaffold size is found to scale with the propensity to engage in action potential-evoked release <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> .</s><s>An evolutionarily conserved set of large multi-domain proteins operating as major building blocks for these scaffolds has been identified over the last years: Syd-2/Liprin-a, RIM, RIMbinding-protein (RBP) and ELKS family proteins (of which the the Drosophila homologue is called Bruchpilot (BRP)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> .</s><s>However, how presynaptic scaffold assembly and maturation are controlled and coupled spatiotemporally to the postsynaptic assembly of neurotransmitter receptors remains largely unknown, although trans-synaptic signalling via Neurexin-1 (Nrx-1)-Neuroligin-1 (Nlg1) adhesion molecules is a strong candidate for a conserved 'master module' in this context, based on Nrx-Nlg signalling promoting synaptogenesis in vitro, synapses of rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , Caenorhabditis elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</s><s>With respect to scaffolding proteins, Syd-1 was found to promote synapse assembly in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , Drosophila 17 and rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In Drosophila, the Syd-1-PDZ domain binds the Nrx-1 C terminus and couples pre-with postsynaptic maturation at nascent synapses of glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in Drosophila larvae.</s><s>Syd-1 cooperates with Nrx-1/Nlg1 to stabilize newly formed AZ scaffolds, allowing them to overcome a 'threshold' for synapse formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Additional factors tuning scaffold assembly, however, remain to be identified.</s><s>We show here that the conserved scaffold protein spinophilin (Spn) is able to fine-tune Nrx-1 function by binding the Nrx-1 C terminus with micromolar affinity via its PDZ domain.</s><s>In the absence of presynaptic Spn, 'excessive seeding' of new AZs occurred over the entire NMJ due to elevated Nrx-1/Nlg1 signalling.</s><s>Apart from structural changes, we show that Spn plays an important role in neurotransmission since it is essential to establish proper SV release probability, resulting in a changed ratio of spontaneous versus evoked release at Spn NMJ terminals.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Presynaptic Spn restricts the AZ number.</s><s>Glutamatergic NMJs of Drosophila larvae continuously expand to meet the requirements of the growing muscle fibres by adding new release sites (or synapses) to their structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>These synapses are characterized by a single presynaptic AZ opposed by a single postsynaptic density (PSD) composed of glutamate receptors (GluRs).</s><s>AZ formation is initiated by both Syd-1 and Liprin-a clusters and finalized by the incorporation of BRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Here we used the Drosophila NMJ model system to search for factors restricting the number of BRP scaffolds.</s><s>To this end, a set of proteins and their known binding partners, which we previously detected in immunoprecipitation experiments against BRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> , were suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) restricted to presynaptic motor neurons.</s><s>RNAi-induced presynaptic knockdown of the only Drosophila homologue of the Neurabin/Spn family caused an increase of AZ numbers at the NMJ (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1a</ref>;

an assembly threshold.</s><s>In addition, Nlg1mediated postsynaptic assembly is also affected (not shown).</s><s>In the absence of Spn (lower panel), Nrx-1 is less mobile and more efficiently recruited into complexes by Syd-1, resulting in the formation of excessive presynaptic AZ scaffolds.</s></p><p><s>nrx-1 gene copy effectively suppressed the Spn AZ phenotype, indicates an important
