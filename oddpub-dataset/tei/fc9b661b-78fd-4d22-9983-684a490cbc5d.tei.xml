<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>This is the first study showing that circulating autoantibodies against VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and PlGF can be found in pregnant women.</s><s>We found that women with PE have lower levels of them as compared to controls using a novel immunoassay.</s><s>All the three studied autoantibodies are members of the VEGF-family, involved in angiogenesis and vascular health.</s><s>Dysregulation of sVEGFR-1 and PlGF has previously been shown to be associated with prediction and diagnosis of especially early-onset PE, and is believed to play a part in the pathogenesis of some, but not all cases of PE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25)</ref> Especially at term, the PE group is less often identified with dysregulated maternal circulating PlGF or sVEGFR-1 as compared to controls.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(25)</ref> Our finding that normotensive women with similar sFlt/PlGF-ratios as the PE group prior to delivery having higher levels of AA-VEGFA than in the PE group, may be of important clinical and pathophysiological importance that needs testing in larger and longitudinal (prospective) pregnancy studies.</s><s>As a low maternal sFlt/PlGF-ratio has shown in a large prospective study of pregnant women with "suspected PE" to predict the absence of PE, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> it is interesting to see that higher levels of AA-VEGFA is associated with the absence of PE in the group with overlapping sFlt/PlGF-ratios.</s></p><p><s>The roles of the studied autoantibodies in PE and vasculatory inflammatory diseases are as yet unknown, precluding any definite conclusions about their effect.</s><s>We speculate they might to some extent explain why some women with adverse levels of sVEGFR-1 and PlGF do not develop preeclampsia.</s><s>It has been postulated that increased levels of sVEGFR-1 cause increased binding of circulating free PlGF and free VEGFA to sVEGFR-1, thereby impairing their normal binding to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 and hence reduced vascular relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(28)</ref> Although other explanations may indeed be possible, we speculate that the autoantibodies against VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 may alleviate this process by stimulating the VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 in the absence of PlGF and VEGFA and hence stall the development of preeclampsia.</s></p><p><s>In general, a role of IgG autoantibodies is little explored in pregnancy.</s><s>A 40 year old study by Taylor et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(29)</ref> showed that maternal serum from pregnant women prevented trophoblasts lysis by maternal lymphocytes whereas removing IgG from the serum significantly reduced this in vitro effect.</s><s>Asymmetric IgG antibodies are antibodies that bind to their corresponding antigen without eliciting immunologic responses.</s><s>Borel et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(30)</ref> found that the level of asymmetric IgG antibodies was doubled in sera from pregnant women compared to nonpregnant controls, and that the level was even higher in the placenta.</s><s>It might therefore be speculated that the circulating autoantibodies we found suppressed in PE are of an inhibitory or asymmetric type, beneficial for the development of an uncomplicated pregnancy.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, Braicu et al found that autoantibodies against VEGFA and VEGFR-1 were decreased in epithelial ovarian cancer and that lower levels of these autoantibodies were associated with a poorer prognosis, yielding support for a protective effect of these autoantibodies.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(31)</ref> We found no significant differences between early-and and late-onset PE (defined as delivery either before or after GW 34/ GW 37) or between clinically severe and non-severe PE.</s><s>Earlyand late-onset PE have been suggested to represent the end-point of different pathways into the PE syndrome, but with significant overlap and with placenta as an important common mediator <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25)</ref>.</s><s>The studied autoantibodies may be markers of placental dysfunction or syncytiotrophoblast stress in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(25)</ref>.</s><s>All except one of the cases with SGA offspring did belong to the PE group, hence the effect of placental dysfunction in more general terms could not be differentiated.</s><s>Longitudinal studies are needed to establish when in pregnancy the autoantibodies we have studied are altered, as compared to normal pregnancy.</s><s>Also prepregnancy and postpartum studies are needed to establish whether the dysregulated autoantibody situation in preeclampsia is present prior to pregnancy, and sustained after delivery, without the presence of placenta.</s></p><p><s>Although fetal growth restriction and placentation problems are more common features of early than late onset PE, all forms of PE are likely to be placentally mediated <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in relation to the classical two-stage placental model of preeclampsia development, with placental dysfunction as the first important pathophysiological step <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(25)</ref>, all proteins targeted by the novel autoantibodies studied in this project are placentally expressed.</s><s>Their potential pathophysiological role in relation to placental dysfunction may extend beyond preeclampsia, and could be tested in relation to preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and placental abruption.</s></p><p><s>We found decreased levels of autoantibodies (VEGFR1-AAs and PlGF-AAs) in non-obese women, also after adjusting for BMI, whilst there were no significant findings in obese women in the adjusted analysis.</s><s>Obesity is associated with lower antibody levels in general and is a risk factor of PE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">33)</ref> Hence, we speculate that these autoantibodies might be protective for PE in lean women and that the relative impairment of autoantibody production in obese women may play a part in the PE pathophysiology.</s><s>Due to lack of power, we could not explore this hypothesis further, A bulk of studies shows an association between PE and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35)</ref> All the protein targets for the autoantibodies we have studied in the present paper have been shown to be implicated in the development of atherosclerotic CVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">37)</ref>, consistent with common pathways for CVD and PE and also PE as an independent risk factor for CVD.</s><s>However, the autoantibodies in our study have at present not been evaluated in relation to CVD risk.</s><s>We therefore suggest exploring a role for these autoantibodies as potential biomarkers for identifying young women at highest risk for longterm CVD after pregnancy complications such as PE.</s></p><p><s>The strength of this study lies within the uniform procedure of blood sampling, storing, analyzation and a well described clinical cohort in addition to novel assays for of IgG autoantibodies against the VEGF protein families.</s><s>The AA assays have been validated as documented in the Supplemental Tables and previously tested on on nonpregnant healthy subjects.</s><s>Further research on circulating autoantibodies against VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and PlGF is warranted.</s><s>Isolation of the autoantibodies and further characterization by other techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance to confirm antigen-antibody interaction are important next steps.</s><s>This is a first pilot study publishing the presence of these autoantibodies in humans, and therefore also the first report from pregnancy in general and from preeclampsia in particular.</s><s>Also, our women with PE had developed PE at the time of blood-sampling.</s><s>Hence, a possible predictive ability of AA-VEGF has to be further evaluated in prospective studies.</s></p><p><s>The lack of biological understanding regarding the functions of these autoantibodies and a limited study size suggests that further studies are needed to obtain further pathophysiological understanding for their role in pregnancy and placental dysfunction in general and in PE in particular.</s><s>Although our study found suppressed levels of autoantibodies in preeclamptic pregnancies, their exact action on their target proteins remains unknown.</s><s>The limited knowledge about the functions of the protein targets of the autoantibodies we have investigated suggests complex interactions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first published study exploring the presence of circulating autoantibodies to the family of VEGF proteins, whether under physiological or pathological conditions.</s><s>The studied autoantibodies do all bind to members of the VEGF-family which are implicated in angiogenesis and vascular health.</s><s>Dysregulation of sVEGFR-1 and PlGF has previously been shown to be associated with the development of PE.</s><s>We found significant lower autoantibody levels in preeclamptic as compared to uncomplicated pregnancies.</s><s>Furthermore, elevated levels of autoantibodies against VEGFR-1, and VEGFA were found in controls compared to women with preeclampsia, when the levels of sVEGFR-1, PlGF and sVEGFR-1/PlGF-ratios were of similar ranges.</s><s>This may suggest that autoantibodies against the VEGF family play a protective role against pregnancy hypertensive disorders and placental dysfunction.</s><s>Our data indicate that other pathways disrupting normal angiogenesis and vascular health in pregnancy may also be involved, including other members of the VEGF family.</s><s>A potential role for these autoantibodies as biomarkers for PE and as biomarkers for the augmented risk for longterm cardiovascular disease after PE and other placentally related pregnancy complications needs also to be explored.    </s><s>.60-287.91)</s><s>55.24 (12.36-194.05)</s><s>0.381 Parous 41 67.34 (18.32-287.91)</s><s>43.20 (14.64-287.91)</s><s>0.051</s></p><note type="other">FIGURE LEGENDS:</note><p><s>Non-obese 46 61.68 (10.60-287.91)</s><s>48.44 (12.36-194.05)</s><s>0.230 Obese 42 67.09 (18</s><s>.32-255.10)</s><s>49.71 (13.56-287.91)   </s><s>.29-313.91)</s><s>34.82 (8.33-340.93)</s><s>&lt;0.001</s></p><p><s>Nulliparous 47 59.14 (8.29-126.30)</s><s>33.69 (8.33-115.38)</s><s>0.023 Parous 41 87.17 (26.50-313.91)</s><s>49.98 (21.96-340.93)</s><s>0.036</s></p><p><s>Non-obese 46 78.56 (8.29-313.91)</s><s>33.40 (8.33-115.38)</s><s>0.007 Obese 42 87.17 (26</s><s>.50-126.30)</s><s>43.98 (11.98-340.93)</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3</head><label>123</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
