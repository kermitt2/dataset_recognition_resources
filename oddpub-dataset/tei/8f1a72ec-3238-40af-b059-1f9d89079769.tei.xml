<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clonal evolution</head><p><s>We sequenced the genomes of 23 triplets of lymphocyte, primary tumor and relapse neuroblastoma (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Tumors were of all stages and with variable outcome, with the only eligibility criteria being the availability of high-quality DNA from the triplet samples.</s><s>There was a roughly equal distribution of cases between low-, intermediate-and high-risk groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>The median time from diagnosis to relapse was 11.3 months (range 1-90).</s><s>Twenty-one of the 23 subjects in this study received chemotherapy prior to relapse, and eight also received radiation therapy, according to internationally accepted treatment protocols (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This means that all patients received similar chemotherapy regimens, with high-risk patients additionally receiving radiation therapy and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.</s><s>No patient on this study received targeted inhibitors to any oncogenic pathway between the time of diagnosis and relapse.</s><s>The majority of low-risk cases received chemotherapy due to site and/or size of the primary tumor.</s></p><p><s>Sequence data were analyzed for somatic mutations resulting in amino acid changes or located within splice site regions within 3 bp of an exon, as well as for focal structural aberrations of regions containing five genes or less (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2,3 and 4</ref>).</s><s>There was a median of 14 more mutations in the relapsed samples compared to the samples at diagnosis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>On average, 28% of the mutations detected in the primary tumor were also detected at relapse, showing that primary and relapsed tumors were of common descent.</s><s>To gain more insight into the clonal architecture, we estimated the cancer cell fraction (CCF) of all somatic mutations using a customized reimplementation of a previously described Bayesian approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , which infers CCF from mutant allele fractions determined by sequencing and accounts for contamination and locusspecific copy number.</s><s>This analysis yielded a median CCF of 61% for mutations detected in the primary but lost in the relapse tumor, compared to a median CCF of 90% for primary tumor mutations shared with the relapse (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), a pattern that is consistent with subclonal outgrowth of the relapsed tumor.</s><s>Furthermore, we estimated a median CCF of 83% for all relapse tumor mutations compared to a median CCF of 75% for all primary tumor mutations, indicating clonal enrichment of a subset of mutations at relapse (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Comparison of genes affected by smaller structural events and chromosomal copy number alterations of primary and paired relapse tumors showed similar results with a subset of aberrations being shared, but many being detected only in the primary or relapse tumor (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C, 1D</ref>, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrichment of mutations predicted to activate the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway</head><p><s>Unbiased pathway analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> using WGS data from the relapse samples on a per patient basis identified a strong enrichment (p=6.1×10</s><s><ref type="bibr">−7 )</ref> for mutations in genes associated with RAS-MAPK signaling (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s><s>We next filtered the identified genes against the Cancer Gene Census <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and subsequently focused on hotspot regions by selecting COSMIC annotated mutations, to identify events that are well annotated to activate this pathway.</s><s>Fifteen out of 23 relapse samples contained somatic mutations that meet these criteria.</s><s>In addition, three relapse samples showed structural alterations involving these RAS-MAPK pathway genes, so aberrations in this pathway were detected in 18/23 relapse samples (78%) and all were consistent with pathway activation (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Eleven RAS-MAPK activating mutations that were present in primary tumors were all preserved in the corresponding relapses.</s><s>Seven mutations were not detectable in the primary tumor at the sequencing depth achieved and therefore ultra-deep sequencing was employed to determine if these mutations were present in fractions under the WGS detection limit.</s><s>The ALK mutation in N607 was found in the primary tumor, while the other mutations were undetectable (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>Structural aberrations were assayed using PCR based methods.</s><s>Only the ALK rearrangement in N790 was shown to be present at low frequency in the primary tumor (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>).</s><s>ALK aberrations occurred in 10 relapse tumors and were also detected by WGS in 7 of the corresponding primary tumors.</s><s>All detected SNVs have been proven to constitutively activate this receptor tyrosine kinase known to activate RAS-MAPK signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, one relapse showed a de novo amplification giving rise to a PPM1G-ALK fusion gene, that activates the RAS-MAPK pathway when expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Two tumors showed relapse specific inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, either through homozygous deletion or heterozygous deletion combined with a splice site mutation (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>NF1 inactivation has been reported in neuroblastoma and confers activation of RAS-MAPK signaling and resistance to retinoic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>One pair of primary and relapse tumors showed a heterozygous mutation in PTPN11.</s><s>Mutations in PTPN11 activate RAS-MAPK signaling and the identified A72T mutation has been reported in leukemia and neuroblastoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>One relapse tumor showed a tandem duplication in the BRAF gene that was not detected in the primary tumor.</s><s>This rearrangement leads to expression of a BRAF transcript that encodes an elongated protein with two kinase domains.</s><s>Expression of this tandem duplication in the BRAF gene in a neuroblastoma cell line induced activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, the somatic mutations detected in this case series shown to activate the RAS-MAPK pathway were mutually exclusive, with no case showing two somatic events known to hyperactivate this growth promoting pathway.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that RAS-MAPK activating mutations exhibit relapse-specific enrichment due to treatment.</s><s>We therefore performed a clonality analysis, comparing CCF estimates for RAS-MAPK mutations between paired primary (CCF p ) and relapse (CCF r ) tumors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>RAS-MAPK mutations were almost universally present within major subclonal populations at relapse, as indicated by CCF r &gt; 0.5 with probability &gt;90% under the posterior distribution for 14 out of 15 relapse tumors.</s><s>In 7 out of 15 tumor pairs there was strong evidence of relapse-specific enrichment of RAS-MAPK mutations-including mutations in ALK (4 pairs), HRAS (1 pair), KRAS (1 pair), and NF1 (1 pair)based on a criterion of CCF r &gt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Recent studies utilizing NGS methodologies indicate firstly a low mutation rate in primary neuroblastoma tumors, with a mean of 15

target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</s><s>Since relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma tumors often demonstrate significant chemotherapy resistance and are typically lethal, we hypothesized that mutational spectrum of relapsed disease would be different than the primary tumors, and may mediate therapy resistance.</s></p><p><s>In this study we characterized the genomes of 23 relapsed neuroblastomas and compared each to the genome of the corresponding primary tumor.</s><s>We show that the relapsed tumors generally contain more mutations and structural aberrations, and that clonal selection takes place between the primary tumor and the relapse.</s><s>We found that 18/23 relapse tumors harbored mutations predicted to hyperactivate the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, and that cell lines containing similar mutations show sensitivity to MEK inhibition, a downstream node in the canonical growth-promoting pathway.</s><s>These results provide a strong rationale for recommending a biopsy and genomic characterization of relapsed neuroblastoma tumors and for prioritizing clinical testing of MEK inhibition strategies in the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma.</s></p><p><s>Due to the sensitivity and specificity of modern imaging modalities, the diagnosis of neuroblastoma relapse rarely requires a tumor biopsy.</s><s>In addition, until recently there has been no realistic potential for therapeutic benefit based on biopsy results, and therefore very few relapse neuroblastoma samples are available for study.</s><s>Here we collected high quality material from 23 relapse-tumor pairs across the spectrum of neuroblastoma phenotypes including those assigned to high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>The only inclusion criterion for this study was the availability of matched samples, but some cases may have been biopsied due to an unusual clinical course.</s><s>Indeed there is a fairly high number of intermediate and low risk tumors which normally do not show frequent relapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>However, the frequency of RAS-MAPK mutations did not differ between groups, so it is unlikely that the overrepresentation analysis is influenced by this bias.</s></p><p><s>The high frequency of RAS-MAPK pathway mutations at diagnosis in this cohort was unexpected, since such high frequencies were not reported in WGS series of primary tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</s><s>It is possible that the presence of these lesions in a diagnostic sample is a biomarker of a more aggressive clinical course and higher likelihood of relapse.</s><s>These findings need to be validated in a prospective patient cohort.</s></p><p><s>We detected several recurrent structural aberrations at the time of relapse.</s><s>Partial loss of chromosome 6q was observed in 5 relapses and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A in 3 relapses.</s><s>Both events are infrequent in primary neuroblastoma and present interesting targets for further research.</s><s>Furthermore, neuroblastoma associated aberrations like loss of 1p and 11q were observed in the relapse and not in the primary tumor, indicating that these events might not be tumor initiating but rather are crucial steps in neuroblastoma tumor evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Events affecting RAS-MAPK signaling were detected in 18/23 relapse samples.</s><s>In 4 cases we identified structural variants, highlighting the benefit of WGS for detecting the full spectrum of genetic alterations.</s><s>In 7/18 cases these mutations were observed only in the relapse tumor, which indicates that analysis on primary tumor samples is not sufficient to guide the choice of treatment for neuroblastoma relapses.</s><s>These findings are in line with the de novo occurrence of ALK mutations reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The observation that several RAS-MAPK mutations were found in the relapse but not in the corresponding primary tumors, favors a model where subclones with secondary driver mutations expand over time, possibly under the selective pressure of chemotherapy, as was recently described for chronic lymphocytic leukemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Whether these mutations occurred between the primary and the relapse tumor, were present in levels below detection limits, or were undetectable due to spatial heterogeneity of the primary tumor remains to be determined.</s></p><p><s>It has been firmly established that mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway can occur as resistance mechanisms against targeted kinase inhibitors 26 , however, no targeted inhibitors were used in the treatment of our patient cohort.</s><s>Mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway may also be associated with resistance to conventional cytotoxic therapies in neuroblastoma, but more research is needed to establish the molecular basis behind this.</s></p><p><s>The ALK gene was mutated in 10 relapse samples and it is known that the most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma activate the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>The results of our xenograft therapeutic studies indicate that single agent treatment with a MEK inhibitor might not be effective in ALK mutated tumors.</s><s>However, the observation that in vitro the ALK mutated cell lines consistently showed some sensitivity to MEK inhibition suggests that activated RAS-MAPK does play a role in ALK mutated neuroblastoma and warrants further investigation on the use of MEK inhibitors in combination therapies.</s><s>ALK inhibitors have proven to be effective in the treatment of ALK mutated tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , but some mutations are associated with resistance to currently available ALK inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Therefore combined MEK and ALK inhibition may improve response in tumors containing such mutations.</s><s>Combination with targeted inhibitors against other pathways that are activated in ALK mutated neuroblastoma, such as PI3K and mTOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , may also improve therapeutic efficacy.</s></p><p><s>We also detect mutations in NF1, BRAF, PTPN11, FGFR1 and the three RAS genes, and all lesions in the RAS-MAPK pathway were mutually exclusive.</s><s>Cell lines with RAS-MAPK mutations show moderate to high sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, and treatment with the inhibitor Binimetinib of SK-N-AS xenografts, which contain an NRAS mutation, as well as NBL-S, which has a loss of NF1, results in a significant therapeutic efficacy.</s><s>This suggests that MEK inhibition may have clinical benefit in treatment of neuroblastoma relapses containing RAS-MAPK mutations.</s></p><p><s>Our study provides strong rationale for performing biopsies and genomic characterization of relapsed neuroblastomas, with the prospect of direct patient benefit.</s><s>We show that RAS-MAPK pathway mutations occur frequently in relapsed neuroblastoma, and propose matching such pathway lesions to novel therapies such as MEK inhibition.</s><s>A prospective clinical trial consisting of biopsy and NGS-based selection of targeted therapy will be required to determine the clinical implication of this newly defined genetic landscape of relapsed neuroblastoma.</s></p></div>
