<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and Findings</head><p><s>We investigated the effect of supplementation with ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and a micronutrient powder (MNP) on the incidence of malnutrition in ill children presenting at an outpatient clinic in Goronyo during February to September 2012.</s><s>A three-armed, partially-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted in children diagnosed as having malaria, diarrhoea, or lower respiratory tract infection.</s><s>Children aged 6 to 59 mo were randomised to one of three arms: one sachet/d of RUTF; two sachets/d of micronutrients or no supplement (control) for 14 d for each illness over 6 mo.</s><s>The primary outcome was the incidence of first negative nutritional outcome (NNO) during the 6 mo follow-up.</s><s>NNO was a study-specific measure used to indicate occurrence of malnutrition; it was defined as low</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The global burden of malnutrition among children is staggering; with an estimated 8% prevalence (51.5 million children) of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and 2.9% prevalence (18.7 million children) of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Malnourished children have a higher risk of mortality, ranging from a 3-fold increased risk for the moderately malnourished to a nearly 10-fold increase for the severely malnourished <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>However, the cause of malnutrition in most tropical countries is multi-factorial, involving not only inadequate nutrition and caring practices, but also recurrent infections.</s><s>It has long been known that malnourished children have a higher risk on severe outcome of morbidity and that ill children have a higher risk on malnutrition.</s><s>In 1968, almost half a century ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggested a synergistic relation between malnutrition and infection, but not much was known about its mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the following decades, insights developed that infections aggravate malnutrition by decreasing appetite, inducing catabolism, and increasing both the demand for nutrients as well as nutrient losses.</s><s>When increased needs are not compensated by increased consumption, weight loss during an infection is frequent <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Failure to return to normal nutritional status after an illness increases a child's susceptibility to further infections, perpetuating a cycle towards further reduced nutritional state <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It has been shown that diarrhea and malaria are associated with substantial weight loss and that supplementation could promote recovery between infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>From the nineties onwards, it was increasingly recognized that protein-energy malnutrition has a depressing effect on the immune system and that even mild degrees of malnutrition begin to adversely affect immunity, which consequently increases morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Research advanced on the mechanisms of the immune system in general, and of the role of individual micronutrient deficiencies-such as zinc and vitamin A-in decreased immunity in particular.</s><s>Further research focused on how supplementation with these individual micronutrients could prevent illness, reduce the severity of illness, or decrease morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As many micronutrients play a role in the immune system, growth and recovery, a deficiency in a few nutrients or even in one could be the limiting factor.</s><s>Therefore, nutritional fortification with multiple micronutrients were tested, but the impact on diarrhea and other morbidity were mixed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, multi-micronutrients have some effect on linear growth, but the effect was small <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Reports on the effects of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) on morbidity and weight gain also gave mixed results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, there are indications that LNS supplementation decreases mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The question whether supplementation with micronutrients or multi-micronutrients, with or without food, is effective in preventing malnutrition and further morbidity in ill children is unanswered, as the results of research are mixed and foremost lacking.</s><s>Above all, current studies targeted the general population of children, not specifically ill children.</s></p><p><s>Until now, it is the general expectation that good nutrition during convalescence of an illness improves recovery.</s><s>Therefore, WHO recommends that caretakers give their children daily additional nutritious food for 14 days after the onset of illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In resource-poor settings-the typical context of the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) programs-this recommendation is likely to be ineffective, as caregivers often lack the healthy ingredients and other resources to implement it.</s><s>A more effective strategy to reduce diseaserelated malnutrition in resource-poor areas may be to provide ill children with nutritional supplements at the point of care alongside medical treatment.</s></p><p><s>MSF treated 292,221 severely malnourished children and 71,471 moderately malnourished children in 2012.</s><s>It is imperative that MSF explores appropriate ways to prevent malnutrition, of which an effective strategy might be providing nutritional supplementation alongside medical treatment to ill children.</s></p><p><s>MSF piloted the potential of supplementation to ill children in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</s><s>This research showed that children with malaria gained weight faster during the period of supplementation when given 14 d of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), although this difference was not seen at 4 wk follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Because of these promising results, MSF investigated whether supplementation of a nutritional supplement-either a lipid-based fortified food or micronutrients-to children with diarrhea, malaria, and/or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) during their 2-wk convalescence period is effective in reducing the incidence of malnutrition over a period of 6 mo.</s><s>Two trials, one in Nigeria and one in Uganda, were conducted.</s><s>Here we report on the trial that took place in Nigeria; the trial in Uganda is published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods Approval</head><p><s>The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov</s><s>number NCT01154803.</s><s>The full protocol and the statistical analysis plan (SAP) can be accessed in the supporting information files (S1 Text and S2 Text).</s><s>The study received approval, collaboration and cooperation of Nigerian health authorities (Sokoto State Director Primary Health care at 24 August 2010 and Goronyo LGA and the Sokoto State Research Ethical Committee at 24 September 2010).</s><s>Approval was also obtained from the MSF Ethics Review Board <ref type="bibr">(23 December 2010)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setting</head><p><s>The study was implemented in the town of Goronyo, Sokoto State, in the northwest of Nigeria.</s><s>Because of a high frequency of severe malnutrition among children and its contribution to high morbidity, this site was chosen to investigate whether nutritional supplementation to ill children would significantly decrease the incidence of malnutrition.</s></p><p><s>Goronyo is rural and primarily dependent on agriculture (including irrigated) and animal husbandry for its livelihood, with income also derived from trade and small-scale manufacturing.</s><s>A variety of crops are grown, including millet, sorghum, rice, maize, groundnuts, cowpeas, okra, onions, spinach, and tomatoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The climate has one rainy season from May to October, which is also the traditional hunger season and malaria season, while from January to June it can be very hot.</s></p><p><s>A qualitative study in the Goronyo Local Government Area in 2009 concluded that malnutrition is linked to inappropriate infant and young child feeding practices; substandard levels of or access to health services, water supply, hygiene, and sanitation; inadequate (health) education; and a poor understanding of the importance of food quality, quantity, and diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>A high proportion of children under 5 y were not consuming protein-rich and nutrient-dense foods on a daily basis; for example, only 35% of diets included milk and dairy products, and only 8% of diets included fish and poultry <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Surveys conducted in March 2009 and March 2010 (during the hot, dry season) showed a global acute malnutrition (GAM) prevalence of 14.8% and 11.5%, respectively, and a SAM prevalence of 4.9% and 2.6%, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>A study by Save the Children Fund concluded that a chronic existence of malnutrition is linked to a marginal economic situation and under-resourced health care system combined with gender inequality and poor weaning practices in northern Nigeria <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The 2009 survey found that 51% of the children reported having an illness (including fever, diarrhoea, and cough) at some time during the previous 14 d, suggesting a high burden of disease that likely exacerbates an already precarious problem of malnutrition.</s><s>The prevalence of malnutrition among those children who reported an illness in the previous 14 days was 23%, compared with 7% among nonsick children (p &lt; 0.001), illustrating the relation between malnutrition and disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Médecins Sans Frontières-Operational Centre Amsterdam (MSF-OCA) has provided medical support to Sokoto State Hospital Goronyo since 2008.</s><s>The activities included outpatient clinics and hospital-based medical care for children, including a therapeutic feeding programme with intensive inpatient and four outpatient facilities.</s><s>In 2012, MSF treated 9,505 children for severe malnutrition in Goronyo.</s><s>MSF withdrew from Goronyo in February 2013 because of security issues.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Objectives and Endpoints</head><p><s>The aim of this three-armed, partially-blinded, randomised controlled trial was to determine the effectiveness of 14 days of nutritional supplementation with a RUTF or a micronutrient powder (MNP) given to children 6-59 mo of age and diagnosed with and treated for malaria, diarrhoea, and/or LRTI in reducing the incidence of acute malnutrition compared with a control group during a follow-up of 6 mo.</s><s>Given the complexity of malnutrition in the trial's study population, a study-specific primary endpoint event was compiled.</s><s>This is called negative nutritional outcome (NNO) and, depending on nutritional status on enrolment, was defined as moderate and/or severe acute malnutrition (MAM and/or SAM).</s><s>It was defined as: weight-forheight z-score &lt;−2, MUAC &lt;115 mm, or nutritional oedema, whichever occurred first for non-malnourished children; and weight-for-height z-score &lt;−3, MUAC &lt;115 mm, nutritional oedema (SAM), or weight loss &gt;10% from baseline for moderately malnourished children (weight-for-height z-score &lt;−2).</s><s>Secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometric indicators, morbidity, and mortality.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population and Randomisation</head><p><s>Children aged 6 to 59 mo diagnosed with one or more of the three study diseases (malaria, diarrhoea, LRTI) were included in the study when living within approximately 60 min walking distance from the clinic and intending to remain in the area for the duration of the 6-mo follow-up.</s><s>Children who met the criteria for SAM (defined as weight-for-height z-score &lt;−3, MUAC &lt;115 mm, or nutritional oedema), were exclusively breastfed, had a severe disease (for example, severe malaria, severe pneumonia, or severe anaemia), had a sibling enrolled in the study, or were offspring of staff of the study were excluded.</s></p><p><s>Children were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three intervention groups.</s><s>During the 6-mo follow-up, children in the RUTF and MNP groups received nutritional supplements for 14 d whenever they were diagnosed with at least one of the three study diseases, with a maximum of 14 d of supplementation in any 28-d period.</s><s>The MNP contained only micronutrients, according to the United Nations (UN) formulation <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The MNP MixMe (DSM Ltd, Switzerland) was mainly used, but owing to a production problem MixMe was replaced by the "vitamin and mineral powder" (Piramal Healthcare Ltd, India) for several follow-up visits from 1 October 2012 to the end of the study.</s></p><p><s>Children in the MNP group received two doses per d to ensure a micronutrient composition comparable to one sachet of RUTF (Plumpynut, Nutriset, France) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Caretakers were instructed to mix MNP in the meal (for example, porridge) just before consumption.</s><s>All groups (including the control group) received health education, including the message that following an illness, a child should eat one extra healthy meal per day for 2 wk.</s></p><p><s>The sample size was based on the assumption of a baseline/control group incidence rate of first NNO event of 0.20 within 6 mo.</s><s>A 30% reduction, considered a clinically and operationally relevant improvement, would result in a targeted incidence rate of 0.14 in 6 mo in each of the two treatment groups.</s><s>Using a Poisson regression model, 80% power at a 0.05 significance level, and an assumed dropout rate of approximately 10%, a sample size of 734 children was needed in each group (that is, 2,202 in total for all three groups).</s></p><p><s>Simple randomisation was based on a computer-generated randomisation list made by an expert independent of the study.</s><s>Participants entering the study received a study number, and only the staff member giving the supplement was able to connect the study number to the treatment group.</s><s>All other study staff (including clinicians diagnosing illnesses and deciding on giving an allocation) were blinded to allocation.</s><s>The statistician was unblinded after completion of the analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p><s>Patients were screened in the regular outpatient clinic on eligibility.</s><s>Potential participants were referred to the adjacent study clinic for further inclusion procedures.</s></p><p><s>Activities at inclusion included provision of information and obtaining written consent of caretakers and their husbands.</s><s>In case the caretaker was illiterate the consent form was read out loud and consent was given by thumbprint in the presence of a witness.</s><s>The enrolled participants were followed after the first 14 d and then monthly during 6 mo (24 wk).</s><s>If a child was ill, they were invited to come whenever they felt that was needed.</s><s>At every visit, the health and nutritional status of the participant was assessed.</s></p><p><s>Anthropometric measurements-weight, height, oedema, and MUAC-were taken at every visit to the study clinic.</s><s>Two types of electronic weighing scales were used to measure weight: SECA model 354, with a precision of 10-20 g, and SECA 869, a mother/baby scale with a precision of 100 g.</s><s>Length or height (change of measuring position at 85 cm of height) was measured using a precision height board (infant-child-adult measuring board ICAM, aluminium, precision 1 mm, Promes).</s><s>MUAC was measured using a standard MUAC tape (MSF, precision 2 mm).</s></p><p><s>Malaria was diagnosed by conducting a malaria rapid diagnostic test (Paracheck).</s><s>All newly enrolled participants were tested on enrollment; during the study, participants would get a malaria test upon indication (fever or history of fever), except during a malaria epidemic in 2012 when all participants were tested at every visit from 1 June onwards.</s><s>Diarrhoea was defined as three or more loose stools (bloody or nonbloody) in 24 h and was diagnosed by mothers' report.</s><s>LRTI was diagnosed by the following algorithm: children with cough or having difficulty breathing, an increased respiratory rate (for children aged 12-59 mo &gt;50 breaths/min and for 6-11 mo &gt;40 breaths/min), and absence of chest in-drawings were diagnosed as nonsevere LRTI; chest in-drawing was considered as a sign of severe LRTI, needing referral to the hospital.</s></p><p><s>All children received standard care and treatment according to current national protocols.</s><s>Uncomplicated malaria was treated for 3 d with artemether-lumefantrine (Lumartem, Cipla, India).</s><s>Acute watery diarrhoea was treated using oral rehydration therapy with low osmolarity oral rehydration salts and zinc according to WHO guidelines, regardless of the supplement received.</s><s>LRTI was treated with amoxicillin 80-100 mg/kg/d for 5 d.</s><s>The first treatment was given under medical supervision, and the use of and need for the drug were explained to the mother.</s></p><p><s>Participants presenting with other nonsevere diseases were treated in the study clinic according to the national protocol.</s><s>Participants with measles received 2 wk of RUTF, as this is considered standard of care for measles cases; these children were kept in the study, and normal rules were applied for allocation for a follow-up supplement.</s></p><p><s>At every visit, health education was provided.</s><s>This included advice on prevention and treatment of malaria and diarrhoea and the advice to give an ill child an extra nutritious meal for 14 d.</s></p><p><s>Home visitors supported the study by reminding the caretakers to come to the appointments, urging follow-up absentees to return, and reporting on deaths that occurred at home.</s><s>When a participant was found to have died, the caretaker was invited to the study clinic for an interview.</s><s>Otherwise, the family would be visited by a nurse for an interview.</s><s>Any death was immediately reported and reviewed by a national paediatrician, principal investigator, and medical director of MSF.</s></p><p><s>Compliance was measured by questionnaires, asking how many times and for how many days the participant consumed the supplement.</s><s>In addition, the caretaker was asked to return the full or empty sachets of each distribution.</s><s>Finally, after the study, three focus groups discussions were held with caretakers who had completed the trial to discuss the supplements and medication used, compliance, and any barriers regarding using the supplements.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p><s>The primary outcome (rates of first NNO) among the treatment groups was analysed by a Poisson regression model including the three intervention groups with contrasts for each twogroup comparison.</s><s>As there were three interventional groups to be compared, a hierarchical test procedure was used to account for multiplicity.</s><s>If a significant result (significance level 0.05 two-sided) was observed in the RUTF group compared with control, MNP was then compared with control; if this was also statistically significant at 0.05 two-sided, RUTF was subsequently compared with MNP in a noninferiority approach with a noninferiority margin of 2% (that is, allowing a slightly worse result in the MNP than in the RUTF group, statistically significant at 0.025 one-sided).</s><s>If no significant result was observed in the first or second step, all other comparisons were considered exploratory.</s></p><p><s>The incidence rate of malnutrition (NNO) is expressed in first event per 365 observation d (events/y) and is extrapolated from the study period of 168 d (24 wk).</s></p><p><s>Secondary outcomes were analysed using logistic regression or analysis of covariance with treatment group and baseline values as covariates.</s><s>In addition, adjustment for nutritional status at baseline (moderate malnourished or non-malnourished on enrollment) was applied.</s><s>A priori defined subgroups were analysed by including interaction terms in the main model.</s></p><p><s>Any participant attending the first and the last visit was counted as having completed the study.</s><s>A participant developing severe malnutrition was referred to the therapeutic feeding programme and withdrawn from the study; all data up to the moment of withdrawal was used.</s><s>When the participant was erroneously included or consent was withdrawn, the participant was withdrawn and the data was not used.</s><s>When a patient was admitted to the hospital, the hospital visit was monitored and (if necessary) supplementation was temporarily suspended, but the patient was not withdrawn from the study.</s><s>The primary outcome was also analysed for a per protocol population that excluded participants if they had abandoned the study, had a low compliance, or had measles (patients with measles were provided with RUTF for 2 wk regardless the supplementation arm)</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</head><p><s>The researchers randomly assigned 2,213 non-malnourished and moderately malnourished children who visited outpatient clinics in Goronyo with malaria, diarrhea or lower respiratory tract infection to be given RUTF or MNP by their caregivers for 14 d following each illness over a 6-mo period or to receive no supplement.</s><s>The primary trial outcome was the incidence of the first negative nutritional outcome (NNO) during follow-up (the proportion of the population experiencing NNO during follow-up).</s><s>NNO was defined as a weight-for-height z-score below −2 or −3 for non-malnourished and moderately malnourished children, respectively (this score compares a child's weight-for-height with that of a reference population; a z-score of −2 or less indicates acute malnutrition), a mid-upper arm circumference of less than 115 mm, or nutritional oedema (swelling caused by malnutrition).</s><s>The incidence rates of NNO were 0.522, 0.495, and 0.566 first events/y in the RUTF, MNP, and control groups, respectively.</s><s>The incidence rate ratio for RUTF versus control was 0.92, a nonsignificant reduction in the incidence of malnutrition (a nonsignificant change in an outcome could have occurred by chance).</s><s>Provision of MNP also did not significantly reduce the incidence of malnutrition.</s></p><p><s>What Do These Findings Mean?</s></p><p><s>These findings show that, among non-malnourished and moderately malnourished children living in Goronyo, Nigeria, provision of RUTF or MNP as part of routine primary medical care during convalescence following malaria, diarrhea, or a lower respiratory tract infection did not reduce the incidence of malnutrition.</s><s>Because RUTF is popular with caregivers and children, the lack of blinding in this trial (participants knew whether they were being given RUTF, MNP or no supplement) may limit the accuracy of these findings.</s><s>Moreover, these findings only apply to ill children and cannot be extrapolated to healthy children.</s><s>Notably, a companion trial undertaken by MSF in Kaabong, Uganda found that short-term supplementation with RUTF reduced the incidence of malnutrition following illness.</s><s>The researchers suggest that the lack of effect of nutritional supplementation in Goronyo may be because the duration and/or dose of supplementation was insufficient to mitigate the effects of high levels of illness and pre-existing malnutrition present in this setting.</s><s>Thus, they suggest, an integrated approach that combines the prevention and treatment of diseases with the treatment of moderate malnutrition might be necessary to break the illness-malnutrition cycle among children living in Goronyo and similar settings.</s></p></div>
