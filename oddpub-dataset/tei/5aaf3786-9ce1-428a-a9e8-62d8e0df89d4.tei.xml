<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>DNA methylation and cortisol stress reactivity.</s><s>Our workflow is listed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>After quality control, 385,882 DNA methylation loci were investigated for their association with cortisol stress reactivity (Supplementary Data 1 shows the results for the 22,425 loci with P values o0.05 in a linear regression model).</s><s>Since none of the CpG sites survived adjustment for multiple testing, we selected the three loci that stood out in the P-value distribution of the genome-wide cortisol stress reactivity analysis (for QQ plot see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; cg27512205 B ¼ À 1,162, P ¼ 5.8 Â 10 À 6 ; cg05608730 B ¼ À 935, P ¼ 6.0 Â 10 À 6 ; cg26179948 B ¼ À 1,009, P ¼ 8.0Â 10 À 6 in linear regression models) and were associated with childhood trauma (Po0.05 in linear regression models; Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>The Kit ligand (KITLG) locus showed the strongest association with cortisol stress reactivity (cg27512205 chr12: 88579621; B ¼ À 1,162, P ¼ 5.8 Â 10 À 6 , empirical P value ¼ 2 Â 10 À 6 , model fit: F(3,81) ¼ 15.28, P ¼ 5.8 Â 10 À 8 , R 2 ¼ 0.34 in a linear regression model).</s><s>This locus was also negatively associated with cortisol stress reactivity in two independent replication samples: a blood replication sample (N ¼ 45; B ¼ À 1,039, P ¼ 0.005, model fit: F(5,39) ¼ 5.6, P ¼ 0.0005, R 2 ¼ 0.35 in a linear regression model) and a cross-tissue replication sample that used mouth swaps to obtain buccal DNA (N ¼ 255; B ¼ À 104, P ¼ 0.004, model fit: F(3,251) ¼ 3.5, P ¼ 0.02, R 2 ¼ 0.03 in a linear regression model; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Visual inspection of cortisol stress reactivity measures pointed to five potential outliers in the discovery sample.</s><s>However, Cook's distance was lower than 1 in all analyses, suggesting that these observations did not affect the results (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Moreover, removal of these five potential outliers did not affect the association of cortisol stress reactivity with either childhood trauma (before removal: B ¼ À 14.6, P ¼ 0.007; after removal: B ¼ À 9.0, P ¼ 0.01 in a linear regression model) or KITLG methylation (before removal: B ¼ À 1,161, P ¼ 5.8 Â 10 À 6 ; after removal: B ¼ À 617, P ¼ 7.0 Â 10 À 4 in a linear regression model).</s><s>To quantify the chance of finding these P values in the three independent samples, we used Fisher's method to calculate the combined P value of the three samples, yielding an overall significance level of P ¼ 5.9 Â 10 À 8 for the association between cortisol stress reactivity and methylation at the KITLG locus.</s></p><p><s>Ethnicity and cortisol stress reactivity.</s><s>In light of the influence of current major depressive disorder (MDD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> and ethnicity on cortisol stress reactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , we examined the contribution of these factors to our results in the blood replication sample, which included non-Caucasian individuals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>In the blood replication sample, cortisol stress reactivity was significantly lower in the African-American than the Caucasian individuals (B ¼ À 300, P ¼ 0.02, model fit: F(4,40) ¼ 4.1, P ¼ 0.007, R 2 ¼ 0.22 in a linear regression model; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), though not related to current MDD (B ¼ À 19, P ¼ 0.89 in a linear regression model).</s><s>Therefore, we performed stratified analyses for ethnicity (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>;

Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, childhood trauma was significantly associated with blunted cortisol stress reactivity only in the Caucasian individuals (B ¼ À 7.9, P ¼ 0.003, model fit: F(3,13) ¼ 4.8, P ¼ 0.02, R 2 ¼ 0.42 in a linear regression model; Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) and increased methylation at the KITLG locus (B ¼ 0.002, P ¼ 0.04, model fit: F(8,8) ¼ 2.3, R 2 ¼ 0.39 in a linear regression model).</s><s>Inclusion of all ethnicities (N ¼ 45) rendered the relation between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity nonsignificant (B ¼ À 3.7, P ¼ 0.09 in a linear regression model), as well as the association of childhood trauma with KITLG methylation (B ¼ 0.001, P ¼ 0.17 in a linear regression model).</s></p><p><s>On the basis of these findings in the blood replication sample, we examined the influence of ethnicity in the cross-tissue replication sample with a sensitivity analysis.</s><s>The association between cortisol stress reactivity and methylation at the cg27512205 locus did not change after inclusion of non-Caucasian individuals and addition of ethnicity as a covariate (N ¼ 267;

total effect ¼ À 7.9, Po0.001; proportion mediated ¼ 0.22, P ¼ 0.31 in the mediation model).</s><s>Moreover, mediation by the KITLG locus could not be established in the complete replication sample (N ¼ 45;

age of specific trauma Â childhood trauma interaction B ¼ 1.3, P ¼ 0.18 in a linear regression model).</s><s>Similarly, the association between KITLG DNA methylation and childhood trauma was not influenced by the age of childhood trauma (age of general trauma Â First we performed a genome-wide analysis of the association between cortisol stress reactivity and DNA methylation in the discovery sample (N ¼ 85).</s><s>On the basis of the P value distribution, we sought replication of the top three loci in two independent samples (N ¼ 45/N ¼ 255) and replicated the negative association between the top KITLG locus and cortisol stress reactivity.</s><s>Then we investigated the influence of childhood trauma on KITLG methylation and cortisol stress reactivity in the discovery and blood replication sample.</s><s>On finding an association for childhood trauma with KITLG methylation and cortisol stress reactivity in the discovery sample and Caucasian of the blood replication sample, we examined whether the KITLG locus is a mediator for the blunted cortisol stress response after childhood trauma exposure.</s><s>Blood-brain correlation of the KITLG locus.</s><s>Blood cg27512205 methylation levels were positively correlated to cg27512205 methylation levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC;

this supports a biologically relevant and functional signal.</s><s>H3K27ac is typically found at active regulatory DNA, such as enhancer and promoter regions, and is associated with a more open chromatin structure indicative of gene transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Interestingly, the cg27512205 CpG is the only KITLG probe located both in the H3K27ac-enriched region and on the shore of a CpG island.</s><s>As CpG island shores are frequently linked to DNA methylation differences that affect gene transcription and expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , the co-occurrence of these two epigenetic signatures suggests that methylation differences at this CpG location could alter gene regulatory DNA near KITLG.</s><s>Interestingly, young animals exposed to early life stress altered  histone modifications at the KITLG promoter, specifically an increase in H3K9ac and a decrease of the repressive H3K9me; this change is associated with increased hippocampal KITLG expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Another potential insight into the biological mechanisms related to KITLG methylation comes from our co-expression network analyses showing that KITLG is part of a gene network enriched for genes regulated by miRNAs 449 (miR449), 23A/23B (miR23A/miR23B) and 9 (miR9).</s><s>Notably, in rodents two of these miRNAs were previously linked to stress system functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Specifically, miR449 is involved in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor in the anterior pituitary and HPA-axis activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Also, miR9 is upregulated in the frontal cortex of mice in response to acute stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><note type="other">Discovery Replication KITLG methylation</note><p><s>The fact that the KITLG locus was significantly related to cortisol stress reactivity in three independent samples is noteworthy considering the substantial differences in study characteristics between these samples.</s><s>The blood replication sample was smaller, ethnically diverse and included individuals selected for either low or high levels of childhood trauma.</s><s>In addition, cortisol was measured in blood and, even though differences in cortisol stress reactivity can be detected in both blood and saliva <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , this may have contributed to the difference in cortisol values between the discovery and blood replication sample.</s><s>The cross-tissue replication sample measured methylation in DNA extracted from buccal cells in relatively young participants (15-18 years) and used a public speaking task without an arithmetic stressor.</s><s>Despite these differences, the KITLG locus was in all cases related to cortisol stress reactivity, which supports the robustness of the observation.</s><s>This is further supported by the fact that a significant association between cortisol stress reactivity and KITLG methylation was observed in buccal and blood DNA.</s><s>Some recommend buccal samples for population epigenetic studies, as they contain more hypomethylated DNA regions, which tend to cluster around disease associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> ; others, however, argue that demographic factors may be better reflected in blood DNA methylation patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Blood and buccal cells are peripheral tissues and do not necessarily reflect changes in DNA methylation in the central nervous system.</s><s>However, there are several reasons why KITLG methylation in peripheral tissues can be informative for the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cortisol stress reactivity.</s><s>First, cortisol is released into the periphery by the pituitary and is known to affect multiple tissue types.</s><s>Second, DNA methylation co-expression network analyses with the module containing the KITLG probe (red module) demonstrated that this module was associated with cortisol stress reactivity in both tissue types, suggesting that a broader methylation network around KITLG is biologically relevant for stress reactivity.</s><s>Previous reports on a variety of traits such as age <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> also indicate that methylation co-expression networks are stable indicators for epigenetic regulation across tissue types.</s><s>Third, HPA-axis genes are abundantly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Peripheral changes in methylation may therefore at least partially be a proxy of epigenetic processes in the brain.</s><s>Indeed, previous studies have shown that childhood trauma-related changes in methylation obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were significantly enriched for central nervous system pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>From the four brain areas that we examined, significant correlations with blood methylation were found in the PFC and the STG, which are biologically relevant brain regions for stress.</s><s>Thus, a wealth of literature points to the PFC as a pivotal regulator of the stress response (for review see ref. 36); in agreement, altered cortisol stress responses have been found after lesions in the PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>Regarding the STG: a recent meta-analysis supported a link of this area to stress susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>In light of the opposing blood-brain correlations, it may be hypothesized that the STG and PFC have opposing roles in the regulation of cortisol stress reactivity, but this cannot be inferred from the present study and warrants further research.</s></p><p><s>It is particularly interesting that epigenetic regulation of the stress response was found to be related to childhood trauma.</s><s>In the discovery sample, increased levels of childhood trauma were significantly related to blunted cortisol stress reactivity and higher methylation at the KITLG locus (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>In the blood replication sample, a similar result was only obtained in Caucasian individuals.</s><s>In the complete blood replication sample, this association was (just) not significant, suggesting that ethnic diversity influences analyses on the relationship between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity.</s><s>This may be the result of overall lower cortisol stress reactivity in Afro-American individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Unlike the discovery sample, there was no evidence that KITLG methylation is a mediator of the association between childhood trauma and cortisol stress reactivity in either the entire (N ¼ 45) or Caucasian-only (N ¼ 17) replication sample.</s><s>Overall non-replication of the mediation analysis may be due to a more heterogeneous ethnicity, smaller sample sizebelow the recommended N ¼ 50 (ref.</s><s>39)-and unfavourable distribution of childhood trauma due to the inclusion of individuals based on either low or high levels of childhood trauma (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The relationship between childhood trauma and a blunted cortisol response in the present study is in concordance with some but not all of the published literature (16 studies; Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For example, in the discovery sample and in Caucasian individuals from the replication sample, the explained variance of cortisol stress reactivity by childhood trauma was 34 and 26%, respectively.</s><s>This is comparable to the 30% explained variance in the study of Carpenter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> who also included healthy individuals without a psychiatric diagnosis.</s><s>Previous studies have pointed to specific periods during which individuals are particularly sensitive to trauma exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s></p><p><s>However, in the blood replication sample, we did not find any indications that our KITLG results were related to age of onset of childhood trauma.</s><s>Moreover, in the discovery sample, cortisol stress reactivity and KITLG methylation were not significantly related to traumatic experiences in adult life, suggesting that early life is a more sensitive period for the persistent impact of trauma on HPA-axis activity.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study shows that altered stress reactivity following childhood trauma in humans is related to altered DNA methylation levels at the KITLG locus.</s><s>Identification of such epigenetic marks may help to identify inter-individual differences in susceptibility to traumatic stress in early life and elucidate the neurobiological pathways underlying its long-lasting detrimental effects.</s></p></div>
