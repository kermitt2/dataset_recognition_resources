follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid hormones (THs) have been implicated to play an important role in testicular, and more particular in Leydig and Sertoli cell development <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gao et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The relation between THs and testis development has mostly been studied by neonatal, transient administration of the TH 3,3 ′

reported that under PTU-induced hypothyroid conditions, adult-type Leydig cell progenitor formation was arrested in rats up to 21 days after birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Mendis-Handagama et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Following cessation of the hypothyroid condition at the age of 26 days, developing Leydig progenitor cells start to proliferate massively <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hardy et al., 1996)</ref>, leading to an ∼70% increase in the adult-type Leydig cell population in adulthood as compared to the euthyroid controls <ref type="bibr">(Cooke et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hardy et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s>The increased testis weights in adulthood after neonatal PTU treatment are explained by an augmented daily sperm production due to an increased number of Sertoli cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(van Haaster et al., 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(van Haaster et al., , 1993;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hess et al.,

a certain number of germ cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Petersen and Soder, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Normally Sertoli cells divide only during a relatively brief phase of testicular development,

Haaster et al., 1992)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Indications that effects of THs on testicular development are at least partially mediated by thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRA1) come from studies in Tra1 knockout mice showing a testicular phenotype that has similarities to PTU-treated mice, while the phenotype of Trb1 knockout mice is not different from wild type mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Holsberger et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Mice with a Sertoli cell specific dominant-negative expression of Tra1 display enhanced Sertoli cell proliferation and increased testis weight in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fumel et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The combination of Leydig cell and Sertoli cell dominant-negative Tra1 expression did not affect steroidogenic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fumel et al., 2015)</ref>, confirming that Tra1 is the functional TR in Sertoli cells, but not in Leydig cells.</s></p><p><s>Another method to induce hypothyroidism is by feeding rats a diet low in iodide to deplete endogenous iodine storage alone or in combination with sodium perchlorate to additionally block thyroidal iodide uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Crissman et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rijntjes et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The advantage of low iodide diets is that the hypothyroid condition can already be induced during fetal life and continued into adulthood, and that perchlorate, unlike PTU, does not interfere directly with the deiodinases, which locally (in-) activate THs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kuiper et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Adult-type Leydig cells in rats on a low iodide diet do differentiate, though this developmental process is delayed and prolonged in comparison to euthyroid control animals.</s><s>Quite surprisingly, dietary-induced chronic hypothyroidism does not lead to an absolute increase in testis size in adulthood to the same extend, as is the case in the PTU studies <ref type="bibr">(Cooke and Meisami, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Crissman et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rijntjes et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The aim of the present study is therefore to elucidate whether these contradicting effects of hypothyroidism are due to the way the hypothyroid conditions are induced (low iodide plus perchlorate vs. PTU) or the length of the intervention (transient vs. chronic).</s><s>These data will further extend our understanding of the role of TH in testicular development.</s><s>This is relevant as overt hypothyroidism occurs in 0.3-0.5% of pregnancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(De Groot et al., 2012)</ref> and may influence testicular development in boys after birth.</s></p><p><s>In the underlying investigation, the effects of transient dietaryinduced perinatal and PTU-induced neonatal hypothyroidism on gonadal development are studied by restoring the euthyroid status of the rats at several critical time-points in testicular development.</s><s>A continuously euthyroid and a continuously hypothyroid group are included as reference groups.</s><s>The development of the testis, with specific emphasis on Leydig and Sertoli cell development, is analyzed, and related to the endocrine condition of the rats (as depicted by the measurement of plasma TSH, T 3 , thyroxine (T 4 ), FSH, LH, and testosterone concentrations).</s><s>We hypothesize that the timing of the switch from a hypothyroid to a euthyroid status is essential for the impact of normalization of TH concentrations on somatic cell development in the testis.</s><s>Based on previous observations we assume that when this normalization of TH concentrations takes place just prior to puberty, it may induce an instant increase in proliferation of the developing Sertoli cells and immature adulttype Leydig.</s><s>This will eventually lead to an increase in Leydig cell and Sertoli cell numbers, and consequently increased testicular weight in adulthood.</s></p></div>

(1992)</ref> who induced hypothyroidism in newborn male rats by PTU treatment and showed that if the hypothyroid condition was discontinued at day 8 or 16 pp, testis weight was significantly increased by the age of 90 days.</s><s>At present, we do not have an explanation for this discrepancy, except for the different ways hypothyroidism was induced (prenatal vs. postnatal; perchlorate in combination with a low iodide diet vs. PTU).</s></p><p><s>There are several lines of evidence that implicate that THs are essential for the development of a normal adult Leydig cell population.</s><s>For example, Leydig cell progenitor development is delayed in hypothyroid neonatal rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Teerds et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rijntjes et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The first progenitor cells are identified at day 16 pp, 4 days later than in the euthyroid controls, which suggests that the reduced THconcentrations are still sufficient to make stem Leydig cell differentiation possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rijntjes et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Only on day 16 pp, the 3α-androstanediol-glucuronide concentration in the hypothyroid rat is decreased; as also in the euthyroid control rats the levels go down with age.</s><s>In a study using methimazole to induce hypothyroidism, an even more substantial decrease was noted, but then on day 21 pp <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cristovao et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>As 3α-androstanediol is the main steroid produced by the newly developing immature adulttype Leydig cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tapanainen et al., 1984)</ref>, these reduced levels suggest a delay in the differentiation of the Leydig cells at this period of development.</s><s>In contrast, in the presence of elevated neonatal T 3 concentrations the formation of Leydig cell progenitors is advanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Teerds et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ariyaratne et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mendis-Handagama et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In line with these observations, an in vitro study has shown that undifferentiated stem Leydig cells are unable to differentiate into HSD3B positive androgen producing Leydig cell progenitors in the absence of T 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ge et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The present study provides further proof to these observations, because when the hypothyroid diet is discontinued before or at day 14 pp, Leydig cell progenitor proliferation follows the same profile as the euthyroid control rats, suggesting a rapid catch-up after return to the euthyroid condition.</s><s>When the hypothyroid condition is discontinued at day 28 pp, the percentage of Leydig cells in S-phase of the cell cycle in the T28 and PTU groups is at day 35 pp not different from the continuous hypothyroid animals.</s><s>It remains to be investigated whether an increase in progenitor Leydig cell proliferation in the first days after discontinuation of the hypothyroid condition occurs.</s><s>This would be in line with the Sertoli cell data, and explain why transient PTU-induced hypothyroidism leads to a 69% increase in Leydig cell number per testis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hardy et al., 1993)</ref>, an expansion in the size of the adult Leydig cell population that is not observed in continuous fetalpostnatal hypothyroidism <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Rijntjes et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the 4 weeks of reduced plasma TH concentrations have affected the growth and differentiation of the progenitor/immature Leydig cell population in such a way that discontinuation of the condition does not lead to a Leydig cell proliferation profile comparable to that of euthyroid controls; BrdU incorporation remains significantly elevated in the T28 and PTU groups up to 63 days pp, extending the data previously published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hardy et al. (1996)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The number of studies addressing the consequences of idiopathic hypothyroidism in combination with macroorchidism in prepubertal boys, and its consequences for testicular size and function in adulthood, is extremely limited.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Castro-Magana et al., 1988)</ref> reported that these patients had elevated FSH, LH, and prolactin concentrations but normal for age testosterone concentrations.</s><s>Prepubertal treatment of these patients with TH reduced LH, FSH, and prolactin concentrations within a few months to normal prepubertal levels.</s><s>Although TH treatment also caused a decrease in testis size, the testis remained significantly larger compared to euthyroid prepubertal children.</s><s>When these patients reached puberty their testicular function appeared normal, as judged by normal pubertal gonadotropin and testosterone concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Castro-Magana et al., 1988)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, transient dietary-induced hypothyroidism has various effects on Leydig cell and Sertoli cell development, depending on the time point of discontinuation of the hypothyroid condition.</s><s>Cessation of the condition up to day 14 pp does not seem to affect the normal development of the Sertoli cell and adult Leydig cell populations as compared to discontinuation of the hypothyroid condition at day 28 pp.</s><s>We hypothesize that the switch to a euthyroid state leads to enhanced Sertoli cell proliferation, while the formation of the adult-type Leydig cell population is under this condition delayed.</s><s>This implicates that the increased testis size in adulthood in transiently hypothyroid rats is not caused by the hypothyroid condition per se, but originates from augmented Sertoli cell proliferation as a consequence of the rapid normalization of TH concentrations following discontinuation of the diet around day 28 pp.</s></p></div>
