model, cholesterol concentrations were unaffected, suggesting that this model was probably not appropriate for studying the effects of PSs.</s><s>Also, the dose of PSs used in these mice was w100 times higher than the amount of PSs that is recommended for lowering LDL cholesterol in humans (2 g/d).</s><s>Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that, in hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet,

vascular ultrasound was performed by welltrained sonographers according to current guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>.</s><s>FMD was assessed by a single, blinded, independent, and

centrally assessed FMD by a single, blinded central reader (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>Some limitations of the study need to be mentioned as well.</s><s>First, although we assumed that the study participants would have suboptimal FMD because of their elevated prestudy LDL cholesterol concentrations, we cannot exclude that the participants were too healthy (e.g., all nonsmokers, no type 2 diabetes) to allow improvement in endothelial function on treatment.</s><s>Followup studies should preferably select participants with impaired FMD at baseline.</s><s>Second, LDL cholesterol was significantly changed from baseline (by w5%) in the control group.</s><s>Also, central and office BP were significantly changed from baseline.</s><s>Although the participants were instructed not to change their diet and lifestyle during the study, we cannot rule out that seasonal influences or increased awareness of having elevated blood LDL cholesterol, for example, led to unintended changes in their typical habits, which may have influenced the outcomes of this study.</s><s>Third, despite stratification for age, sex, and LDL cholesterol, FMD at baseline was significantly different between the 2 intervention groups.</s><s>The performed ANCOVA analysis with baseline as covariate was one planned safeguard against differences in baseline FMD.</s><s>Because the difference was larger than expected, we performed simulation analysis with equally balanced baseline FMD.</s><s>This analysis showed that upfront balancing for baseline FMD would not have changed the outcomes of our study.</s><s>Last, although changes in endothelial function can occur quickly on intervention [e.g., fat loads can affect FMD within a few hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref>], it cannot be ruled out that the duration of the current study (3 mo) was insufficient to induce small effects on the vascular system, particularly when assuming that such an effect would be mediated through LDL cholesterol reduction and considering that the observed LDL cholesterol-lowering effect was only rather modest (w7% for a dose of 3 g PS/d).</s></p><p><s>In summary, endothelial function as measured by brachial artery FMD was neither improved nor worsened with PS intake.</s><s>The LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of PS intake was confirmed, although the effect was lower than anticipated for the dose of PS tested (3 g/d).</s><s>LDL cholesterol is an established risk factor in the development of atherosclerosis leading to CAD.</s><s>Whether reductions in LDL cholesterol due to PS intake would reduce CAD risk via improvements of vascular function requires further investigation.</s><s>Future studies should investigate vascular effects of PS after prolonged intakes of PS with enhanced LDL cholesterol lowering, preferably in participants with compromised vascular function.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE
