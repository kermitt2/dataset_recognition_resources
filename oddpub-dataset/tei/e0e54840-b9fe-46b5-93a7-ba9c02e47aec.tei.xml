N</s><s>tably, this is due to the driver's body weight exerting significant pressure, which is forced directly on the muscle areas of the body which are presently functioning in an anaerobic manner.</s><s>Due to the compressive force imposed on the driver's body and the seat interface, the blood flowing through large vascular blood vessels to the lower part of the anatomy will be obstructed.</s><s>Consequently, this will lead to insufficient oxygen supply to the body, resulting in discomfort, fatigue and the longer term, will convert into severe pain and possible injury if untreated <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Many studies have been conducted to measure sitting discomfort.</s><s>Previous studies have identified two types of measuring methods that are used, namely the subjective and objective methods.</s><s>The subjective methods are used primarily for indirect evaluation due to the subjective perceptions regarding comfort or discomfort <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref> .</s><s>Conversely, objective methods require the use of specific equipment to measure the comfort condition.</s><s>Nevertheless, the objective methods produced more advantages compared to subjective methods.</s><s>Furthermore, the objective methods require less time for observation and in testing subjects and are attributed to less bias and measurement errors, producing fast, relevant information for the design process <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> . A</s><s>cordingly, the objective methods provide a value associated with the condition, by measuring and collecting data mostly numerically.</s><s>Furthermore, the objective methods are beneficial when integrated with the subjective methods, if there is a relationship between the two methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref> .</s><s>Helander et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref> cited the causes of sitting discomfort mainly influenced by biomechanical causes.</s></p><p><s>Many studies in the literature focus on areas associated with seat improvement.</s><s>For instance, Grandjean <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref> , Hubbard et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref> , Coelho et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref> and Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref> concentrated on the seat design parameters and features by considering the postural angle, design, and materials of the seat.</s><s>Several other studies combined the subjective assessment tools, such as the comfort rating with the pressure distribution data.</s><s>Prior studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between the pressure distribution data and the seat comfort rating.</s><s>Ng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref>) conducted a study using the same approach by developing an intelligent seat system based on pressure data of an adjustable seat.</s><s>In this study, subjective comfort ratings (from 1=very poor to 10=very good) and anthropometric measurements were carried out on 20 participants simulating driving positions in a seating buck.</s><s>Thakurta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref> compared the subjective assessment of short and long-term driving periods along a 129-kilometre highway.</s><s>Thirty-six respondents using five small cars were assessed using assessment questionnaires relating to 'comfort', where pressure distribution was mapped both before and after driving.</s><s>Limited studies at this stage have examined the pressure distribution pattern in a fixed driving sitting position with a complete vehicle setup (construct) to observe the effects on the driver.</s><s>However, there are three studies previously undertaken which are closely associated with this area.</s><s>Andreoni et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref> recorded posture and pressure distribution when the subject put their foot on the car pedal, but this study did not use a fixed position for the pedal.</s><s>Porter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref> requested the subject to drive the car, but no specific posture was used.</s><s>In a separate study by Na et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref> they set the seat back angle at 1150 based on the posture associated with an average Korean person.</s><s>However, no assessment regarding the relationship between the measurement and anthropometric body data was performed.</s></p><p><s>In general, the adaptation of body posture while performing a task depends mostly on the adjustability of the seat and anthropometry of the driver <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref> .</s><s>Past studies have shown that there is often a positive relationship between pressure distribution, the subjective rating and body measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref> .</s><s>For instance, Ng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref> evaluated the modern design of a seating system (setup) using the subjective rating and pressure map where seated anthropometric data were collected from 20 subjects.</s><s>A joint angle was used, such as the ankle angle and knee angle plus the anthropometric measurements, such as buttock-popliteal length and knee height, and was collected when the subject stretched their arms out to reach the steering wheel.</s><s>Goonetilleke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref> and Shen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref> also identified that the buttock-popliteal length was a primary parameter to determine the sitting pattern, which showed a good relationship with the other measurements.</s><s>In the study conducted by Goonetilleke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref> , the buttock-popliteal length showed a linear correlation with the seat depth of a chair with 99.98% R-square.</s><s>Notably, the buttock-popliteal length can be defined as the determinant factor to the cushion length.</s><s>Based on a study by Reed et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref> , a cushion that is too long will lead to localised discomfort due to significant pressure under the person's thigh area, thereby restricting blood flow to the leg.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</head><p><s>Eleven subjects (mean age=28 ± 4.83 years of age, a mean height=161 ± 6.38 cm, mean weight=56 ± 7.16 kg) were chosen from the staff and student population at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia to participate in this study based on meeting certain criteria.</s><s>All subjects needed hold a full Malaysia driving license, have a minimum of three years driving experience, aged between 21 to 35 years old.</s><s>Also, each subject reporting no risk of nausea (motion sickness) while travelling in a car as the driver.</s><s>The constraint associated with age was proposed to reduce any potential variations in the results due to the subject's age.</s><s>Notably, even as part of the normal ageing process, people will exhibit slight perceptive and reflex variations that could have a direct effect on their attitude towards driving <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref> .</s><s>A letter of approval relating to Ethical Practice was also required from the Ethical Committee at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia with reference number UKM PPI/111/8/JEP-2016-200. Next, the buttock-popliteal length (mean length=47.4</s><s>± 1.8 cm) was measured using an anthropometer.</s><s>All subjects were able to adapt to the car simulator setup and the task of driving before starting the actual experiment.</s><s>The experiment commenced five minutes after each subject had been seated in the driving position, which enabled each subject to adapt to the seat and materials (i.e.</s><s>fabric).</s><s>All subjects understood and complied with oral and written instructions presented by the researcher for the experiment.</s><s>Relevant information regarding simulator driving procedures and assessment methods were presented, which was followed by each subject signing a consent form acknowledging that they understood and complied with all information and experimental procedures.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the driving simulator used for the experiment.</s><s>The simulator's design and seat parameters are like a Malaysian small car.</s><s>The simulator consisted of an adjustable driver's seat (adjustable backrest, headrest and seat), steering wheel, clutch, accelerator pedal and brake pedal, handbrake and manual gear shift.</s><s>The screen was positioned in front and in full view of the driver along with a virtual dashboard and simulated engine noise.</s><s>Furthermore, the screen displays the simulated road scene and conditions, driving speed and gear positions using the virtual dashboard.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the driving posture.</s><s>The driving posture required the subject to be seated at the closest comfortable distance to the controls.</s><s>During the pressure distribution recording, the test subjects were required to locate their left and right hands at the positions of 10 and 2 o'clock, as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Furthermore, the subjects needed to ensure that their right leg was located on the car pedal, and able to use either the brake or accelerator pedals, while the left leg was situated on the floor near to the clutch pedal.</s><s>Accordingly, each subject was required to be seated close to the steering wheel with their knees flexed at an angle less than 110° and be comfortably seated while leaning back against the seat's backrest.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> displays the steering wheel actions required to be performed by each subject.</s></p><p><s>The pressure distribution pattern used in this experiment demonstrates and predicts any signs associated with sitting discomfort.</s><s>Notably, pressure measurement is sensitive to postural changes of various angulations and has a positive correlation with subjective comforts, by determining the maximum pressure, average pressure ratio and maximum pressure gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref> .</s><s>In this study, the Tactilus ® pressure mapping system supplied from Sensor Products Incorporations (SPI) is used.</s><s>The system includes 22 × 22 sensor pads calibrated at 0 to 5 pounds per square inch (psi) with a 32 × 32 sensor matrix.</s><s>The interface pressure uses thin and flexible sensor arrays.</s><s>Also, by scanning the grid and measuring the electrical resistance at each grid point, the pressure distribution on the sensor's surface can be determined.</s><s>The electronic scanner is packaged in a handle type assembly that clips onto the sensor's interface tab that provides the electrical connection to each sensor cell.</s></p><p><s>All subjects were requested to wear suitable attire for driving without bulky seams, buttons or pockets to ensure minimal effect on the pressure readings and to avoid false seat or backrest interface pressure readings.</s><s>The mats were securely attached to the seat using strips of masking tape and care was exercised to ensure that the mats were placed in a consistent location from the subject, seat and backrest.</s><s>For the driving position, each subject was required to put both hands on the steering wheel and to look directly ahead.</s><s>Accordingly, this enabled measurements to be accurately recorded.</s><s>Next, the mats were removed, and the subject was asked to re-enter the simulator and sit on the seat to complete the survey, thereby negating any interference caused by the mats.</s><s>The reason for this instruction was because the subjects had trouble rating the appearance of the seat when they sat on it.</s></p><p><s>For the subjective assessment form, two sections within the form were required to be completed.</s><s>The information within the first section that was needed related to each subject's demographic background, age, gender, weight, height and driving experience.</s><s>The second section required each subject to identify their perceptions of the pressure felt level based on driving posture.</s><s>In this section, the seat component was split into two parts representing the buttocks and thighs.</s><s>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was to represent the perception of pressure felt, using a 10-cm continuous horizontal line with each point along the line having a different definition.</s><s>In this case, 0 was referred to as no pressure felt, and 10 referred to as extreme pressure felt.</s></p><p><s>Data from the experiment were used to predict and estimate the dependent variable (DV) based on an independent variable (IV) by using the Regression Method.</s><s>Accordingly, this was used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.</s><s>The variable to predict is called the DV, while the variable used to predict the other variable's value is called the IV or otherwise known as the predictor variable.</s><s>In this study, the DV is based on the subjective assessment, while the IV  is referred to as the objective assessment (pressure distribution map measurement).</s><s>The highest mean score for each IV was used to develop the model in this section.</s></p><p><s>Based on this method, the regression coefficient (K), regression constant (c), multiple correlation coefficients (R), coefficients of determination (R 2 ) and significance level (p) are determined.</s><s>The acceptance or rejection of the Null hypothesis (H o ) is also determined based on the newly developed model (H o : β1=0 and β2=0: β1 ǂ 0 and β2 ǂ 0).</s><s>The H o can be rejected if the p-value is low (p&lt;0.05).</s><s>As a result, it can estimate the drivers' condition based on these integrated assessment methods.</s><s>In other words, a predictor that has a low p-value is likely to be a significant predictor to the model because the changes in the predictor's value are connected to changes in the response variable.</s><s>The linear equation to predict the drivers' state is given by Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">y=k 1 x 1 + k 2 x 2 + c (Equation 1)</formula><p><s>where y=drivers' state
