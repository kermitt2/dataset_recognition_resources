LRP2-deficient mice, we suspected a developmental defect as cause of this phenotype.</s><s>Thus, we characterized the expression of LRP2 in wild-type embryos.</s><s>Around E10.5, invagination of the neuroepithelium in the optic pits forms the bi-layered optic cup (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2A</ref>).</s><s>Expression of LRP2 on the apical surface of the neuroepithelium at E10.5 is retained during optic cup invagination, resulting in receptor localization to the inner layer of the optic cup epithelium (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2B</ref>).</s><s>Initially
