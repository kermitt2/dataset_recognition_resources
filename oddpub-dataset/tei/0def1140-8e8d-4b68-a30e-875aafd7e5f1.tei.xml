<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Classification and grouping of toxicants is a major goal of toxicological risk assessment, next to the de novo prediction of hazard for entirely new compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gocht et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Such methods are particularly useful when testing for reproductive and developmental toxicity due to (1) a large backlog of substances to be evaluated, (2) an especially high demand in resources and animals and (3) the difficult issue of data interpretation in this field.</s><s>Moreover, it is well established that the developing central nervous system is particularly susceptible to chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Smirnova et al. 2014b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">van Thriel et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Currently, developmental neurotoxicity is tested using labour-intensive in vivo experiments according to OECD test guidelines TG 426, which requires exposure of animals during gestation and lactation, followed by analyses for histopathological, functional and behavioural abnormalities in the offspring.</s><s>As this in vivo test is too expensive for the analysis of thousands of untested but marketed chemicals, alternative tests are urgently needed to prioritize test compounds for further analysis by more extensive studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bal-Price et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Leist et al. 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To reach this goal, human embryonic stem cell (hESC)based test systems have recently been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bal-Price et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Colleoni et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Efthymiou et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr"

recapitulate different critical phases of embryonic development during which the differentiating cells can be exposed to chemicals.</s><s>A particularly intensively studied phase is neural induction, when the neural ectodermal progenitor cells are formed.</s><s>This phase can be recapitulated, using the cell system UKN1, which has recently been optimized for transcriptomics approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balmer et al. 2012</ref><ref type="bibr">(Balmer et al. , 2014;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Krug et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In this in vitro system, the known developmental neurotoxicants valproic acid (VPA) and methylmercury have been shown to induce specific and reproducible gene expression patterns that can easily be distinguished from negative control compounds.</s><s>Moreover, the system revealed concentration progression principles with (1) tolerated, (2) teratogenic but non-cytotoxic and (3) finally cytotoxic ranges, at similar concentrations as in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Waldmann et al. 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A next challenge in the UKN1 test system development is the establishment of gene expression-based classifiers for compounds acting by similar mechanisms.</s><s>Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have been chosen as a class of model compounds in the present study, as they are known to cause neural tube defects in animals and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Balmer et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kadereit et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Nau et al. 1991)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Inhibition of histone deacetylases triggers large changes in the cellular transcriptome at in vivo relevant concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Jergil et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Krug et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Smirnova et al. 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Theunissen et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Waldmann et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Werler et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Since VPA acts as a reversible inhibitor of enzyme activity, changes in the transcriptome can therefore be reversible.</s><s>Indeed, it has been shown that up-or downregulated genes in developing neuronal precursor cells can return to control levels after short-term exposure of 6 h.</s><s>However, longer exposure period of 4 days, which covered critical time windows of development, led to transcriptional changes that were irreversible after washout of the toxicant <ref type="bibr">(Balmer et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Besides VPA, five further HDACi were studied, namely belinostat (PXD101), entinostat (MS-275), panobinostat (LBH589), vorinostat (SAHA) and trichostatin A (TSA).</s><s>Although these compounds differ in their isoenzyme specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Khan et al. 2008)</ref>, they all produce potent inhibition of major members of the HDAC family (HDAC-1, 2, 4, 6) and have all been developed for a similar indication (tumour chemotherapy).</s><s>Therefore, the six HDACi can be considered as a relatively homogeneous group with respect to their mode of action.</s><s>'Mercurials' were selected for the second group, which were defined by the commonality of having one mercury atom in their chemical structure: methylmercury chloride (MeHg), thimerosal, mercury(II)chloride (HgCl 2 ), mercury(II)bromide (HgBr 2 ), 4-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB) and phenylmercuric acetate (PMA).</s><s>These compounds form a more heterogeneous group than the aforementioned HDACi, ranging from inorganic salts, such as HgCl 2 with ionized Hg 2+ and small charged organomercurial ions (methyl-Hg + ; ethyl-Hg + from thimerosal), to completely organic structures (PCMB).</s><s>All mercury compounds react with thiol groups and can therefore modify proteins with free cysteine groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bahr and Moberger 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Halsey 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Pekkanen and Sandholm 1971)</ref> leading to oxidative stress, inhibition of protein synthesis and disruption of calcium homeostasis (Suppl.</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>The most studied mercurial compound is MeHg because of the catastrophic endemic diseases caused by ingestion of MeHg-contaminated food <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Choi 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ekino et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Harada 1995)</ref>.</s><s>It is also known to cause neural tube defects and other developmental disturbances, and as a result is considered a 'gold standard' compound of human developmental toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Grandjean and Herz 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Robinson et al. 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of the present work was to study (1) whether the six HDACi can be recognized as a homogeneous group based on gene array data, (2) whether the alterations they induce can be differentiated from those caused by mercurials and (3) whether a classifier can be constructed based on a support vector machine.</s><s>Finally, the gene set required for correct classification was optimized and reduced to a minimum to facilitate routine testing.</s><s>We report that an eight-gene-based classifier correctly identifies all tested HDACi.</s><s>With this classifier, it should be possible to predict with a high probability whether an unknown compound can be classified as an HDACi.</s></p></div>

10-PS still correctly predicts all 12 compounds if the 'leave-one-out concept' is used.</s><s>These 10-PS correspond to only eight genes, because the classifier selected two PS for each of the genes transcription factor AP-2 beta (TFAP2B) and endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA).</s><s>At a first glance, it may be surprising that only one gene (FOXD3) is in the overlap of the eight-gene classifier

phenomenon of high-dimensional data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fan 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Several classifiers can be constructed that are based on completely different sets of genes but nevertheless perform equally well.</s><s>It should also be considered that the eight-gene classifier was obtained by a multivariate algorithm and preselection of probe sets based on individual variances, whereas the consensus list is based on simple overlap analysis of all genes up-or down-regulated by all HDACi.</s><s>Differentiation between HDACi and mercurials is relatively easy in the present set of data and could even be achieved on the basis of only single genes, such as FOXD3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>However, the eight-gene-based algorithm guarantees more stability when additional compounds are tested.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, an eight-gene-based classifier allows the identification of HDACi in a human stem cell-based in vitro system.</s><s>In future, it will be of interest to study whether further signatures can be identified that can be linked to specific mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity, and whether such systems can replace animal experiments <ref type="bibr"
