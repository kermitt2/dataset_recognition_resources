<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Understanding percutaneous absorption of organic solvents is important in many areas, such as prediction of the time-to-effect of topically administered medications, the retention and behaviours of cosmetics on the skin, or risk assessment of unintended exposures.</s><s>The demand for percutaneous absorption data for risk assessment purposes has increased with the introduction of the REACH legislation in the European Union, as manufacturers and producers of chemicals are required to evaluate the safe use of their products considering all relevant exposure routes, including dermal exposure.</s></p><p><s>For risk assessment of occupational exposures, solvents are of special importance due to extensive occupational use.</s><s>Both inhalation and dermal exposure may contribute to systemic toxicity, meanwhile, successful reduction of ambient air levels increases the relative importance of dermal exposure.</s><s>In the regulation of occupational exposure, the so-called "skin notation" is commonly used (in conjunction with occupational exposure limits, OELs) to identify chemicals that are easily taken up through the skin, and/or may cause or contribute to systemic toxicity.</s><s>However, the criteria for skin notations, and how they are applied in practice, differ substantially between standard-setters <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Among the difficulties to assign skin notation is the lack of relevant and reliable absorption data.</s><s>A review of available studies for 108 different chemicals showed a huge variation in dermal permeability between as well as within chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>This highlights the need for evaluating appropriateness of dermal absorption data.</s><s>The kind of data most relevant for skin notations and other risk assessments of human skin exposure, i.e. human or in vivo dermal exposure toxicity, are rare due to ethical, practical and economical restrictions.</s><s>Therefore, route-to-route extrapolation will be required for most chemicals.</s><s>The same restrictions apply also to human and in vivo toxicokinetic data, underscoring the need for in vitro systems to evaluate percutaneous absorption and, in a longer perspective, to develop or improve computational predictive models.</s></p><p><s>The static diffusion cell, or Franz cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, is a commonly used tool to measure percutaneous absorption in vitro.</s><s>The most common physical quantities used to describe the absorption process of a specific chemical can be derived from Fick's laws of diffusion.</s><s>Given a homogenous medium exposed to a chemical Fick's first law can be used to calculate the steady-state flux J SS and the permeability coefficient K p .</s><s>These two physical quantities may then be used to develop predictive models, such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) or quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Such models for percutaneous absorption have been the scope of a multitude of publications, e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, as well as evaluations of their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>These models are mainly based on linear methods, which may not be sufficient for modelling the dynamics of percutaneous absorption.</s><s>There are also few examples of different machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which show some promise.</s><s>Deep learning methods in particular might be useful in future analysis of skin permeation data.</s><s>Deep learning has been applied in a few cases of pharmaceutical and toxicological research <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and performed well in the 2014 Tox21 challenge on prediction of nuclear receptor signaling and stress pathway assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A challenge in the development of linear as well as nonlinear approaches to predictive modelling of skin permeation is the limited availability of experimental data.</s><s>Thus, the skin permeation models cited above are based on data for roughly 10 to 250 compounds whereas the Tox21 challenge participants had access to standardised data for 12 000 compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Whichever predictive skin permeation model is chosen, the accuracy will depend on the input data and, as shown by e.g.</s><s>Johanson and Rauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, these data are highly variable.</s><s>For example, the donor species, location on the body and skin preparation all have a major impact on the results.</s><s>Additionally, the experimental protocol, experimental and analytical equipment will influence study results <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>For instance, experimental permeation data from diffusion cells using synthetic membranes, reducing the intra-and interspecies variability, may still comprise both inter-and intra-laboratory variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Comparisons of the static diffusion cells with flow-through diffusion cells, however, have shown that these two in vitro systems yield similar results <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the dermal penetration potential of a number of chemicals relevant for the occupational setting, namely organic solvents.</s><s>Permeation studies of 38 common organic solvents were performed with skin from new-born piglets using the same experimental set up with static diffusion cells.</s><s>Because the properties of neat chemicals and water dilutions may differ significantly, both these solutions were tested.</s><s>Estimates of the lag time t lag , the steady-state flux J SS , and the apparent permeability coefficient K p are presented.</s></p></div>
