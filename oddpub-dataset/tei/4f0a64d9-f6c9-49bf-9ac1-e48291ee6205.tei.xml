<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary malignant bone tumor affecting both children and adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Even the outcome for patients with osteosarcoma has improved dramatically by therapeutic strategies, those who suffered from distant metastasis or local recurrence continue to pose a particularly tough challenge (3).</s><s>Thus, a better understanding of the molecular biology of OS is needed and may improve therapeutic efficiency.</s><s>Diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKZ) has proven to be involved in several physiological or pathophysiological signaling pathways, including certain human carcinogenesis.</s><s>In our study, we speculated that DGKZ acts as an oncogene in proliferation of osteosarcoma.</s><s>Expression of DGKZ was significantly up-regulated in OS tumor samples compared with normal bone tissue, and was associated with poor prognosis.</s><s>Moreover, in vitro studies, through a constructed lentivirus expressing DGKZ-specific shRNA, we further demonstrated the key role of DGKZ in cell growth and apoptosis in Saos-2/U2OS/HOS cells.</s><s>Additionally, considering that a suitable animal model was needed to investigate the effect of DGKZ in vivo, we chose BALB/c nude mice, one of the most widely used models, to establish xenograft model induced by subcutaneous injection of HOS cells.</s><s>Consistent with findings in vitro, our data also strongly supported the positive correlation between DGKZ expression and osteosarcoma growth.</s><s>Taken together, these data indicated substantial evidence that DGKZ is a prognostic marker and potential new target for cancer therapy in osteosarcoma.</s></p><p><s>Previous data demonstrated that DGKZ was involved in tumor initiation and progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Cai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(27)</ref> found that high DGKZ expression could facilitate Rho GTPase activation and promote motility of metastatic function in colon cancer.</s><s>Diao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28)</ref> demonstrated positive correlation between DGKZ expression and gliomagrade in glioma tumor samples.</s><s>Furthermore, DGKZ knockdown in human glioma suppressed cell proliferation, hampered colony formation ability, and promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.</s><s>Torres-Ayuso et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref> explored the potential molecular mechanism of DGKZ's role in rapamycin-resistant colon cancer cell line, and found that DGKZ manipulated mTORC1 and lipogenic metabolism in colon cancer cells through SREBP-1.</s><s>In line with these data, we also proved that role of DGKZ acts an oncogene in proliferation of osteosarcoma.</s></p><p><s>The regulation of DGKZ on downstream signal pathway in cancer cells is still not well-elucidated.</s><s>To investigate the potential mechanism about DGKZ in regulating tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma, we conducted microarray analysis to explore alteration of cancer-related genes between normal osteosarcoma cells and DGKZ knockdown cells.</s><s>Microarray data demonstrated that DGKZ's oncogene role is the result of regulating a number of different signaling pathways, which is consistent with a biofunctional role for DGKZ reported in previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr"

siRNA-expressing cells posed a downregulated activity of MYC signal pathway and an altered expression of several target genes in MYC pathway.</s><s>MYC proto-oncogene promotes oncogenic transcriptional amplification program in cancers and represents as an important therapeutic target for cancer therapy.</s><s>In addition, misregulated expressions of MYC are often associated with osteosarcoma oncogenesis and progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(36)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, it could be concluded that DGKZ might exert an enhancing effect on activity of MYC signal pathway to impact on osteosarcoma proliferation.</s></p><p><s>The MYC signaling pathway consists of a family of upstream and downstream targets that are associated with cell proliferation and growth.</s><s>Whether regulation of DGKZ on downstream MYC pathway in osteosarcoma is through a direct or indirect route is still not clear.</s><s>In our study, through IP-MS analysis, we provided potential evidence that the interaction of ERK1/2 and DGKZ was closely linked to MYC-dependent osteosarcoma development.</s><s>ERK1/2 are widely expressed in various cells including cardiomyocytes, neurons, and hepatocytes.</s><s>They are directly activated by phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to promote cellular differentiation, proliferation, and survival <ref

the MYC protein and thus enhances the accumulation of MYC activity, both in normal cell growth control and oncogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42)</ref>.</s><s>This finding enriched our knowledge on how DGKZ exerted an impact in osteosarcoma MYC-dependent proliferation.</s><s>Thus, we speculated that DGKZ might regulate MYC signal pathway via possible interaction with ERK1/2 in carcinogenesis of osteosarcoma and utilization of DGKZ-ERK1/2-MYC interacting axis inhibitor might be an effective approach in treatment of osteosarcoma.</s><s>However, the detailed mechanism of MYC pathway regulation induced by DGKZ-ERK1/2 needs further investigation.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that DGKZ, a potential prognostic and predictive indicator in osteosarcoma, play a key role in proliferation of osteosarcoma, via its possible interaction with ERK1/2 and regulation of MYC pathway.</s><s>These
