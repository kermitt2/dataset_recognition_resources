<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</head><p><s>There is presently no proven pharmacological therapy for the acute respiratory distress syndrome.</s><s>Recently, we and others discovered that the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] shows significant beneficial effects in preclinical models of acute lung injury (ALI).</s><s>Here, we aimed to identify the best time window for Ang-(1-7) administration to protect rats from oleic acid (OA) induced ALI.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH</head><p><s>The effects of i.v.</s><s>infused Ang-(1-7) were examined over four different time windows before or after induction of ALI in male Sprague-Dawley rats.</s><s>Haemodynamic effects were continuously monitored, and loss of barrier function, inflammation and lung peptidase activities were measured as experimental endpoints.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KEY RESULTS</head><p><s>Ang-(1-7) infusion provided the best protection against experimental ALI when administered by continuous infusion starting immediately after 30 min OA infusion till the end of the experiment (30-240 min).</s><s>Both pretreatment (À60 to 0 min before OA) and short-term therapy (30-90 min) also had beneficial effects although less pronounced than the effects achieved with the optimal therapy window.</s><s>Starting infusion of Ang-(1-7) 60 min after the end of OA treatment (90-240 min) did not protect barrier function or haemodynamics but still reduced myeloperoxidase activity and increased ACE2/ACE activity ratio respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p><s>Our findings indicate that early initiation of therapy after ALI and continuous drug delivery are most beneficial for optimal therapeutic efficiency of Ang-(1-7) treatment in experimental ALI and, presumably accordingly, in clinical acute respiratory distress syndrome.</s></p></div>

however, mechanical ventilation characteristically bears the risk of adding ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) as an addition to the pre-existing disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Slutsky and Ranieri, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Because the term ARDS is exclusively used to refer to the condition in humans, the pathophysiological correlate in experimental models and animal studies is typically referred to as acute lung injury (ALI).</s></p><p><s>The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a humoral system that is essentially involved in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte homeostasis, and water and sodium intake.</s><s>Angiotensin II (AngII), the main biologically active peptide of the RAS, has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of ARDS/ALI through stimulation of its AT 1 receptor subtype.</s><s>This attribution is based on the observation that experimental ALI in mice can be attenuated by treatment with a recombinant form of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which converts AngII into its heptapeptide metabolite angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], thereby presumably reducing the activation of AT 1 receptors by AngII <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Imai et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, however, the AngII metabolite Ang-(1-7) itself possesses potent biological activity and has been shown to counteract many of the detrimental actions of AngII <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Santos, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We previously identified Ang-(1-7) as an important signalling molecule that binds to the GPCR known as Mas <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Santos et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we recently reported proof of principle for a highly effective therapeutic effect of Ang-(1-7) in different preclinical models of ALI/ARDS including the model of oleic acid (OA)-induced ALI in rats, and models of overventilation-induced and acid instillation-induced lung injury in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Klein et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Meanwhile, these beneficial effects have been successfully reproduced by others, demonstrating the validity and reproducibility of this therapeutic effect in different models and laboratories respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Li et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zambelli et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>As the heptapeptide Ang-(1-7) has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in a series of clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balingit et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pham et al., 2013)</ref>, testing of this peptide as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ARDS is becoming a realistic and promising scenario.</s><s>However, prior to the planning and initiation of a clinical trial, important details of the therapy including the optimal time window of drug delivery, the best dosing, the optimal formulation and delivery route and the risk of potential adverse effects specific to ARDS patients need to be addressed in appropriate preclinical disease models.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we have addressed the first of these crucial questions, namely, the optimal time window for the treatment with Ang-(1-7).</s><s>Time windows for the treatment with Ang-(1-7) were selected based on our previous finding that continuous infusion of Ang-(1-7) starting at the time of lung injury until the end of the experiment conferred significant protection.</s><s>Specifically, we aimed to answer the following three questions: (i) Can pretreatment with the heptapeptide initiate similar protective effects?</s><s>(ii) Does the</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we aimed to identify the optimal TW for Ang-(1-7) treatment in experimental ALI.</s><s>The unchanged mortality of ARDS over the past decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Phua et al., 2009)</ref> highlights the need for novel therapeutic interventions and their optimal timing in the disease process.</s><s>Here, we tested four different TWs including pre-injury and post-injury treatments with different times of onset after injury and duration in an established model of OA-induced lung injury and compared outcome parameters to untreated injured animals and uninjured control rats.</s><s>In this model of ALI, all tested TWs for Ang-(1-7) showed some form of therapeutic benefit, in that they alleviated OA-induced increases in permeability, inflammatory markers or haemodynamic alterations.</s><s>This finding is in line with prior work in which we and others have recently demonstrated the therapeutic potential of Ang-(1-7) for the treatment of experimental ALI <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Klein et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zambelli et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Of the four different time windows tested, the best protection in terms of lung vascular barrier function, inflammatory and haemodynamic parameters was provided by a continuous infusion of Ang-(1-7) starting at the time of injury and continuing until the end of the experimental period (TW2).</s><s>Pretreatment and short-term treatment with Ang-(1-7) also provided partial benefits, which were however largely absent in the later treatment group (TW4).</s></p><p><s>Our experimental model of ARDS shows the characteristic features of experimental ALI as outlined in the recent consensus statement from the American Thoracic Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Matute-Bello et al., 2011)</ref>, including impaired alveolocapillary barrier function (evident as increase in wet-to-dry lung weight ratio and BALF protein), a strong inflammatory response (as indicated by an elevated MPO activity in lung tissue and a marked increase in TNF-α in the BALF) and altered haemodynamics.</s><s>In a series of experiments, we and others have identified a critical role of the RAS in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS.</s><s>A first indication for a key role of Ang-(1-7) in ALI was provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Imai et al. (2005)</ref> who demonstrated the protective effects of recombinant ACE2 in murine models of acid-induced and sepsis-induced ALI, an Angiotensin-(1-7) therapy for acute lung injury BJP effect which the authors linked to reduced AngII concentrations and, consequently, reduced stimulation of AT 1 .</s><s>However, metabolism of AngII by ACE2 concomitantly leads to the generation of Ang-(1-7), which counteracts many of the effects of the AngII-AT 1 receptor axis by signalling through its own receptor, Mas.</s><s>In previous work, we and others have provided experimental proof-of-principle demonstrating not only that exogenous Ang-(1-7) exerts similar or even more pronounced protective effects as recombinant ACE2 or pharmacological blockade of AT 1 receptors respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Klein et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zambelli et al., 2015)</ref>, but also that the protective effect of AT 1 receptor blockade is largely attributable to an enhanced signalling via the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Klein et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The cellular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of Ang-(1-7) in ALI are still incompletely understood but are likely to involve endothelial barrier-stabilizing effects via cGMP-dependent and cAMP-dependent pathways, given that inhibition of NO synthase by L-NAME inhibited the barrierprotective effect of Ang-(1-7) in lung microvascular endothelial cells challenged by thrombin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Klein et al., 2013)</ref> and that Ang-(1-7) increased intracellular cAMP levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Liu et al., 2012)</ref>, which can attenuate endothelial leak <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moore et al., 1998)</ref> and reduce inflammatory cell infiltration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Derian et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>The emerging role for a therapeutic potential of Ang-(1-7) in the treatment of lung disease is further substantiated by similar protective effects in experimental models of lung fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shenoy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Wösten-van Asperen et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Ang-(1-7) treatment presents not only a promising but also a realistic strategy given that the drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials.</s><s>Importantly, with respect to its prospective clinical use, Ang-(1-7) infusion in uninjured control rats did not cause any detectable adverse effects with respect to lung vascular barrier function or inflammation.</s><s>However, crucial factors such as optimal dosage, administration route and time window all need to be analysed in preclinical studies prior to the initiation of a first-in-man trial.</s><s>In the present study, we sought the optimal time window for Ang-(1-7) therapy in ARDS by testing four different treatment strategies, namely, a pretreatment (TW1), a continuous treatment (TW2), a short-term strategy (TW3) and a late-term (TW4) strategy.</s><s>Prophylactic treatment (TW1) showed some protective effects with respect to protein and TNF-α concentration in BALF, as well as in MPO, ACE and ACE2 activities.</s><s>However, these protective effects were less pronounced than those seen with a continuous drug infusion (TW2).</s><s>A prophylactic approach is also of limited clinical relevance, given the poor predictability of ARDS, whichin conjunction with its moderate effectiveness makes this approach less promising.</s><s>An immediate but shortterm infusion of Ang-(1-7) (TW3) showed a similar trend towards protection in terms of permeability, inflammation and haemodynamic stabilization as seen with the continuous infusion in group TW2, but to an overall lesser degree.</s><s>Hence, continuation of Ang-(1-7) infusion throughout the acute inflammatory phase of ARDS seems critical for an optimal treatment effect, a finding that is probably of little surprise given the short half-life of Ang-(1-7) of only 20-30 min in plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Mordwinkin et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Of interest, there was a noticeable increase in arterial pressure after the start of Ang-(1-7) infusion in both the TW2 and TW3 groups.</s><s>This finding may initially seem surprising as Ang-(1-7) is known to exert direct vasodilatory effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chappel et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Peiró et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Peiró et al., 2013)</ref>, which was also evident as a slight decrease in arterial pressure in the control group receiving Ang-(1-7) infusion.</s><s>The Ang-(1-7)-induced increase in arterial pressure in ALI rats is thus likely to reflect an overall stabilization of cardiovascular haemodynamics due to the anti-edematous and anti-inflammatory effects of the heptapeptide as well as additional positive inotropic effects of Ang-(1-7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zhou et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>However, after stopping Ang-(1-7) infusion in the TW3 group, AP decreased rapidly again to levels that were not statistically different from the untreated OA group.</s><s>This finding confirms the notion that cardiovascular stabilization was a direct result of Ang-(1-7) infusion, and emphasizes the need for continuous drug infusion during the acute inflammatory phase of ALI/ARDS.</s><s>Finally, later administration of Ang-(1-7) had no significant positive effects on systemic haemodynamics and could not reverse all signs of ALI at this advanced stage.</s><s>However, the later administration still prevented the OAinduced increase in MPO activity and the concomitant decrease in ACE activity.</s><s>The former finding is in line with the relatively long time, at least 2 h, that PMN take to emigrate from the vasculature into the alveolar space <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Reutershan et al., 2005)</ref>, which leaves a longer time window for Ang-(1-7) therapy to reduce neutrophil infiltration.</s><s>In comparison, endothelial injury and barrier failure occur within minutes after OA infusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Schuster, 1994)</ref>, which explains why the later Ang-(1-7) treatment had no detectable beneficial effects on parameters of lung barrier function such as BALF protein concentration or lung wet-to-dry weight ratio.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, the experimental groups with the best protective effects of Ang-(1-7) showed also the highest ACE2/ACE activity ratio, which may therefore represent a potential biomarker for monitoring the therapeutic efficiency of ALI/ARDS treatment by Ang-(1-7).</s><s>In subsequent studies, it will be of interest to monitor in parallel the ACE2/ACE activity ratio in circulating blood cells and to correlate it with therapeutic effectiveness, as measurements that can be made with whole blood would markedly increase their utility as potential biomarkers.</s><s>Functionally, this relation indicates that exogenous Ang-(1-7) shifts the balance from the detrimental ACE/AngII/AT 1 receptor pathway towards the protective endogenous ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in ALI, thereby establishing a positive therapeutic feedback loop.</s></p><p><s>A potential limitation of our study lies in the fact that we only tested a single concentration of Ang-(1-7) (50 pmol•kg À1 •min À1 ) in one experimental model of ALI.</s><s>In previous work, however, we had demonstrated the excellent efficacy of the applied concentration of Ang-(1-7) in three different experimental models of ALI, namely, acid aspiration, OA and VILI <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Klein et al., 2013)</ref>, and therefore focused in the present study exclusively on the optimal time window for Ang-(1-7) therapy.</s></p></div>
