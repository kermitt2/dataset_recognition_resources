<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Recent years have seen a steep increase in behavioral and brain imaging research of human social cognition.</s><s>Defining, differentiating and operationalizing cognitive and emotional subprocesses of social cognition such as empathy, Theory of Mind (ToM), and emotion recognition, have attracted increasing interest from psychologists and neuroscientists.</s><s>Two related, but yet separable constructs have been employed by researchers to describe the cognitive processes that may enable humans to understand others' cognitive and affective states -empathy and ToM.</s><s>While ToM describes the ability to understand and predict another's mental states, intentions, or beliefs, empathy as a psychological construct rather describes the phenomenon to share other people's affective states, which is likely to form the basis for social emotions like guilt or compassion.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hein and Singer (2008)</ref> explicitly distinguish empathy from "cognitive perspective taking as the ability to understand intentions, desires, beliefs of another person, resulting from (cognitively) reasoning about the other's state", a concept that can be called "cognitive empathy", whereas the classical definition could be referred to as "affective empathy."</s><s>The related concept of mentalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Frith and Frith, 2006)</ref> has been defined as "the process by which we make inferences about mental states" and comprises an immediate recognition and understanding of emotional states, also via cognitive inference.</s><s>A triple-dissociation of the ToM/empathy complex suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Walter (2012)</ref> divides the ToM concept into three separable cognitive mechanisms: Cognitive ToM comprises the ability of an individual to mentalize about cognitive states of others, Affective ToM -or Cognitive Empathy -is defined as an individual's ability to cognitively reflect on affective states of others, and Affective Empathy is characterized by the induction of others' affective states in the perceiving individual.</s></p><p><s>Numerous experimental paradigms have been developed to formalize the ToM construct in a way that allows researchers to assess both behavioral manifestations and neural underpinnings of ToM-related cognitive mechanisms.</s><s>These include the wellknown False Belief Task (initially developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wimmer and Perner, 1983)</ref>, a paradigm commonly used in developmental research, and the related Sally-Anne Tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baron-Cohen et al., 1985)</ref>, which have been employed to demonstrate ToM deficits in children with Down's Syndrome and Asperger's Syndrome.</s><s>A different approach to the experimental assessment of ToM and empathy was introduced with the publication of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron-Cohen et al., 1997)</ref>, in which participants have to assign mental states to static pictures of eye regions.</s><s>Notably, comparisons of the behavioral performance in different ToM tasks have yielded poor correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ahmed and Miller, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite this lack of correlation, the cognitive processes tested by the presently available tasks do most likely all contribute to enabling ToM in real-life social situations.</s><s>It is conceivable that, in the real world, people rely on highly multimodal information when engaging in social cognitive tasks, and different individuals are therefore likely to potentially employ distinct strategies during social cognition.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Achim et al. (2013)</ref> have proposed the Eight Sources of Information Framework (8-SIF) as a theoretical framework to analyze mentalizing tasks with respect to the information participants can use for task performance.</s><s>It consists of a 2*2 matrix, with the axes reflecting the temporal characteristics of information [immediate (I), with the subcategories "linguistic" and "perceptual", vs. stored (S), with the subcategories "general" and "source-specific"] and agentrelated versus context-related information.</s><s>The authors suggest that the multimodal nature of information described in the 8-SIF framework is best met by more naturalistic -or ecologically valid -paradigms or stimuli.</s></p><p><s>The need for ecologically valid stimulus material has been recognized in cognitive neuroscience, and several stimulus sets of various categories have been developed for this purpose.</s><s>For example, a number of photograph-based sets of object stimuli have been developed as an alternative for the commonly used Snodgrass pictures, line drawings of common objects <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Snodgrass and Vanderwart, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>These include the Amsterdam Library of Object Images (ALOI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Geusebroek et al., 2005)</ref> or the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brodeur et al., 2014)</ref> 1 .</s><s>The importance of examining ecologically valid information is wellestablished in the field of visual perception research <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kayser et al., 2004)</ref>, but only few ecologically valid stimulus sets applicable to emotion processing and social cognition have been published so far.</s><s>A notable exception is the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lang et al., 2008)</ref>, which contains images of different degrees of emotional valence and arousal, including highly aversive images of accidents and mutilation.</s></p><p><s>Based on the IAPS stimuli, the MET (Multifaceted Empathy Test; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dziobek et al., 2008)</ref> has been developed to study both affective ToM as well as affective empathy.</s><s>In this photographbased stimulus set, human beings are depicted in various emotional situations and participants are asked to infer the mental states of the persons depicted (affective ToM) and to indicate the level of own emotional involvement when perceiving or evaluating the scenes (affective empathy).</s><s>The MET has been extensively validated by experts and is therefore suitable for assessing response accuracy in social cognitive tasks.</s><s>One potential limitation of the MET is that the images are based on IAPS stimuli, which are -to a large extent-not representative for daily-life situations.</s></p><p><s>With a strong focus on ecological validity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dziobek et al. (2006)</ref> have developed the MASC (Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition).</s><s>The stimulus set consists of a 15-min video showing four main characters at a dinner party.</s><s>In 46 breaks, subjects have to answer questions on the feelings, thoughts, and intentions of the characters.</s><s>The task shows rather high ecological validity, but its design as a movie with a fixed location and a small number of protagonists limit its use particularly in neuroimaging studies that require precise trial timings and appropriate baseline conditions.</s><s>In neuroimaging studies of ToM and empathy, it is also important to employ appropriate controls, both at the task level (e.g., first-person perspective versus "pure" ToM) and at the item level (e.g., different degrees of task difficulty or emotional salience and valence), preferably using the same stimulus material.</s><s>Schnell and Walter have developed a task that allows one to distinguish first-person and third-person perspective during emotional and cognitive/visualperceptual processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Schnell et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Walter et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The stimulus set consists of cartoon stories that are usable as false-belief tasks, but have been designed in a way that suitable first-person perspective control questions can also be applied to all stories.</s><s>Cartoon stories consisting of three sequentially presented pictures are shown, and participants are instructed to either count the number of animate objects (self-cognitive), to state whether the protagonist can see more or less animate objects than in the previous picture (third-person cognitive), whether they feel better or worse than during the picture presented before (first-person affective), or whether the protagonist feels better or worse than during the previous picture (other-affective).</s></p><p><s>Notably, that stimulus set is devoid of any direct indicators of the protagonists' affective states, like expressive facial elements.</s></p><p><s>Here, we present a stimulus set (The ToMenovela) that was specifically designed to combine the high ecological validity of the MASC and the MET with the applicability of first-person control tasks as in the cartoon task by Schnell and Walter.</s><s>We chose to base the task on photographs rather than movies, in order to make it more suitable for event-related fMRI and EEG studies.</s><s>To achieve high ecological validity, we set up a fictional circle of eight friends (four male and four female; see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and designed a background story that contains biographies and personalities of each protagonist as well as the relationships between the characters.</s><s>Each of the characters possesses stable characteristics (traits) that are distinct from one another (e.g., homely, outgoing, artistic, etc.).</s><s>Based on this social arrangement, we scripted a series of scenes that would be comprehensible from a single still photograph.</s><s>We aimed to balance the scenes with respect to location (indoor vs. outdoor) and appearance of the characters (each scene depicts at least two of the protagonists).</s><s>After selection of the suitable stimuli, we collected normative data on the stimulus set in a cohort of 61 healthy study participants (31 women, 30 men), in order to obtain normative data with respect to content, emotional salience and valence, as well as cognitive and affective ToM.</s><s>Because emotion recognition constitutes an important facet of human social cognition, the scenes were designed to Ekman's basic emotions (happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ekman et al., 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ekman and</ref><ref type="bibr">Friesen, 1975, 1978)</ref> to a various degree, and the evaluation contained specific questions testing for emotion recognition (see Methods section for details).</s><s>One important reason for including Ekman's emotions was the potential for future clinical applications: Emotion recognition and cognitive ToM show parallel deficits in certain neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Sparks et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barbato et al., 2015)</ref> or temporal lobe epilepsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amlerova et al., 2014)</ref>, but may be differentially affected in other conditions like Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gregory et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Freedman et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the inclusion of Ekman's emotions may be useful for future clinical applications.</s></p><p><s>As will be outlined in the following sections, the ToMenovela has several potential advantages for future studies of human social cognition:</s></p><p><s>(1) With respect to ecological validity, the use of a defined group of protagonists may induce a sense of familiarity, thereby accounting for the fact that most social interactions in daily life occur with individuals with whom humans are at least to some extent familiar.</s><s>(2) Also for the purpose of high ecological validity, scenes were designed to differ in their emotional salience and valence, but we avoided extreme emotional situations, in order to match the content of the scenes with the daily-life experience of the likely study participants.</s><s>(3) By using photographs, the stimulus set is highly suitable for event-related neuroimaging studies.</s><s>(4) Finally, beyond social cognition, the stimuli may also be suitable for studies of other cognitive processes like higher-level vision, memory, or face and scene processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Zweynert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hofstetter et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rossion et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p><s>In order to generate a stimulus set of pictures depicting daily-life social interactions for use in future studies of social cognition, we scripted a total of 220 distinct daily-life scenes, 193 of which were subsequently staged and photographed (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> for example scenes).</s><s>Because we aimed to generate stimuli that would be particularly suitable for neuroimaging studies, we opted for photographs rather than video clips.</s><s>Two scenes were excluded due to technical problems, and one due to ambiguous evaluation results, resulting in a final set of 190 scenes.</s></p><p><s>In a subsequent validation study, each scene was rated with respect to principal content, cognitive and affective firstand third-person perspective, emotional valence along six basic emotions (happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ekman et al., 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ekman and</ref><ref type="bibr">Friesen, 1975, 1978)</ref>.</s><s>Those ratings were complemented by two free-text open questions, and the response data will be reported in a future publication.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of the Stimulus Material</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Script</head><p><s>We first developed an initial sketch of eight distinct human characters that constitute a circle of friends with diverse relationships (a long-term married couple, a new romantic relationship, two sisters, colleagues, high school friends, the "new guy in town", etc.). Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> describes the biography and personality traits of the main characters and the interpersonal relations within the group.</s></p><p><s>We next scripted a total of 220 scenes, each of which was to depict at least two of the eight main characters.</s><s>Each scene was constructed with respect to general content, basic emotions (happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise), dramatic setting, characters displayed, requisites, and location.</s><s>The scripts also included mindsets of the different protagonists instructing the actors to feel and express specific emotions (for example scripts, see Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1A,B</ref>).</s><s>When scripting the scenes, we aimed to balance the appearance of the eight main characters, basic emotions and location (indoor vs. outdoor).</s><s>Due to external conditions during the shooting of the scenes (e.g., sicknesses of actors or unexpected weather changes), some scenes deviated in details from their original script.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Team</head><p><s>We recruited eight professional and semi-professional actors as main cast and, depending on the specific scene, additional experienced lay actors.</s><s>The cast for the main characters and reoccurring background actors were recruited in early 2013.</s><s>The final ensemble consisted of two professionally educated actors and six amateurs with previous stage experience (drama and/or music).</s><s>The actors were known to each other prior to the shootings and specifically selected based on their certain style and personality, although it should be noted that their FIGURE 1 | Description of the main characters and interpersonal relations within the group.</s><s>The names and biographies shown here were used in our evaluation study, but future researchers should be readily able to adapt them to their needs.</s><s>Suggested English names in italics are suggestions from the authors to replace the German names used during evaluation.</s></p><p><s>actual biography and personality differ from that of the fictional characters described here.</s><s>All actors gave written informed consent for the use of the resulting photographs for research purposes.</s></p><p><s>All main actors were familiarized with their respective character by authors MCH, a trained psychologist, and BR who holds a B.A. in theater studies and has extensive previous experience in directing.</s><s>MCH and BR also directed and supervised the shootings of all scenes.</s></p><p><s>Photographs were acquired and processed by Sven Reichelt 2 , a photographer with extensive previous experience in portrait photography.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results on Third-Person ToM: Agreement across Raters</head><p><s>Analysis for the cognitive and affective ToM conditions revealed that only a small subset of images yielded ambiguous responses.</s><s>In the cognitive condition ("Who can see more people?"),</s><s>15 photographs were rated as ambiguous among female participants, and nine among male participants (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>In the affective ToM condition ("Does person A or B feel better?"), nineteen images were rated as ambiguous by both men and women, although there was only partial overlap.</s><s>Depending on future researchers' need for unambiguous stimulus material, scenes with little or no disagreement can be selected from our stimulus set.</s><s>The detailed results of the rating procedure are available along with the stimulus set.</s><s>It should be noted at this point that a certain degree of ambiguity of the scenes may be unavoidable, given that our focus was on ecological validity of the stimulus material, and ambiguity of certain stimuli is most likely not unique to the ToMenovela.</s><s>For example, rating studies of the well-established IAPS stimuli suggest that several pictures did not receive high ratings on the initially intended emotions in a normative rating procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barke et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, some researchers may want to explicitly include ambiguous scenes, for example in order to vary cognitive load or task difficulty.</s><s>Most ToM or mentalizing tasks currently used simplified settings, unimodal structures or highly simplified fictional characters.</s><s>As mentalizing can be conceptualized as "an executive component managing the multiple aspects of representations that are concurrently activated by the inherently complex everyday social interactions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brunet-Gouet et al., 2011)</ref>, we suggest that the naturalistic setting employed in our paradigm invariably includes some degree of ambiguity, at least in a subset of the stimuli, while rather accurately representing daily life social interactions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship of Stimulus Ratings with Self-report Measures of Social Cognition</head><p><s>Correlational analyses revealed a negative relationship between decisiveness in the third-person affective condition and the empathic concern subscale of the SPF (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>This may appear somewhat surprising, as this negative correlation suggests that participants with higher empathic concern show more difficulties in judging an individual's emotion.</s><s>On the other hand, there is considerable debate with respect to potential subdivisions of the ToM construct into different subprocesses like emotion recognition, understanding of causality, or the ability to distinguish knowledge and facts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kanske et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a distinction has been suggested between affective empathy, affective ToM/cognitive empathy, and cognitive ToM <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Walter, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Schaafsma et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kanske et al. (2015)</ref> could recently demonstrate that empathy and ToM can be orthogonalized within the same task at both the behavioral and neural level.</s><s>With respect to the present results, this notion points to the possibility that increased empathic concern may induce difficulties in some individuals when it comes to making (comparative) decisions about other people's feelings.</s><s>One limitation in this context is that we did not record reaction time data, which would provide a more objective measure to further substantiate this interpretation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</head><p><s>It should be noted that, as of now, expert evaluation of the ToMenovela has not been completed, and thus the stimulus set does not represent a performance test as of yet, which can be used for investigating mentalizing skills or deficits at the behavioral level.</s><s>Future studies are planned that will obtain both expert ratings on the stimulus set and ratings from clinical populations like individuals with autism spectrum disorders, both of which will be used to establish concurrent and discriminant validity.</s><s>In addition, other researchers may develop new questions applicable to our stimulus set, for example with respect to social cue recognition or potential gender-related differences in ToM for male versus female characters.</s><s>We have summarized the purpose of each question used in the initial evaluation, along with potential use cases in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>, in order to provide suggestions for future applications of the ToMenovela stimuli.</s></p></div>
