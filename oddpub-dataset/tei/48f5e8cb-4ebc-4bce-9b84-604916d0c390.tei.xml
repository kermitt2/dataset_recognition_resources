independent IgE-  As IgE regulation was independent of the inducing signals, namely OVA sensitization or parasite infection, a common signaling cascade is likely, e.g., control of IgE class-switch recombination.</s><s>Previously it was shown that VDR activation inhibits IgE switch transcript expression (4) by recruitment of a trans-repressive VDR-DNA complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, other important molecules for IgE class-switching are targeted by VDR as shown before by reduced NF-kB activation and expression of its target in B cells, aicda <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>These data were confirmed in mice using a synthetic low-calcemic VDR agonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> or VDR-KO mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Also, specific IgG1 and IgA were increased in the plasma of sensitized Cyp27b1-KO mice.</s><s>The data suggest that endogenous calcitriol controls these Ig classes, beyond specific mechanisms as shown for IgE, by reducing the T cell reactivity or general mechanisms of the class-switch machinery in mice such as downregulation of AID as shown by us previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, IgE induction by sensitization and helminth infection follows different signals, e.g., induction of Th2 cells by thymic stromal lymphopoietin or thymic stromal lymphopoietin-independent suppression of Th1 polarization, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our data support that endogenous calcitriol synthesis reduces T cell costimulation and/or central molecules in the isotype switching process, such as AID and NF-kB in B cells.</s></p><p><s>We identified that specific IgE concentrations are also increased in mice with T cell-specific Cyp27b1-KO as well as the numbers of OVA-IgE secreting cells.</s><s>This supports the functional relevance of the Cyp27b1 mRNA expression in lymphocytes.</s><s>Our data support that although kidney-derived calcitriol will contribute to most of the serum calcitriol (physiologic range of 25-45 pg/ml) (30), these concentrations are below the VDR-activating threshold in B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, endogenous calcitriol from activated immune cells in lymphoid tissues is important in a paracrine and/or autocrine fashion for the immune functions of calcitriol, as discussed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref> and extending the knowledge to IgE regulation by genetic evidence.</s><s>Moreover, VDR function in murine B lymphocytes, but not T lymphocytes, contributes to the control of sensitization-induced specific IgE, as shown recently in lymphocyte-specific KO mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our data suggest that endogenous calcitriol from T cells acts on the VDR in B cells to reduce IgE in vivo.</s><s>However, endogenous calcitriol derived from other immune cells and/or the kidney contributes to IgE regulation, as the calcitriol effect was not abolished completely by lymphocyte-specific knockout.</s></p><p><s>In addition to a function of endogenous calcitriol in the isotype switching, we determined altered frequencies of OVA-specific ASC in the spleen and bone marrow.</s><s>Our data support the previous finding that endogenous calcitriol can alter the migration of specific immune cells, however, the general trafficking into spleen is not affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to a previous report on reduced differentiation of B cells to Ab-secreting human plasmablasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, we detected normal frequencies in mature B cell subsets and plasma cells in aged Cyp27b1-KO mice.</s><s>Only B cell progenitors in the bone marrow were marginally reduced, potentially through preclinical bone abnormalities such as osteomalacia <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>Supporting our data, the immune cell compartments are grossly intact in Cyp27b1-KO mice of a different genetic background <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, we showed increased numbers of OVA-IgG1 ASCs in the spleen of Cyp27b1-KO mice along with strong enhancement of Ig production, supporting and confirming previous data that VDR is not influencing the plasma cell differentiation as such, but rather specific activation and differentiation processes including IgE class-switch.</s><s>However, B cell-independent mechanisms of IgE control by endogenous calcitriol cannot be excluded by our data, e.g., through regulatory T cell differentiation by calcitriol-primed dendritic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref> and/or IL-10-secreting Tr1 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>.</s><s>Although Th2 polarization by VDR including from VDR-KO mice was suggested by previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, our data do not support a strong Th2 differentiation, as the IgE-response was increased in the absence of endogenous calcitriol.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, in this study we show that endogenous calcitriol reduces the humoral IgE and IgG1 response to OVA sensitization or parasite infection.</s><s>Therefore, vitamin D deficiency should be avoided to take advantage of the beneficial effects of endogenous calcitriol regarding bone health and IgE regulation.</s></p></div><figure
