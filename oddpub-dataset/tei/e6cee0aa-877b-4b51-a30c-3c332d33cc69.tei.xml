<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Interstitial fibrosis plays a key role in the development and progression of heart failure.</s><s>Here, we show that an enzyme that crosslinks collagen-Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2)-is essential for interstitial fibrosis and mechanical dysfunction of pathologically stressed hearts.</s><s>In mice, cardiac stress activates fibroblasts to express and secrete Loxl2 into the interstitium, triggering fibrosis, systolic and diastolic dysfunction of stressed hearts.</s><s>Antibody-mediated inhibition or genetic disruption of Loxl2 greatly reduces stress-induced cardiac fibrosis and chamber dilatation, improving systolic and diastolic functions.</s><s>Loxl2 stimulates cardiac fibroblasts through PI3K/AKT to produce TGF-b2, promoting fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation; Loxl2 also acts downstream of TGF-b2 to stimulate myofibroblast migration.</s><s>In diseased human hearts, LOXL2 is upregulated in cardiac interstitium; its levels correlate with collagen crosslinking and cardiac dysfunction.</s><s>LOXL2 is also elevated in the serum of heart failure (HF) patients, correlating with other HF biomarkers, suggesting a conserved LOXL2-mediated mechanism of human HF.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H</head><p><s>eart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death, with a mortality rate of B50% within five years of diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>This high mortality rate reflects inadequacy of modern therapy and calls for a new mechanistic paradigm for treatment.</s><s>A major cause of cardiac dysfunction is the adverse tissue remodelling with interstitial fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> , caused by various pathological insults that include hypertension and myocardial infarction, with the extent of interstitial fibrosis prognosticating clinical outcomes of the diseased heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Current therapies that improve HF survival primarily target the pathogenic mechanisms that occur within cardiomyocytes but not those mechanisms that take place outside cardiomyocytes in the interstitial space that houses collagen and fibroblasts.</s><s>This lack of direct therapy against interstitial mechanism of HF may contribute to the persistently high morbidity and mortality of HF.</s></p><p><s>The major causes of death in HF are ventricular arrhythmias and pump failure.</s><s>Although the arrhythmic death can be effectively prevented by implantable cardiac defibrillators, death from pump failure has become an even more pressing issue.</s><s>Cardiac systolic and diastolic pump functions are both compromised in patients suffering from HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).</s><s>However, current therapies only have moderate efficacy in systolic dysfunction and are ineffective for diastolic pump failure.</s><s>For patients having HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), who have primarily diastolic dysfunction, there is no proven therapy that can improve diastolic function and long-term outcome.</s><s>Therefore, an urgent need remains for novel, complementary medical therapies, which target maladaptive left ventricular tissue remodelling/fibrosis to improve systolic and diastolic functions of failing hearts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Interstitial fibrosis plays a key role in the development and progression of HF by causing adverse mechanical and electrical disturbances in the diseased hearts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Interstitial fibrosis impairs the electromechanical coordination between cardiomyocytes to compromise systolic contractility.</s><s>Fibrosis also increases ventricular stiffness and impairs diastolic relaxation and filling.</s></p><p><s>We found that Lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) is upregulated in the interstitium of diseased mouse and human hearts.</s><s>Increased LOXL2 expression leads to increased TGF-b2 production, triggering the formation and migration of myofibroblasts with enhanced collagen deposition and crosslinking in the hypertrophic regions of stressed hearts.</s><s>These effects result in interstitial fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction.</s><s>The concept of targeting LOXL2 in HF is supported by our preclinical data from cell-based assays, pharmacological studies and mouse genetic models, as well as by the clinical evidence of elevated cardiac tissue and serum LOXL2 in HF patients and correlation of tissue LOXL2 level with fibrosis and cardiac physiological changes in HF patients.</s><s>The efficacy of anti-LOXL2 antibody and genetic LOXL2 disruption in relieving cardiac interstitial fibrosis and diastolic abnormalities is particularly salient, given the lack of direct therapy against cardiac fibrosis, and the increasing emphasis on diastolic dysfunction as an integral part of the heart failure syndrome.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Loxl2 proteins are elevated in the stressed mouse hearts.</s><s>We used transaortic constriction (TAC) to cause pressure overload and hypertrophy of the hearts of male mice at 6-8 weeks of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Quantitative PCR (qPCR), western blot analysis and immunostaining of left ventricles showed that Loxl2 was minimally expressed in sham-operated hearts, but it was highly upregulated within the first week of TAC, and the Loxl2 upregulation persisted for 410 weeks after TAC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Genes that encode other LOX isoforms (Lox, Loxl1, Loxl3 and Loxl4) were also upregulated in the stressed hearts but to a lesser extent and consistency than Loxl2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-e</ref>).</s><s>In TAC-stressed hearts, Loxl2 proteins were present in the interstitial space (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), which contains fibroblasts and collagen fibres.</s><s>The upregulation of Loxl2 in the interstitium was accompanied by transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts that are highly migratory (marked by expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)) and synthetic of collagen (marked by expression of collagen, type I, alpha 1 (Col1A); Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>The interstitium of TAC-stressed hearts, therefore, contains increased Loxl2 and collagenproducing myofibroblasts, providing the enzyme (Loxl2) and substrates (collagen) required for collagen crosslinking.</s><s>Indeed, TAC-stressed hearts showed increased interstitial collagen, which was primarily insoluble (crosslinked;

therapy.</s></p><p><s>In mechanically stressed hearts, LOXL2 expression is activated in the fibroblasts, which then release LOXL2 proteins into the interstitial space, particularly in the hypertrophic area where the mechanical stress is highest (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>This suggests that LOXL2 activation is a response of cardiac fibroblasts to enhanced mechanical stress to maintain structural integrity of the heart.</s><s>Indeed, LOXL2 elevation has multiple biological effects that  promote interstitial collagen formation.</s><s>LOXL2 not only triggers myofibroblast transformation to enhance collagen production (through PI3K-AKT-mTOR and TGF-b), but also augments collagen strength (by crosslinking collagen fibres).</s><s>LOXL2 also stimulates myofibroblasts migration to large areas of the heart, where these cells produce collagen fibres.</s><s>Collagen fibres, once released into the interstitial space, are crosslinked by LOXL2 to form bundles of collagen that are much stiffer than isolated collagen fibres.</s><s>Furthermore, activated fibroblasts secrete more LOXL2 and collagen, creating a positive feedback loop to sustain the fibrotic process.</s><s>All these factors, in combination, trigger diffuse interstitial fibrosis of pathologically stressed hearts.</s><s>The LOXL2-mediated stress reaction, although capable of reinforcing tissue strength in the face of increased mechanical stress, is ultimately maladaptive.</s><s>Excessive amount of collagen fibres in cardiac interstitial space impede coronary vasodilation, oxygen diffusion and electromechanical coordination between cardiomyocytes, causing contractile abnormalities (systolic pump dysfunction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Meanwhile, the
