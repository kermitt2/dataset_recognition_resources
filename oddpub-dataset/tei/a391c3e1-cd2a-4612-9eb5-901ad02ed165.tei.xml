<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The results of this prospective randomized study show that BSCPB with 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine administered before induction of general anesthesia during thyroid surgery is associated with a significant decrease in intraoperative sevoflurane consumption when entropy is added to standard intraoperative management.</s></p><p><s>Utilizing electroencephalography-based monitors, such as entropy, to judge the depth of general anesthesia and the level of hypnosis during surgery results in reduced sevoflurane consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies used an automated closed BSCPB and sevoflurane consumption circuit loop to deliver sevoflurane and state entropy to monitor the depth of anesthesia.</s><s>We used response entropy, which depicts not only the state of anesthesia but also the state of frontalis activity, representing a reflex response to pain in the event of inadequate analgesia.</s><s>Sevoflurane was controlled manually, which may explain the higher consumption in our study compared to previous ones.</s><s>Response entropy was chosen because it represents not only the state of the brain but also the degree of reflex suppression, which is a component of balanced anesthesia.</s><s>We believe that entropy monitoring helped us maintain adequate anesthesia depth in the present study, as none of our patients complained of recalling any intraoperative event when assessed 24 h after surgery.</s><s>The volume of sevoflurane consumed was calculated and displayed by an inbuilt algorithm fed into the anesthesia workstation software.</s></p><p><s>The exact mechanism by which neural blockade results in a reduced requirement for anesthesia is not clear, but neuraxial anesthesia is associated with sedative properties.</s><s>Sedation has been reported in unpremedicated patients undergoing surgery under spinal anesthesia, and an association between of sensory block and degree of sedation was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Inhibition of tonic afferent spinal signaling to the brain may explain the decrease in alertness level following central neuraxial blockade.</s><s>Afferentation theory, as delineated by Lanier et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, states that tonic sensory and muscle-spindle activity maintains a state of wakefulness, which is likely integrated via the spinal cord in the reticular activating system.</s><s>Accordingly, an acute decrease in tonic afferent input would be expected to decrease the level of consciousness and thereby increase susceptibility to anesthetic agents.</s><s>This could also be one of the reasons why neural block-ade reduces anesthetic consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Blockade of pain pathways from the site of surgery using regional techniques, such as interpleural, epidural, and caudal blocks, also reduces anesthetic consumption and prolongs analgesia apart from providing stable intraoperative hemodynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The BSCPB in the present study likely reduced sevoflurane consumption by inhibiting afferent input to the brain.</s></p><p><s>The possibility of central nervous system (CNS) depression due to absorbed local anesthetics cannot be ruled out.</s><s>Systemically absorbed local anesthetics have some depressant effects on the CNS.</s><s>Inadvertent intravenous administration of a large dose of lidocaine results in suppression of cortical activity, and systemic infusion of lidocaine reduces the sevoflurane requirement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>However, the amount of local anesthetic used in the present study may have been insufficient to induce CNS depression.</s></p><p><s>The combination of superficial and deep cervical plexus block is expected to provide better analgesia than superficial cervical plexus block alone.</s><s>The incidence of complications is higher with a deep cervical plexus block, apart from the technique being technically more difficult.</s><s>Hence, we resorted to a superficial cervical plexus block alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A similar study involved 162 patients who underwent elective thyroid surgery: 52 received BSCPB (12 ml on each side) with 0.5% bupivacaine, 54 received 0.5% levobupivacaine, and the remainder received normal saline before the induction of general anesthesia.</s><s>The depth of anesthesia was monitored using the auditory evoked potential.</s><s>It was observed that mean end-tidal desflurane concentration decreased significantly in both groups compared to the control group, fewer patients in both intervention groups required analgesics, and it took longer before the Trends in response entropy (RE) in both groups.</s><s>RE was &lt; 60 at all time points in both groups and comparable between the groups (P &gt; 0.05).</s><s>Group A: BSCPB with Bupivacaine (test group), Group B: BSCPB with saline (control group).</s></p></div>
