<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hydrogels with tunable stress relaxation</head><p><s>First we modulated the nanoscale architecture of hydrogels to develop a set of materials with a wide range of stress relaxation rates, but a similar initial elastic modulus.</s><s>As hydrogels exhibiting minimal degradation were desired, the polysaccharide alginate was chosen for these studies since mammalian cells do not express specific enzymes that can degrade this polymer <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Alginate presents no intrinsic integrin binding sites for cells and minimal protein absorption, but cell adhesion can be promoted through covalent coupling of the RGD cell adhesion peptide to the alginate chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>While the stress relaxation properties of hydrogels have been altered previously by changing crosslinking chemistries <ref type="bibr">32 , 35</ref> or polymer concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , we developed an alternative materials approach to control the rate of stress relaxation of hydrogels with a single crosslinker type and the same concentration of alginate.</s><s>We hypothesized that by using different molecular weight polymers in combination with different crosslinking densities of calcium, which ionically crosslinks alginate, the stress relaxation properties of the resulting hydrogels could be modulated due to the altered connectivity and chain mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> in the network (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Any associated decrease in the initial elastic modulus resulting from decreased polymer molecular weight could be compensated for by increased crosslinking.</s><s>Further, we hypothesized that covalent coupling of short PEG spacers to the alginate would provide a steric hindrance to crosslinking of alginate chains and enhance stress relaxation in the gel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Both approaches would alter the net avidity between individual polymer chains and therefore be expected to control the relaxation behavior.</s><s>This was confirmed, as it was found that by lowering the molecular weight of the alginate from 280 kDa to 35 kDa, and further by coupling 5 kDa PEG spacers to the 35 kDa alginate, the rate of stress relaxation was enhanced markedly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, the time for the initial stress of the material to be relaxed to half its value during a stress relaxation test (τ 1/2 ) was modulated from ~1 hour to ~1 minute, while holding alginate polymer concentration and the initial gel elastic modulus constant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>-e, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>These timescales span a range similar to that measured in various tissues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Further, this range of timescales is relevant to cell behaviors as cells are thought to respond to force oscillations over a timescale of ~1 second 37 , exert traction forces on a timescale of minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , and undergo cell spreading on a timescale of minutes to hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>The stress relaxation behavior of these materials follows that of a 2-element Maxwell-Weichert linear viscoelastic model (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>It was previously shown that stress relaxation measured in ionically crosslinked alginate gels represents viscoelasticity of the hydrogel and unbinding of ionic crosslinks followed by matrix flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>This interpretation was confirmed by a measurement of the frequency dependent rheology of the gels, as an increase in the rate of stress relaxation correlated with a greater rate of decrease in the shear storage modulus with decreasing frequency (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>).</s><s>Also consistent with this interpretation is the near complete relaxation of the stress, indicating that these matrices can be plastically deformed/ mechanically remodeled and that the shorter the τ 1/2, the faster the matrices remodel under stress.</s><s>Homogeneity of the gels at the microscale was confirmed with confocal fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, the mechanical properties of these gels and the dry polymer mass of the gels were both stable over a timescale of at least 7 days under tissue culture conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f,g</ref>).</s><s>In combination, these demonstrate that the degradation of these matrices is negligible over this timescale.</s><s>Taken together, these demonstrate an approach to control matrix stress relaxation, independent of the initial elastic modulus and polymer concentration, and without hydrogel degradation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact of stress relaxation on cell spreading and proliferation</head><p><s>With this set of materials, the effect of the rate of substrate stress relaxation on cell spreading and proliferation in 3D culture was investigated, and striking differences in both were observed.</s><s>First, 3T3 fibroblasts were encapsulated within RGD coupled alginate hydrogels with varying stress relaxation rates but all with an initial elastic modulus of ~9 kPa (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>).</s><s>Both cell spreading and proliferation were suppressed within materials with long timescales for stress relaxation (τ 1/2 ~ 1 hour), and the rounded cell morphologies typical of cells in non-degradable elastic hydrogels were observed under this condition.</s><s>Strikingly, both spreading and proliferation were found to increase with faster stress relaxation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>-c, Spearman's rank correlation, p &lt;0.0001 for both).</s><s>The influence of substrate stress relaxation on cell spreading and proliferation was enhanced when RGD cell adhesion ligand density was increased in gels with faster relaxation, indicating that the effect of stress relaxation is mediated through integrin based adhesions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>, Spearman's rank correlation, p &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>This enhancement in spreading and proliferation was attributable to altered stress relaxation alone, as the initial elastic modulus and alginate concentration was constant, and RGD cell adhesion ligand density was also held constant at either 0, 150, or 1500 μM.</s><s>The observation of striking changes in cell shape in the rapidly relaxing hydrogels suggest mechanical remodeling of the hydrogel by the cells, as these hydrogels are nanoporous and non-degradable so that cell shape change and proliferation must be accommodated by matrix displacement.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook</head><p><s>This work demonstrates an approach to modulating stress relaxation properties in alginate hydrogels, and indicates that substrate stress relaxation has a profound effect on cell biology.</s><s>Several recent studies have used alternative material approaches to examine the role of altered substrate viscoelasticity on cell biology.</s><s>These include modulating both the covalent crosslinking density and polymer concentration in acrylamide hydrogels to tune the loss modulus for 2D culture <ref type="bibr">30 , 31</ref> , utilizing different stoichiometry of dynamic covalent crosslinkers with different affinities to modulate stress relaxation in PEG hydrogels <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , or use of covalent versus physical crosslinking of alginate hydrogels <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>These approaches revealed that an enhanced loss modulus and substrate creep led to increased spreading and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in 2D culture <ref type="bibr">30 , 31</ref> , and that increased substrate stress relaxation promoted cell spreading and proliferation in 2D culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and altered cell morphology in 3D culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>The approach described in this paper is unique in that only one type of crosslinking is utilized, while maintaining compatibility with 3D culturing of cells and holding alginate concentration constant.</s><s>The nanoscale architecture of these gels does not capture the fibrillarity of some natural ECM in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>However, this approach does allow modulation of stress relaxation properties over a range similar to that observed in various tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and enables presentation of a homogenous microenvironment to cells, providing a well-controlled system for probing cell-ECM interactions.</s><s>There is some coupling between the initial elastic modulus and the range of stress relaxation timescales for alginate with a given molecular weight and PEG coupling state, as stiffening the hydrogels from 9 kPa to 17 kPa shifted the range of stress relaxation timescales from 3300s -70s to 1300s -40s.</s><s>Generally, this approach to decouple the initial elastic modulus from relaxation rate, and the associated development of rapidly relaxing gels, may be useful in a variety of material applications.</s></p><p><s>Mechanistically, we find that the enhancement in cell spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by faster matrix stress relaxation is mediated through integrin based adhesions, local clustering of RGD ligands, actomyosin contractility, and nuclear localization of YAP (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>).</s><s>MSC differentiation depended strongly upon the initial elastic modulus in viscoelastic matrices in 3D, with osteogenesis only occurring when the initial elastic modulus was 17 kPa.</s><s>In contrast, MSC differentiation loses sensitivity to matrix stiffness in covalently crosslinked hydrogels 13 , which are presumably elastic, highlighting the importance of stress relaxation in cell responding to mechanical cues of ECM.</s><s>Inhibition of actomyosin contractility completely abrogated osteogenesis, indicating the role of contractile forces in sensing stiffness and stress relaxation, and driving osteogenesis.</s><s>As forces exerted by cells on the weakly crosslinked alginate hydrogels are relaxed through unbinding of ionic crosslinks and matrix flow, actomyosin contractility coupled to the matrix through binding to RGD ligands mechanically clusters RGD ligands over time in gels with faster relaxation.</s><s>RGD ligand and integrin clustering in turn is known to activate signaling pathways <ref type="bibr">44 , 45</ref> and has been associated previously with osteogenic differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , providing a mechanistic link between altered stress relaxation and modulation of biological signaling and long term cell fate.</s><s>While Rho-mediated contractility has been found to be critical for osteogenesis in 3D culture in degradable hydrogels <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , inhibition of Rho did not diminish osteogenesis in the non-degradable alginate hydrogels, and in some cases enhanced it.</s><s>Further, previous work has found that an increased loss modulus in acrylamide substrates increases Rac activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , whereas inhibition of Rac did not diminish osteogenesis in alginate hydrogels.</s></p><p><s>These suggest that the role of Rho and Rac in osteogenesis is context dependent.</s></p><p><s>While many previous studies have highlighted the importance of matrix remodeling through proteolytic degradation on cell function, the altered behavior of cells in rapidly relaxing gels suggests that the ability of cells to mechanically remodel their matrix is also an essential component of cell-ECM interactions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s><s>In particular, it is likely that the greater malleability of fast relaxing hydrogels that enabled increased RGD ligand clustering on short timescales also facilitated the physical aspects of the processes of cell spreading, proliferation, and formation of an interconnected bone-like matrix by osteogenically differentiated MSCs over longer timescales, in the absence of matrix degradation.</s><s>Similar to the observed trend of diminishing osteogenic differentiation with decreased stress relaxation, a recent study showed that osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was inhibited in nondegradable covalently crosslinked gels, which presumably cannot be remodeled mechanically, though differences in material systems preclude a direct comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Previous work has highlighted the effect of matrix degradation in bone regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> or cartilage formation 10 in implantable scaffolds, as well as on cell shape and MSC differentiation in 3D culture in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Our work suggests the possibility that the effect of degradation may be in part due to enhanced matrix stress relaxation in regions of the matrix that exhibit substantial degradation.</s><s>Indeed, it was recently found that proteolytic degradation of covalently crosslinked PEG hydrogels by encapsulated MSCs locally converts elastic matrices into viscoelastic fluids <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Broadly, these results highlight the importance of considering matrix stress relaxation as a fundamental signal in understanding the basics of cell-ECM interactions and the underlying biophysics of mechanotransduction, since most physiological extracellular matrices exhibit some degree of stress relaxation.</s><s>These findings point towards the use of stress relaxation as a design parameter for materials in tissue engineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , particularly in the context of regulating cell proliferation and promoting bone regeneration.</s></p></div>
