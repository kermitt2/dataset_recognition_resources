<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This report is the first to specifically characterize bacteriuria in patients with urinary retention to BPH.</s><s>These patients require special attention of urologists because they are common in our departments, undergo transurethral procedures, that bear high risk of infectious complications and also they may be a source of contamination with multidrug resistance strains.</s><s>Finally, during several weeks with a catheter, men are prone to infective complications, such as epididymitis, prostatitis, and symptomatic lower urinary tract infections (UTIs).</s><s>As current urine culture is rarely available when complications arise, empirical therapy is usually implemented and knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility pattern becomes crucial.</s></p><p><s>Our data show several characteristic trends in the composition and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial flora that occurred during the studied period.</s><s>First, the percentage of Gram-positive bacteria increased significantly.</s><s>Whereas in the 90's it could be assumed that Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for vast majority of CAUTI (90% of patients had Gram-negative species only), later the percentage of patients contaminated with Gram-positive only or with mixed flora involving Gram-positive germs increased significantly.</s><s>Gram-positive strains in Period 1 were few and all susceptible to amox/clav and imipenem.</s><s>After ten years appearance of Enterococcus faecium and resistant Staphylococci caused that those agents had become less effective.</s><s>At the same time susceptibility Gram-negative flora to fluoroquinolones decreased significantly while susceptibility to cotrimoxazole and gentamicin increased at the same time.</s><s>The trend for fluoroquinolones has already been reported extensively and attributed to the Not all agents were tested in all isolates.</s><s>Only those agents were included that were tested in &gt; 90% isolates.</s><s>In 2004-2006 resistance to imipenem was found in 2 g-negative strains and in 1 Gram-positive strain.</s><s>No resistance against vancomycin was found at that period.</s><s>In 2011-15 resistance to imipenem was found in 2 Gram-negative strains, and resistance to vancomycin to in 1 Gram-postive strain In years 1994-96 susceptibility to imipenem was not tested, however Gram-positive bacteria susceptible to ampicillin or amoxicillin were considered susceptible to imipenem The * or † character was used to determine which pair of values in the row was compared with a statistical test enormous use of these antibiotics in medicine and in livestock breeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The improvement in the effectiveness of cotrimoxazole and gentamicin is probably related to lower popularity of both drugs but this issue was investigated to a lesser extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Whether these trends are universal or not is hard to conclude as results reported by investigators vary.</s></p><p><s>Studies on antimicrobial resistance of bacteria causing catheter-associated infections are scarce, and none are focused on this specific group of patients.</s><s>An analysis by Jiménez-Alcaide et al. included all patients with any type of urinary catheter or stent and symptomatic UTI hospitalized in 2012-2013 in a single urological ward <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>About a quarter of their group consisted of patients with indwelling catheters on admission who might be considered similar to our patients.</s><s>Another group analyzed samples of urine collected from unspecific catheterized patients in India with UTI symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Valuable data on CAUTI among patients in US acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities also come from reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network.</s><s>A recent update covered the years 2011-2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and reported on over 138,000 CAUTI events.</s><s>Data on bacteriuria in catheterized patients in nursing homes from a single Swedish county were presented in a cross-sectional study from 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, but in contrast to other studies, this group consisted mainly of asymptomatic women and men only 7% used antibiotics when the sample was collected.</s><s>However, age, sex, and time of catheterization (70% catheterized longer than 12 months) make this study significantly different from ours.</s><s>Some CAUTI studies have focused on a specific bacteria species (e.g., Proteus spp.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) and others on specific resistance mechanisms (e.g., extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>).</s><s>In those reports, the groups also were not disease-specific, and time of catheterization was not reported.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, our study reports on a very well-defined group of men with one urological condition, catheterized for a period of several weeks to months.</s><s>It also offers a 20-year perspective on changes in microbial composition and antimicrobial resistance in a single center, which is unique among papers on CAUTI.</s><s>Due to the lack of more similar studies, it was decided to compare our results with the aforementioned analyses.</s><s>A high rate of Gram-positive bacteria in catheter-associated flora was confirmed in some of the mentioned studies (16% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, 21% <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, 31% <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>) but not all (2% <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>), which may reflect geographical variability.</s><s>Gram-positive bacteria reported in our series are highly susceptible to amox/clav.</s><s>However, in the male genitourinary tract, this antibiotic, as well as ampicillin, is not always effective because of low penetration to prostatic tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>Instead high penetrability has been confirmed for carbapenems and vancomycin <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, E. faecalis resistance to amox/clav was already reported to be as high as 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>With an increasing number of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) -colonized patients in our department (data on file) and reported by other groups (8% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>), we predict that BPH patients with catheters colonized by these germs will soon appear.</s></p><p><s>The choice of antibiotic for treatment of Gramnegative species is a much more difficult task.</s><s>Rising resistance to fluoroquinolones means that this group, which penetrates very well to prostatic tissue, should not be used any more for empirical treatment of complicated Only when all strains isolated from a single patient were susceptible to one antibiotic or to a combination susceptibility in this analysis was recognized.</s><s>When one or more strains were resistant, intermediate susceptible or not examined for a specific antibiotic non-susceptible status was given.</s><s>Numbers and percentages of patients with susceptible flora relative to all patients with bacteriuria are reported Amox/clav amoxicillin with clavulanic acid The * or † character was used to determine which pair of values in the row was compared with a statistical test UTIs.</s><s>A significant decrease in resistance to cotrimoxazole still does not mean that this drug can replace fluoroquinolones.</s><s>Among agents available in oral formulations, none can be used without urine culture.</s><s>Despite methodological differences, a high resistance to fluoroquinolones and cotrimoxazole is convincingly confirmed by other studies (17% <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, 33% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, 50% <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The ESBL prevalence of 20% in our group presents the same level as US and Spanish hospitalized patients with CAUTI <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> and among European participants in the SMART study <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Toner et al. found that an indwelling catheter almost doubles the risk for ESBL-producing strains in urine <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Susceptibility to amikacin among Gram-negative species is still high, but significant prevalence of Enterococci makes this drug poor choice if used alone.</s><s>Carbapenems is the last resort, however, as in the case of VRE, we can predict growth in the number of carbapenemase-producing strains in the near future.</s><s>At the Spanish urological department, resistance against amikacin was less frequent than against carbapenems (3% vs 10% for E. coli) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The US CDC has reported similar numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>An older global study on nosocomial UTI showed highest susceptibility to imipenem <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>A low prevalence of two species, Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are the most common producers of carbapenemase, may explain the difference between our results and those in other reports cited here.</s><s>Apart from geographical variations, exposure to hospital strains also may be a reason.</s><s>Although our patients visited only outpatient clinics before they entered the ward for surgery, patients from other studies usually were recruited among already hospitalized populations, some of them after urological procedures.</s><s>In Swedish nursing homes, carbapenemase-bearing strains were also not reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Considering antimicrobial resistance, our results can be placed between those obtained from hospitalized patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> and patients in Swedish decentralized geriatric care facilities where strict adherence to the Swedish Strategic Programme against Antibiotic Resistance recommendations is a rule.</s><s>There are some limitations of this study.</s><s>The main one is the fact that the data come from a single center.</s><s>Differences in species composition and susceptibility between different continents, countries and centers result from local patterns of antibiotics use, hygienic conditions, migration, or the time of the average catheterization time.</s><s>Similar analyses should be performed locally in other centers and promotion of this issue was one of our additional goal.</s><s>Another weakness is the heterogeneous composition of antibiograms.</s><s>Therefore, only a few antibiotics were repeatedly evaluated in the three Periods studied.</s><s>Also, we did not have the original minimum inhibitory concentration data and the standard of susceptibility is different prior to and after 2010.</s></p><p><s>Although our findings do not refer strictly to the situation in other countries and other clinical conditions, we think that taking into account the trends identified in other studies, the significance of these results remains broadly relevant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Between 1994 and 2015 substantial rise in the incidence of Gram-positive species in catheter-associated bacterial flora was discovered.</s><s>This fact, together with fluctuations in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, make necessary a switch in empirical therapy of CAUTI from Gram-negative targeted agents to therapy effective also to Gram-positive species <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.The choice of drugs in the empirical treatment of genitourinary infection in a male with a catheter was and still is limited to amikacin or carbapenems for Enterobacteriaceae and amox/clav, carbapenems or vancomycin for Enterococci.</s><s>The final choice depends on the localization and severity of infection as well as renal function.</s><s>Monitoring of catheter-associated bacteria resistance patterns reflects trends in the outpatient population, and these surveillance efforts should be continued independent from monitoring hospital-acquired infections.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Bacterial species isolated from urine of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and indwelling catheters in given time periods</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Species</cell><cell>1994-96</cell><cell>2004-06</cell><cell>2011-15</cell><cell>P value</cell></row><row><cell>Escherichia coli</cell><cell>30 (22%)</cell><cell>34 (25%)</cell><cell>40 (27%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Enterobacter cloacae</cell><cell>14 (10%)</cell><cell>11 (8%)</cell><cell>13 (9%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Proteus mirabilis</cell><cell>19 (14%)*</cell><cell>12 (9%) †</cell><cell>5 (3%)* †</cell><cell>* 0.002  † 0.05</cell></row><row><cell>Klebsiella pneumoniae</cell><cell>14 (10%)</cell><cell>6 (4%)</cell><cell>14 (9%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Klebsiella oxytoca</cell><cell>1 (1%)</cell><cell>4 (3%)</cell><cell>3 (2%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Pseudomonas aureginosa</cell><cell>17 (12%)*</cell><cell>5 (4%)*</cell><cell>14 (9%)</cell><cell>* 0.01</cell></row><row><cell>Acinetobacter baumannii</cell><cell>1 (1%)</cell><cell>4 (3%)</cell><cell>3 (2%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Citrobacter freundii</cell><cell>2 (1%)</cell><cell>3 (2%)</cell><cell>5 (3%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Serratia marcensens</cell><cell>1 (1%)</cell><cell>4 (3%)</cell><cell>2 (1%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Other Gram negative</cell><cell>26 (19%)*</cell><cell>19 (14%)</cell><cell>11 (7%)*</cell><cell>* &lt; 0.01</cell></row><row><cell>Total Gram negative</cell><cell>125 (91%)* †</cell><cell>102 (74%)*</cell><cell>110 (73%) †</cell><cell>* &lt; 0.001  † &lt; 0.001</cell></row><row><cell>Enterococcus faecalis</cell><cell>10 (7%)*</cell><cell>19 (14%)</cell><cell>28 (19%)*</cell><cell>* 0.002</cell></row><row><cell>Enterococcus faecium</cell><cell>0 (0%)*</cell><cell>8 (6%)* †</cell><cell>2 (1%) †</cell><cell>* 0.003  † 0.04</cell></row><row><cell>Staphylococcus aureus</cell><cell>2 (1%)</cell><cell>2 (1%)</cell><cell>1 (1%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Coagulase-negative staphylococci</cell><cell>1 (1%)</cell><cell>5 (4%)</cell><cell>5 (3%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Other Gram positive</cell><cell>0 (0%)</cell><cell>2 (1%)</cell><cell>4 (3%)</cell><cell>NS</cell></row><row><cell>Total Gram positive</cell><cell>13 (9%)* †</cell><cell>36 (26%)*</cell><cell>40 (27%) †</cell><cell>* &lt; 0.001  † 0.001</cell></row><row><cell>Total</cell><cell>138</cell><cell>138</cell><cell>150</cell><cell></cell></row></table></figure>
