<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch promotes SuFu ubiquitylation.</s><s>To identify the molecular mechanisms controlling SuFu activity, we set out to investigate the role of ubiquitylation in the regulation of SuFu.</s><s>First, we tested whether SuFu can be targeted for ubiquitylation by E3 ubiquitin ligases known to modulate Hh signalling, namely Itch, Nedd4 (HECT E3s), SCF βTrCP , CRL3 SPOP , CRL3 <ref type="bibr">REN</ref> , and CRL3 KCTD21 (Cullin-RING E3s).</s><s>We found that only Itch was able to ubiquitylate SuFu (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a, b</ref>) in cultured cells.</s><s>Accordingly, increasing amounts of Itch induced a progressive increase in the ubiquitylation of endogenous SuFu (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>), while no effect was observed with other HECT E3 ligases (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a, b</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether SuFu interacts with Itch, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments and demonstrated that Itch interacts with both exogenous (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) and endogenous SuFu (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) in cultured cells.</s><s>Direct interaction between GST-Itch and in vitro translated [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> S]-labelled SuFu, as well as between recombinant Itch and GST-SuFu, was also demonstrated by in vitro pull-down assays (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e, f</ref>).</s><s>The modular structural organisation of Itch consists of an N-terminal Ca 2+ -dependent phospholipid-binding C2 domain, four WW domains implicated in multiple protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal catalytic HECT domain (Fig. <ref type="figure">1g</ref>).</s><s>To identify the specific domains of Itch involved in the interaction with SuFu, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays using in vitro transcribed/translated SuFu and different GST-Itch proteins containing only the HECT catalytic domain, the four WW domains, or single WW domains (WW1, WW2, WW3, WW4).</s><s>We found that the WW1 and WW2 domains of Itch, but not WW3, WW4, or the HECT domain, directly bind to SuFu (Fig. <ref type="figure">1h-j</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Itch ubiquitylates SuFu by K63 linkage.</s><s>We next investigated the ability of Itch to ubiquitylate SuFu both in vivo and in vitro.</s><s>In cultured cells, ectopic expression of Itch, but not of the catalytically inactive ItchC830A mutant, induced the ubiquitylation of endogenous SuFu (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, Itch −/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) displayed decreased ubiquitylation of endogenous SuFu when compared to wild-type MEFs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>SuFu ubiquitylation was rescued by wild-type Itch, but not by its catalytically inactive mutant (ItchC830A) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The Itch-dependent ubiquitylation of SuFu was confirmed in vitro.</s><s>We used purified recombinant Itch in a reconstituted in vitro ubiquitylation system containing ubiquitin, E1, E2 (UbcH7), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and in vitro synthesised radiolabelled [ 35 S] SuFu as substrate.</s><s>High levels of SuFu ubiquitylation were observed in the presence of recombinant Itch (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), whereas a SuFu mutant in which all lysine residues were mutated to arginine (SuFu K-less) was not ubiquitylated (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To identify the specific lysine residues of SuFu that are ubiquitylated by Itch, we assessed the Itch-dependent ubiquitylation of SuFu mutated in lysine 257, 321, or 457, previously described as direct (K257) or potential (K321 and K457) SuFu ubiquitylation sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>).</s><s>We observed a significant reduction in the ubiquitylation of SuFuK321R and SuFuK457R mutants, as well as the SuFuK321/457R mutant, when compared to ubiquitylation of wild-type SuFu (Fig. <ref type="figure">2f</ref>, g and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>No decrease was observed in the Itch-mediated ubiquitylation of SuFu when lysine 257, previously identified as a ubiquitin acceptor site that induces SuFu proteasomal degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , was replaced by arginine (K257R) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Overall, these results indicate that Itch ubiquitylates SuFu on lysines 321 and 457.</s></p><p><s>To determine if Itch-induced ubiquitylation of SuFu primes it for proteasomal degradation, we examined the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on this event.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2h</ref>, proteasome inhibition did not cause accumulation of the Itchdependent ubiquitylation of SuFu.</s><s>Accordingly, ectopic expression of increasing amounts of Itch or its depletion by RNA interference did not result in any change in the exogenous or endogenous SuFu protein levels, indicating that the Itchdependent ubiquitylation of SuFu does not lead to SuFu degradation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2i-k</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, no changes in the half-life of SuFu were observed in Itch −/− MEFs compared to wild-type MEFs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2l</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we analysed the molecular mechanism by which Itch ligates ubiquitin to SuFu.</s><s>An in vitro ubiquitylation assay performed in the presence of in vitro transcribed/translated SuFu, GST-Itch, and ubiquitin (wild type or mutant) showed that Itch polyubiquitylates SuFu through lysine 63-but not lysine 48- mediated linkages.</s><s>Indeed, while a ubiquitin mutant in which K48 is replaced by arginine (K48R) was efficiently ligated to SuFu by Itch, a ubiquitin mutant in which K63 is replaced by arginine (K63R) was not linked to SuFu and showed a reduced formation of high polyubiquitin chains and a pattern similar to the one observed in the presence of the K-less ubiquitin mutant, in which all lysine residues are mutated.</s><s>Accordingly, the ubiquitin mutant containing only lysine 63 (K63O), but not the ubiquitin mutant containing only lysine 48 (K48O), was efficiently ligated to SuFu by Itch, similarly to wild-type ubiquitin (Fig. <ref type="figure">2m</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained in in vivo ubiquitylation assays in which the ectopic expression of K63R ubiquitin, but not of the K48R ubiquitin mutant, strongly reduced the Itch-dependent ubiquitylation of SuFu (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results indicate that Itch catalyzes the
