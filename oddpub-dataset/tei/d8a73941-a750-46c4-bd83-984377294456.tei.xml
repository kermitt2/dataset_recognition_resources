<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Animals</head><p><s>Adult male Hannover-Wistar rats (Harlan, Horst, The Netherlands; weight: 180 to 280 g) were used in the experiments.</s><s>The study protocol was approved by the Regional Animal Ethics Committee, and the experimental guidelines followed the European Communities Council Directive of 22 September 2010 (2010/63/EU).</s><s>The animals were living in a 12-hour light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgical procedures for producing neuropathy</head><p><s>The SNI model described by Decosterd and Woolf <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> was used.</s><s>For the operation, anesthesia was induced with sodium pentobarbital (intraperitoneally 60 mg/kg).</s><s>Anesthesia was continued by giving further doses of sodium pentobarbital (15-20 mg/kg) to keep the depth of anesthesia deep enough so that the animal did not react to noxious stimulation.</s><s>The skin on the lateral surface of the left thigh was incised, after which the biceps femoris muscle was sectioned to expose the sciatic nerve trunk and its terminal branches: the sural nerve, the common peroneal nerve, and the tibial nerve.</s><s>After ligating and sectioning the common peroneal and tibial nerves, their distal nerve stumps were removed, without touching the sural nerve.</s><s>As required by the animal ethics committee, animals were treated with 0.01 mg/kg of buprenorphine twice daily for 2 days to reduce postoperative pain.</s><s>Additionally, a group of unoperated healthy control rats was tested in the experiments.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cannula insertion and drug injection procedure</head><p><s>A guide cannula for amygdaloid drug administrations was installed in the right hemisphere (the side opposite to the peripheral nerve injury).</s><s>The reason for choosing the amygdala in the right hemisphere was that previous results indicated that the right rather than the left amygdala is involved in role in the processing of pain-related signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Another reason for choosing the amygdala in the right hemisphere as a the treatment target was that the nerve injury was in the left hind limb and the amygdala-driven descending control of pain is stronger in the contra-than ipsilateral limb <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>The guide cannula (26 gauge; PlasticsOne, Roanoke, VA, USA) for drug injections was installed after exposing the skull and drilling a hole for its placement at the same time as the SNI operation was performed.</s><s>The injection target in the right amygdala was the capsule lateral of the CeA: 2.1 mm posterior from the bregma, 4.3 mm lateral from the midline, and 7.8 mm ventral from the dura mater <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The brain control injection site was the right internal capsule: 2.1 mm posterior from bregma, 3.6 mm lateral from the midline, and 5.0 mm ventral from the dura mater.</s><s>The guide cannula tip was 2 mm above the injection target.</s><s>Dental screws and dental cement were used to fix the guide cannula on the skull.</s><s>When the animal was not being tested, a dummy cannula was placed in the guide cannula.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drugs and their administration procedure</head><p><s>TPA, a THIK-1 channel antagonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.Louis, MO, USA).</s><s>TPA was dissolved in saline and administered at the dose of 30 µg.</s><s>However, when testing TPA effect in fully developed hypersensitivity, TPA doses were 3 μg, 10 μg or 30 µg.</s><s>Unilateral infusions of TPA, or an equivalent volume of vehicle (saline), were made by using injection needles (33 Gauge) made of stainless steel (PlasticsOne).</s><s>The injection needle was connected to a 10 µl Hamilton microsyringe (Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland) by polyethylene (PE-10) tubing.</s><s>The injection needle protruded 2.0 mm beyond the guide cannula tip.</s><s>The injection volume was a 0.5 µl.</s><s>During the infusions, the animals were gently restrained for the duration of the injection (30 s).</s><s>After completing the injection, the injection needle was retained within the cannula for an additional 20 s to prevent backflow of the drug.</s><s>The spread of the injections was expected to be close to 1 mm <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the injections were likely to cover not only the CeA but also the adjacent subnuclei of the amygdala.</s><s>Consequently, the drug injection volumes of the present study may not allow pinpointing the site of the effect within the amygdala.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of mechanical pain</head><p><s>Before any operations or testing, the animals were habituated to the testing conditions at least in three one hour sessions during three consecutive days.</s></p><p><s>Monofilament-evoked limb withdrawal response to repetitive stimulation, was used to assess pain behavior.</s><s>Testing was performed using a series of calibrated monofilaments (North Coast Medical, Inc.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessment of anxiety-like behavior</head><p><s>When assessing anxiety-like behavior in the light-dark box (LDB) test, the rats were habituated to the laboratory but not yet exposed to the arena used for assessing anxiety until the actual testing of anxiety started.</s><s>In each animal, LDB testing was performed twice: i) Once on D3, after assessing mechanical sensitivity, but before the last drug/saline treatment of the amygdala, ii) Second time on D14, after assessing mechanical sensitivity.</s><s>While repetition of the test at an interval of 10 days may per se influence the test result, this potential confounding factor was considered to influence identically the group treated with drug as that treated with saline.</s><s>The LDB test was carried out in an arena that had two compartments (each 26.4 × 20.6 cm).</s></p><p><s>One of the compartments was dark and the other one illuminated.</s><s>Dark and light compartments were connected by a dark center chamber (15.9 × 20.6 cm) that allowed free movement between the zones.</s><s>At the beginning of testing, the rat was released to the light zone.</s><s>The animal was allowed to explore the experimental chambers for 10 min.</s><s>The time spent in each zone during the test was recorded using an 4 x 16 array of photo beams monitored by a computer.</s><s>An increase in anxiety was expected to decrease the time the animal spends in the illuminated chamber.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present results in the rat SNI model of chronic pain indicate that perioperative CeA administration of TPA, an antagonist of THIK-1 ion channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, attenuates the development of pain and anxiety-like behavior as revealed by the mechanical antihypersensitivity effect and the increase of time spent in the illuminated arena, respectively.</s><s>In the brain, THIK-1 is highly expressed in microglia and only little, if at all, in other types of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>TPA, through action on THIK-1 channels, was recently shown to inhibit microglial ramification and surveillance as well as release of proinflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>These findings are in line with the proposal that amygdaloid microglia, through action on THIK-1, contributed to the development of pain and comorbid anxiety in SNI animals of the present study, although a contribution of other TPA-sensitive mechanisms is possible.</s><s>In the late postoperative period, amygdaloid administration of TPA failed to influence pain hypersensitivity indicating that TPA-sensitive amygdaloid mechanisms are not involved in the maintenance of chronic pain behavior.</s><s>Our findings in amygdala are in line with earlier results reporting that microglia in the spinal dorsal horn exerts a pronociceptive role in the early rather than prolonged phase of nerve injury-induced pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>CeA microinjections were performed at a volume of 0.5 μl, due to which is is not possible to pinpoint the critical site of drug action at a subnucleus level.</s><s>The finding that TPA failed to influence pain behavior in a brain control injection site, the internal capsule, however, supports the proposal that the TPA-induced effect was due to action on the amygdala rather than outside of it.</s><s>The CeA is the origin of the main output pathways from the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and it contributes to the descending control of pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it may be argued that TPA reduced hypersensitivity due to a change in the descending drive originating or relaying in the CeA.</s><s>However, other amygdaloid subnuclei through their direct or indirect intra-amygdaloid projections are known to influence the CeA <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we cannot exclude potential contribution of other amygdaloid subnuclei to the TPA-induced effects.</s><s>For example, in addition to the CeA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, neurons in the basolateral amygdala potentially contribute to nociception and are subject to plasticity in chronic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Partial ligation or chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve have

hypothesis that the present CeA administration of TPA attenuated the development of pain behavior in the rat SNI model by attenuating activation of amygdaloid microglia.</s><s>Moreover, since activated microglia release proinflammatory cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the upregulation of amygdaloid cytokines in rats as well as mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> is also in agreement with the hypothesis that the inhibitory action of TPA on amygdaloid microglia provides a plausible explanation for the TPA-induced antihypersensitivity and anxiolytic effect.</s><s>The pronociceptive and anxiogenic actions of amygdaloid microglia that were attenuated by TPA need to involve e.g. a cytokinemediated interaction of microglia with neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> to be expressed as pain and anxiety-like behavior.</s><s>Chronic pain, including that induced by SNI is known to induce anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The finding that amygdaloid administration of TPA suppressed the development of anxiety-like behavior as well as pain hypersensitivity in SNI animals suggests that an activation of a TPA-reversible amygdaloid mechanism, such as microglia, contributes to the comorbidity of pain and affect in SNI.</s><s>This proposal still leaves open whether the TPA-reversible amygdaloid mechanism might have had a direct anxiogenic effect on neuronal circuitry involved in anxiety.</s><s>Alternatively, the TPA treatment-sensitive anxiety could be indirectly caused by a TPA-reversible pronociceptive mechanism enhancing the magnitude of pain that was driving neuronal circuitry underlying anxiety.</s></p><p><s>Among limitations of the present study is that the potential role of microglia on behavior was studied using only pharmacological methods and with a compound that affects also various other channels (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) that may have contributed to the present findings.</s><s>Therefore, further studies in which THIK-1 channels in amygdaloid microglia are selectively blocked are still needed to verify whether microglia, other TPA-sensitive amygdaloid mechanisms, or both have a key role in the present findings.</s><s>Independent of the underlying mechanism, the present in vivo results suggest that TPA provides a powerful tool for the study and potential treatment of chronic pain and anxiety following peripheral injuries.</s></p></div>
