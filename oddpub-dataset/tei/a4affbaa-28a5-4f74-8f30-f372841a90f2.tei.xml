Wh</s><s>e a critical review by Piccinelli and Wilkinson 33 identified that a lack of social integration, reduced social support and an increased vulnerability to adverse life events were social factors, which may potentially contribute towards a higher incidence of depression among females.</s></p><p><s>Individuals older than 70 years were at least 27.0% more likely to experience depressive symptoms at 2-year follow-up compared with individuals aged between 50 and 59 years.</s><s>Findings also showed that participants aged between 60 and 69 years were 9.0% less likely to experience depressive symptoms at 2-year follow-up, compared with individuals aged between 50 and 59 years.</s><s>This U-shaped curve in depression prevalence has been reported previously by Blanchflower and Oswald. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>An explanation for this finding could be that retirement is beneficial for an individual's mental well-being. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>he size and representativeness of our sample are the primary strengths of this study, and therefore, our findings are generalisable to the English population, who are aged over 50 years.</s><s>Standardised data collection methods and validated data collection tools were used to obtain data for ELSA, for example the CES-D was used to gather data about depressive symptoms.</s><s>The CES-D scale requires participants to accurately and truthfully recall information about their depressive symptoms to prevent study bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>he cause of depressive symptoms is often multifactorial, and although many covariates were used in the analyses to minimise study bias, there may be other contributory factors which have not been examined in ELSA, and thus, these factors could have influenced our findings.</s><s>While this study indicated that neither metabolic health nor obesity predict depressive symptoms at 2-year follow-up, there could nevertheless be associations which are obscured by the study design.</s><s>As the study only included respondents aged older than 50 years, it is possible that metabolic health and/ or obesity could predict depression earlier in the life course.</s></p></div>
