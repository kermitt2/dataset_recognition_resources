rare single-nucleotide variants, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> although, to date, the only specific rare variants that have been robustly implicated in the disorder are of the mutation class known as copy number variants (CNVs).</s></p><p><s>CNVs are large, but submicroscopic, chromosomal insertions and deletions.</s><s>0]<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> Nevertheless, they are not completely penetrant, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> that is, they are not sufficient to cause schizophrenia.</s><s>They also lack diagnostic specificity as the same CNVs are known to influence the risk for several neuropsychiatric disorders, including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as disorders in other systems, including cardiovascular, renal, immune and musculoskeletal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>ompeting hypotheses have been proposed about the genetic architecture and influence of CNVs, as well as other types of rare mutations, on schizophrenia.</s><s>At the one end of the spectrum, an extreme heterogeneity model proposes that schizophrenia represents a highly disparate set of distinct disorders, among which those with a specific mutation form homogeneous but small subgroups.</s><s>This model, also known as a multiple rare variant model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> is no longer generally sustainable given the success in identifying common risk variants, but it may apply to the subset of cases carrying rare high-penetrance mutations such as CNVs.</s><s>That all known CNVs have incomplete penetrance for schizophrenia suggests that even under this model, their clinical effects depend on other risk factors, genetic and/or environmental. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>If the hypothesis of extreme heterogeneity extends from distinct alleles to distinct pathophysiology, these additional risk factors should not overlap between carriers of different CNVs, or between carriers of CNVs and people with schizophrenia who do not carry CNVs.</s><s>Examples of additional CNV-specific risk factors that have been considered include, for example, a 'second-hit' somatic or germline mutation occurring at a gene within the CNV region but on the unaffected chromosome, a second hit mutation elsewhere in the genome, or mutation-specific environmental exposures.</s><s>If this is true, the results obtained from studies that seek to model the effects of CNVs and other types of rare mutation may be useful for understanding pathological mechanisms of disorder in those individuals, but tell us little about the generality of cases with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.</s></p><p><s>0]<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> Given the existence of a 1 sufficiently large number of risk alleles segregating in the population, it may be that individual case has a unique risk profile, in some cases including a CNV or other type of rare mutation.</s><s>Nevertheless, cases will also carry risk alleles that are shared with many others with the disorder, making the concept of extreme heterogeneity at the pathophysiological level largely meaningless.</s></p><p><s>Here, we test these extreme models by evaluating whether individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who carry a schizophrenia-associated CNV also share a common risk allele burden with those who have schizophrenia but no schizophreniaassociated CNV.</s><s>To measure the common risk allele burden, we use the polygenic risk profile score (RPS) method that has been widely shown to be a powerful and valid tool for this purpose and has, for example, revealed common allele burden overlaps between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Essentially, an individual's RPS reflects the total number of independent risk alleles (weighted by their effect sizes) carried by that individual, a risk allele being defined as one that surpasses specified thresholds of significance (P T ) for disease association in an independent GWAS study (that is, one that does not contain that individual).</s><s>In the present study, we define schizophrenia susceptibility alleles using the largest published GWAS of schizophrenia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Under the polygenic liability threshold model, but not the heterogeneity model, we predict that CNV carriers with schizophrenia will have an increased burden (RPS) of the common risk alleles defined from the wider population of people with schizophrenia.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The primary goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that within schizophrenia, individuals defined by known pathogenic mutations are completely distinct from the wider population of people with the disorder with respect to their genetic aetiology.</s><s>Our results do not lend support to the extreme heterogeneity hypothesis.</s><s>Instead, we found that common risk alleles contribute to the disorder in those who also carry a defined relatively highpenetrance mutation.</s><s>This was also true for CNVs whose effect size is at the larger end of the spectrum (OR47), and even the 3q29 and 22q11 deletions that have exceptional effect sizes still had elevated burdens of common alleles (see Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure">3  and 4</ref>), although we did not have sufficient power to evaluate RPS for individual CNVs.</s><s>Since the common risk alleles are derived from studies composed almost entirely of those without pathogenic CNVs, this must suggest that shared risk variants operate in those with and without a CNV.</s><s>In so far as risk alleles must ultimately reflect biological perturbations that result in pathophysiological processes, it follows that those with distinct, defined rare mutations do not form subgroups with a circumscribed pathophysiology.</s></p><p><s>Our finding is relevant for pathophysiological models of schizophrenia.</s><s>If an extreme heterogeneity model operates whereby despite similar symptoms, there exists a myriad of subdisorders defined by non-overlapping aetiologies and distinct pathophysiologies, it might also be the case that studies aiming to model high-penetrance mutations in model systems would have no, or very limited applicability, for the disorder more widely.</s><s>We do not interpret our findings as suggesting that schizophrenia is a homogeneous disorder where every individual has an identical set of risk alleles and pathophysiology.</s><s>Rather, we suggest that people with the disorder, including carriers of mutations of large effect, have overlapping pathophysiologies and that these are not demarcated by a single mutation.</s><s>Inevitably, the degree to which risk alleles and pathophysiological processes are shared between pairs of individuals will vary, but that they do overlap, albeit to a greater or lesser extent, makes it likely that mutations of large effect will have their effects mediated by processes that are relevant to a proportion of people with the disorder who do not carry that mutation.</s></p><p><s>A second important observation, albeit one that almost inevitably flows from the primary observation, is that among CNV carriers the RPS statistically differentiates between those who do and do not develop schizophrenia.</s><s>Although the variance currently explained maximizes at around 0.1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), this offers the possibility that as more of common genetic variance for schizophrenia is captured, RPS scoring might make a contribution to predicting the adult psychiatric phenotypic consequences of carrying large-effect, but incompletely penetrant alleles.</s></p><p><s>As is the case for predicting affected status more widely, it seems unlikely that RPS alone will offer sufficient discriminatory power. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>However, one might envisage that it could do so in the future when combined with additional endophenotypes (used here to denote heritable measures like RPS and index genetic liability) or with measures (for example, brain imaging, childhood cognition and psychosocial development) that do not necessarily meet the criteria for endophenotypes (see GotteFsman and Gould <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> for full discussion) but may nevertheless index increased risk of the disorder.</s><s>A separate question that will require the exploration of larger GWAS data sets of those disorders is whether RPS might also be used to discriminate between different childhood outcomes, for example being developmentally unimpaired vs having ADHD, and/or ID, and/or ASD, or indeed some of the other adult outcomes that are associated with one or more of the CNVs we have investigated such as epilepsy and obesity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>his will require the exploration of larger GWAS data sets of those disorders, but it seems reasonable to propose that factoring in RPS (and other risk factors) for those disorders might similarly begin to provide predictive power.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>Individuals with schizophrenia harbouring a schizophreniaassociated CNV also have a significant predisposition arising from common risk alleles that influence risk in the wider population of people with the disorder.</s><s>Our results offer support for a polygenic threshold model rather than an extreme heterogeneity model of schizophrenia, even within CNV carriers.</s><s>The additional .</s><s>Two-sided P-values for evidence at P o0.05 are displayed.</s><s>For each analysis of A vs B, the first sample was coded as 1 and the second as 0 in the logistic regression.</s><s>R 2 values above 0 symbolize that case status is associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and R 2 values below 0 symbolize that case status is associated with decreased risk for schizophrenia.</s><s>CNV, copy number variant; OR, odds ratio; RPS, risk profile score.</s></p><p><s>contribution from common alleles may in part explain why some individuals develop schizophrenia rather another disorder linked to the same CNV.</s></p></div>
