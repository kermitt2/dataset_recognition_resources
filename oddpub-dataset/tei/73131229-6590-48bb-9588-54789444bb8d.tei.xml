<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The course of self-reported symptoms during medium-versus long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy has rarely been documented for outpatient settings.</s><s>This observational study describes routine practice of ambulatory treatment in Germany and explores self-reported symptoms of a broad patient sample undergoing one (medium-term) versus two years (long-term) of psychodynamic psychotherapy.</s><s>Methods: Over four and a half years, longitudinal self-report symptom data were collected from 342 outpatients as part of a standardized documentation system.</s><s>Self-report data were compared between patients receiving either medium-term or long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy.</s><s>Results: Routine care significantly decreased disease burden as reported by patients by small to medium effect sizes (ES) for depression (ES = 0.58), anxiety (ES = 0.49), obsessive-compulsive disorder (ES = 0.54), somatoform disorder (ES = 0.32), eating disorder (ES = 0.38).</s><s>The majority of patients completed treatment after one year and showed medium-size changes.</s><s>For a subgroup of patients with depressive and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms for whom two years of therapy were deemed necessary, additional benefits were reported during the second year of treatment (ES = 0.61 and ES 0.47, respectively).</s><s>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that both medium-and long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy decrease self-reported disease burden of patients with depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, somatoform and/or eating disorders.</s><s>For a subgroup of patients, additional benefits were gained in the second year of treatment.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and setting</head><p><s>Between June 2008 and December 2012 routine data were collected from adult patients receiving either one or two years of psychodynamic psychotherapy who were treated in 13 outpatient clinics run by practice-based Specialists for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy.</s><s>Clinics were located in either Northern or Eastern Germany, of which about half of the clinics were based in Germany's capital of Berlin.</s></p><p><s>We included consecutive patients who presented at participating clinics as described above, with routine data collected once per year.</s><s>Patients had to be 18 years or older, and be able to read and understand German.</s><s>Of above patient cohort, we excluded those who had provided data within the last 15 months before closure of the database as it could not be ruled out that these patients were still in active psychotherapy.</s><s>As these patients potentially would not yet have received the full dose of treatment, it was important to exclude these to receive valid estimates from the data that were collected.</s><s>Applying above criteria led to a final sample size of n = 342.</s><s>Of these, 271 (79 %) patients received one year of psychodynamic psychotherapy and 71 (21 %) patients received two years of treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention</head><p><s>In Germany, psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy) is covered by the public health insurance system.</s><s>That is, costs for short-term (up to 25 sessions), medium-term (25-50 sessions) as well as long-term therapies (maximum 80-100 sessions for psychodynamic psychotherapy; up to 300 sessions for psychoanalyses) are reimbursed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Psychodynamic psychotherapy embraces a comprehensive curative approach that-in addition to purely focusing on symptom-oriented relief-leads to a stronger psychosocial capacity to cope with future challenges of life.</s><s>It focuses on revealing and verbalizing emotions.</s><s>This particularly applies to contradictory emotional attitudes and efforts, and the potential for conflict to be discovered which is clarified in everyday life as well as within treatment.</s><s>Habitual avoidance strategies are to be experienced, understood, and changed.</s><s>Recurring patterns in interpersonal relationships as well as hidden fantasies and motives are identified and explored systematically.</s><s>The life-historical process of formation of reactions and attitudes is examined and integrated in the personality of the patient.</s><s>This applies to interpersonal relationships outside as well as to the therapeutic alliance itself, with the latter being the essential therapeutic agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>.</s><s>Psychodynamic psychotherapy consists of individual and group sessions with both carried out according to aforementioned principles.</s><s>While individual sessions may be scheduled in irregular intervals, group sessions mostly occur regularly, that is, usually once per week.</s><s>Groups are generally mixed in terms of sex, age, social status, and symptoms.</s></p><p><s>In the current study, all patients received routine psychodynamic psychotherapy as described above, including both individual doctor-patient sessions and group therapy with or without pharmacological treatment.</s><s>As the majority of patients received a mix of both approaches, i.e. one-on-one sessions and group therapy, we applied the following definition for patients to be considered as mostly receiving "group therapy": &gt;60 % of the sessions received were group therapy sessions with &gt;10 group therapy sessions attended.</s><s>Patients not fulfilling these criteria were considered as patients receiving "one-onone".</s><s>Although treatment intensity and quantity differed between patients, with the schedule ranging from lowfrequency sessions once a week or once every two weeks up to high frequency arrangements with two to three sessions per week, it needs to be noted that treatment provided by Specialists for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy is regulated in Germany.</s><s>That is, the therapists are obliged to follow treatment methods that have been scientifically approved and are included in the catalogues of services of the German statutory insurance funds.</s><s>The continuing medical education includes supervised short-, medium-and long-term outpatient psychotherapy, regular meetings with colleagues for therapeutic selfawareness sessions, and inpatient clinical training.</s><s>Hence, all therapists who provide psychodynamic psychotherapy in the psychosomatic medicine setting are qualified in short-, medium-and long-term psychodynamic treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data documentation system</head><p><s>At collaborating institutions, patient data were collected routinely using the Documentation System in Psychosomatic medicine (DSP).</s><s>Patients filled in questionnaires on 1) socio-demographic data including use of healthcare services and 2) the ICD-10-Symptom-Rating (ISR) scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>, whereas therapists filled in questionnaires on 3) diagnoses based on the German ICD-classification system ICD-10-GM <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> and 4) use of other health care services <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In view of socio-demographic data both sex and age were available from patients' health records.</s><s>Education, employment status, nationality, and relationship status were assessed via patient self-report.</s><s>For this paper, education was grouped following the categorization as recommended by the German Federal Ministry of Health and used in many federally funded projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The ISR, developed in Germany, assesses patientreported symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> based on chapter F, ICD-10-GM <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The ISR aims at assessing presence as well as severity of self-reported symptoms.</s><s>It consists of 29 items, of which 17 form the five subscales depressive (4 items), anxiety (4 items), obsessive-compulsive (3 items), somatoform (3 items), and eating disorder (3 items) symptoms.</s><s>The remaining 12 items can be used as a screening instrument for single syndromes.</s><s>In this paper we use the former five subscales only as these measure distinct aspects of mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The ISR items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 ('Does not apply') to 4 ('Extremely applies').</s><s>Subscale scores are calculated by forming the average of respective responses per individual subscale; hence, scores in a given subscale range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (maximum amount of self-reported symptoms).</s><s>The psychometric properties of the ISR have been shown to be very strong, with evidence that it is largely robust against potential confounding effects such as response shift when measuring change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Further details on the ISR can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s></p></div>
