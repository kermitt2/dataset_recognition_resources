PBO/TED, received placebo in the initial placebo-controlled study and teduglutide in STEPS-2; PS, parenteral support (parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluids); SBS, short bowel syndrome; TED/TED, received teduglutide in the initial placebocontrolled study and in STEPS-2.</s></p><p><s>with lung cancer, and one patient with a history of Hodgkin's disease treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy developed metastatic adenocarcinoma.</s><s>Each of these patients had a significant risk factor for malignancy.</s><s>The causal link between smoking and lung cancer has been well established. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">24</ref></s><s>Similarly, survivors of Hodgkin's disease are at increased risk of secondary cancers, which are the leading cause of death in this population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">26</ref></s><s>However, because a causal relationship with teduglutide treatment and the case of metastatic adenocarcinoma could not be ruled out, that event was reported as treatment related.</s><s>Neither of the other two cancer cases was considered related to teduglutide.</s><s>Nonetheless, because teduglutide is an intestinotrophic hormone, treated patients should be monitored for signs of intestinal neoplasia, and use of teduglutide should be discontinued if neoplasm is detected.</s><s>Furthermore, continued clinical assessment of risk of teduglutide with regard to neoplastic growth is warranted.</s></p><p><s>Gastrointestinal polyps were reported in 9 of 51 (18%) patients who received colonoscopies.</s><s>This prevalence rate is in line with recommended target adenoma detection rate for first-time colonoscopies (‚â•15% and ‚â• 25% for women aged ‚â• 50 years and men aged 450 years, respectively). <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">27</ref></s><s>Furthermore, none of the seven biopsied polyps were malignant.</s><s>Although the ideal schedule for colonoscopy surveillance of teduglutide-treated patients has yet to be determined, these findings support the recommendation to monitor patients receiving teduglutide with regular colonoscopies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">28</ref></s><s>he nutrition and hydration status of teduglutide-treated patients was conserved in this study, despite PS volume reductions.</s><s>Some patients experienced episodes of decreased weight during the study, which were reported as AEs.</s><s>However, mean weight among the study group as a whole remained constant, suggesting that weight loss in individual patients was transient.</s><s>Furthermore, mean body mass index did not change over the course of the study, which may indicate that weight fluctuations resulted from fluid effects.</s><s>Mean kidney function tests and electrolyte levels were also stable.</s><s>Mean albumin levels remained steady between baseline and end of treatment.</s><s>This observation suggests that hydration and nutrition status was generally stable, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">29</ref> even though patients were challenged with reduction or elimination of PS.</s><s>Mean liver enzyme values either numerically decreased or remained constant during this study.</s><s>The most dramatic decreases were observed among the subset of patients with ‚â• 50% reduction in PS volume requirements; this is a notable finding, considering that liver disease is a life-threatening complication of chronic PS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">30</ref> In this study, long-term teduglutide treatment for up to 2 years, or up to 30 months for a subset of the study population, was associated with continued efficacy as reflected by continued reductions in PS volume, a gain in number of days off PS per week, and achieving complete independence from PS.</s><s>One of the greatest values associated with teduglutide is the potential to eliminate the need for PS in some patients.</s><s>Complete enteral autonomy eradicates the risks associated with catheter dependence and chronic PS infusion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">7</ref></s><s>However, PS reductions that permit partial weaning and gaining additional days off PS are also powerful, with the potential to increase quality of life and reduce PS-associated complications.</s><s>Indeed, among patients with SBS-IF, decreases in PS requirements are associated with significantly higher scores on an SBS-specific quality-of-life instrument. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">31</ref></s><s>he results of this long-term study demonstrate the durability of the effects of teduglutide.</s><s>Almost all patients (21/22) in the TED/TED subgroup who achieved a clinical response (‚â•20% reduction from baseline in weekly PS volume at Weeks 20 and 24) with teduglutide in the initial placebocontrolled study maintained their response after an additional 24 months of treatment.</s><s>In addition, a progressive increase in clinical benefit was observed with long-term teduglutide treatment.</s><s>Mean PS volume requirements declined steadily over 30 months of treatment among patients who received teduglutide in both the initial 24-week placebo-controlled study and the STEPS-2 extension study.</s><s>Furthermore, the percentage of patients achieving additional days off PS increased with longer treatment time; among teduglutide-treated patients who completed 30 months of treatment in the initial placebocontrolled study and STEPS-2, 60% (18/30) achieved a ‚â• 2-day reduction in PS infusions per week compared with 21% (8/39) of patients who received teduglutide for 24 weeks in the initial placebo-controlled study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">17</ref></s><s>esponses to teduglutide were observed in all 3 subgroups.</s><s>The greatest improvements with teduglutide were observed in the TED/TED subgroup, which received the longest duration of therapy (up to 30 months).</s><s>Nevertheless, PBO/TED and NT/TED patients, who initiated teduglutide during STEPS-2 for a total of up to 24 months of treatment, also incurred clinical benefits (e.g., response rates of 55 and 67% and mean PS volume decreases of 3.1 and 4.0 l/week, respectively, for study completers).</s><s>Protocol differences between the 2 studies may account for some of the variation in response among treatment subgroups.</s><s>The initial placebo-controlled study, which was designed to assess the efficacy of teduglutide relative to placebo, implemented a stricter protocol for PS weaning than did the extension study, which was designed to provide longterm, open-label safety and efficacy data, with less frequent study visits (on average, every 3 months).</s><s>Although they did not receive teduglutide treatment in the initial placebocontrolled study, patients in the PBO/TED subgroup benefited from the more aggressive weaning algorithm.</s><s>As a result of this intensive management, patients in the placebo group in the initial placebo-controlled study achieved a 2.3-l/week (21%) reduction in PS volume requirements at the end of that study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">17</ref></s><s>hese patients, who had lower baseline PS requirements at the start of STEPS-2, achieved an additional 3.1-l/week (28%) reduction in PS volume requirements with 24 months of teduglutide during the extension study.</s><s>Between Months 3 and 24 of STEPS-2, patients were evaluated for PS reductions less frequently than during the initial placebo-controlled study; this may partially explain why the response to teduglutide treatment in the NT/TED group at Month 24 was somewhat weaker than the response in the teduglutide arm in the initial placebo-controlled study at Month 6 (‚àí4.0 vs. ‚àí 4.4 l/week, respectively). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">17</ref></s><s>However, the small size of the subgroups, particularly the NT/TED subgroup (n = 12), limits the ability to draw firm conclusions from subgroup comparisons.</s></p><p><s>Although some patients showed an early response to teduglutide, others had a delayed response.</s><s>Seven of 8 patients who did not achieve the response criteria of ‚â• 20% reduction in PS in the initial placebo-controlled study showed dramatic reductions in PS with longer exposure to teduglutide in STEPS-2 (29-100% reduction in weekly PS volume after 24-104 weeks of treatment).</s><s>Three of these slow responders eventually achieved enteral autonomy.</s><s>The mechanisms underlying this delayed response are currently unclear.</s><s>Baseline PS volume requirements were similar between the slow responders and the study population as a whole (mean of 12.7 l/week for the slow responders vs. 11.4-14.2</s><s>l/week for the 3 STEPS-2 subgroups).</s><s>However, the slow responders were somewhat earlier in their postresection clinical course than the full study group (range for duration of PS dependency at baseline of 1.1-9.8 vs. 1.0-25.8</s><s>years, respectively).</s><s>Therefore, the slow responders may have required additional time to achieve their full endogenous adaptive potential, which was then augmented by teduglutide treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">4</ref></s><s>Nonetheless, this finding suggests that there is no specified time at which to consider discontinuation of teduglutide for lack of efficacy.</s><s>Rather, the physician should consider the patient's entire clinical picture, including hydration status, oral intake, fecal/stomal output, and time after resection when deciding whether to continue teduglutide therapy.</s></p><p><s>Efficacy and safety should be closely monitored on an ongoing basis in all patients, and clinical decisions should be guided by treatment objectives, physician judgment, and patient preferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">32</ref></s><s>The decision of how long to teduglutide also should be considered in the context of recent data from a large series of adult patients with SBS (N = 268) followed up for up to 24 years.</s><s>Amiot et al. found that intestinal adaptation can continue for considerably longer than once thought (i.e., up to 5 years following resection); the analysis also confirmed that 10-year survival is considerably worse among patients with SBS who remain dependent on PS (40.7% ¬± 0.5%) compared with those who become independent of PS (67.0% ¬± 0.6%, Po0.001). <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">33</ref></s><s>he limitations of this study are primarily those shared by open-label observational studies.</s><s>Furthermore, the study population is necessarily small, given the rarity of the condition, and heterogeneous with 3 patient subgroups who received treatment for different durations.</s><s>Patient response to teduglutide appeared to vary, and thus, it is unclear how each phase of study attributed to the observed benefits of teduglutide.</s><s>Because this extension study was not placebo-controlled, we cannot rule out the possibility that observed reductions in PS were partially caused by spontaneous adaptation, which has previously been documented in adults with intestinal failure after more than 5 years of PS dependence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">34</ref></s><s>n STEPS-2, the longest and largest study yet conducted in patients with SBS-IF, long-term treatment with teduglutide resulted in sustained and continued reductions in PS requirements while overall health and nutritional status was maintained.</s><s>PS volume reductions were observed in the majority of patients who completed the study, and 13 patients (20% of study completers) with varying baseline characteristics achieved enteral autonomy and independence from PS. Together, these data provide further evidence of the ability of teduglutide to enhance intestinal absorptive capacity.</s><s>The most common AEs associated with teduglutide in this long-term study were consistent with the placebo-controlled trials and with the disease state of SBS-IF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">21</ref></s><s>Nonetheless, further long-term data on safety and sustained durability of effect of teduglutide in patients with SBS-IF are warranted; the ongoing global registry study (ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>identifier: NCT01990040) will add to the accruing body of knowledge.</s></p><p><s>Additional participating investigators for this study NPS Pharmaceuticals.</s><s>B.
