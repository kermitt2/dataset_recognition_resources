<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The conduct of oral food challenges as the preferred diagnostic standard for food allergy (FA) was harmonized over the last years.</s><s>However, documentation and interpretation of challenge results, particularly in research settings, are not sufficiently standardized to allow valid comparisons between studies.</s><s>Our aim was to develop a diagnostic toolbox to capture and report clinical observations in double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC).</s><s>Methods: A group of experienced allergists, paediatricians, dieticians, epidemiologists and data managers developed generic case report forms and standard operating procedures for DBPCFCs and piloted them in three clinical centres.</s><s>The follow-up of the EuroPrevall/iFAAM birth cohort and other iFAAM work packages applied these methods.</s><s>Recommendations: A set of newly developed questionnaire or interview items capture the history of FA.</s><s>Together with sensitization status, this forms the basis for the decision to perform a DBPCFC, following a standardized decision algorithm.</s><s>A generic form including details about severity and timing captures signs and symptoms observed during or after the procedures.</s><s>In contrast to the commonly used dichotomous outcome FA vs no FA, the allergy status is interpreted in multiple categories to reflect the complexity of clinical decision-making.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The interobserver differences experienced in the EuroPrevall birth cohort's highly standardized food challenges prompted our development of a new toolbox of refined methods for diagnosing FA.</s><s>The follow-up assessment of the EuroPrevall birth cohort as part of the pan-European iFAAM project (EU grant agreement number 312147) already applied these methods.</s><s>They were developed as generic blueprints, applicable in observational and interventional research, and routine care.</s><s>The case report forms (CRFs) and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are publicly and freely available.</s><s>Paediatricians, dieticians, epidemiologists and data managers with extensive experience in translational research and clinical practice led the development of these tools, based on the previously published guideline of the PRACTALL group <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Three specialist clinics (Southampton and Manchester, UK; Berlin, Germany) piloted all CRFs and SOPs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questionnaire assessment of earlier FA history</head><p><s>We propose a number of new questions for the assessment of prior reactions to foods.</s><s>These questions are phrased for parent-or self-reported reactions.</s><s>To allow the calculation of comparable frequency estimates in research settings, a list of commonly observed allergenic foods should be presented.</s><s>Further (country-and culture-specific) suspected food allergens can be added and should be reported as free text.</s><s>Three different diagnostic levels are distinguished as follows: parent-/self-reported reactions to food ('Have you/Has your child ever had an illness or trouble caused by eating a food or foods and/or a diagnosis of food allergy?' Yes/No), parent-/self-reported doctor's diagnosis of FA ('Have you/Has your child ever been diagnosed by a doctor as having an allergy to this food?' Yes/No) and parent-/self-reported challenge-proven FA ('if yes, was this diagnosis supported by a food challenge in a clinic or practice?'</s><s>Yes/No or don't know).</s></p><p><s>Age (in years, optional: in months, for the first one/two years) at first symptoms/diagnosis ('How old were you/was your child when these symptoms first occurred?')</s><s>and when the patient was eating the food again without symptoms ('I/ The child was able to eat the food without symptoms beginning at the age of:') or when the patient last ate the food with subsequent symptoms ('I/The child had symptoms the last time I/he/she ate the food at the age of:') can be used as indicators of onset, disease duration and tolerance development.</s><s>Furthermore, parent-/self-reported symptoms (e.g.</s><s>itching, rash, diarrhoea) and the interval between exposure and symptoms should be recorded ('How soon after eating did the symptoms occur?' Within 2 h/After 2 h/Both).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical history and sensitization status</head><p><s>Current FA status of a patient can be evaluated clinically after a face-to-face or telephone interview assessing the FA history, including recent symptoms and consumption (last 3 months) of core foods.</s><s>The list of core foods should be defined while planning a study and may include typical, frequent and/or clinically relevant food-allergen sources.</s><s>For the multitude of foods not on this list, the consumption history is only recorded in case of earlier problems.</s><s>This means there is no information on the number of people who ate the food recently, thus tolerating it.</s><s>Without a robust estimate for the number of tolerant individuals, valid estimates of disease frequency cannot be calculated.</s><s>These foods can therefore only be evaluated and reported on a descriptive case-by-case basis.</s></p><p><s>At first, a skin prick test (SPT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>, or specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing for all a priori defined core foods, additionally relevant foods and potential sources of cross-reacting aeroallergens (e.g.</s><s>grass pollen, birch pollen) should be performed to determine sensitization.</s><s>The reagents used for SPTs in a research project should be described in detail (e.g.</s><s>fresh foods, commercial extracts, the latter were used in the EuroPrevall/iFAAM birth cohort).</s><s>Similarly, the method for measuring allergen-specific IgE should be specified.</s><s>The physician's appraisal of whether the patient is allergic to the foods in question, just based on the interview/ conversation, can be used as an additional study end point ('Do you, as the physician, think that the reported history is suggestive of prior and/or current food allergy/hypersensitivity?' (1) Yes, very likely (2) Possibly (I would evaluate further) (3) Possibly (but I would NOT evaluate further) (4) No, unlikely).</s><s>This question is explained further by the following examples: (1) plausible history of repeated reactions or prior anaphylaxis (2) single reaction followed by avoidance or symptoms not always associated with food (3) vague history or no plausible link to ingestion (4) never experienced a reaction or the history is incompatible with food hypersensitivity.</s><s>This item can serve as a proxy outcome for those eligible but refusing challenge testing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility for oral food challenge</head><p><s>The decision whether suspected FA is confirmed or ruled out through a DBPCFC should be based on information from the interview/questionnaire assessment and the allergic sensitization status (e.g.</s><s>SPT wheal diameter ≥3 mm or specific IgE levels ≥0.35 kU/l), following the outlined decision algorithm (decision tree, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Food allergy is very unlikely, and a person does not need to undergo an oral food challenge if they have either eaten the food recently (in the last 3 months) without symptoms (eligibility type A), or have not eaten it recently but never had symptoms and are not sensitized (type B, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In research, there are two indications for an oral food challenge: if a person is sensitized and if a food in question has not been eaten in the last 3 months without symptoms or the food was never consumed at all.</s><s>This is necessary to screen yet unnoticed FA allowing estimation of FA prevalence (type C).</s><s>If a person has had symptoms after eating a specific food at any time in their life and has either never tolerated it again or has tolerated it at some point but has not consumed it recently without symptoms, then a DBPCFC should be conducted to establish the current status of FA, regardless of the allergic sensitization status (type D, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>There may be contraindications like a plausible report of recent anaphylaxis.</s></p><p><s>In all research settings, the type of eligibility (A-D) should be recorded for each food in question to allow better interpretation and comparability between study physicians, centres and studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oral food challenge conduct and documentation</head><p><s>To reduce the overall number of challenge days and thus increase compliance, foods are grouped based on a common matrix used for blinding, herein called challenge blocks.</s><s>For example, cow's milk and hen's egg powder can be blinded in the same matrix and thus be assessed on separate days within a single challenge block.</s><s>For each of these blocks, only one placebo day needs to be scheduled and used as the reference for up to the maximum number of verum days (e.g.</s><s>three), instead of one placebo day for each verum day.</s></p><p><s>To ensure also blinding of the staff attending the procedure, the dietician preparing the challenge meal shuffles the order of food allergens and placebo within a challenge block randomly, for example using a randomization list.</s><s>The assignment of food allergens/placebo to actual challenge days is kept secret until finishing the whole challenge block, unless emergency unblinding is required.</s></p><p><s>All observations made on a challenge day can be documented in the challenge day form (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>The DBPCFC schedules are typically comprised of 7-9 escalating doses, usually in intervals of 20-30 min.</s><s>Signs and symptoms should be recorded in relation to the last dose consumed, specifying the exact time at onset of skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.</s><s>The attending physician is asked to report symptom severity based on suggestions by the PRACTALL consensus report <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>For example, number of hives, number of episodes of vomiting and diarrhoea, impact and duration of scratching, or the area affected by rash are recorded.</s></p><p><s>Symptoms within the last 24 h before the challenge day are recorded to differentiate between newly occurring and pre-existing or recurrent symptoms.</s><s>Objective parameters (blood pressure, pulmonary function) can be assessed and documented if considered necessary, for example based on prior reactions or safety concerns.</s><s>The challenge is stopped upon predetermined criteria such as vomiting or urticaria (highlighted as orange and red symptoms in the form, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>However, the final decision to stop the procedure is always at the discretion of the attending physician.</s><s>After a stopped challenge or reaching the final dose as scheduled, the patient remains under clinical observation for at least 2 h.</s><s>Symptoms occurring up to 24 h after the last dose can be recorded as an indicator of a delayed reaction.</s><s>Therefore, final appraisal of the challenge day is deferred until then.</s><s>An SOP for using the documentation form (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) is available online (open access online supplement, updated versions and other languages at www.diagnosing-food-allergy.org).</s></p><p><s>Each DBPCFC day (placebo and verum separately) is rated negative if all planned doses were given with no clinical signs/ symptoms or if observed signs/symptoms are not thought to be caused by the test food.</s><s>It is rated positive if (objective) clinical signs or symptoms in relation to the tested food item occuras proposed by Vlieg-Boerstra and later adapted by Sampson <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15)</ref>.</s><s>In addition to these two categories, we suggest to define a challenge day as inconclusive if the reported signs/symptoms are not clearly attributable to the assessed food item (e.g. if similar signs/symptoms were reported earlier) or if a challenge day was stopped before reaching the final dose without ingestion-related signs/symptoms.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, study physicians document their reasons leading to the final conclusion.</s><s>The form requires the clinician to subjectively appraise the severity of the reactions on a scale from 0 to 10: firstly, based on just the signs and symptoms; secondly, including the length of exposure-reaction intervals, necessity of medical interventions and other information from the medical history or observation of the Negative food challenges should be confirmed by serving the cumulative full dose of allergen in a single meal on one of the following days <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining food allergy</head><p><s>Food allergy is usually handled as a dichotomous state: either food allergic or food tolerant <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>.</s><s>In clinical practice, physicians see a whole spectrum of reactions, from distress, self-reported symptoms to mild or stronger objective clinical signs, and up to potentially fatal reactions.</s><s>Splitting this originally continuous (and multidimensional) outcome into a dichotomous decision of being allergic or tolerant is often necessary to give dietary advice.</s><s>However, it not only discards valuable information but also requires a clear cutoff that is agreed-on and applied by different physicians to be useful in (comparative) research.</s></p><p><s>Recording graded signs and symptoms and semi-quantitative perceived severity allows modelling of challenge day outcomes in a continuous fashion.</s><s>Now, when judging the overall status in the light of both a placebo and a verum challenge, physicians should be asked to classify FA status within 10 meaningful levels, separating three broad outcome categories: 'NO food allergy', 'UNCERTAIN outcome' and 'FOOD ALLERGY' (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>This allows comparison of detailed outcome information and adjustment for systematic differences such as proportion of placebo reactors as an indicator of individual cutoffs for interpreting challenge symptoms.</s><s>We encourage researchers and clinicians alike to use a similar terminology for DBPCFC outcome assessments, supporting combined data analyses across studies and allergy clinics.</s><s>In clinical care, an UNCERTAIN outcome is not helpful for the patient and further diagnostic evaluation and follow-up care may be needed.</s></p></div>

standardizing the triage for further diagnosis.</s><s>Thorough documentation of the type of eligibility supports the extrapolation of frequency estimates for food allergies in the population.</s><s>This will also allow taking account of challenge testing that is offered but declined or avoided.</s><s>For example, one can use the proportion of positive DBPCFCs in individuals who became eligible when not eating a food and being sensitized, to estimate the number of undetected allergic individuals of those with the same eligibility criteria refusing challenge testing.</s><s>The PRAC-TALL group stressed the need to grade signs and symptoms of food allergic reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Based on their consensus report and our evaluations of the multinational EuroPrevall birth cohort study up to age 2 (18-20), we developed and piloted a generic one-page form for the documentation of a complete food challenge day.</s><s>This form will not only allow a grading of clinical signs and subjective symptoms, but also a specification of the exact time when signs and symptoms started, and will give an indication of subjective severity assessments of the reactions.</s><s>If used in future projects, comparison between centres, studies and populations on the lowest signand symptom-based level for a positive reaction will be possible.</s><s>Furthermore, graded symptoms, subjective severity scoring and multilevel DBPCFC outcomes will improve comparability of physician-specific sign/symptom cutoffs, often unconsciously applied by study staff for the definition of confirmed FA.</s><s>It also allows the reporting of FA as a continuous phenomenon with mild to severe forms.</s></p><p><s>We introduce a more differentiated interpretation of DBPCFC outcomes based on verum and placebo days.</s><s>From comparing symptom severity and conclusion between two challenge days, the allergy status is defined using a system of 10 different outcome levels, clustered into the three broad categories of NO food allergy, UNCERTAIN outcome and FOOD  ALLERGY.</s><s>For example, FOOD ALLERGY can be diagnosed through three different approaches: clear signs and symptoms on verum but none on placebo day, placebo signs and symptoms but less severe compared to verum day, or clear symptoms on verum day but no placebo challenge performed.</s><s>Distinguishing these levels can inform the researcher about differences between projects and physicians and support estimation of the degree of individual diagnostic certainty.</s><s>We will be able to validate the FA diagnosis internally as given by the study physician against different approaches of defining FA based on our detailed documentation of symptoms.</s><s>Future validation including assessment of interobserver reliability will help identify areas for further improvement.</s></p><p><s>The overarching drawback of comparable and harmonized FA diagnosis is that it will always rely on physician's subjective appraisal of patient's/family's report of observed signs and symptoms of the patient.</s><s>This cannot be overcome completely but a common standard for reporting, documentation and decision-making can minimize limitations of subjective interpretations of blinded food challenges.</s><s>Capturing subtle differences between physicians and settings might enable researchers to report or potentially adjust for individual factors and subjective perception.</s><s>Beyond the generic SOPs we suggest here, IT-supported decision-making for eligibility, stop criteria or DBPCFC outcome judgment might be possible, but is complicated by the multidimensionality of input information and handling of rare exceptions, these are after all medical decisions.</s><s>As FA is a very complex and heterogeneous condition, its investigation requires case definitions with a certain degree of complexity.</s><s>The methods presented here tried to balance between ease of use and applicability on one side and capturing as much information as possible on the other.</s><s>Our approach requires a thorough training and continued supervision to be consistently applied in research and clinical care alike.</s></p><p><s>Measuring incidence and prevalence of FA in populationbased research is subject to certain restrictions such
