field in tissue generated by a transmit (TX) element starts to become similar or short compared to the size of the target anatomy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>).</s><s>This leads

arrays are not limited to the transmission side.</s><s>On the receiver side, ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (UISNR) considerations reveal that current patterns are dominated by the linear

these reasons render electrical dipole antennae legitimate candidates for implementation in transceiver arrays tailored for MR at ultrahigh and extreme magnetic field strengths that may help to relax challenges associated with RF power deposition constraints.</s><s>The reduction in RF wavelength reduces the area of superficial SAR, which together with increased power losses leads to decreased coupling between antennae (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>).</s><s>This permits an increase in the number of transmitter/receiver elements positioned around an object (Figure <ref

all single waves can be accomplished.</s><s>In addition, the dipole antenna length is reduced at higher RF frequencies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>), which decreases the field of view along the long axis of the antenna but also boosts B1 + /√Pin for regions underneath the dipole due to higher current densities per input power.</s><s>The reduced field of view can be compensated
