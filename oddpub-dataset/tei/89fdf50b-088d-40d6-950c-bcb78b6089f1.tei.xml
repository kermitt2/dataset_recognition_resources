analysis results showed that patient age and sex, and tumor location had no significant effect on the outcomes of 210 cases of laryngeal cancer, whereas expression of PTTG1, lymph node metastasis, tumor stage, and degree of differentiation had marked influences on prognosis.</s><s>The cumulative survival rates at 3 and 5 years after surgery in the PTTG1-negative subgroup were 85.19 and 73.68%, while in the PTTG1-positive subgroup they were 41.34 and 3.52%, respectively.</s><s>The survival rates at 3 and 5 years in the PTTG1-positive group were significantly lower than those in the PTTG1-negative group (P&lt;0.0001).</s><s>Thus, PTTG1 is negatively correlated with overall survival, and the higher the PTTG1 expression, the shorter the patient survival time.</s><s>This indicates that PTTG1 is an important factor in the occurrence and development of laryngeal cancer and acts to promote the invasion and metastasis of laryngeal cancer cells.</s><s>Thus, it may be used as a marker of prognosis in patients with laryngeal cancer.</s><s>The Cox model results showed that the positive expression of PTTG1 is an independent factor in evaluating the prognosis of patients with laryngeal cancer.</s><s>In summary, the present study demonstrated that PTTG1 expression in laryngeal cancer cells serves a key role in tumor development and could be used as an independent biological marker for the evaluation of prognosis in patients with laryngeal cancer.</s><s>PTTG1 can promote the proliferation and metastasis of laryngeal cancer cells, and the levels of PTTG1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are significantly positively correlated.</s><s>Studying the effect of PTTG1 may provide novel targets for the prevention and treatment of laryngeal cancer.</s></p></div><figure
