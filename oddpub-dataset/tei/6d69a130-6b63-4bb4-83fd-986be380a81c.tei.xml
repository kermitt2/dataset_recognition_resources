<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Patients</head><p><s>A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-finding study was performed in 241 obese patients over 24 weeks.</s><s>Eligibility criteria included male or female gender, an age between 18 to 65 years, a BMI of 30-40 kg/m 2 or of 27-29.9</s><s>kg/m² with at least one coexisting risk factor (type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or lipid disorder).</s><s>Exclusion criteria were a systolic blood pressure exceeding 160 mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure exceeding 100 mm Hg and/or a heart rate exceeding 100/min after 5 min of rest in a sitting position.</s><s>Patients were also excluded if they took sympathomimetic or psychotropic drugs (including antidepressants, neuroleptics, sedatives, centrally acting antihypertensives) or received β-blockers, insulin therapy or any other medication which might alter body weight or interfere with the absorption, metabolism or excretion of cathine.</s><s>Pre-existing conditions that precluded participation in this study were amongst others cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, pulmonary hypertension, neuropsychiatric disorders, impaired liver or kidney function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, insomnia, narrow angle glaucoma, hemorrhagic diathesis, and organic reasons for obesity.</s></p><p><s>At the screening visit, the medical history of each patient was recorded followed by physical examination as well as electrocardiographic and laboratory assessment.</s><s>In women, a pregnancy test was performed.</s><s>All patients received detailed information about the study protocol and provided written informed consent.</s><s>The study was conducted at four academic and private trial sites in Germany in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.</s><s>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees of the participating centers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment and Study Medication</head><p><s>After a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly allocated to four treatment arms.</s><s>Once daily, they received a defined solution containing 0, 16, 32 or 53.3 mg cathine hydrochloride (Antiadipositum X-112 T ® now renamed Alvalin ® ; RIEMSER Pharma, Riems, Germany).</s><s>After 12 weeks, there was a comprehensive assessment of the tolerability of the drug, and if there were no serious drug-related adverse events the administration of the drug was continued for another 12 weeks, resulting in a total treatment period of 24 weeks.</s><s>Regular visits at the study centers were held every 2 weeks over the entire period of treatment.</s><s>In addition, follow-up visits were performed at weeks 28 and 52, i.e. 4 and 28 weeks after termination of active treatment.</s><s>At each visit, anthropometric variables, electrocardiography, and other outcome variables including potential adverse events were assessed.</s><s>Anthropometric measurements (body weight, waist circumference) were performed using established procedures in a standardized manner.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lifestyle Program</head><p><s>Each patient, independent of group allocation, received structured counseling sessions using an established and validated intervention program <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> which was adapted to the specific requirements of the study design.</s><s>In addition, the recommendations were individually tailored based on the analysis of dietary protocols.</s><s>The aim was to achieve an energy deficit of 500-600 kcal/day.</s><s>The level of daily physical activity was assessed using a pedometer.</s><s>Patients were recommended to increase their physical activity up to 5,000 to 10,000 steps/day, depending on baseline activity using a pedometer for self-monitoring.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adverse Events and Tolerability</head><p><s>During the clinical trial, a total of 243 adverse events were documented.</s><s>No suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported.</s><s>Eight of the adverse events were serious, but without any causal relationship to the study medication.</s><s>60 adverse events were classified as non-serious ADRs.</s><s>These reactions included, amongst others, cardiovascular events (e.g.</s><s>tachycardia, increase in blood pressure) as well as events related to the central nervous system (e.g.</s><s>restlessness, sleep disorder, depression).</s><s>The number of ADRs increased in proportion to the cathine dosage the patients received.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> presents all ADRs occurring in the treatment as well as in the placebo group.</s><s>Due to ADRs, a total of 12 patients dropped out from the study ( table <ref type="table">4</ref> ).</s></p></div>

in all groups (supplementary fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, available at http://content.karger.com/</s><s>than the two lower doses.</s><s>At the maximum dosage, mean weight loss was 9.1 kg as compared to 2.4 kg under placebo treatment after 24 weeks.</s><s>Surprisingly, the weight loss at doses of 16 and 32 mg/day was similar.</s><s>This could be due to a lower compliance to the concomitant diet in the 32 mg group, but cannot be fully explained.</s></p><p><s>All patients received an intensive multimodal lifestyle modification program comprising an energy-restricted diet and an increase in physical activity.</s><s>The principal finding of this randomized controlled trial on cathine was that this agent is effective and rather safe to support weight loss in obese subjects over this short-term period.</s><s>To date, our knowledge on the weight-lowering potential of cathine is mainly based on very small studies with a limited number of patients in the 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14]</ref> , although cathine has been used for the treatment of obesity for more than 40 years.</s><s>In Germany, nearly 1 million obese individuals were treated with cathine in the past 10 years.</s><s>The incidence of reported ADRs was low -less than 40 spontaneous case reports from healthcare professionals were collected in this time <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> .</s><s>However, it should be stressed that substantial underreporting of ADRs in primary care is a known problem of such registries based on self-reporting.</s></p><p><s>As expected from a drug with sympathomimetic action, cathine increased heart rate, with a mean increase at the two highest concentrations of about 6 bpm.</s><s>The reduction of blood pressure was smaller than expected by the extent of weight loss, but was seen in those with moderately elevated blood pressure at baseline.</s><s>This observation is similar to the experience with sibutramine, which also exhibits a rather modest decrease in blood pressure, particularly in those patients with elevated blood pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref> .</s><s>Electrocardiography analysis performed in regular intervals in all patients did not reveal any abnormalities.</s><s>It is important to note that high-risk patients were excluded.</s><s>Therefore, the safety data observed in this trial are not representative for the general obese population, and additional larger studies with longer exposure are required to obtain more reliable information.</s></p><p><s>After premature termination of the SCOUT study due to the adverse long-term effect of sibutramine on the cardiovascular system and the withdrawal of rimonabant, assessment of potential adverse events is of crucial importance for any centrally acting weight-lowering drug.</s><s>The results of this study indicate that cathine has a similar risk profile as sibutramine with regard to activation of the sympathetic nervous system.</s><s>Nevertheless, even in the group receiving the highest dose of cathine no serious adverse reactions were observed.</s><s>No signs of any kind of misuse or abuse were noted.</s><s>Thus, no new safety issues were identified during this clinical trial, although the sample size was too small to exclude other rare adverse events.</s></p><p><s>According to the literature, it is assumed that cathine has only a transient weight-lowering activity due to the development of tolerance or tachyphylaxia.</s><s>Therefore, the original recommendation was to use cathine only for short treatment intervals of 4-6 weeks.</s><s>This study was designed to examine the efficacy of cathine treatment for up to 24 weeks in a controlled clinical setting.</s><s>Our results indicate that there is no attenuation or even loss of efficacy concerning weight reduction over this period.</s><s>Weight loss continued, even between week 12 and 24.</s><s>Thus, this trial suggests that administration of cathine may have a longer duration of action and may be similar to noradrenergic drugs such as sibutramine and phentermine.</s><s>Nevertheless, in view of the chronic nature of obesity and the potential need for much longer treatment, additional studies are required to investigate the efficacy and safety of the compound over longer periods.</s></p><p><s>We also monitored obesity-associated risk factors such as glucose and lipid metabolism.</s><s>In earlier reports, it was argued that cathine and related compounds from khat leaves would deteriorate glucose tolerance and lipid metabolism, but there is also a report showing a beneficial effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> .</s><s>In our study, there was no unfavorable effect of cathine at any dosage on the measured parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism.</s><s>Even in the subgroup of people with type 2 diabetes, there was no evidence for a deterioration of metabolic control.</s><s>However, it has to be noted that the current study is too small to clarify the metabolic effects of this compound.</s></p><p><s>Although the results of this trial may give some preliminary answers to old questions, they may also raise some new ones.</s><s>If cathine has a potential for weight loss as indicated by this study, what is the best way of application and treatment duration, and what is the longterm benefit-risk ratio?</s><s>Although the compound appears to be tolerated well, the question may arise as to whether it may convey similar risks for cardiovascular complications as reported for sibutramine due to its indirect sympathomimetic action.</s><s>This is still an open question, as obese patients with elevated cardiovascular risk were intentionally excluded.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the results of this dose-finding study suggest that cathine has a potential for adjunct pharmacological treatment of obesity with an acceptable risk profile.</s><s>In view of the still growing obesity epidemic, effective and safe treatment options are urgently needed, and based on the findings of this study cathine may deserve a more comprehensive exploration in larger clinical trials.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1
