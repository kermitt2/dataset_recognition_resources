<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>A fast track "Hot Start" process was implemented to launch the European Bank for Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (EBiSC) to provide early release of a range of established control and disease linked human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines.</s><s>Established practice amongst consortium members was surveyed to arrive at harmonised and publically accessible Standard Operations Procedures (SOPs) for tissue procurement, bio-sample tracking, iPSC expansion, cryopreservation, qualification and distribution to the research community.</s><s>These were implemented to create a quality managed foundational collection of lines and associated data made available for distribution.</s></p><p><s>Here we report on the successful outcome of this experience and work flow for banking and facilitating access to an otherwise disparate European resource, with lessons to benefit the international research community.</s><s>eTOC: The report focuses on the EBiSC experience of rapidly establishing an operational capacity to procure, bank and distribute a foundational collection of established hiPSC lines.</s><s>It validates the feasibility and defines the challenges of harnessing and integrating the capability and productivity of centres across Europe using commonly available resources currently in the field.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Since their introduction in 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Takahashi et al., 2007)</ref> hiPSC have been rapidly and broadly incorporated into research to understand their potential for disease.</s><s>This has substantiated interest to incorporate this resource into drug discovery pipelines, prospective patient stratification, recruitment for clinical trials and post-clinical drug assessment of safety issues following rare event reporting.</s><s>However, the evolution of these applications depends on facilitated and unfettered access to a standardised and well characterised hiPSC resource to help avoid dissemination of unauthenticated or substandard cell lines to the research community.</s><s>Rising demand by academia and industry has instigated a number of large scale public and privately funded disease and/or population oriented hiPSC banking initiatives in the US, Japan and UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(McKernan and Watt, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>These will foreseeably improve the consistency with which new cell lines will be developed but not necessarily the standardised and scalable distribution of pre-established or new lines to the wider hiPSC research community.</s></p><p><s>At present in Europe, a human pluripotent stem cell registry (www.</s><s>hPSCreg) offers the research community, legislators, regulators and the general public a measured overview of the current status of human pluripotent stem cell research though the provision of information on established cell lines derived from embryos or induced from adult cell sources.</s><s>At time of writing over 452 hiPSC lines are on the registry, sponsored by EU, nation specific and charitable funding sources.</s><s>However, this resource does not facilitate standardise access to these resources which still require user interface with institutional representatives in possession of any given cell line.</s><s>Recognising a need for a harmonised framework of best practice, the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU), a pan-European public private partnership between the European Commission (EC) and European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA; www.efpia.eu),</s><s>issued a call for proposals which in January 2014 culminated in the launch of the European Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Bank (EBiSC).</s><s>EBiSC's mission has been to: i) identify key cohorts of patients useful for research purposes within the wider scientific community, ii) create a large single European hiPSC repository through the integration of existing infrastructure, such as for example hPSCreg, and iii) generate a centre of scientific excellence for standardisation and optimisation of cryopreservation, retrieval and differentiation methods for hiPSC lines.</s></p><p><s>Here we report on the experience of the first stage of this initiative, a fast track "Hot Start" process whose goal was to rapidly establish operational capacity and a distributable foundational collection of established hiPSC lines.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results</head><p><s>The Hot Start experience and outcomes were embodied in established and conceived infrastructure provided by its membership.</s></p><p><s>This was both as originally proposed and subsequently informed and amended in the course of operational experience as follows.</s></p><p><s>2.1.</s><s>Infrastructure set up</s></p></div>

Depositor priorities.</s><s>Although facilitating third party user access to hiPSC lines is central to the EBiSC mission the first bottleneck to  4. Robustness of available protocols and hiPSC resources.</s><s>Despite the centre wide diversity of hiPSC line provenance (i.e.</s><s>cell of origin, reprogramming, culture and cryopreservation methods) the programme was successful in implementing standardised feeder-free culture conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ludwig et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen et al., 2011)</ref> using commercially sourced reagents.</s><s>The provision of several training courses was perceived as critical for this.</s><s>The robustness of these feeder-free protocols was further substantiated by a pilot study undertaken in collaboration with another IMI funded initiative, StemBANCC (www.stembancc.org)</s><s>focused on provision and use of well characterised patient derived hiPSC for use in drug discovery, wherein lines banked under feeder-dependent cultures were transitioned directly and banked under feeder-free conditions (data not shown).</s><s>5. Value of batch testing for sterility and identity.</s><s>The importance of measures to safeguard against microbiological contamination and mislabelling of cell lines is broadly understood and avoidable through implementation of high quality standards of operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Stacey et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The danger of procuring lines from sources other than banks routinely implementing these measures as a batch release criterion is underscored by our experience.</s><s>The incidence of mycoplasma contamination is estimated to be around 5-30% of cell lines across the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Nikfarjam and Farzaneh, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Although the number of cell lines screened was modest (i.e.</s><s>47) and centres sampled was small (n = 7), mycoplasma were not detected in any deposited hiPSC line as assessed by both direct colony growth and a high sensitivity, indirect qPCR based method.</s><s>Checking for culture sterility by inoculating liquid microbiological growth media with spent culture media and incubation for 14 days, rather than less stringent visual assessment of cell cultures in process, revealed only a low incidence (3/47) of bacterial contamination of undetermined type.</s><s>This was thought to arise from the occurrence of low level bacterial contamination which was not observed, even in antibiotic-free cultures due to the daily media changes applied to cultures but may also have been due to variability in contamination levels in the laboratory of origin.</s><s>6. Labelling.</s><s>Defining traceable nomenclature and labelling terms involved substantial and iterative inter-institutional discourse.</s><s>Initially, the local cell line name was added as a safety measure to ensure the correct labels were used during cryopreservation.</s><s>The switch to 2D barcodes was made to improve barcode scanning compatibility with an established automated cryostorage system.</s><s>Due to repetitive cell line identity failures and/or incorrect clone IDs recorded prior to deposit, the local cell line name was subsequently removed.</s><s>Co-incidentally the distributing centre (ECACC) catalogue number was introduced.</s><s>7. Interface with established public resources managing information and cell lines.</s><s>Key to the future sustainability and quality of EBiSC resources initiated by the Hot Start process is the interface and integration of well established public resources for data and cell management.</s><s>For example, the hPSCreg project is independently funded by the European Commission to provide a central resource of hPSC lines along with ethical provenance, and it has emerged as the established community standard for iPSC registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Seltmann et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>hPSCreg issues certificates to verify that a registered line meets strict minimal data requirements, and this certificate is now required by a cell line before it can be included in proposals for EC research funds.</s><s>It also provides the portal for registration of lines for banking and distribution by EBiSC.</s><s>A fast track registration process for EBiSC lines has been set up to enable rapid processing for accession of EBiSC lines although certification of lines will still require completion of hPSCreg minimal requirements.</s><s>A guide for registration has been prepared to assist depositors (http://www.ebisc.org/files/Other-doc/</s><s>01-QuickStartGuideCellLineRegistration-2016-06-14-V2.pdf).</s><s>EBiSC automatically registers all of its hiPSC cell lines in the BioSamples database at EMBL-EBI.</s><s>This ensures that any hiPSC assay data, generated on EBiSC cell lines and deposited in the EMBL-EBI archives (such as RNA-seq or array data) can be directly linked to the EBiSC catalogue enabling rapid user access to molecular data where it is available.</s><s>EBiSC uses ontology tools hosted by EMBL-EBI to annotate cell lines using a controlled vocabulary, which ensures cell line scientific data are accurately described and more easily discoverable in the web portal.</s><s>EBiSC has arranged for cell line data to be shared, seamlessly and automatically, between the different components of the IMS network ensuring that the data is up to date and content is validated when released to the public.</s><s>This includes hPSCreg, the IMS database, ECACC, the central facility's Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), and the Biosamples database.</s><s>Depositors and prospective users/customers benefit from the assurance that cell line data is consistent across these services, for all cell lines.</s><s>Lastly the IMS provides a user-friendly application layer for searching across hiPSC lines and associated datasets within the EBiSC collection and provides support to internal business operations and management of cell line data.</s><s>8. Donor information.</s><s>At present hiPSC donor information supplied and publicly available through such capacity as provided by hPSCreg is limited.</s><s>There is broad recognition in the field of worries in gathering and making detailed clinical information and medical records publicly available in relation to privacy and consent associated issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Peppercorn et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bastião Silva et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>From a 'database point of view' the presentation of clinical data as free text is not preferred as this complicates searching and comparing clinical information between donors.</s><s>Rather, standardised taxonomies and ontologies should be developed and used to describe a disease and there are ongoing efforts to this effect amongst pertinent institutions within EBiSC (EBI).</s><s>Existing standards such as Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine (snowmed), the International Classification of Diseases (ISO), or disease ontologies should be applied if possible.</s><s>At the moment, hPSCreg registers clinical data related to diagnosed disease(s) based on experimental factor ontology (EFO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Malone et al., 2010)</ref> and disease ontology (DO) (http://www.diseaseontology.org)</s><s>standard terms by applying a semantic mapping tool Zooma <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Sarntivijai et al., 2016)</ref>, but also allows for free text information.</s><s>In addition, genetic disease carrier status, family history, disease-and non-disease related phenotypes can be provided as free text.</s><s>Furthermore, disease -and phenotype -associated mutations/ polymorphisms can be registered for each of the diagnosed diseases of a donor, also using standard nomenclatures of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS).</s><s>The already implemented standardised attributes allow direct comparison and searching, without additional free text analysis.</s><s>HPSCreg also asks depositors whether medical history files or clinical information for the donor are available upon request.</s><s>Compliance with providing clinical and genetic donor information together with cell line information is a major bottleneck and could be helped by incentive or assistance to depositors provided by banking establishments such as EBiSC.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we describe here the feasibility and challenges of coordinating existing organisational capacities across Europe to fast track the establishment of a centralised network and facilities to access a standardised resource of established hiPSC lines and data.</s><s>The availability of these should benefit the accessibility, comparability, reproducibility and efficacy of ongoing research on this resource in all sectors, public and private.</s><s>Additionally, EBiSC experience and infrastructure can benefit future efforts to standardise the procurement and derivation of new hiPSC lines.</s><s>A prospective depositor's early engagement with EBiSC could aid in the avoidance of costs of local banking and quality control not to mention provides a safe off-site depository.</s><s>To this end, EFPIA member sponsored production of hiPSC lines, whose costs are partly subsidised by EBISC, are ongoing for diseases for which there is researcher demand not currently met by existing supply.</s></p><p><s>Recently, guidelines prepared by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) for global standards for stem cell research and clinical translation in 2006 and updated in 2008 were updated further (see Commentary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Daley et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Review of these to confirm complicity and alignment of hiPSC lines banked as part of EBiSC Hot Start launch verified that for the guidelines which were applicable (eg.</s><s>procurement, processing and banking) EBiSC hiPSC lines either complied or enable compliance by third party users (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>).</s><s>This makes the EBiSC Hot Start collection and ongoing advances in infrastructure of broader global benefit to other small and large scale hiPSC derivation and banking initiatives.</s></p></div>
