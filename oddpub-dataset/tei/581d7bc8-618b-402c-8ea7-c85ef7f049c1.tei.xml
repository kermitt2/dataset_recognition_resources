<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">| DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">| Key findings</head><p><s>In the first stage, data analysis indicated significant differences between the group interviewed with the Turkish DIA-X/CIDI 2.8 version versus those interviewed with the German version in terms of socio-demographic sample characteristics and some of the included quality criteria (overall quality, implementation quality, attention,  comprehension of the answer items and illiteracy).</s><s>The determined effect sizes indicated that these quality criteria were mildly correlated with the group that was interviewed with the Turkish CIDI version, while all socio-demographic variables (excluding gender) showed a medium to high correlation.</s><s>This was particularly true for the variables associated with migration background (nationality, generational status, own migration experience).</s><s>This is not surprising because these components are correlated with one another.</s><s>Furthermore, the regression analysis indicated that age, educational level and socio-economic status were significantly correlated with two to five of the included quality criteria.</s><s>Considering the highly significant results, the following quality reductions (from the perspective of the interviewer) emerge:</s></p><p><s>(1) low socio-economic status accompanied a lower general quality;</s></p><p><s>(2) high age accompanied a lower implementation quality; (3) high age and low educational level accompanied reduced attention capability for the participants.</s><s>The relationship with illiteracy showed solely an association with a low and middle educational level which seems to be an evident result; nevertheless it should be noted that this pertained to a small number of participants (3.8% of the sample).</s><s>Overall, it can be deduced that when the socio-demographic variables were kept constant, the varying CIDI versions had no influence on the quality of the interview; thus, the Turkish DIA-X/CIDI version had a good quality and feasibility similar to that of the German version.</s></p><p><s>Regarding the aborted interviews (n = 30), frequently given explanations were 'too exhausting' (e.g. a decline in concentration and difficulty comprehending the questions and answers) and 'too long'.</s><s>The duration of the interview before it was ceased varied greatly (range:</s></p><p><s>54-315 minutes).</s><s>The length of the CIDI interview has been discussed critically in numerous studies because it increases considerably in the presence of illiteracy or comorbid mental disorders (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kishore, Kapoor, &amp; Reddaiah, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wittchen et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Quintana et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Data on the prevalence and comorbidity of mental disorders, which were assessed using the DIA-X/CIDI 2.8(TR) in the present study, will be discussed in further publications.</s><s>The average duration of the CIDI interview in our sample was 117 minutes (range:</s></p><p><s>26-360 minutes), excluding the quality assessment (section x).</s><s>Kishore showed considerably shorter implementation times: e.g. 90 minutes, not including section g <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wittchen et al., 1998)</ref>; 66 minutes, SD 27.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jacobi et al., 2014)</ref>; and 63 minutes, range: 20-185 minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Brugha, Jenkins, Taub, Meltzer, &amp; Bebbington, 2001)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">| Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>As socio-economic status was found to be an important predictor of nearly all analysed quality criteria (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>) it should be critically noted that there exists a significant amount of missing data (16.6%</s></p><p><s>of the total sample).</s><s>This is an important limitation for the interpretation of the results.</s><s>Possible reasons for the higher number of missing information on socio-economic status in comparison to other variables could be due to mistrust, anxiety and concerns about data privacy protection in the context of health research studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dingoyan et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, one of the fundamental strengths of this study is that it offers the first translation of the DIA-X/CIDI for the largest migrant group currently living in Germany and tested the translated version immediately upon its first implementation.</s></p><p><s>Translation and comprehension difficulties related to the CIDI and interviewer difficulties with handling taboo topics (e.g.</s><s>sexuality or depression) have been reported in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kishore et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Smits, de Vries, &amp; Beekman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wittchen et al., 1991)</ref>.</s><s>To obtain the best possible content equivalence to the German DIA-X/ CIDI, the translation and back-translation method was declined in favour of a more elaborate translation process based on the TRAPD team approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Harkness, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>This permitted the inclusion of differentiated and culturally relevant nuances; for example, those related to different subjective theories of disease and expressions of psychological symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Vardar, Kluge, &amp; Penka, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>As described, a pretest (n = 6) was conducted with this translated version of the CIDI, and adjustments were made.</s><s>Because of the project's time and financial limitations, it was not possible to conduct cognitive pretesting before field application, which could have potentially identified further The phi value is given for correlations of nominal variables with only two values each; Cramer's V is given in cases with more than two values for at least one variable.</s></p><p><s>b In two cases of the 662 interviews section x was not filled by the interviewers.</s><s>sources of quality and feasibility problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collins, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fitzgerald, Widdop, Gray, &amp; Collins, 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The bilingual lay interviewers were trained intensively in the application of both CIDI versions according to international recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Wittchen &amp; Pfister, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Meyer et al., 2000)</ref> and were closely supervised throughout the data collection process [via regular supervision and frequently asked questions (FAQs)].</s><s>The interviews were promptly checked and edited after their completion.</s><s>Regarding feasibility testing, it should be noted that the quality criteria investigated here were based predominantly on the subjective assessments of the interviewer, although some quantitative measures (such as interview duration, non-response and error items) were included in the analysis.</s></p><p><s>An additional questioning of the participants or cognitive debriefing after the completion of the interview (e.g.</s><s>regarding the comprehensibility of the question and answer categories, attention, taboo topics)</s></p><p><s>would have been informative.</s><s>Supplementary testing of the diagnostic criteria's objectivity reliability and validity and the inclusion of a comparative sample without a migration background (for example, in Turkey) would have been desirable; however, such testing was not possible in the present study given the available time and financial resources.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">| CONCLUSION</head><p><s>The DIA-X/CIDI 2.8(TR) shows comparatively good quality and feasibility compared with the German version based on the investigated quality criteria.</s><s>The identified quality differences are strongly related to the socio-demographic characteristics age, educational level and socio-economic status.</s><s>This relationship should be investigated more closely in future studies, e.g. through adaptations to the CIDI DIA-X for implementation with older individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Wittchen et al., 2014)</ref> or individuals with a low educational level and socio-economic status.</s></p><p><s>The DIA-X/CIDI 2.8(TR) shows also good quality in the event of illiteracy if all question and answer options are read aloud.</s><s>In addition, it should also be taken into consideration that the DIA-X/CIDI 2.8(TR)</s></p><p><s>was administered to Turkish-language speakers living in Germany.</s></p><p><s>Because language use can vary based on migration and social influences, the question remains whether this instrument is also suitable for the Turkish population residing in Turkey.</s></p></div>
