<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>AL and CQ were highly effective for treating uncomplicated knowlesi malaria, with both drugs well tolerated, all patients becoming aparasitemic within 48 hours, and no treatment failures by day 42 of follow-up.</s><s>However, AL demonstrated faster parasite clearance and earlier predicted hospital discharge than CQ, with improved potential health cost benefits.</s><s>The earlier parasite clearance for AL compared with CQ is consistent with a previous trial of ASMQ versus CQ for uncomplicated knowlesi malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The difference in parasite clearance between AL and CQ was more pronounced in those presenting with higher parasite counts &gt;1000/μL, although this may be due in part to methodologic difficulties in accurately evaluating parasite clearance at lower levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Routine screening hospital microscopy was demonstrated to underestimate parasite counts in a number of patients, including those with counts above the 20 000/μL inclusion threshold.</s><s>Microscopic underestimation of P. knowlesi parasite counts and inappropriate initial treatment with oral rather than intravenous artesunate for severe disease has resulted in case fatalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>However, oral ACT may minimize the risk of worsening complications for unrecognized moderate or severe disease compared with drugs with slower parasite clearance, such as CQ.</s><s>Parasitemia is a known risk factor for severe knowlesi malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, with parasitemia counts &gt;20 000/ μL resulting in an 11-fold increased risk of severe disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The safety of oral therapy for uncomplicated disease with parasite counts above this threshold has not been systematically evaluated, although both ACT and CQ were successfully used to treat a small number of patients with parasite counts up to 48 000/μL in both this study and the previous ACT KNOW trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Clinical outcomes with AL and ASMQ were similar despite differences in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties between these medications.</s><s>The proportion of patients with negative microscopy at 24 hours was only 1.1-fold greater in those treated with ASMQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> versus AL, and there was no difference in bed occupancy or risk of anemia at follow-up.</s><s>The different artemisinin derivatives, artemether and artesunate, found in AL and ASMQ respectively, are both metabolized in vivo to the same active component dihydroartemisinin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and have been shown to have similar in vitro mean 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.90 nmol/L for clinical P. knowlesi isolates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>However, in contrast to ASMQ, AL is administered as a twice-daily dose, with an artemether component of 1.8 mg/kg, compared with the once-daily dosing of ASMQ, with an artesunate component of 4 mg/kg <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>AL is also highly lipophilic, and optimal oral absorption requires coadministration of fatty foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In routine clinical practice in countries such as Malaysia with mandatory hospital admission for malaria, and also many clinical trials evaluating antimalarial efficacy for P. falciparum <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, fatty foods are not regularly coadministered with AL.</s><s>Despite the presumed reduced oral bioavailability of AL for patients not receiving fatty foods in this study, the recommended weight-based dosing of AL was sufficient for parasite clearance.</s><s>This is consistent with highly drug-sensitive P. knowlesi parasites from zoonotic transmission to humans.</s><s>Patients in both clinical trials were aparasitemic within 72 hours, and both ACTs are administered for 3 days.</s><s>Therefore, with the fast 24-hour life-cycle of P. knowlesi and high efficacy of the artemisinin component of both ACTs, the shorter half-life of the partner drug for AL, lumefantrine, of about 3 days, did not confer any disadvantage for eliminating any residual parasites compared with mefloquine, with a half-life of about 21 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Both AL and CQ demonstrated high safety and tolerability, with minimal adverse events.</s><s>The most commonly reported adverse event was nonsevere rash or itch, seen in 12% of patients treated with AL, with recognized drug-related gastrointestinal disturbance in &lt;5%.</s><s>AL and CQ were also both tolerated well by the 12 children ≤12 years of age.</s><s>Suboptimal dosing of AL with children owing to administration as tablets or fractions of tablets in dose-weight bandings <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> had no detectable impact on safety or therapeutic efficacy, although the small number of children in this study limits definitive evaluation.</s><s>AL did not demonstrate a faster fever clearance than CQ, and although the risk of anemia during follow-up was decreased in those treated with AL compared with CQ, this difference was not statistically significant.</s></p><p><s>These findings are in contrast to comparisons of ASMQ and CQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, but the evaluation of these secondary outcomes was limited by the smaller sample size in the current study.</s><s>The low prevalence of P. knowlesi gametocytes in about 25% of patients at presentation was probably underestimated by microscopy, with minimum estimates of 85% in a previous study using a sensitive Pks25 PCR assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, the lack of gametocytes at follow-up indicates that both AL and CQ are effective at reducing the sexual stage of P. knowlesi, and risk of onward transmission after treatment is minimal, with other transmission-blocking agents, such as primaquine, not required.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our findings support the use of AL as a first-line treatment over CQ for uncomplicated knowlesi malaria, allowing a universal policy of ACT for all species of malaria in this region <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Although CQ continues to demonstrate adequate therapeutic efficacy, ACT has a number of advantages related to earlier parasite clearance and hospital discharge and decreased risk of anemia.</s><s>Furthermore, CQ is not recommended for the treatment of presumed uncomplicated knowlesi malaria owing to the frequent microscopic misidentification of P. knowlesi as P. falciparum or P. vivax <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, both highly CQ-resistant in this region <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, faster-acting ACT treatment may minimize the risk of severe complications for P. knowlesi infections with parasitemia underestimated by microscopy.</s><s>AL has some advantage in safety and tolerability over ASMQ because of the small risk of severe mefloquine-related neuropsychiatric sequelae <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, despite otherwise comparable clinical outcomes.</s><s>Results of this and the previous RCT seem generalizable to other areas of Malaysia and Southeast Asia where AL and ASMQ are used as first-line therapies for uncomplicated malaria <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Other ACTs, such as dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, used in coendemic areas of Indonesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> for first-line blood-stage treatment of falciparum and vivax malaria, including misidentified P. knowlesi infections, are also likely to be efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated knowlesi malaria, although they require further evaluation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Enrollment
