dermographism (SDerm) is the most common form of physical urticaria with a prevalence of up to 5%. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> SDerm is characterized by itchy wheals that occur in response to friction, for example, after rubbing or scratching of the skin, and usually last for 1 to 2 hours. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> SDerm commonly lasts for years and significantly impairs quality of life (QOL). <ref type="bibr">2</ref></s><s>The underlying cause of SDerm is unknown, and the trigger is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid.</s><s>Therefore, symptomatic treatment with antihistamines is the first-choice treatment.</s><s>However, higher than standard doses are usually required to achieve symptom control, and some patients do not respond to updosing of antihistamines. <ref type="bibr">2</ref></s><s>malizumab, a humanized anti-IgE antibody, is highly effective in antihistamine-refractory patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), also known as chronic idiopathic urticaria, and the drug was licensed for use in CSU/chronic idiopathic urticaria in 2014.</s><s>Case reports suggest that patients with physical urticaria including SDerm can also benefit from omalizumab treatment. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s>ere, we report the results of a phase 2 trial with patients with SDerm, in which we evaluated the efficacy and safety of 2 different doses of omalizumab as compared with placebo.</s></p><p><s>Overall, 61 patients with SDerm were randomized, received at least 1 treatment, and were included in the safety analyses, and 55 were included in the primary end-point analysis (for details on study procedures, see this article's Online Repository and Fig E1 at www.jacionline.org).</s><s>The baseline, demographic, and clinical characteristics were comparable in all groups (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">E1</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).</s><s>Most notably, the mean Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score at baseline was 11.1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">E1</ref>), that is, a score that indicates a very large effect on QOL. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> Critical friction thresholds (the strongest trigger strength, at which a patient developed symptoms) at week 10 (primary readout) were significantly improved in the omalizumab 150 mg (21.8 6 0.4; P 5.014) and 300 mg (22.0 6 0.4; P 5.004) groups, as compared with the placebo group (20.6 6 0.3; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref>).</s><s>Both omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg resulted in a rapid improvement in friction thresholds, as early as in week 4 after the start of treatment (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, B</ref>).</s><s>After the last injection, during the follow-up period, provocation trigger thresholds in the omalizumab groups increased and did not show differences to those in the placebo group 6 weeks after the last treatment.</s><s>No significant differences between 150 mg and 300 mg omalizumab groups were observed at any time during the study (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A and B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To test whether patients with SDerm with low and high trigger thresholds and disease activity show differences in their responses to omalizumab, we assessed threshold values in every patient at baseline and 10 weeks later.</s><s>As shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, C</ref>, patients with SDerm with low and high baseline thresholds showed similar responses to omalizumab treatment.</s><s>Two of 18 (11%) patients with SDerm showed complete response at week 10 after placebo treatment, whereas 8 of 18 (44%) showed complete response to 150 mg omalizumab.</s><s>With omalizumab 300 mg, 10 of 19 (53%) showed complete response (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>).</s><s>No response at all was observed in 15 of 18 (83%) patients treated with placebo, 6 of 18 (33%) patients treated with omalizumab 150 mg, and 8 of 19 (42%) patients treated with omalizumab 300 mg (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The frequency of adverse events was similar across all groups.</s><s>The frequency of serious adverse events was low, with 1 event in the 150 mg omalizumab group, 1 in the 300 mg omalizumab group, and 1 in the placebo group (see Table <ref type="table">E2</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org);</s><s>none of them was considered related to the study medication.</s></p><p><s>Patients with SDerm refractory to antihistamine treatment were considerably impaired in their QOL (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">E1</ref>).</s><s>Treatment with both 150 mg and 300 mg omalizumab improved the QOL as assessed by mean DLQI scores at week 10 compared with baseline (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, A and B</ref>).</s><s>Overall, 13 of 18 (72%) patients treated with 150 mg omalizumab and 11 of 19 (58%) patients treated with 300 mg omalizumab improved at least 4 points in the DLQI scale, the minimal clinically important difference. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s>In contrast, only 6 of 19 (32%) placebo-treated patients improved by 4 or more points.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we found pronounced, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful reductions in disease activity and impact in patients with SDerm treated with omalizumab 150 or 300 mg.</s><s>The risk/benefit profile for omalizumab was good (Table <ref type="table">E2</ref>) and did not show any new safety aspects as compared with previously published trials.</s><s>Interestingly, both doses of omalizumab, 150 mg and 300 mg, were effective, with no statistical differences between them.</s><s>This is in contrast to CSU, in which both doses are also effective, but 300 mg omalizumab is more effective than 150 mg. <ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref></s><s>t is, as of yet, unclear why omalizumab has these strong effects on disease activity in SDerm.</s><s>A comparison of baseline characteristics in responders and partial or nonresponders (see Table <ref type="table">E3</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.</s><s>org) revealed no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups.</s><s>Passive serum transfer experiments have suggested that a soluble transferable factor, presumably IgE, is involved in the pathogenesis of physical urticaria forms such as SDerm, cold urticaria, or solar urticaria. <ref type="bibr">9</ref></s><s>But as of now, no relevant role of IgE in any of these diseases has been proven. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">10</ref></s><s>Future clinical trials with more patients will have to be performed to identify potential subgroups that can predict a response to omalizumab treatment in SDerm.</s></p><p><s>Future studies are needed to characterize the role of IgE in the pathogenesis of SDerm and the mechanisms of action of omalizumab in SDerm and other physical urticarias.</s><s>Also, additional controlled trials are needed to test whether omalizumab is similarly effective in other physical urticaria types such as solar, heat, or pressure urticaria, all of which have been described in case reports to respond to omalizumab.</s><s>Furthermore, future trials with larger numbers of patients need to provide more detailed information on the time to response after omalizumab treatment and the optimal doses used in the treatment of patients with physical urticaria.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, omalizumab in doses of 150 and 300 mg resulted in a high rate of complete and partial responders in patients with SDerm and a pronounced overall reduction in disease activity and QOL impairment in these patients.</s><s>The results of our study show that patients with SDerm unresponsive to antihistamine treatment can benefit from well-tolerated and effective treatment with omalizumab.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defective protein prenylation is a diagnostic biomarker of mevalonate kinase deficiency</head><p><s>To the Editor: Mevalonate kinase (MVK) deficiency (MKD) is a rare, autosomal-recessive autoinflammatory disease that presents in its milder form as hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS), and in the most severe cases as mevalonic aciduria (MVA). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> It is widely assumed that the inflammatory symptoms of MKD are caused by defective protein prenylation owing to hypomorphic mutations in MVK.</s><s>Prenylation is a posttranslational modification of proteins, particularly small GTPases, with isoprenoid lipids that are generated via the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway 2 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref>).</s><s>Two recent studies in Nature Immunology suggested that loss of the prenylated small GTPases RhoA or K-Ras in MKD results in activation of the pyrin inflammasome and IL-1b secretion. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s>However, although MVK is essential for synthesis of the isoprenoid lipid geranylgeranyl diphosphate needed for the prenylation of Rab-, Rho-, and other families of small GTPases (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref>), numerous studies have been so far unable to convincingly demonstrate directly that prenylation of small GTPases is actually altered in MKD.</s><s>To provide this missing mechanistic evidence, we developed a highly sensitive in vitro prenylation assay that enables the detection of unprenylated small GTPase proteins in cell lysates. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s>The in vitro prenylation assay involves the incorporation of a biotinylated isoprenoid lipid into unprenylated proteins in cell lysates when incubated with a recombinant geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTase) enzyme-either GGTase I (that prenylates Rho, Rac, and Rap proteins) or GGTase II (that prenylates Rab proteins).</s><s>The small GTPases that are prenylated (and thereby biotinylated) in the in vitro prenylation reaction can then be detected with streptavidin after blotting onto membranes. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s>We also used western blotting to specifically detect unprenylated Rap1A. <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s>Both these approaches demonstrated a striking accumulation of unprenylated 21-to 27-kDa Rab proteins and unprenylated 21-kDa Rap1A in PBMCs from an 8-year-old boy with HIDS (V377I/H20N genotype), which was absent in either of his heterozygous, healthy parents (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, B</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, freshly isolated PBMCs from this patient and 2 other patients with HIDS (MKD1, 2, 3 in Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>) who were compound heterozygous or homozygous for the commonest mutation, V377I, all showed an accumulation of unprenylated Rab GTPases.</s><s>This was not due simply to an overall increase in the level of Rab proteins because western blot analysis of Rab 14 did not show an increase in patients with MKD (see Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).</s><s>Consistent with this, we recently used a quantitative proteomic approach to show that the accumulation of unprenylated Rab proteins in HIDS cell lines was not due simply to a larger pool of Rab proteins. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s>he accumulation of unprenylated Rab proteins seen in MKD PBMCs was absent in healthy controls and patients with other autoinflammatory diseases such as familial Mediterranean fever, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and TNF receptorassociated periodic syndrome (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>; genotypes are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">E1</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.</s><s>org).</s><s>The defect in protein prenylation in MKD cells was least obvious in cells from a homozygous V377I patient, consistent with the more variable (and sometimes absent) clinical phenotype of these individuals. <ref type="bibr">8</ref></s><s>However, analysis of PBMCs from this patient on a separate blot, using more protein, revealed a subtle but clear accumulation of unprenylated Rab proteins compared with PBMCs from an unaffected control (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Unprenylated Rap1A, and unprenylated 21-kDa GTPases that are also substrates for GGTase I, <ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> such as Rho, Rac, and K-Ras, could be clearly detected in only 1 compound heterozygous patient with HIDS (MKD 1 in Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>) and were not observed in PBMCs from healthy controls or from patients with other autoinflammatory diseases (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>).</s><s>The detection of unprenylated Rab proteins in MKD PBMCs therefore appears to be a more sensitive indicator of defective prenylation than detection of unprenylated Rap1A or other proteins modified by GGTase I.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, these analyses are the first direct demonstration that protein prenylation is defective in patients with MKD.</s><s>The accumulation of unprenylated proteins in fresh PBMCs therefore appears to be a useful diagnostic biomarker to distinguish MKD from other childhood autoinflammatory disorders.</s><s>Importantly, none of the 3 HIDS/MKD patients analyzed (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, B-D</ref>) were undergoing an inflammatory flare at the time of blood collection and were not receiving treatment.</s><s>Furthermore, we did not find any defect in prenylation in PBMCs from patients treated with statins or bisphosphonate (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">E2,</ref> A and B, and Table <ref type="table">E2</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), 2 widely used classes of drug that also inhibit the mevalonate pathway <ref type="bibr">7</ref> (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, B</ref>).
