1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shaw et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>The radular teeth are used to graze or cut food (algae, detritus, plants or even animals) as the membrane is manipulated by various muscles and cartilages <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Guralnick and Smith, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>There exist seven basic types of radula morphology, considered by some to reflect the various stages in the evolution from carnivorous to herbivorous feeding habits of the different mollusks <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Herbivorous mollusks that graze for algae need more teeth with different functions to scrape, grind and brush the food from the substrate to which they attach <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Limpets (Mollusca, Gastropoda) are a large group of primitive marine mollusks characterized by their inverted cone-shaped shells.</s><s>They mostly inhabit intertidal zones but are also found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cruz and Farina, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The limpet radula is a toothed structure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which contains more than 100 rows of teeth of various kinds, but only the outermost few rows are actively used at any given time <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lowenstam and Weiner, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>During their growth and maturation, the teeth advance in position along the radula in a conveyor belt manner and eventually enter the scraping zone, i.e. the front end of the radula, which is in contact with the substrate while feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lowenstam and Weiner, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>Once the teeth start to function, they begin to wear down until they are discarded, at an average rate of one tooth row per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kirschvink and Lowenstam, 1979)</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, a new row of teeth emerges <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Isarankura and Runham, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shaw et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Limpets are predominantly herbivorous and their radular morphology is either doccoglossan or rhipidoglossan (see schematic in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Goldberg, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The doccoglossan ('docco' is the Latin word for beam and 'glossa' for tongue) radula (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, left panel) is structurally rather primitive, with only two types of teeth (marginal and lateral), whereas the rhipidoglossan ('rhipido' is the Latin word for fan) radula (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, right panel) has a variety of different teeth (marginal, two types of lateral and central).</s></p><p><s>In the doccoglossan radula (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, left panel), there is typically a small central tooth, up to three lateral teeth and up to 3 marginal teeth in each row <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>In some doccoglossate species, the central tooth is missing.</s><s>The teeth are stiff and fixed, and of limited mobility due to the low number of radula muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Doccoglossate radulae are found in the earliest limpets (families Patellidae, Lottiidae, Lepetidae) and function like chains of shovels scraping hardened macroalgae <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cruz and Farina, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Isarankura and Runham, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kirschvink and Lowenstam, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lowenstam and Weiner, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Shaw et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>The large spaces between the teeth are not suitable for collecting microalgae from substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>, such that the doccoglossate limpets are less adaptable to different food resources, i.e. they are limited to feeding on larger algae.</s><s>These early limpet families have mineralized teeth, containing either crystalline goethite and silica (in shallow-water limpets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Faivre and Ukmar Godec, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grime et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lowenstam, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lowenstam, 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sone et al.,

silica and amorphous iron oxide (in the deep-sea hydrothermal vent limpet <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cruz and Farina, 2005)</ref>).</s><s>The combined effects of mineralized teeth on a rigid radula give rise to an enhanced stroke with impressive excavating ability of doccoglossate limpets whilst feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>The mineral fiber length in the doccoglossate limpet teeth was suggested to be optimized to ensure maximal efficiency during mechanical loading <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Lu and Barber, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Doccoglossate limpet teeth were found to have an absolute material tensile strength that is the highest recorded for a biological material <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barber et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>The more advanced so-called rhipidoglossan radula, depicted schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (right), is found in all archeogastropods except in true limpets <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref> and is the most complex and structurally sophisticated among the radulae of herbivorous mollusks.</s><s>It contains numerous different teeth per row and a myriad of muscles in the buccal mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Graham, 1973)</ref>.</s><s>In striking contrast to the doccoglossate limpets the rhipidoglossane limpet teeth are not mineralized with iron compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Goldberg, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Most of the muscles can create minor adjustments of tension and position of the radula ribbon, which splays the numerous marginal teeth during the protraction strokes of the radula <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>The marginal teeth and the more massive lateral teeth are very long as compared to their overall length (see right panel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and the teeth have relatively narrow bases attaching them to the radular membrane.</s><s>Consequently while in function, it is sufficient to induce a small change in the tension applied to the radular membrane, to effect an extensive movement of the distal tips of the teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Collecting the food is assumed to be mostly accomplished by the major lateral and the marginal teeth, whereas the central tooth is thought to be less involved in this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fretter and Graham, 1962)</ref>.</s><s>Because the marginal teeth are typically very long and the lateral teeth are not mineralized, these radulae operate like brooms, typically collecting the softer microalgae and only rarely feeding on the somewhat tougher leathery macrophytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>The complex and well controlled protraction motion of the radular membrane give rise to sweeps, effectively collecting algae with a variety of sizes.</s><s>Larger rhipidoglossate gastropods are able to remove the tougher cortical algal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The giant keyhole limpet Megathura crenulata (Mcren) is a rhipidoglossate limpet, certainly the largest known member of its species, as the name indicates: Mcren can reach up to 13 cm in length.</s><s>This species inhabits the rocky reefs of the eastern Pacific of the North American coast <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Morris et al., 1980)</ref>.</s><s>In California Mcren is important economically, because it produces the extracellular protein hemocyanin, a product used in immunology and oncology <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beninger et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harris and Markl, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Martin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Martin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazariegos-Villarreal et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Mcren differs from typical rhipidoglossate gastropods as it is an omnivorous gastropod, feeding on both red and brown algae as well as on tunicates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beninger et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harris and Markl, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Martin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Martin et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mazariegos-Villarreal et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Morris et al., 1980)</ref>.</s><s>A dominant portion of its diet consists of red algae Coralina although hard articulated calcareous algae such as Coralina are typical docoglossate limpet food.</s><s>Thus, Mcren has found a way to ingest calcareous algae considered to be too hard for the radulae of other rhipidoglossate gastropods <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>The feeding strategy of Mcren thus presumably differs from both the simpler scraping limpets as well as the more evolved sweeping rhipidoglossan mollusks.</s><s>Mcren combines sweeping 'knowhow' of rhipidoglossan radulae <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fretter and Graham, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Graham, 1973;</ref><ref

The outer, brush-like structures are numerous marginal teeth (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a and c</ref> and compare with MT in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> as well as with magnifications in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>The very high aspect ratio is likely the reason for their high flexibility.</s><s>The marginal teeth have a characteristic appearance with small hair-like structures covering the tooth surface (see inset of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4g</ref>).</s><s>Inwards from the marginal teeth on each side, we observe a major hook-like dicuspid lateral tooth (compare with MLT in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a and c</ref> along with Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a-d</ref>).</s><s>The tooth base anchors the tooth cusp to the radular membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b and d</ref>).</s><s>The bases of consecutive major lateral teeth interlock, which probably enhances the stability and rigidity during scraping (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b and d</ref>).</s><s>The tooth side facing the direction of scraping is termed the anterior or ''leading side" and the side facing in the opposite direction is called the posterior or ''trailing side" (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>In the center of the radula, we observe a broad central tooth (also called rachidian tooth, denoted by R) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Khanna and Yadav, 2004)</ref> enclosed by four small unicuspid lateral teeth, of which the outer pair appears to be less developed (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b and 4e and f</ref>).</s><s>The position and orientation of the rachidian tooth in the radula is depicted in the longitudinal cross-section Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The radular tooth formula of Mcren is: 1 + D + 4 + R + 4 + D + 1 where the central rachidian tooth (R) is enclosed with 4 minor lateral teeth, a dominant major lateral tooth (D) and a large number (1) of marginal teeth.</s></p><p><s>A lCT image of a mature part of the radula is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> and readily shows the dominant major dicuspid lateral teeth.</s><s>The marginal teeth appear as brushes on both sides of the radula.</s><s>We observe the size of mature major lateral teeth in a stage mostly unaffected by wear (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and compare to the cusp length and sharpness in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>).</s><s>This can be explained by the fact, that supply of new teeth is a controlled by the radular growth and not the dynamics of tooth wear (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wal et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>This in turn means, that the front-most lying mature teeth have been scraping over a longer period and are hence more extensively worn.</s><s>In addition, the front most part of the radula is curved upwards, suggesting that the late-mature teeth face the substrate at different angles and are exposed to different stresses than the teeth in the mid-and early-mature phase (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The typical separation between the lowest part of the base and the tooth tip is about 1.2 mm.</s><s>The length of the tooth cups is almost 1 mm and the width of the widest part of the cusp is 0.95 mm.</s><s>Thus the length of major lateral teeth of Mcren is about 4-5 times larger than the length of typical doccoglossate limpets such as Patella vulgata <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jones et al., 1935;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mann et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Runham, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Runham et al., 1969)</ref> and Patella caerulea <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Sone et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sone et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Note the variation of the width along the tooth axis, which in Mcren (see central panel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) is much more pronounced than in the simpler scraping limpets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jones et al., 1935;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mann et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Runham, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Runham et al., 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sone et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sone et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the ratio maximal width/ tip length of %1 is much larger than in scraping limpets <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jones et al., 1935;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mann et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Runham, 1962;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Runham et al., 1969;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sone et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sone et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The main features of the Mcren radula agree with conventional descriptors of the rhipidoglossate gastropod radula.</s><s>For instance, the numerous dense marginal teeth are conceivably very efficient in collecting small loosened remnants of algae.</s><s>The major lateral teeth are very dominant and have hook-like shapes.</s><s>The fact that the tooth is curved causes the largest stresses generated during feeding to concentrate near the cusp-base transition region <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(van der Wal et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>In doccoglossate limpets the tooth width first increases and shortly after remains constant in the direction towards the tooth base.</s><s>While the contour of the tooth in Mcren near the tooth base is similar to the one in doccoglossate limpets, the tooth width afterwards increases more extensively and reaches a pronounced maximum at the apex of the hook, i.e. in the region, where stresses concentrate during a stroke (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wal et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>In turn this might be beneficial in the sense that it could represent a local mechanical reinforcement.</s><s>Such a reinforcement might represent an evolutionary upgrade, which contributes to Mcren's ability to harvest hard algae.</s><s>Extensive signs of wear are evidence of intense scraping/cutting activity on hard substrates (such as red calcareous algae).</s><s>The large central tooth exhibits pronounced signs of wear in contrast to the minor lateral as well as marginal teeth.</s><s>A different orientation of the central tooth with respect to the major lateral teeth indicates that this tooth most likely acts like a knife, cutting or grinding the substrate.</s><s>The signs of wear on the major lateral and central tooth contrast with the known rhipidoglossane mode of harvest where the marginal brooms act as the main operational teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fretter and Graham, 1962)</ref>.</s><s>Mcren hence uses a multitude of different tools (hook-like shovels, knives and brooms) in the feeding process.</s><s>The brownish coloration of the front-most part of the radula might be connected to the presence of traces of Fe.</s><s>Namely, ICP-OES measurements revealed observable Fe amounts only in the colored region, which contains predominantly substantially worn teeth.</s><s>This observation suggests that the Fe originates from repeated contact with Mcren's food.</s><s>Alternatively, or in addition to this, the coloration might appear due to protein sclerotization, which is frequently observed in non-mineralized biomaterials <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rubin et al., 2010)</ref> and remains to be analyzed in forthcoming work.</s></p><p><s>The changes accompanying tooth development during the maturation process suggest that Mcren first builds a soft scaffold for the teeth and afterwards gradually reinforces it.</s><s>Note that this reinforcement does not follow the generic biomineralization strategies observed in doccoglossate limpets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Faivre and Ukmar Godec, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sone et al., 2007)</ref> as rhipidoglossan teeth lack the mineralization present in the doccoglossan radulae <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Goldberg, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>Instead, the reinforcement involves only chitin and proteins.</s><s>The initially thin major lateral teeth gradually thicken and their tips gradually reorient from the direction parallel to the radula growth axis into the anti-parallel direction in the maturing stage.</s><s>In this stage, the tooth cusp, and especially the tip of the tooth, becomes thicker.</s><s>Accompanying these observations are also marked changes in the AA composition as well as in the GA content.</s><s>The large drop in the GA content accompanying the transition from the immature to the maturing stage either indicates the formation of a complete chitinous network (resulting in less intrinsically free GA) or the presence of more compacted and less accessible chitin fibers, which are less susceptible to acid hydrolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rupley, 1964)</ref>.</s><s>The X-ray scattering results fully support these observations.</s><s>They further reveal that chitin reinforcement starts at the anterior edge and in the developing tooth at the transition between immature and early maturing teeth.</s><s>In the mature stage, the posterior edge becomes reinforced with chitin fibers as well, but the relative content is lower than in the anterior edge.</s><s>The abrupt change in the AA content and composition further implies that the proteins present during the formation of the chitinous scaffold are very different from those occurring in the maturing and mature stages, where the teeth become thicker.</s><s>The AA composition in the latter stages is strongly dominated by Gly, His and Pro.</s><s>Gly and Pro are generally abundant in fibrilar structural proteins such as collagen, elastin, titin and elastomeric and amyloid fibrils (a large Gly content gives rise to a high degree of helical structure and Pro is a structural disruptor and rigidifier) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cheng et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rauscher et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yang et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The high degree of hydrophobicity of proteins might also be responsible for a decreased susceptibility of chitin fibers to acid hydrolysis by making them less accessible to water.</s><s>Moreover, the Gly and Pro composition is above the threshold in which amyloid formation is impeded and elastomeric properties become apparent <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rauscher et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The Gly and His rich AA composition resembles the one of sclerotized structural proteins, which are mechanical reinforcement materials in some marine invertebrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rubin et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>This suggest that proteins could play an important role for the mechanical properties of the mature radular teeth of Mcren but further analyses are needed to obtain a definite answer.</s><s>The typical rhipidoglossan radulae gastropods have numerous marginal teeth and can sweep and collect loosened material, including microalgae <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Steneck and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>The major lateral teeth of these gastropods are soft and typically not mineralized with iron compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Goldberg, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Steneck and Watling,

and Watling, 1982)</ref>.</s><s>We conclude therefore, that the radula of Mcren functions as a versatile harvest device that can withstand and remove the toughened cortical cells of these calcareous red algae as well as feed on much softer sources of nourishment.</s><s>At this stage it is not yet clear how Mcren is able to tackle the task of consuming the hardened algal species.</s><s>We note, however, that hardness alone is a bad descriptor of the excavating ability of radulae <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Padilla, 1985)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The sophisticated harvesting apparatus of Mcren combines the ability of rhipidoglossane radula to successfully collect loosened small material with a surprisingly high ability to harvest hard algae, typical for doccoglossate limpets.</s><s>Further
