<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Fingolimod (FTY720, brand name Gilenya®) has been approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</s><s>It exerts its therapeutic effects via modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P-) receptors on lymphocytes, which results in the retention of circulating lymphocytes in the lymph nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>As a result, peripheral blood lymphocyte counts are reversibly reduced to approximately 30%, which is postulated to reduce recirculation of autoreactive lymphocytes and to prevent infiltration into the central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Receptors of this class, predominantly S1P1, are also expressed on atrial myocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Fingolimod binding to S1P1 mediates a decrease in heart rate and prolongation of atrioventricular (AV) conduction.</s><s>These effects are transient as fingolimod also induces internalization of these receptors, causing functional antagonism.</s><s>Consequently, the negative chronotropic effects are limited to treatment initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A first-dose observation procedure is recommended.</s><s>The exact procedure is defined by local product labels and differs between countries.</s><s>It is generally required to observe patients for bradycardia by hourly measurements of pulse and blood pressure for at least six hours and to obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) prior to dosing and at the end of the observation period.</s><s>In contrast to the United States (US) and the Australian labels, the European Union (EU) label additionally recommends a continuous Holter ECG for six hours.</s><s>In Japan, continuous ECG and observation of heart rate and blood pressure for 24 hours are recommended.</s></p><p><s>START is a prospective study designed to assess the cardiac safety of fingolimod first dose in detail and in a much larger cohort compared to previous studies.</s><s>Patients and study sites were selected to closely resemble the broad range of fingolimod patients and treatment circumstances in daily practice.</s><s>The study follows the EU label recommendations by obtaining a Holter ECG for six hours in addition to clinical monitoring and pre-/post first dose ECG.</s><s>Therefore, START is the first interventional study that investigates in a large cohort whether continuous ECG monitoring detects clinically meaningful findings beyond pre-/post first dose ECG.</s><s>The results might facilitate guidance on the degree of observation that is necessary to ensure patient safety.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>START (NCT01585298) is an ongoing open-label, multicenter study in Germany in patients with RRMS receiving fingolimod at a daily dose of 0.5 mg.</s><s>Its purpose is (a) to assess cardiac safety of fingolimod first dose with a special focus on bradycardia and AV conduction abnormalities, and (b) to analyze individual arrhythmic episodes more extensively in order to evaluate the clinical relevance of continuous ECG monitoring.</s><s>Up to 7000 patients are planned to be enrolled based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval with a precision of 0.23%.</s><s>Sample size calculation was based on the observed incidence of 0.963% of second-degree or higher AV blocks in the first 1000 patients enrolled.</s><s>Annual interim analyses are planned per protocol to review whether the sample size needs to be adjusted.</s><s>The results of the 2015 interim analysis are reported here.</s><s>At the time of the interim analysis, the number of patients included has largely exceeded the sample size of previous studies, thereby adding significantly to the state of knowledge on the cardiac effects of fingolimod.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoints</head><p><s>The primary endpoints are the incidence of bradycardia, defined as heart rate &lt; 45 bpm, and the incidence of second-and third-degree AV blocks during the six-hour monitoring period.</s><s>For this analysis, three types of second-degree blocks were distinguished: Mobitz type I (progressive prolongation of the PR interval with the subsequent occurrence of a single non-conducted P wave, i.e. atrial impulse that creates a pause), 2:1 (second-degree block with a fixed 2:1 ratio of conducted and nonconducted P waves, that can be the result of either Mobitz I or Mobitz II type blocks) or Mobitz type II (constant PR interval followed by a non-conducted P wave, such that either an occasional dropped P wave or a regular conduction pattern of 2:1, 3:1, and so on is observed).</s><s>Secondary endpoints include the incidence of other conduction abnormalities such as first-degree AV block (PR-interval prolongation), and QTc prolongation.</s><s>The latter is defined as QTc &gt; 450 ms in males and &gt; 470 ms in females.</s><s>Additionally, QTc prolongations &gt; 500 ms are identified as these patients required overnight monitoring as specified by the EU label.</s></p><p><s>To analyze the incidence of bradycardia, pulse palpation by study personnel was used.</s><s>In detail, study personnel were advised to measure the heart rate for at least 15 s.</s><s>Second-and third-degree AV blocks were identified from continuous Holter ECG recordings.</s><s>The remaining variables, i.e.</s><s>PR-and QT-interval, were taken from 12-lead ECG data.</s><s>Fridericia formula was used for correction of the QT intervals.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety assessments</head><p><s>The incidence of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) was determined applying the definitions and standards of the ICH guideline on clinical safety data management.</s><s>Further, the incidence of AE suggestive for cardiac events was determined using the following MedDRA preferred terms: Angina pectoris, chest discomfort, dizziness, dyspnoea, exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, palpitations, syncope, vertigo, positional vertigo, and blurred vision.</s></p><p><s>The incidence of overnight hospitalization was defined as the number of patients who experienced a cardiac AE (any AE out of the system organ class "cardiac disorders") starting on the day of the first fingolimod intake and who were hospitalized for this event.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical relevance of continuous ECG monitoring</head><p><s>To assess the relevance of continuous ECG monitoring, the identified second-degree AV blocks were assessed for clinical relevance, i.e. the occurrence of any cardiac symptoms in these patients.</s><s>Furthermore, continuous ECG recordings of patients with AV blocks were evaluated rigorously.</s><s>The duration of pauses (RR intervals) and the minimal heart rate during second-degree AV blocks were determined post hoc by the cardiologist.</s><s>The minimal heart rate during AV blocks was defined as the mean heart rate of 10 beats during an AV block to detect short lasting changes in heart rate.</s><s>Holter ECG data of patients with cardiac symptoms were assessed for any abnormalities that might have predicted the symptoms.</s><s>Alignment of evaluations of bradycardia as assessed by study nurse and the Holter ECG were also evaluated post hoc.</s><s>No statistical comparison between Holter ECG and 12-lead ECG plus pulse palpation assessment with respect to the incidence of cardiac events was performed.</s></p><p><s>Results of START were analyzed descriptively.</s><s>Where indicated, statistical tests were performed based on Student's t-test unless otherwise noted.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approval and participants</head><p><s>The study protocol was approved by the respective state and institutional ethical standards committees at all participating sites (Competent ethics committee: Ethikkommission der Ärztekammer Nordrhein; EUDRACT No. 2012-000653-32-DE).</s><s>Patients have to give written informed consent.</s><s>The inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined to select patients with RRMS who were eligible for treatment with fingolimod (Gilenya®) according to the EU label.</s><s>Patients were excluded if they received class Ia or III antiarrythmic drugs or beta blockers, heart-rate-lowering calcium channel blockers or other substances which may decrease heart rate (e.g.</s><s>digoxin, anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine).</s><s>Furthermore, patients were excluded if they have a history of seconddegree Mobitz Type II or higher-degree AV block, Sicksinus syndrome, Sino-atrial heart block, significant QT prolongation, symptomatic bradycardia or recurrent syncope, known ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, hypokalemia, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrest, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe sleep apnea.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study procedures</head><p><s>Patients' eligibility was determined during a 4-week screening phase (visit 1).</s><s>At the first-dose visit (visit 2), patients underwent baseline assessments of basic demographic and relevant clinical characteristics including MS status, concomitant medication, vital signs, blood count and blood chemistry.</s><s>A 12-lead ECG prior to the first dose of fingolimod was recorded.</s><s>After the first intake of the study drug, patients were monitored for six hours by continuous Holter ECG recording, while heart rate and blood pressure were measured simultaneously, every hour.</s><s>Afterwards, a second 12-lead ECG was recorded.</s><s>The 6-hour monitoring period reflects the current EU label and was considered sufficient as the nadir of the heart rate decrease usually occurs four hours post-dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>At visit 3, i.e. 1 week after study drug initiation, a third 12-lead ECG is recorded and vital signs, blood count and blood chemistry were assessed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Adverse events were recorded at all visits.</s></p><p><s>If the patient's heart rate at the end of the 6-hour period is the lowest following first dose administration, the monitoring had to be extended by at least two hours and until the heart rate rises.</s><s>In those patients with evidence of clinically important cardiac events (e.g.</s><s>persistent new-onset seconddegree or third-degree AV block, heart rate &lt; 45 bpm at six hours after first dose, QTc interval ≥ 500 msec), monitoring had to be extended until full resolution of symptoms, including overnight monitoring.</s><s>If a patient required pharmacologic intervention during the first dose observation, the first dose monitoring strategy had to be repeated after the second dose of fingolimod.</s><s>Study medication had to be interrupted or discontinued in cases of atypical neurological deterioration, lymphopenia &lt; 200/μl, and a more than 5-fold elevation of liver function tests.</s><s>In other cases the decision on continuation of study drug was at the discretion of the physician and the patient.</s></p><p><s>Each study site was equipped with the ECG-device Cardi-oMem® CM3000-12, a 12-lead-continuous-ECG-digital recorder.</s><s>The ECG recordings were pseudonymized and immediately transmitted via internet to the cardiology reading center for evaluation.</s><s>The results of ECG analysis were available to the treating physician within less than 40 min.</s><s>To identify AV blocks all Holter ECG recordings were assessed according to the same automated analysis process.</s><s>Subsequently, two independent cardiologists manually reviewed every second-or third-degree AV block episode to determine the exact AV block subtype per episode, the number of episodes, the duration of the longest pause and the minimal heart rate (mean of ten consecutive beats).</s></p><p><s>Twice a year, an external and independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), consisting of two neurologists and a cardiologist, reviewed safety-related issues.</s><s>The DSMB was entitled to recommend changes in study conduct.</s></p></div>

nighttime (&gt;12 h after first dose) does not seem higher than in the healthy population.</s><s>However, as the study cohorts differ, a valid comparison of incidence rates would require adjustment for variations in patient characteristics.</s></p><p><s>Except for one case accompanied by mild symptoms, AV blocks observed in the START study were not associated with cardiac symptoms.</s><s>Thus, the pathologic ECG findings were usually not associated with any clinically relevant event.</s><s>Conversely, none of the few mild cardiac symptoms observed showed a corresponding event in the Holter ECG.</s><s>In summary, Holter ECG data provide scientifically valuable information of an in-depth understanding of the electrocardiographic effects of fingolimod, but does not help to identify patients at risk for clinically relevant cardiac symptoms.</s></p><p><s>As lower degree AV conduction abnormalities also occur in an otherwise healthy population without clinical significance, they are generally not considered harmful <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In general, type I second-degree AV blocks do not require intervention as long as they are asymptomatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>On the contrary, third-degree and type II seconddegree AV blocks usually warrant intervention and even constitute an indication for permanent pacemaker implantation, which indicates their prognostic relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, this approach does not apply to druginduced lower degree AV blocks, which are

START study indicate that the nature of AV conduction effects of fingolimod might differ from other AV block inducing drugs.</s><s>For example, drug-induced AV blocks are usually associated with significant slowing of heart rate.</s><s>However, in fingolimod-induced second-degree AV  blocks no relevant decrease in heart rate was observed.</s><s>The mean minimal heart rate over ten consecutive beats during AV block observed was 51.5 bpm.</s><s>Furthermore, the Holter ECGs did not show relevant pauses.</s><s>Usually, pauses are reported if they exceed 3 s in patients with sinus rhythm.</s><s>The longest pause recorded in association with a second-degree AV block in this study was 2.6 s.</s><s>The absence of relevant pauses is underlined by the fact that the events mostly remained asymptomatic.</s><s>Finally, none of the AV blocks progressed to a complete block (third-degree AV block), as would have been expected for drugs known to induce AV blocks (e.g.</s><s>calcium channel blockers).</s><s>Therefore, AV blocks associated with fingolimod treatment initiation can be considered as rather benign, selflimiting and associated with an either low or virtually non-existing propensity to progression to a complete AV block.</s><s>Although affected by fingolimod, overall AV conduction, which is determined by several ion currents (i.e.</s><s>particularly by calcium currents) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, remains preserved.</s><s>In the present study, AV blocks were not preceded by excessive slowing of heart, what would be expected, but followed increases in heart rate.</s><s>This suggests that slowing of AV conduction is due to a positive rate-dependent electrophysiological effect of fingolimod.</s><s>A mild direct effect of fingolimod on the AV node was postulated in a rodent study, where S1P1 receptor mRNA expression was found to be high in the AV node.</s><s>Fingolimod prolonged the cycle length in isolated AV node cells by 9% from 230 to 251 ms.</s><s>Under pathological conditions (such as ischemia/reperfusion), fingolimod did not further prolong AV conduction.</s><s>Fingolimod-induced AV node conduction abnormalities were discussed to be the result of a direct effect of the  PT preferred term, SOC system organ class drug on ion channels expressed in the AV node with mild prolongation of AV conduction time <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Generally speaking, the effects of fingolimod on AV conduction have to be interpreted and weighed in the broader context of its beneficial effects in a progressive disease such as MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref
