<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Whole-genome analyses have now produced near-comprehensive topographies of coding mutations for certain human cancers, enabling both detailed molecular studies of cancer pathogenesis and potential of precisely targeted therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> .</s><s>For certain childhood cancers, recent studies have begun to reveal the essential functions of complex non-coding structural variants that can induce aberrant expression of cellular proto-oncogenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> .</s><s>However, for many aggressive childhood cancers including embryonal tumors, such studies have identified distinct cancer subtypes that have no discernible coding mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> .</s><s>In addition, while for some cancers, defects in DNA damage repair have been suggested to explain their increased incidence at a relatively young age, the causes of complex genomic rearrangements in cancers of young children without apparent widespread genomic instability remain largely unknown.</s></p><p><s>Rhabdoid tumor is a prototypical example of this question.</s><s>Rhabdoid tumors occur in the developing tissues of infants and children, leading to tumors with neuroectodermal, epithelial and mesenchymal components in the brain, liver, kidney and other organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> .</s><s>Rhabdoid tumors that cannot be cured with surgery are generally chemotherapy resistant and almost uniformly lethal <ref type="bibr">14</ref> .</s><s>Rhabdoid tumors exhibit inactivating mutations of SMARCB1, generally as a result of genomic rearrangements of the 22q11.2</s><s>chromosomal locus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>These mutations can be inherited as part of the rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome, but are not thought to involve chromosomal instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> .</s><s>While SMARCB1 mutations are sufficient to cause rhabdoid tumors in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , human rhabdoid tumors have been observed to have multiple molecular subtypes and rearrangements of additional chromosomal loci that are poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>These findings suggest that additional genetic elements and molecular mechanisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of rhabdoid tumors.</s></p><p><s>In humans, nearly half of the genome is comprised by sequences derived from transposons, including both autonomous and non-autonomous mobile genetic elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>The majority of human genes that encode enzymes that can mobilize transposons appear to be catalytically inactive, with the exception of L1 long interspersed repeated sequences (LINEs) that appear to induce structural genomic variation in human neurons and adenocarcinomas 20-22 , Mariner transposase-derived SETMAR that functions in DNA repair 23 , and Transib-like DNA transposase RAG1/2 that catalyzes somatic recombination of V(D)J receptor genes in lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>In particular, aberrant activity of RAG1/2 in lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas can induce the formation of chromosomal translocations that generate transforming fusion genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</s><s>The identity of and mechanisms by which similar genomic rearrangements may be formed in childhood solid tumors are unknown, but the existence of additional human recombinases that can induce somatic DNA rearrangements has long been hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Recently, human PGBD5 and THAP9 have been found to catalyze transposition of synthetic DNA transposons in human cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>The physiologic functions of these activities are currently not known.</s><s>PGBD5 is distinguished by its deep evolutionary conservation among vertebrates (∼500 million years) and developmentally restricted expression in tissues from which childhood embryonal tumors, including rhabdoid tumors, are thought to originate 30,31 .</s><s>PGBD5 is transcribed as a multi-intronic and non-chimeric transcript from a gene that encodes a full-length transposase that became immobilized on human chromosome 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Genomic transposition activity of PGBD5 requires distinct aspartic acid residues in its transposase domain, and specific DNA sequences containing inverted terminal repeats with similarity to the lepidopteran Trichoplusia ni piggyBac transposons <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>These findings, combined with the recent evidence that PGBD5 can induce genomic rearrangements that inactivate the HPRT1 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , prompted us to investigate whether PGBD5 may induce site-specific DNA rearrangements in human rhabdoid tumors that share developmental origin with cells that normally express PGBD5.</s></p></div>

accessibility or the presence of cellular co-factors, as determined by cellular developmental states.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the spectrum of PGBD5-induced genomic rearrangements and their PSS sequences identified in this study should provide a useful approach to the functional characterization of childhood tumor genomes and identification of cancer-causing genomic alterations.</s><s>In the case of rhabdoid tumors, the association of SMARCB1 mutations with additional recurrent genomic lesions, such as structural alterations of CNTNAP2, TENM2 and TET2 genes that can regulate developmental and epigenetic cell fate specification, may lead to the identification of additional mechanisms of childhood cancer pathogenesis, including those that cooperate with the dysregulation of SWI/SNF/BAF-mediated nucleosome remodeling induced by SMARCB1 loss.</s><s>Notably, the recurrence patterns of PGBD5-induced genomic rearrangements in rhabdoid tumors indicate that even for rare cancers, more comprehensive tumor genome analyses will be necessary to define the spectrum of causal genomic lesions and potential therapeutic targets.</s><s>Our results also indicate that improved genome analysis methods, such as SMuFin and laSV used in our work <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , and confirmation of their sensitivity and specificity, will be needed to elucidate tumorigenic genome rearrangements.</s><s>Similarly, given the existence of distinct molecular subtypes of rhabdoid tumors 9,10 , it will be important to determine to what extent PGBD5induced genome remodeling contributes to this phenotypic diversity.</s></p><p><s>In summary, PGBD5 defines a distinct class of oncogenic mutators that contribute to cell transformation not due to mutational activation but rather as a result of their aberrant induction and chromatin targeting to induce site-specific transforming genomic rearrangements.</s><s>Our data identify PGBD5 as an endogenous human DNA transposase that is sufficient to fully transform primary immortalized human cells in the absence of chromosomal instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Given the expression of PGBD5 in various childhood and adult solid tumors, either by virtue of its aberrant or co-opted tissue expression, we anticipate that PGBD5 may also contribute to their pathogenesis.</s><s>Similarly, it will be important to investigate the functions of PGBD5 in normal vertebrate and mammalian development, given its ability to induce site-specific somatic genomic rearrangements in human cells.</s><s>Finally, the functional requirement for cellular NHEJ DNA repair in PGBD5-induced cell transformation might foster rational therapeutic strategies for rhabdoid and other tumors involving endogenous DNA transposases.</s></p></div>
