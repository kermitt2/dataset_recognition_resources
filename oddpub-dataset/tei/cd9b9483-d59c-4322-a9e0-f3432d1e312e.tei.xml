			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: An immunotherapy formulation consisting of 3 contiguous overlapping peptides (COPs) derived from Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, showed good clinical tolerability in a previous phase I/IIa clinical trial.</s><s>Objectives: We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allergen-specific immunotherapy using 2 dose regimens of Bet v 1 COPs versus placebo in subjects with birch pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.</s><s>Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb clinical trial was performed to assess the efficacy of Bet v 1 COP immunotherapy during the 2013 birch pollen season.</s><s>Before the season, Bet v 1 COPs (50 and 100 mg in aluminum hydroxide) or placebo (saline and aluminum hydroxide) were administered as 5 subcutaneous injections to 239 adults with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis to birch pollen.</s><s>Bet v 1 COPs at 25 or 50 mg were administered on day 1, and 50 or 100 mg was administered on days 8, 15, 29, and 57, respectively.</s><s>Patients were monitored for adverse events during the treatment period and assessed for combined rhinoconjunctivitis symptom and medication scores, as well as quality of life.</s><s>Results: Rhinoconjunctivitis symptom and medication scores improved in both Bet v 1 COP-treated groups, reaching statistical significance over placebo in the 50-mg group (least squares mean, 20.23; 26% improvement; P 5 .015).</s><s>Both active groups showed significant improvement in quality of life and nighttime nasal symptom scores, supporting the primary end point findings.</s><s>Bet v 1 COP injections were well tolerated, with a higher frequency of systemic adverse events in the 100-mg group.</s><s>Conclusion: Two months of preseasonal immunotherapy with 3 COPs derived from Bet v 1 at a 50-mg dose showed promising efficacy, small risk for systemic reactions, and immunomodulatory changes in this single-season, dose-finding, phase IIb trial in patients allergic to birch pollen.</s></p></div>

v 1 COP doses improved RSMSs compared with placebo.</s><s>Improvement of LS means by 26% over placebo in the primary end point was significant in the 50-mg Bet v 1 COP group and greater than the clinically relevant efficacy limit of 20% generally admitted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> The 100-mg group showed almost the same RSS level; however, they did not reach significance in RSMSs.</s><s>On post hoc analysis, the high medication score observed in the 100-mg Bet v 1 COP group (see Table <ref type="table">E2</ref>) could be explained by sustained self-administration of oral corticosteroids (highest weight in the score) in 5 of 82 patients for a prolonged period  of time.</s><s>Interestingly, the 100-mg Bet v 1 COP group was undistinguishable from the 50-mg group in both MiniRQLQ scores and NNSSs.</s><s>Considering the limited statistical power of the study, both dosages can be considered equivalent in efficacy, with no additional benefit from higher dose, as previously observed in another AIT study based on peptides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>ong synthetic peptides appeared safe in several vaccine trials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> as well as in 2 AIT trials based on COPs derived from phospholipase A 2 , the major allergen of bee venom, or from Bet v 1 in a recent phase I/IIa study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>COPs were carefully selected among several sets of peptides, leading to the choice of Bet v 1 COPs, a set of 3 long synthetic peptides with the lowest IgE-binding capacity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>The safety of COPs was clearly demonstrated in preclinical murine models, in which intraperitoneal injection of COPs did not induce allergic reactions in contrast to native allergen and protected mice from anaphylaxis on re-exposure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>In this study, as in the previous phase I/IIa study, we show that most local AEs are related to aluminum hydroxide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>The number of dropouts caused by treatment-related AEs was limited to 2.8% in the 50-mg group but reached 9.8% in the 100-mg group, suggesting an improved clinical tolerance of the 50-mg dose.</s><s>The same trend was observed when comparing the frequency of systemic allergic reactions between the 2 dose groups, which nonetheless remained mild to moderate.</s><s>Another phase IIb study is currently in progress, which might help us better define the relationship between a series of lower Bet v 1 COP dose levels and tolerability in the setting of an experimental pollen exposure chamber model.</s></p><p><s>Administration of Bet v 1 COPs resulted in FEV 1 decreases of 30% or greater in 6.5% of patients, most of them occurring late (&gt;3 hours) after the first or second injection.</s><s>Such respiratory events were also observed in early clinical trials with short T-cell epitope peptides, as well as with longer allergen fragments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>The number and severity of FEV 1 decreases might have been overestimated in the present study, possibly because of self-measurement by the patient in the absence of medical supervision.</s><s>However, none of the FEV 1 decreases led to SAE reporting, an emergency department visit, or even a call to the investigator before the next scheduled visit (24 hours after injection).</s><s>Episodes of pulmonary symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath, or dyspnea, were more frequent in the 100-mg group (55% of the patients) and in the 50-mg group (35%) than in the placebo group (13%), indicating a probable relationship between Bet v 1 COPs and late respiratory systemic reactions.</s><s>The mechanisms of these late allergic reactions are not fully understood, but most probably are dependent on T-cell activation rather than IgE binding or mast cell or eosinophil activation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>Such respiratory AEs also occurred in AIT trials based on major T-cell epitope peptides, which are unable to bind IgE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>In the present trial, as well as in previous peptide-based AIT studies, FEV 1 decreases were mainly observed to decrease after the first injection, thus arguing again for early T-cell activation, followed by progressive T-cell tolerance on repeated injections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>Other non-lower respiratory tract AEs were mild and occurred also late after injection, including skin, upper respiratory tract, and eye symptoms, once more suggesting T-cell activation rather than IgE-dependent mast cell activation.</s><s>Finally, only 2 WAO grade 3 events that were relatively moderate in severity were considered SAEs (a third one was unrelated to vaccine) because they occurred within 60 minutes of the injections.</s><s>Taken together, this safety report is clearly distinct from earlier trials based on nonselected allergen fragments or recombinant allergen <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> or restricted T-cell epitope peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> by the very limited number of immediate allergic reactions and SAEs, which were of moderate severity and did not require hospitalization, although they were considered SAEs by protocol definition.</s><s>All other AEs were mild to moderate in severity, and all resolved without medical intervention within a few hours.</s></p><p><s>The increase in IgG 4 levels after AIT represents the only marker associated with successful immunotherapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>We confirm here the findings of our phase I/IIa trial (ie, a vigorous induction of Bet v 1-specific IgG 4 of about 20-fold 1 month after the treatment phase).</s><s>IgG 4 values persisted at increased levels up to 3 years after Bet v 1 COP treatment, which is suggestive of long-term immunologic memory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>These results are in sharp contrast with the absence of IgG 4 induction observed in clinical trials based on short T-cell epitopes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>Thus an interval of 1 month between the last injection and the start of the pollen season appears ideal to reach an optimal plateau of IgG 4 serum level.</s><s>No increase in IgG 4 levels was observed in the placebo group in contrast to IgE levels, which increased in all groups in proportion similar to those observed during the pollen season. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>n conclusion, for the first time, this study demonstrates that a short course of AIT with COPs efficiently immunomodulated the allergic response of patients with rhinoconjunctivitis during the first season after treatment, improving symptoms and quality of life without inducing more safety concerns than conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>Furthermore, this approach induced a particularly strong IgG 4 -specific response, the hallmark of successful immunotherapy.</s><s>Follow-up studies will help to define the duration of protection and possibly better characterize subjects with potential risk of late allergic reactions.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG 1
