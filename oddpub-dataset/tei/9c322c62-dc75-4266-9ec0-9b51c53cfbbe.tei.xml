<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The musculoskeletal system is central to work, locomotion, and posture.</s><s>Maintaining its integrity during long-duration spaceflight is essential to mission completion as well as to astronaut health during and after the mission.</s><s>One of the principal obstacles facing the design and implementation of long-duration exploration class missions is the fact that, without countermeasures, all components of the musculoskeletal system are altered by the environment of the long-duration mission.</s><s>These comprise exposure to microgravity, amounts and characteristics of space radiation that differ from those of Earth and even from those of low Earth orbit, as well as changes in diet and light exposure that can impact the metabolism of musculoskeletal tissues.</s><s>Deleterious changes noted in ground-based models as well as the current evidence base of over 30 years of long-duration missions in low orbit (over 15 years of experience in the International Space Station, ISS) include extensive bone loss, loss of muscle mass and strength, increased risk of kidney stones, vertebral disk alterations, and lower back pain as well as changes to the elasticity of the tendons.</s><s>In the absence of countermeasures, these changes can be severe, potentially impacting the safety and performance of crew members during extravehicular activities (EVA) in microgravity and partial gravity environments, and putting them at risk for injuries and other health impairments upon return to Earth.</s></p><p><s>This review summarizes and expands on the discussions that took place in the Bone and Muscle Advisory group of the project entitled "Towards Human Exploration of Space: a European Strategy (THESEUS).</s><s>The aim of THESEUS was to recommend a set of research priorities to the European Space Agency (ESA) for the preservation of health and performance of ESA astronauts, with the goal of suggesting approaches that would build on the technical and economic strengths of the European Community.</s><s>The goal of this review is to describe the base of knowledge accumulated thus far regarding the changes to the musculoskeletal system in long-duration spaceflight and the efficacy of countermeasure approaches for preventing or at least reducing the impact of those changes.</s><s>We will review evidence from ground-based and space-based studies in both human and animal models, and recommend priorities for further studies required to understand and mitigate the risks to the musculoskeletal system associated with very long duration missions beyond low-Earth orbit, such as to Mars or asteroids.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BONE AND MUSCLE LOSS: EVALUATIONS IN SPACEFLIGHT</head><p><s>Early findings of bone loss in long-duration missions Pre-flight and post-flight studies carried out on the Russian MIR and early ISS missions, studies of astronauts performed pre-flight and postflight have documented the magnitude and regional variation of bone loss.</s><s>In a study of 26 MIR cosmonauts undergoing bone mineral density (BMD) measurements with dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after spaceflights lasting 6 months on average, LeBlanc et al. reported losses of BMD averaging around 1% per month of spaceflight at the spine and femoral neck and 1.5% per month at the trochanter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Thus, in roughly 1 month of spaceflight, these subjects incurred a loss of BMD typically observed over a year in a postmenopausal woman.</s><s>In a study of members of the first eight ISS crews, Lang et al. employed quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to image changes in hip and spine volumetric BMD (vBMD) over flights of similar lengths. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Compared to DXA, which measures the integral bone compartment, combining changes in both the trabecular and cortical bone, QCT allows for separate depiction of the bone compartments.</s><s>Similar to the earlier MIR study, Lang et al. found that ISS crew lost 1-1.5% per month integral vBMD at the hip and spine, but QCT measurements showed that the cortical and trabecular vBMD changed at different rates, with trabecular bone losses at the hip ranging from 2-2.7% per month, with losses of cortical BMD less than 1% per month and for some proximal femoral subregions, not statistically significant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>While hip cortical vBMD changed relatively little over the flight, measures of cortical bone mass and volume changed at the rate of 1% per month, consistent with the integral measurements, and indicating that bone was lost by decreased cortical thickness rather than loss of density.</s><s>The severe losses of bone observed at the proximal femur were not observed in the spine.</s><s>At the spine, this study reported a low rate of trabecular bone loss (&lt;1% per month), but losses in the integral and cortical compartments, as well as the posterior processes, which were similar or slightly larger than was reported in Leblanc et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In order to directly assess the impact of spaceflight on the strength of the hip, Keyak et al. analyzed the QCT data from the ISS study using finite element modeling (FEM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>5]<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> By estimating the mechanical load required for the hip to fracture, CT-FEM provides a more clinical relevant measure of skeletal integrity.</s><s>In the FEM studies, Keyak observed that astronauts lost 2.4-2.7% of their hip strength per month of spaceflight, comparable to the trabecular losses and larger than those observed for BMD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The variability of loss was very high, with one of 13 subjects experiencing a strength loss of 50%, more than the lifetime loss associated with aging over the course of a 6-month mission.</s><s>In contrast, other subjects experienced no detectable strength loss.</s><s>Other investigators have examined changes in vBMD in the peripheral skeleton using smaller peripheral CT scanners designed to scan the distal radius and tiba.</s><s>Vico et al. observed in a study of 11 cosmonauts with 6month MIR flights, a mean loss of trabecular vBMD from the distal tibia of roughly 5%, with a 1.7% mean loss of cortical bone, similar to the proximal femur study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>They also observed, in keeping with the earlier MIR results, minimal loss at the distal radius, indicating that the greatest changes are observed in the load bearing skeleton.</s></p><p><s>Studies following up bone density measurements in the years after spaceflight show varying patterns of recovery, depending on the measurement approach.</s><s>Sibonga et al. followed DXA BMD measurements in astronauts after completion of missions averaging 6 months in length. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>They found that recovery of DXA bone density fit an exponential pattern, was incomplete 1 year from flight, but approached baseline levels asymptotically over the next 2 years.</s><s>Studies employing volumetric QCT show that, for the proximal femur, recovery after spaceflight is a process involving differential changes in cortical and trabecular bone density, and in size. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> </s><s> second study by Lang et al. included measurements taken 1 year after the completion of spaceflight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>This study found that although integral BMD and bone mineral content were recovered 1 year after spaceflight, trabecular bone and integral volumetric bone density did not recover fully.</s><s>In fact, during the year after flight, the size of the proximal femur increased as measured by proximal femur volumes and femoral neck cross sectional area.</s><s>These bone size measures were significantly larger at 1 year than pre-flight.</s><s>The presence of larger bone size, thinner cortices and lower trabecular bone density indicated that the combination of spaceflight and post-flight recovery induced irreversible changes in bone, with unknown consequences for fracture at more advanced age.</s><s>A subset of these subjects were followed by Carpenter et al. for 2-4 years after completion of their missions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>They observed that while the recovery of proximal femoral trabecular bone tended to drop off or reverse, cortical vBMD continued to increase, and thus, modest increases in cortical bone density may be a key factor in the asymptotic recovery of DXA BMD.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Countermeasure studies</head><p><s>Countermeasures to bone loss have involved use of exercise to replace, or at least partially replace mechanical loads sustained in 1 g.</s><s>Initial countermeasures available on MIR involved a treadmill system and exercise bicycle.</s><s>Cosmonauts also made use of a "penguin suit", which tended to force the body into a fetal position and in which continuous muscle forces were required to maintain the torso in an extended position. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>On the ISS, early countermeasures, up to 2004, included an Interim Resistance Exercise Device (iRED), <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> as well as a treadmill (in which bungee cords were used to tension crew to the device) and exercise bicycle.</s><s>Despite the presence of resistance and aerobic exercise countermeasures on both the MIR and early ISS missions, early crews still showed extensive bone loss. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> In 2004, NASA installed the advanced resistance exercise device (aRED), <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> which had higher loads aimed at increasing forces on bone, particularly the spine and proximal femur.</s><s>Initial results from crew members who exercised on the aRED were encouraging.</s><s>In 2012, Smith et al. carried out a study on five ISS astronauts (mission length 48-215 days) who exercised on the aRED, comparing energy intake, vitamin D levels, bone resorption markers and BMD measurements to 8 previous ISS crew who had exercised on the iRED device. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Compared to crews who exercised on the earlier iRED device, these subjects had higher energy intake (90% of World Health Organization recommendations compared to 70-80% for the initial crews) and higher Vitamin D levels due to an increase in supplementation from 400 to 800 International Units per day.</s><s>The skeletal response was monitored through observation of bone metabolism markers throughout the missions and pre-flight and post-flight measurements of BMD.</s><s>Markers of bone metabolism, both formation and resorption, increased in both iRED and aRED exercisers, but data suggested that aRED exercise attenuated the resorption increase relative to iRED.</s><s>The iRED, but not the aRED exercisers, showed a decrease in BMD through the flight.</s><s>Postflight BMD in the five crewmembers, who exercised on aRED, was not statistically different from preflight BMD.</s><s>Compared to iRED exercisers, aRED exercisers returned with higher percentage lean mass and lower percentage fat mass.</s><s>A subsequent study examined whether adding anti-resorptive treatment to aRED exercise was beneficial in reducing bone loss.</s><s>Using indices of bone density and strength derived from QCT and bone densitometry by DXA, Leblanc et al. compared a group of astronauts combining aRED exercise with the anti-resorptive medication alendronate (n = 7) to untreated subjects exercising on the aRED (n = 11), with both groups compared to a control group of iRED exercisers (n = 18). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>The combination of an antiresorptive drug and aRED exercise attenuated all indices of bone loss by DXA and QCT.</s><s>Although their levels of bone loss at hip and spine tended to be lower than those on the iRED, untreated subjects treated on the aRED experienced significant decreases from baseline in DXA BMD measures of the femoral neck and total hip, and these losses were statistically significant when compared to the treated aRED exercisers as well.</s><s>Studies of bone biochemistry of exercising subjects, both iRED and aRED, show increased levels of both bone resorption and formation during spaceflight. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>aRED exercise tended to increase the level of bone formation markers without appreciably reducing the elevated resorption markers, which were attenuated only when antiresorptive treatment is added to exercise.</s><s>Thus, high-intensity resistance exercise shows strong evidence for substantially reducing the rate of bone loss in long-duration spaceflight as well as maintaining lean mass and physical condition.</s><s>Part of the effect may come from the fact that astronauts are told to eat more in order to achieve the nutrient intake levels required for their physical activity, with both the increased loading of the musculoskeletal system, and the increased nutritional intake contributing to a preservation of bone and muscle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>However, while exercise appears to improve the bone turnover balance by increasing bone formation markers, there is still significant loss at a lower level, which is only attenuated by use of an anti-resorptive medication.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knowledge gaps</head><p><s>Studies on the ISS have shown that heavy resistance exercise can significantly reduce bone loss and that treatment with antiresorptive medications (alendronate) combined with heavy resistance exercise can prevent bone loss.</s><s>Although this work has demonstrated the value of these approaches, considerable additional research is required.</s><s>More information is required concerning the efficacy of intermittent timing of exercise bouts, on age and sex differences in exercise countermeasure efficacy as well as the efficacy of exercise for protecting other physiologic systems, such as the immune system and brain.</s><s>There is a need to investigate new frontline therapies against bone loss, including novel anti-resorptive as well as anabolic agents.</s><s>Finally, there is a need for further bed rest data on combination countermeasure approaches, such as timed nutritional-exercise countermeasures, combined exercise and anti-resorptive treatment, and in the use of anti-oxidants to combat both radiation and disuse.</s></p><p><s>Recommendations for future study While initial studies have hinted at sex differences in bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> and skeletal muscle response ref. 26 to exercise in spaceflight, further analyses with larger sample sizes will be required to fully elucidate these differences.</s><s>Additionally, the influence of age in the response to exercise countermeasure efficacy should be evaluated.</s><s>Attention should also be given to testing exercise approaches that combine resistance exercises with balance and proprioception.</s><s>Such studies could take advantage of novel analog environments such as :envihab, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> a facility operated by the German Aerospace Center, which combines aspects of disuse and isolation, with varying atmospheric pressure and a short arm centrifuge.</s><s>This type of facility should be utilized to determine the protective effect of exercise on brain and immune function when exercise is carried out in isolated environments, while varying other conditions such as intermittent gravity level and other environmental conditions.</s><s>Studies should be performed that combine nutritional and pharmacologic approaches with exercise to determine if there are synergistic effects.</s><s>Future facilities such as the large Human Hypergravity Habitat, H3, might be applied to explore chronic applications of hypergravity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s></p></div>
