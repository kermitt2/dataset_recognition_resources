Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is the world's most consumed psychostimulant.</s><s>It is contained in coffee, tea, energy drinks, and several soft drinks.</s><s>After oral consumption, caffeine is quickly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and the highest blood concentrations are reached after 30-60 min.</s><s>The half-life time of caffeine in the human body amounts to 3 to 3.5 h on average, but shows high inter-individual variation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Similar caffeine concentrations have been found in the blood and in the cerebrospinal fluid, indicating that the blood brain barrier is no obstacle for caffeine <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Physiologically, caffeine impedes the binding of adenosine to its receptors in the cell membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and thus causes a mild dilation of blood vessels and increases in blood pressure, metabolic rate, and urine production <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Augmenting effects include increased alertness and reduced fatigue, leading to better performance especially in simple psychomotor tasks demanding fast reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Transferred to real-life situations, caffeine has been shown to improve, for example, steering accuracy, and reduces the number of incidents in a driving simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>However, for more complex and cognitively demanding tasks, the effects of caffeine appear inconsistent and reports of increased performance in demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> coexist with null findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>It has been suggested that inconsistent effects under high cognitive loads are caused by interactions between baseline arousal state, dose and inter-individual differences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</s><s>For example, moderate doses of caffeine to rested individuals have led to heightened vigilance and faster reaction times while cognitive functions such as memory or learning were unaffected <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, fatigued and exhausted participants showed improvement in working memory after caffeine compared to placebo administration, although the effects were likely attributable to the restored ability to sustain attention during the task rather than to direct improvement in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Subjective effects of caffeine also include increased feelings of wellbeing, mental energy, motivation, and self-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>According to the withdrawal reversal hypothesis, such benefits for subjective experience and mood merely reflect the restoration to normal levels thereby compensating the detrimental effects of caffeine withdrawal in regular consumers (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</s><s>Together, diverse and partly inconsistent findings render a comprehensive view on the beneficial effects of caffeine difficult.</s><s>Particularly, the use of specific tasks and target groups, e.g.</s><s>high vs. non-caffeine consumers, places limits on generalization.</s></p><p><s>The carbohydrate glucose can be found in many of our comestibles, especially sweet ones.</s><s>Glucose is the major source of energy for the human brain; it is essential for the normal functioning of the central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The brain relies on a constant blood glucose level, since its energy storage is very small.</s><s>Although all brain functions are primarily dependent on the availability of glucose, it has been found that especially effortful, controlled, and executive processes are in need of a sufficient supply with glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>When measuring cognitive performance, glucose has been shown to improve attention, speed of processing, and working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, for example in solving maze problems, or verbal fluency <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, the most consistent effects of glucose on cognitive functioning have been found for the facilitation of declarative memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> leading to the hypothesis that the hippocampus plays an important role in the pathway through which glucose acts on cognitive functions in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Also affective mood changes correlated with blood glucose levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Especially perceived mental energy is reduced as blood glucose levels decrease <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and elevated when the glucose metabolism in the brain is higher as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, after performing a Stroop task for 30 min, a faster decrease of glucose levels in the blood led to increased ratings of sadness <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The existing bulk of studies suggests only a brief time window for beneficial effects of glucose to occur.</s><s>This is surprising, as, in healthy individuals, plasma glucose concentrations peak within 60 min after glucose ingestion and return to baseline levels only within 2-3 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it remains difficult to infer about glucose effects in multi-task settings that require sustained performance.</s></p><p><s>During education and early career, young adults face situations that require various cognitive functions, like examination and assessment centers.</s><s>Coffee and sweetened energy drinks are convenient and popular means to supposedly enhance performance in these situations.</s><s>The potency of caffeine and glucose to exhibit effects on performance and mood in young adults was investigated with the present series of three studies.</s></p><p><s>In the first study, we examined the effects of caffeine and glucose in a multi-task setting on a range of cognitive tasks and mood in healthy young individuals.</s><s>Caffeine and glucose were administered in common beverages with appropriate placebo controls to control for the psychological effects of expectancy, which have been neglected surprisingly often <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>We hypothesized that (i) caffeine improves attentional performance and mood, while performance in more complex tasks will not be improved, and that (ii) glucose enhances performance on memory tasks, potentially accompanied with negative mood.</s></p><p><s>Whether the findings of the present study can be explained by a placebo effect (i.e., a psychological effect) or the lack of dietary restraints for the active ingredients, was addressed in studies 2 and 3, respectively.</s><s>In study 2, we asked whether a placebo treatment compared to plain water is sufficient to enhance mood and/or performance due to psychological expectation-based effects as about the enhancing or activating properties of coffee and energy drink.</s><s>In study 3, we asked whether (i) caffeine effects occur after a 24-hour caffeine withdrawal and (ii) we compared placebo to no treatment to rule out effects of hydration.</s></p></div>

the FAIR was the last test of the battery and cognitive capacities may have been depleted by then.</s><s>It is also feasible that the rather arousing and demanding test situation, caused by the series of challenging tasks to be performed under time pressure, precluded potential beneficial effects of caffeine.</s><s>It has been shown, in fact, that caffeine improves attention particularly in low arousal situations and in rather simple tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Also, the intended mingling of habitual coffee drinkers and non-consumer in our study likely hampered the revelation of potentially diverging effects in regular and non-coffee drinkers.</s><s>Albeit, the literature provides conflicting evidence about which consumers benefit most: reports of enhancing effects of caffeine in heavy coffee drinkers but not non-drinkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> coexist with reports of stronger beneficial effects in non-consumers than regular consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>GLUCOSE was expected to enhance memory performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> compared to PLACEBO, yet performance in the numeric memory and verbal memory tasks was unaffected in the present study.</s><s>As plasma glucose concentrations peak 20-30 min after ingestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref> and return to baseline levels within 2-3 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, it is plausible to assume that blood glucose levels were indeed elevated during the entire testing session.</s><s>While we cannot exclude facilitated depletion of blood glucose due to the cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, full depletion (i.e. a drop below the initial fasting level) is unlikely as it is associated with detrimental memory effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> which were not observed in the present study.</s><s>Admittedly, we can only make assumptions about the blood glucose levels in the absence of a blood test, which should be employed in future studies.</s><s>It seems also reasonable that the potential of glucose to enhance performance in young adults was limited, as age has been shown to be an influential factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and older people benefit particularly from glucose treatments as their glucose regulation is frequently impaired <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>.</s><s>At the mood level, participants preserved subjective feelings of energy and activity after CAFFEINE compared to PLACEBO treatment.</s><s>Moreover, CAFFEINE, in contrast to PLACEBO, caused participants to judge their own performance higher.</s><s>Such findings are in accord with caffeine-induced physiological arousal (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>) and its potential misattribution to good performance and perceived energy <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>.</s><s>Although caffeine consumption failed to improve cognitive performance, it made participants feel more energetic and even smarter.</s><s>Thus, a cup of coffee may help to find the energy to get started with or to complete a task, albeit the outcome may be just the same as without coffee.</s><s>Together, the findings corroborate the notion that caffeine does not enhance cognition per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> but it rather enhances vigilance and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For GLUCOSE, compared to PLACEBO, no significant effects on subjective mood or performance were observed.</s><s>Yet, participants tended to feel sadder and more depressed after GLUCOSE compared to PLACEBO consumption.</s><s>This observation is indicative of reduced levels of blood glucose after 2 h of cognitive performance (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Together, CAFFEINE and GLUCOSE exhibited no significant effects on cognitive performance compared to PLACEBO.</s><s>While reports of beneficial effects of glucose are mostly in older adults, the enhancing effects of caffeine have been repeatedly reported also in young adults.</s><s>Whether the findings of the present study can be explained by a placebo effect (i.e., a psychological effect) or the lack of dietary restraints for the active ingredients was addressed in studies 2 and 3, respectively.</s></p></div>
