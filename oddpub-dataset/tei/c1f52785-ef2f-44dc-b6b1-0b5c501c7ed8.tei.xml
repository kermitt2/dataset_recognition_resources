<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequential Decision-Making Task</head><p><s>A two-step choice task was implemented as in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Deserno et al., 2015a,b)</ref>.</s><s>The task consisted of 201 trials; each trial involved two choice stages.</s><s>At each stage, subjects were required to give a forced choice (maximum decision time 2 s) between two stimuli presented; stimuli were two gray boxes at the first stage and two pairs of differently colored boxes at the second stage (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The position on the screen where stimuli were presented (left vs. right) was randomized over trials.</s><s>After a choice the respective stimulus was framed in red and moved to the top of the screen, where it remained for 1.5 s.</s><s>Rewards were delivered only after the second-stage choice.</s><s>The reward probabilities of second-stage stimuli were identical to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Daw et al. (2011)</ref>.</s><s>First and second stage choices were connected via a fixed transition probability: each first-stage choice was associated with one pair of the second-stage stimuli via a fixed probability of 70% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Each trial was ended by an exponentially distributed inter-trial interval (ITI) with a mean of 2 s.</s></p><p><s>During an instruction session prior to the experiment, participants were explicitly informed that the transition structure would not change throughout the task.</s><s>Participants were also told about the independence of reward probabilities and their dynamic change over the course of the experiment.</s><s>Participants were instructed to win as much money as possible and informed that the balance of their account would be paid out in addition to the reimbursement for study participation.</s><s>After detailed instruction including teach-back, participants trained on a shortened version of the task (50 trials) with different reward probabilities and stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Note that inference on model-based vs. model-free control strategies in this task is made based on the choices observed at the first stage of the task.</s><s>The rationale is that a learner can be influenced by two sources of information to come to a decision at the first stage.</s><s>Firstly, decisions at the first stage can be influenced by rewards obtained after the second stage.</s><s>Relying on these previously experienced rewards, in the sense of repeating choices in the future which had led to a reward in the past, would correspond to a habitual or model-free strategy.</s><s>As a second source of information, the learner can take the previously acquired task structure into account.</s><s>In the case of this task, the task structure corresponds to the transition probabilities between the two stages.</s><s>Practically, this would mean repeating decisions at the first stage based on an if-else pattern: the first-stage choice should only be repeated if the second-stage choice was rewarded and occurred under the common (i.e., 70% probability) transition state.</s><s>In the case where the second-stage choice was rewarded but the coupling of the first and second stage stimulus pair was untypical and rare (i.e., 30% probability), the first stage choice ought-despite a (rather accidently) obtained reward for the choice sequence-not be repeated.</s><s>Combining learning from rewards with the knowledge of the transition matrix would correspond to a model-based strategy, which takes into account the environmental transition structure when making decisions.</s><s>Thus, analysis of first-stage choices as a function of reward and state (rare vs. common transition) allows for inferences about the contribution of model-based and model-free strategies to participants' decision behavior.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Addiction, Cognitive Capacities, and Instrumental Control</head><p><s>Studies suggest that interindividual variability in cognitive capacities relates to a model-based system <ref type="bibr">(Otto et al., 2013a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schad et al., 2014)</ref> which was indeed shown to moderate group differences in studies involving patients characterized by cognitive impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sebold et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>These and our findings suggest that, when observing differences in instrumental control between groups which differ systematically in cognitive factors, one ought to tread carefully when interpreting these; differences might be an epiphenomenon of a more general impairment rather than a specific characteristic for alcoholdependence.</s><s>This is also in line with a study using instructed devaluation tasks in alcohol-dependent patients, which revealed a global impairment in learning per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sjoerds et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we replicate the previously reported correlation between cognitive function and model-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schad et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sebold et al., 2014)</ref> and find evidence for interaction effects between cognitive function and impulsivity, a recognized risk factor for addiction, on model-based control.</s></p><p><s>Regarding the correlations between model-based control and general cognition, two aspects should be taken into account.</s><s>First, as proposed theoretically, model-based computations underlying goal-directed behavior are expensive, thus, they occupy cognitive resources.</s><s>In this vein, model-free computations underlying habitual behavior can be seen as the cognitively less demanding solution to the task.</s><s>Indeed, this may bias individuals with relatively higher or lower cognitive capacities per se to one or the other way to solve the task.</s><s>As mentioned before, there is good evidence for such correlations between model-based control in this task and cognitive measures such as cognitive speed and working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Otto et al., 2013a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Otto et al., , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Schad et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Explicitly manipulating cognitive load via a dual task challenge reduces the degree of model-based decision-making in this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Otto et al., 2013b)</ref>.</s><s>In healthy individuals, one can regard this as proof of construct validity that model-based control in this task is indeed a computationally more costly solution.</s><s>Secondly, all cross-sectional between-group findings with this task in clinical populations related to the degree of modelbased control and reduced cognitive capacities are a characteristic of these clinical populations, such as addiction and obsessivecompulsive disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sebold et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Voon et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, reduced model-based control in alcohol addiction compared to healthy controls was indeed related to the reduction in cognitive speed seen in these patients and group differences did no longer reach significance when adjusting for cognitive speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sebold et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, whether reduced model-based control in patients constitutes a disease-specific mechanism or results from general cognitive impairments can only be teased apart in future longitudinal studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impulsivity, Cognitive Capacities, and Instrumental Control</head><p><s>Interestingly, cognitive dysfunction itself (more specifically, reduced executive functioning), as well as the combination of deficits in cognitive function and impulsivity have been suggested as endophenotypes for drug dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ersche et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our finding of an interaction of cognitive functioning and impulsivity on model-based behavior in two independent samples amends previous studies reporting on an influence of impulsivity on reduced goal-directed control in a devaluation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hogarth et al., 2012a)</ref> or on accentuated model-free control together with intact model-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deserno et al., 2015a)</ref>.</s><s>Our findings in the original investigation and in an independent confirmation sample suggest that the interaction of cognitive capacities and impulsivity plays an important role.</s><s>Interestingly, in the sample at hand, for which impulsivity measures were not the selection criterion, a positive correlation of cognitive capacity and model-based behavioral control was found in the relatively lower impulsive group.</s><s>To interpret this finding, one might speculate that relatively, but not extremely low impulsiveness in addition to relatively high cognitive capacities provides an optimal ground for model-based control in this task.</s><s>In the confirmation sample, which was specifically recruited to consist of a low vs. a highly impulsive group from the extreme ends of the impulsivity measures, impulsivity scores at the higher end matched those of addicted patients.</s><s>Interestingly, in this sample the correlation of cognitive speed with model-based behavior was driven by the high-impulsive group, suggesting it as a potential compensatory factor in high-impulsive individuals, which were initially assumed to be impaired in goal-directed, model-based behavioral control <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deserno et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hogarth et al., 2012a)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>In sum, we did not find evidence for an influence of the risk factors positive family history or impulsivity on model-based control per se.</s><s>Due to the limited sample size, this finding has to be interpreted with caution and warrants further investigation in larger sample sizes.</s><s>Our findings could speak in favor of a multiple hits account with different risk conditions playing together to impair or protect model-based behavioral control.</s><s>Longitudinal designs might help to disentangle these rather complicated interaction effects on model-based control and eventually, on the potential development of addiction.</s></p></div>
