<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increasing inspiratory time and I:E ratio did not result in dynamic hyperinflation</head><p><s>To rule out relevant dynamic hyperinflation, HV T animals were ventilated with an alternating I:E ratio (1:2 versus 1:1) in 30-minute intervals for 120 minutes, and mean airway pressure and dynamic compliance (C dyn ) were measured.</s><s>Mean airway pressure remained stable during the specific interval of MV (see Figure <ref type="figure">S1A</ref> in Additional file 2).</s><s>The higher but stable mean airway pressure during HV T 1:1 is explained by the increased inspiratory time during HV T 1:1 (see Figure <ref type="figure">S1A</ref> in Additional file 2).</s><s>C dyn remained stable during MV, irrespective of the adjusted I:E ratio (see Figure <ref type="figure">S1B</ref> in Additional file 2).</s><s>Thus, HV T 1:1 ventilation did not lead to relevant dynamic hyperinflation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Increasing the inspiratory time and I:E ratio during MV increased mortality in VILI</head><p><s>All mice of the low tidal-volume groups ventilated with an I:E ratio of either 1:2 or 1:1 (LV T 1:2; LV T 1:1) and of the high tidal-volume group ventilated with an I:E ratio of 1:2 survived the procedures.</s><s>Increasing the I:E ratio in the HV T group to 1:1 resulted in premature termination of the experiment in 13 of 14 mice because of dropping of mean arterial blood pressure below 40 mm Hg (alternative end point), corresponding to a 92.1% mortality in the HV T 1:1 group (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

increasing lung stress and strain in relation to the cycle time by prolonging the inspiratory time (t i ) and increasing the I:E ratio aggravate VILI.</s><s>This is in line with the theory of weighted

detected a significant impact of the increased t i and I:E ratio on pulmonary cytokine levels, pulmonary neutrophil influx, systemic neutrophil counts, lung permeability, and histological signs of lung injury.</s><s>KC and MCP-1 are chemotactic signals for neutrophils, which contribute to the development of VILI <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr"

lung-protective ventilation with 6 ml/kg in humans with ARDS.</s><s>At first view, this might outrange the stress and strain applied during MV in ARDS patients.</s><s>However, residual capacity in ARDS lungs is severely reduced, which is referred to as the "baby lung" of ARDS patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, the sicker the patient and the lower the oxygenation capacity becomes, the greater is the reduction of the residual capacity and the intention to increase the relative portion of inspiratory time to improve oxygenation.</s><s>As intensivists do not routinely quantify residual capacity at the bedside, we do not know how much lung strain is generated during MV, despite limiting the tidal volume to 6 ml/kg, especially in very severe ARDS.</s><s>Further, ARDS is characterized by a high grade of tissue inhomogeneity, in which open, atelectatic, and collapsed but recruitable lung areas coexist, which locally results in lung stress exceeding the measured airway pressure by far <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Loss and inactivation of surfactant, a hallmark in ARDS, further aggravate local trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, applying high tidal volumes in healthy mouse lungs constitutes a reasonable experimental approach.</s><s>Further, the currently used model of VILI meets the ATS criteria on lung injury in animals, including the evidence of inflammation, microscopic tissue injury, alteration of alveolar barrier function, and impaired oxygenation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Vice versa, the observation that prolonging t i in the LV T groups did not increase detectable lung injury in healthy mice does not argue for the safety of an I:E ratio increase in lungprotective ventilation of ARDS patients.</s></p><p><s>In this study, it was highly important to control properly factors that might significantly bias the results.</s><s>(a) Dynamic hyperinflation would increase intrinsic PEEP, which consecutively enhances residual volume and shifts tidal volume upward on the pressure/volume curve, eventually above the upper inflection point, resulting in augmented absolute lung stress and strain.</s><s>Thus, we adjusted respiratory rates in both HV T groups to 70 per minute to exclude dynamic hyperinflation in the HV T I: E 1:1 group.</s><s>(b) To keep dynamics of lung inflation identical between 1:1 and 1:2 groups, we prolonged t i by adding an inspiratory hold.</s><s>This excluded that a difference in pressure acceleration during inspiration or a difference of the total inflation time biased the results of the study.</s><s>(c) Expiration was most probably similar in the HV T 1:1 and HV T 1:2, and in the LV T 1:1 and LV T 1:2 groups, respectively.</s><s>Expiration is a passive process starting after the opening of the expiratory valve with end-inspiratory pressure being the driving force, which was similar in the respective groups.</s><s>As dynamic hyperinflation could be excluded, exhalation was complete.</s><s>(d) Respiratory rate, PEEP and FiO 2 were identical in the HV T and the LV T groups, respectively and anesthesia and operation procedures were identical in all groups.</s></p><p><s>Intrathoracic pressure directly affects cardiac function (for an excellent review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>), and increased intrathoracic pressure due to increased I:E ratio may decrease cardiac output <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>Reduction of venous return seems to be the central mechanism reducing cardiac output by high intrathoracic pressure, which can be ameliorated by sufficient fluid support.</s><s>In our study, mice received liberal fluid support to minimize reduction of cardiac output.</s><s>Blood pressure and urine output were not affected by increased I:E ratio.</s><s>Nevertheless, lactate levels were slightly elevated in HV T 1:1 compared with HV T 1:2 mice.</s><s>Thus a certain reduction of cardiac output cannot be excluded.</s><s>However, circulatory failure and resultant shock as cause of the premature death of the HV T 1:1 animals would have resulted in significantly higher lactate levels, lower blood pressure, and particularly in reduction of urine output.</s><s>Thus the data provided here exclude profound hemodynamic deterioration as the underlying mechanism for the devastating outcome of the HV T 1:1 group.</s></p><p><s>Although the data are conclusive and the results are clear, one can only speculate whether the findings can be translated to patients with ARDS.</s><s>However, the study clearly emphasizes that for further improvement of lungprotective ventilation strategies, a deeper understanding of central factors for VILI is mandatory.</s><s>In this regard, experimental studies like the present one are essential.</s></p></div>
