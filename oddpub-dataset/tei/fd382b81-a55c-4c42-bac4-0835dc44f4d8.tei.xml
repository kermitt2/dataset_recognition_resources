<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Type 2 diabetes mellitus constitutes a growing threat to human health.</s><s>The International Diabetes Federation recent estimates indicate that 9 % of the global adult population (415 million people) have diabetes, with the number set to rise beyond 642 million within the next two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The diabetes epidemic is truly a global problem with substantial variations within regions.</s></p><p><s>In high-income countries, migrant populations are particularly affected by type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>They also develop type 2 diabetes at a younger age, and have higher associated morbidity and mortality and related complications, such as cardiovascular disease, than local European populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The limited data available indicate that sub-Saharan African (SSA) migrants are among those that are most affected by type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>In a recent metaanalysis, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was nearly three times higher in populations of SSA origin than in European host populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes differs between SSA origin populations living in different European countries.</s><s>In a previous study, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was higher among African Caribbeans living in England than in African Caribbeans living in the Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s>This suggest that distinct environmental factors, in addition to heritable susceptibility, contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes among these populations.</s></p><p><s>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is not only rising among migrants, but also in low-and middle-income countries such as those in SSA from where many of these populations originate <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>.</s><s>While type 2 diabetes seemed to be virtually absent, for example, in West Africa in the 1960s and 1980s, today it has become a major health threat particularly in urban centres <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>.</s><s>SSA is expected to experience the worldwide fastest increase in the number of people living with type 2 diabetes (141 %) in the next two decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The rising levels of type 2 diabetes in populations of SSA origin are a reflection of the rising levels of major risk factors such as obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The rising levels of obesity and associated type 2 diabetes among SSA origin populations is thought to be a result of transitioning of societies, and resulting changes in lifestyles, though the key specific drivers within this broad category still need to be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>.</s><s>Migration studies provide important windows of opportunity to assess differences between migrating and non-migrating populations, and to help identify the potential factors driving the rising levels of type 2 diabetes and obesity among these populations.</s><s>Such knowledge is a prerequisite for designing effective public health interventions for addressing the problem.</s><s>Ideally, this requires comparing a relatively homogeneous migrant population with the source population in their country of origin in Africa.</s><s>However, such data are lacking so far.</s><s>Consequently, in the last two decades, studies have used migration surrogates such as multinational comparison of African descent populations living in diverse geographic environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</s><s>The findings, however, are difficult to interpret because of the heterogeneous nature of the African populations studied so far, and the reliance on secondary analyses of data from different studies.</s></p><p><s>The main aim of this paper was, therefore, to compare the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes among Ghanaians living in rural and urban Ghana, as well as among Ghanaians living in three different European countries.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of the study population</head><p><s>Out of the 6385 Ghanaians who agreed and participated, 5659 were included in the analysis after exclusion of those who did not participate in the physical examination, those without blood samples collected and those outside the age range (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>The age structure was similar in all geographical sites, although men in Amsterdam and Berlin were slightly older than in other geographical sites.</s><s>Ghanaians in London were the most educated group while individuals from rural Ghana were the least educated group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>There were substantial differences in mean BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, total cholesterol and blood pressure among sites, with individuals in urban Ghana and Europe having higher mean levels than their counterparts in rural Ghana.</s><s>Smoking prevalence was higher in Berlin and Amsterdam than in other sites.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence of obesity</head><p><s>The age-standardised prevalence of generalised obesity varied between the five population groups, ranging from 1 % in rural Ghana to 21 % in London in men, and from 8 % in rural Ghana to 54 % in London in women (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a, b</ref>).</s><s>Similar large differences were also observed for abdominal obesity with the age-standardised prevalence rates in men, ranging from 2 % in rural Ghana to 18 % in Amsterdam, and in women from 31 % in rural Ghana to 76 % in London (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a, b</ref>).</s><s>The differences between individuals  <ref type="figure">S2</ref>) and abdominal obesity (Additional file 3: Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> illustrates adjusted PRs for obesity using rural Ghanaians as the reference category.</s><s>For men, the PR of obesity was five times higher in urban Ghanaians than in their rural counterparts.</s><s>Among Ghanaian men living in Europe, the obesity PR increased 11-to 15-fold across all cities.</s><s>For women, the PR of obesity was four times higher in urban Ghanaians than in rural dwellers.</s><s>As for European cities, obesity PR in Ghanaian women was increased up to 6.6-fold in London.</s><s>Similarly, the adjusted PRs of abdominal obesity were higher in all sites than in rural Ghana, although the difference between men in rural and urban Ghana was statistically non-significant (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>When overweight and obesity were combined, 8 % of men in rural Ghana were considered overweight or obese, whereas this figure was nearly 40 % in urban Ghana, 64 % in Berlin, 68 % in Amsterdam, and 75 % in London (Additional file 4: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>).</s><s>In women, this proportion was high even in rural Ghana (34 %), and 69 % in urban Ghana and 80-90 % in European cities (Additional file 4: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prevalence of type 2 diabetes and IFG</head><p><s>The age-standardised prevalence of type 2 diabetes in men and women was 4 % and 6 %, respectively, in rural Ghana (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a, b</ref>).</s><s>This proportion was higher in urban Ghana (men, 10 %; women, 9 %) and in Europe, reaching its maximum in Berlin (men, 15 %; women, 10 %).</s><s>The group-related differences increased with advancing age (Additional file 5: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S5</ref>).</s><s>Newly detected type 2 diabetes was more common in urban Ghana than in other sites (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we observed a large proportion of the participants with IFG in all sites including rural Ghana (men, 13 %; women, 11 %; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5a, b</ref>).</s><s>The prevalence of IFG was particularly high in Amsterdam (men, 32 %; women, 24 %) and significantly higher than elsewhere.</s><s>When rural Ghana was used as the reference category, the PRs of type 2 diabetes in men were nearly 3-fold higher in urban Ghana and increased to nearly 4.5-fold higher in Berlin.</s><s>In women, the PRs were 1.6-fold higher in London to 2-fold higher in the other sites (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The probability of type 2 diabetes increased with high levels of BMI (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a, b</ref>) and waist circumference (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a,  b</ref>).</s><s>However, with a given level of BMI and waist circumference, the probability of type 2 diabetes was greater among urban and migrant Ghanaians than their rural Ghanaian peers in both men and women, although the magnitude of the differences were greater in men than in women.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key findings</head><p><s>Our findings from a large, multi-centre and multicountry study show higher rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes in urban Ghanaians and Ghanaian migrants in Europe than in rural Ghana.</s><s>For obesity, there was a clear rising gradient in prevalence from rural through urban Ghana to migrants in Europe.</s><s>No such gradient was observed for type 2 diabetes and IFG across the sites.</s><s>Notably, the difference in type 2 diabetes prevalence between urban Ghana and Ghanaians in Europe was rather small.</s><s>The prevalence of IFG was generally high and similar across sites except for the even higher prevalence in Amsterdam.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>The main strength of the RODAM study is the use of well-standardised approaches across the various study sites.</s><s>Another unique strength of this study is the Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Prevalence ratios of obesity (BMI 30 kg/m 2 ) and abdominal obesity by locality and sex (models are adjusted for age and education) homogenous study population of Ghanaians living in different settings in Africa and Europe.</s><s>So far, only a few studies have attempted to assess the potential role of migration on obesity and type 2 diabetes among African populations by comparing native Africans with people of African ancestry living in the Caribbean, UK and USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</s><s>However, these studies were limited due to the heterogeneous ancestry of populations who were transported out of Africa several centuries ago.</s><s>This factor, as well as genetic admixture primarily with European ancestry population groups, make it difficult to assess the potential role of migration and its impact on health in African populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, these studies were based on secondary data with different measurement protocols.</s><s>The RODAM study overcomes these previous limitations by focusing on one population using the same measurement procedures in all sites.</s></p><p><s>Our study also has limitations.</s><s>First, as in most epidemiological studies, type 2 diabetes was defined by a single blood glucose measurement, which traditionally would have to be confirmed.</s><s>Second, although the same methods were applied in all sites, the recruitment strategies had to be adapted to suit the local circumstances due to differences in registration systems.</s><s>Ghanaian participants in Amsterdam, for example, were drawn from the Amsterdam Municipal Population register, whereas London participants were drawn mainly from Ghanaian organisations lists.</s><s>It is possible that individuals who were not on the lists of these organisations differ in terms of sociodemographics, which might somewhat affect the representativeness of Ghanaian migrants in London and Berlin.</s><s>In a non-response analysis, men more often were non-respondents than women in all sites except for Berlin.</s><s>Non-respondents were younger than respondents in all sites.</s><s>Further, the non-response analysis in Berlin revealed that the distribution of respondents and non-respondents across Berlin city districts was fairly similar.</s><s>Additionally, evidence suggests that most Ghanaians in Europe are affiliated with Ghanaian organisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>, suggesting that members within these organisations may be representative of the Ghanaian population living in various European countries.</s><s>Therefore, although a certain level of bias is likely, as in all population-based surveys, we consider it unlikely that the differences in prevalence rates between European sites are substantially biased by the variations in sampling strategy.</s><s>Finally, only fasting plasma glucose was used to diagnose diabetes, which  may underestimate the prevalence of diabetes.</s><s>Evidence suggests that the 2-h plasma glucose value after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test diagnoses more people with diabetes fasting plasma glucose.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion of the key findings</head><p><s>Our current findings show that obesity is extremely common among women at all study sites, including a notable prevalence in rural settings.</s><s>The prevalence rates in men were less than half of those among women.</s><s>Despite the higher burden among urban populations, overweight/obesity is rapidly increasing also in rural communities in low-and middle-income countries, especially among women, as our study clearly shows.</s><s>Therefore, the notion that overweight/obesity is affecting typically the urban populations can no longer be substantiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, over a third of women in rural Ghana were either overweight or obese.</s><s>This corroborates recent findings in rural South African youth <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Rapid urbanisation and improved contact between rural and urban settings due to infrastructure improvements may be facilitating the transfer and introduction of urban practices to rural settings with consequent changes in diet, resulting in consumption of energydense traditional or processed foods as seen in urban Ghana and some settings in SSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23]</ref>.</s><s>Of note, the present study shows that the obesity rate among women in urban Ghana is nearly as high as those reported among women in the USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>, and far higher than the prevalence rates reported among women in many European high-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>.</s><s>We show that Ghanaian migrants in Europe are particularly affected by obesity, the rate being up to 15 times higher than among their rural counterparts in Africa.</s><s>Among migrant Ghanaian women, the obesity rate greatly exceeds the figures of the host European populations in all three European countries.</s><s>In the 2013 Health Survey for England, the prevalence of obesity among English general population women was 24 % [25] compared with 54 % observed in the present study among Ghanaian migrant women in London.</s><s>Similarly, the prevalence of obesity among Dutch women is 13 % <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref> compared with 49 % in Ghanaian migrant women in Amsterdam, and 24 % in German women <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref> compared with 39 % among Ghanaian migrant women in Berlin.</s><s>Worryingly, type 2 diabetes occurred at a similar prevalence among individuals in urban Ghana and in Europe.</s><s>Previous studies among SSA populations found a rising gradient of type 2 diabetes from SSA through the Caribbean to the UK and USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</s><s>Mbanya et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>, for example, reported an age-standardised prevalence of diabetes of 1 % among urban Cameroonian men compared with 15 % in African Caribbeans in the UK.</s><s>This gradient was due to extremely low prevalence of type 2 diabetes in SSA, which has been documented from the earliest studies that were conducted more than five decades ago.</s><s>For example, in a 1958 study, Dodu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref> observed a diabetes prevalence of 0.4 % in an urban population in Accra, Ghana.</s><s>Likewise, a community-based study in the Volta region of Ghana in 1964 found a diabetes prevalence of 0.2 % <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the results of the present study suggest that the gradient between urban Africans and diaspora African living in high-income European countries is fading rapidly.</s><s>In fact, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among women was marginally higher in urban Ghana (9.2 %) than in London (8.4 %).</s><s>Thus, the increasing risk of type 2 diabetes is no longer an issue of only migrant populations, but appears to have reached urban communities in SSA.</s><s>This implies increased risks for rural African communities, especially given the rapid changing lifestyles in these settings.</s><s>The rise of obesity and type 2 diabetes among SSA populations can be partly attributed to modernisation with consequent adoption of unhealthy aspects of globalised lifestyles such as physical inactivity and poor dietary behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The key specific drivers within these broad categories, however, still need to be identified.</s><s>Interestingly, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was higher in men than in women despite the higher levels of obesity in women in all sites except rural Ghana.</s><s>The explanations for these differences are unclear, but may be partly due to a more favourable body fat distribution in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Alternatively, is possible that body weight has a larger impact on type 2 diabetes risk among men than among women, as is suggested by the current study.</s></p><p><s>Another important finding from this study is the high prevalence of IFG in all sites.</s><s>The IFG rates in both rural (12 %) and urban (13 %) Ghana are far higher than those in most urban populations in Africa <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32]</ref>.</s><s>In a community-based study conducted more than a decade ago in urban Accra, the IFG prevalence was 6.2 % <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>, indicating a nearly 110 % percentage increase in IFG in urban Ghana in a decade.</s><s>In the present study, IFG was exceptionally common in Amsterdam Ghanaian migrants, which is consistent with our earlier findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">35]</ref>.</s><s>In a previous study, the prevalence of IFG was 35 % and 14 % among African Caribbeans in the Netherlands and in England, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref>.</s><s>The high rate of IFG is worrying given the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and related complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The reasons for the abundance of IFG among Ghanaians in the Netherlands is unclear but might be due to contextual factors such as differences in treatment of diabetes and/or unknown aetiological factors; this requires further study.</s><s>Despite varying prevalence rates among the host populations in the three European countries, the respective differences among migrants residing in these countries were rather small.</s><s>Still, although higher, the type 2 diabetes prevalence among the migrant populations mimics their respective host European populations.</s><s>Recent International Diabetes Federation age-standardised estimates indicate a prevalence of type 2 diabetes of 4.7 % in the UK, 5.5 % in the Netherlands, and 7.4 % in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Despite the lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>, obesity is more common in the UK than in most European countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, a similar pattern was observed among our study populations with Ghanaians in London having a lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes but a higher prevalence of obesity compared with Amsterdam and Berlin.</s><s>This observation seems to suggest that the national contextual factors, such as prevailing health behaviour, health-related policies and access to preventive services, may influence metabolic risk factors in different ways in various countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">37]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our findings have important public health implications for health planners in Europe and Africa.</s><s>The prevalence rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes among African migrants exceed those of the European host populations.</s><s>Ghana is a lower middle-income country with a substantial burden of communicable diseases.</s><s>The high levels of overweight and type 2 diabetes will undoubtedly put more pressure on the already overburdened health system suggesting an urgent need for action with strong support by government and civil societies in Ghana.</s><s>This requires a health policy shift towards prevention and control of obesity and diabetes and other non-communicable diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Our study findings show that obesity, IFG and type 2 diabetes are common in both SSA migrants and their population of origin.</s><s>The findings show a gradient of rising prevalence from rural through urban Africa to Europe for obesity, but not for the type 2 diabetes gradient between urban African and Europe, which has reached almost European levels in urban Ghana.</s><s>This seems to suggest that the increased risk of type 2 diabetes is no longer limited to migrant populations, and that processes similar to those underlying the high burden in migrants may also be at play in SSA, particularly in urban centres.</s><s>This, in turn, points to an urgent need to unravel the potential factors contributing to the high prevalence of these conditions in both SSA migrants and non-migrants to inform targeted intervention and prevention programmes.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Age-standardised prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) by locality in men (a) and women (b).</s><s>Error bars are 95 % confidence intervals</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,63.84,94.85,467.66,137.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>
