Clark measures the PA and NA with two 10-item mood scales.</s><s>PA is composed by following descriptors: enthusiastic, interested, determined, excited, inspired, alert, active, strong, proud and attentive; NA by scared, afraid, upset, distressed, jittery, nervous, ashamed, guilty, irritable and hostile <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>A 5-point Likert scale ("Not at all" = 1, "Very much" = 5) indicated the extent of the emotion.</s><s>Thus, the range was 10-50 for each affect.</s></p><p><s>All patients above 18 years of age with a primary adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum were screened for potential inclusion in the study.</s><s>For inclusion, the planned procedure had to be open surgery to improve comparability.</s><s>Excluded were all patients with an ASA-Score &gt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The level of negative affect, measured by the PANAS questionnaire, had an influence on QoL.</s><s>The higher the preoperative NA was, the lower was QoL on the 30th postoperative day.</s><s>This is in line with examinations on patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</s><s>Patients experienced a lower QoL one and 6 month after surgery when preoperative NA levels were higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There were also changes in QoL after colorectal surgery, but neither Guided Imagery nor Progressive Relaxation had an advantage on short-term changes of QoL measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the GIQLI questionnaires.</s></p><p><s>The lowest QoL was on the third postoperative day and recovered to almost the same level as preoperative on the 30th day after operation.</s><s>The only difference between the groups measured by the GIQLI score was on the third postoperative day between the Imagery and the Control group.</s><s>The score was significantly lower in the Guided Imagery group.</s><s>It is not clear why the differences were in favor of the Control group.</s><s>An explanation could be that the interventions lead to a more intense confrontation with the disease, which might affect QoL.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, although we could not detect other statistical differences between the three groups, most of the patients in the interventions groups would not only recommend the psychological exercises but also see an advantage.</s><s>The reason why patients in the Imagery group had a lower GIQLI score than in the Control group remains unclear.</s></p><p><s>The formation of an ostomy during surgery was very important for postoperative QoL.</s><s>Though there was no difference between patients with or without ostomy on the third postoperative day, on the 30th postoperative day patients with an ostomy had a considerably lower QoL.</s></p><p><s>There have been attempts to influence QoL by psychological interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Our interventions received a positive feedback, but still we could not quantify a difference in QoL between the groups.</s><s>Good had similar findings in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The applied relaxation techniques after abdominal surgery had no significant effects on the level of pain that could be measured, but still most of the patients (89%) considered them helpful.</s></p><p><s>One questionnaire we used was the EORTC QLQ-C30, a validated questionnaire which is used to assess healthrelated QoL for over 20 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>But still, there have been concerns that not all aspects of QoL are properly displayed by the EORTC questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Different questionnaires might have different emphases on different aspects of QoL.</s><s>The EORTC questionnaire for example is focused on physical and less on psychological issues of QoL.</s><s>To minimize the risk of missing an effect Cheung and colleagues suggested using more than one questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>But even then, no difference could be seen using the GIQLI questionnaire additionally.</s></p><p><s>We did not examine long-term effects.</s><s>Interventions might take effect later than 30 days.</s><s>Penedo examined 92 patients with prostate cancer who received either 10 weeks of group treatment (once a week for 2 h) or a single half-day lasting training of strategies for coping with stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>QoL was assessed using the FACT-G questionnaire.</s><s>Only the men in the 10-week treatment group experienced an improvement of QoL.</s></p><p><s>Most important for QoL though was not the intervention or the affect, but the existence of an ostomy postoperatively.</s><s>On the third postoperative day there was no difference in QoL between the ostomy and nonostomy group.</s><s>Apparently, patients have not realized until then the impact of the ostomy on their life, but 4 weeks after the operation they have.</s><s>It was seen before and it is not unexpected that an ostomy influences QoL <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We conclude from literature that there is evidence that QoL can be influenced by psychological interventions, which we could not prove in our setting.</s><s>Screening for susceptible patients' might be helpful <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>But there are still miscellaneous variables, which have to be considered like using the appropriate questionnaires, applying the interventions long enough and measuring QoL at the right time after intervention.</s><s>Data from literature is inconclusive and offer not enough guidance.</s><s>Most important for QoL though is not the intervention but the existence of an ostomy.</s><s>QoL is distinctively lower in patients with an ostomy.</s></p><p><s>Measuring preoperative NA might help to detect patients that are more likely to have a worse QoL postoperatively.</s><s>Maybe through special care, outcome can be improved in those individuals.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
