<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4th experiment</head><p><s>The fourth experiment was carried out applying the periodical ozonation process in order to study the effect of this treatment on the extension of the preservation time of table grapes.</s><s>During this experiment, five 2-clusters of table grapes were used and several parameters, such as decay frequency (DF, %), weight loss (%), pH, moisture content (MC, %), sugars and proteins content were measured.</s><s>The respective results are presented on the following Figure <ref type="figure">3S (a and b</ref>) and in Table <ref type="table">3S</ref> of Supporting Information.</s></p><p><s>The contaminated clusters treated with ozone periodically, lost higher weight comparing the untreated contaminated clusters.</s><s>This was cleared after the first 15 days of the treatment.</s><s>The control cluster lost a little less weight after 40 days storage, than the other clusters.</s><s>The weight loss for the contaminated clusters treated with ozone approached 15-20%, two-fold higher than the case of the untreated contaminated clusters.</s></p><p><s>No remarkable differences for the incidence of the gray mould were observed between the contaminated clusters treated or no with periodical ozone dosage.</s><s>Decay on control cluster was retained at low levels.</s><s>The decay caused by B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison</head><p><s>The current work constitutes a complete study of different ozonation ways of table grapes in order to extend their shelf-time under cold storage.</s><s>The most referred ozonation way, cited in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Palou et al. 2002)</ref> includes the continuous exposure of table grapes and other fruits in an ozone atmosphere.</s><s>According to the current study, novel ozonation processes are introduced.</s><s>These treatments include the application of a specific low or high ozone dosage for 1 hour every day, for 1 hour at the starting of the storage time and for 1 hour every 3 days.</s><s>The realization of these processes was carried out in order to find the optimum ozone dosage either of technical or economical point of view for improvement the storage conditions of table grapes.</s><s>According to the obtained results it is obvious that the exposure of table grapes to ozone atmosphere resulted to significant weight losses, higher than the respective obtained by the control or untreated clusters.</s><s>This ozone effect to the physiological response of table grapes was more intent at the application of high ozonation and periodical ozonation processes (up to 20%).</s><s>The incidence of the gray mould caused by B. Cinerea, was restricted after the application of the low and high ozonation processes.</s><s>The initial and periodical ozonation was proved to be insufficient for prevention the decay development, as long as the decay frequency reached 100% in almost of the cases.</s><s>It seems that the daily ozone treatment is necessary in order to secure the preservation of table grapes.</s><s>In addition, the measurements about the quality parameters of table grapes during their storage time (data shown only for the start and the end point) indicated that the ozonation did not significantly alter their levels in table grapes.</s><s>The last conclusion is coming to consolidate the FDA approval for the use of ozone in food industry and make clear that the ozone is a powerful disinfectant agent with multiple uses.</s><s>As a result, the suggested process for table grapes conservation, taking into account the achieved results and the financial cost for ozone generation, is the low ozonation process.</s><s>In addition the applied ozone dosage according to the developed process is close to the 0.3 ppm, which is the Threshold Limit Value (TLV) established by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (US-OSHA).</s><s>Thus the cost for aeration of the warehouse used for table grapes preservation is significantly reduced.</s><s>Consequently, the low ozonation process combined with cold storage is the optimum treatment from technical and economical point of view for conservation of 'Sultanina' table grapes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Ozone has many uses and applications in human civilization.</s><s>One of the most interesting application of ozone is located at the storage, treatment and processing of foods after the recent approval by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration.</s><s>In the current study, alternative ozonation processes for table grapes preservation were developed and evaluated, in order to choose the optimum from technicoeconomical point of view.</s><s>The ozone treatment of table grapes on a daily basis with ozone dosage c 9 t = 900 ppm min, combined with cold storage (2-3 °C, 85-90% MC) proved to be the most efficient preservation process.</s><s>The results indicated that ozone inhibited the decay development caused by B. Cinerea on the fruit.</s><s>The observed weight loss remained at low levels and no sugars or proteins alteration was observed.</s><s>Consequently, the suggested process can be tested on different kinds of fruits contaminated with various types of moulds.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Results about low ozonation process combined with cold storage for the preservation of 'Sultanina' table grapes: a weight loss (%), b decay frequency, DF (%)</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,54.41,59.24,231.36,361.32" type="bitmap" /></figure>
