elsewhere in the central US and warming over Mid-Atlantic States do not pass the significance test but have similar sign as NCD and CRU values.</s><s>20CRv2 trends have a prominent 'Γ-shaped' region of very strong warming near the west coast and across the northern Plains.</s><s>The portion of the 'Γ-shape' north of 42 N arguably agrees better with NCD trends than the other datasets, though the warming rate exceeds NCD.</s><s>While 20 CRv2 trends somewhat match in sign over those regions, significant cooling over New Mexico clashes with the other results, notably, the ensemble spread and spread trend are larger there.</s><s>Elsewhere, 20 CRv2 trends have weak cooling in the Ohio River Valley, consistent with the other datasets.</s></p><p><s>During the shorter time period both reanalyses have stronger warming over western mountains, Great Basin, and west coast.</s><s>Neither has the cooling along the west coast found in CRU trends but not in NCD trends.</s><s>ERA-20C matches the amplitude of NCD and CRU trends data better in the west.</s><s>Both reanalyses have stronger warming in the Great Lakes and northeastern US.</s><s>The warming hole in the central US is better handled in area and amplitude by 20CRv2.</s><s>ERA-20C has too strong cooling and places the peak cooling too far west, though these values are not significant and the ensemble spread is
