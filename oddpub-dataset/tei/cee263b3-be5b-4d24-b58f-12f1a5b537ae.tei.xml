We show that, when compared to ancient lineage 1 and 5, MTBC strains belonging to modern lineage 4 show a higher rate of replication, associated to a significant production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î±) and induction of a functional autophagy process.</s><s>Interestingly, we found that the increased autophagic flux observed in macrophages infected with modern MTBC is due to an autocrine activity of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1Î², since autophagosome maturation is blocked by an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.</s><s>Unexpectedly, IL-1Î²-induced autophagy is not disadvantageous for the survival of modern Mtb strains, which reside within Rab5-positive phagosomal vesicles and avoid autophagosome engulfment.</s><s>Altogether, these results suggest that autophagy triggered by inflammatory cytokines is compatible with a high rate of intracellular bacilli replication and may therefore contribute to the increased pathogenicity of the modern MTBC lineages.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of MTBC strains</head><p><s>To investigate the impact of MTBC genetic diversity on intracellular growth, inflammatory response, and autophagy, six MTBC strains were randomly chosen from a collection of clinical strains based on their genotype determined by spoligotyping (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>We selected two Mtb strains of the ancient phylogeographic lineage 1, belonging to clades EAI1_SOM and EAI2_Manilla, and a strain of M. africanum, belonging to the ancient lineage 5, which includes strains causing TB in a restricted area of West Africa or in recent immigrants from those regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>Two strains belonging to the highly successful phylogeographic lineage 4, of clades H3 and T1, and one strain from lineage 3, clade CAS1-Kili, were selected as representative of the modern Mtb strains.</s><s>We also included the Mtb reference strain H37Rv, that, while belonging to the modern lineage 4, has been subjected to many in vitro passages that may have altered its virulence properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>These strains were chosen because they may fairly represent the genetic diversity of MTBC at the global level.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mtb strains belonging to the modern lineage show a higher rate of intracellular replication</head><p><s>To characterize the virulence properties of the selected MTBC strains, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were infected at MOI 1:1 and intracellular CFUs were determined at 4 h and 7 days post infection.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> (upper panel), no significant differences were observed in the intracellular CFUs at 4 h post infection, indicating a similar ability of ancient and modern strains to gain access to macrophages.</s><s>Analysis of the intracellular CFUs at day 7 post infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, lower panel) indicated a poor capacity of the two EAI strains to survive and replicate intracellularly and also the M. africanum strain showed limited ability to persist in macrophages.</s><s>Conversely, all Mtb strains of the modern clades were capable of replicating intracellularly, with a similar level of intracellular CFUs.</s><s>Macrophages infected with different Mtb strains showed similar viability, as indicated by evaluating LDH release (data not shown), indicating that cytotoxicity may not account for the observed differences of CFUs.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these results indicate that the MTBC strains of the modern clades show enhanced ability to replicate intracellularly compared to the strains belonging to the ancient clades.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mtb strains of modern lineages produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines</head><p><s>The levels of inflammatory cytokines upon infection of human primary macrophages with modern and ancient MTBC strains were evaluated by cytometry.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and S1, infection with the modern lineage strains induced a higher production of TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-1Î², and IL-10 compared to the ancient strains at 5 h (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>: p = 0.01, p = 0.0008, p = 0.001, and p = 0.04, respectively), 1 day (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>: p = 0.0008, p = 0.01, p = 0.02, and p = 0.0008, respectively) and 3 days post infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>: p = 0.02, p = 0.02, p = 0.0004, and p = 0.05, respectively).</s></p><p><s>These data indicate that a proinflammatory signature is induced by macrophage infection with modern Mtb strains.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mtb strains of the modern lineage 4 induce a functional autophagy flux</head><p><s>Autophagy flux was analyzed in human primary macrophages infected with the different Mtb strains described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> by comparing the levels of the autophagosome protein LC3-II in the presence or absence of lysosome inhibitors.</s><s>In macrophages infected for 24 h with the ancient Mtb strains, EAI1_SOM, EAI2_Manilla (lineage 1), and AFRI (lineage 5), the inhibition of lysosomal activity does not result in a significant accumulation of LC3-II compared to the untreated cells, indicating that the fusion of autophagosomes with the lysosomes is impaired (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>), similar to what was previously reported for the laboratory strain H37Rv <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>Conversely, in macrophages infected with the modern Mtb strains H3 and T1, the lysosome inhibitors significantly increased LC3-II levels compared to the untreated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>), indicating that newly formed autophagosomes are efficiently delivered to the lysosomes in these cells.</s><s>Similar results were obtained when autophagic flux was analyzed at 5 h after infection with ancient and modern Mtb strains (Figure <ref type="figure">S2a</ref>).</s><s>Autophagy induction following infection was prevented by using the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, indicating that modern Mtb strains trigger a canonical autophagic pathway (Figure <ref type="figure">S2b</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Activation of proinflammatory responses by Mtb infection depends on the binding of bacterial components to extracellular PRRs</head><p><s>Activation of IL-1Î² has been previously shown to promote Mtb killing through the activation of the TNF-Î± signaling, which culminates with caspase-3-induced apoptosis followed by the uptake and the lysosomal degradation of Mtb-containing apoptotic bodies by uninfected neighbors, a process defined as efferocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61</ref> .</s><s>In addition, IL-1Î² is also known to induce autophagy that in turn has been shown to restrict Mtb replication in macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>In line with these observations, the H3 and T1 strains, which trigger a higher level of IL-1Î² compared with ancient and reference strains, induce a functional autophagic process, as shown by analyzing the degradation rate of the autophagosomal marker LC3II.</s><s>Conversely, cells infected with ancient MTBC strains and H37Rv, secrete lower levels of IL-1Î² and show an inhibited autophagic flux.</s><s>Notably, we found that the increased production of IL-1Î² was indeed responsible for the induction of autophagy, since an inhibitor of IL-1Î² prevented autophagy flux in H3infected macrophages, reestablishing the block of autophagosome maturation observed with H37Rv and the ancient strains.</s><s>However, despite the higher autophagy induction and consistent with its increased ability to survive in macrophages, Mtb H3 strain is able to hide within endosomal compartments and to elude autophagosome engulfment and consequent lysosomal degradation.</s><s>Understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow modern Mtb strains to escape IL-1Î²-induced autophagy degradation will be relevant to design novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing their intracellular survival.</s><s>The fact that several drugs specifically targeting autophagy, inflammation, and immunometabolism have been shown to exert anti-TB activity highlights the potential Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> Role of IL-1Î² on the induction of autophagy triggered by Mtb H3.</s><s>Macrophages were infected with the Mtb H3 and H37Rv strains.</s><s>After 2 h, uninfected and infected cells were treated with an IL-1Î² receptor

relation with the increased virulence observed in strains of modern lineages.</s><s>In fact, IL-1Î² is required for protection against TB but a chronic high level of IL-1Î² is associated with pathology, likely causing a non-protective response <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">65</ref> .</s><s>At the same time, IL-1Î²-induced autophagy could turn out to be beneficial for chronic infection by sustaining macrophages metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66</ref> and protecting against excessive inflammation during Mtb infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67</ref> .</s><s>In this line, it has been recently proposed that Mtb may selectively regulate autophagy to extend survival in infected macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">68</ref> .</s><s>This hypothesis is also supported by our observation that infection with modern Mtb strains does not result in decreased macrophage viability, which would have been expected in cells infected with highly replicating Mtb strains.</s><s>Hence, the ability of modern Mtb strains to efficiently replicate intracellularly in macrophages, while inducing autophagy, may represent an advantage acquired during evolution to enhance bacilli persistence in inflammed host tissues.</s><s>Potential limitations of the present study should be considered.</s><s>We analyzed a relatively small number of clinical isolates.</s><s>However, although larger studies are needed to confirm these observations, the data generated here on the modulation of the autophagy process are confirmed by different approaches such as immunoblotting, confocal, and electron microscopy.</s></p><p><s>In view of these findings, it will be important to test how the different ability of modern Mtb strains to alter autophagy and inflammation impacts on the regulation of specific T-cell response.</s><s>This is expected to uncover new aspects on the complex mechanism that allows Mtb to escape the immune response and be protected from vaccinal approaches.</s><s>The results of this study may have translational implications for the design of new TB vaccines or host-directed therapies, which should take into account both the autophagic and immunogenic characteristics of the lineage of the Mtb candidate.</s></p></div>
