<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Operative Technique. The operative technique of CRIF</head><p><s>for PHF using the Humerusblock has been widely described in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The surgery is performed in beach-chair position and fluoroscopy is utilized for visualization of the reduction and fixation steps.</s><s>A delta split approach of 3 cm is performed about 4 to 5 cm below the fracture site at the lateral aspect of the humerus.</s><s>Then the Humerusblock is brought in and fixed to the shaft of the humerus by a 3.5 mm self-tapping, cannulated screw.</s><s>It is very important to hold the arm in neutral rotation during introductions of the Humerusblock.</s><s>Two k-wires are introduced to the humeral shaft through a guiding device (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>The two k-wires are brought in at an angle of 35 ∘ to the shaft and 25 ∘ to each other.</s><s>This allows the k-wires to cross over each other and diverge in the humeral head.</s><s>Before reduction the k-wires are drilled up to the subcapital fracture level.</s><s>Then the fracture is reduced manually by traction and/or percutaneously by using an elevator via small stab incisions.</s><s>In 3-part fractures the head fragment is derotated using a bone hook.</s><s>After anatomical reduction the head fragment is fixed by introducing the two k-wires up to the subchondral bone.</s><s>Finally the k-wires are locked within the Humerusblock.</s><s>Additionally, displaced tuberosities are reduced with small bone hooks, introduced via stab incisions.</s><s>After reduction the tuberosities are fixed with 3.0 mm cannulated screws (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3-5</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Postoperative Treatment.</head><p><s>Postoperatively the upper arm is immobilized in a standard shoulder sling for three to four weeks.</s><s>Beginning from the first postop day passive mobilization is recommended.</s><s>Active movement is started after the fourth postoperative week.</s><s>The removal of the Humerusblock is advised following bony healing after approximately six weeks.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In advanced age above 60 years, especially in women, bone density of the humeral head decreases significantly <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In PHF, the head fragment is usually very fragile with small amounts of subchondral bone, which often gives the impression of an "egg shell" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Treatment of fractures in patients with weak bone is challenging.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional and radiological outcome of surgical treatment of osteoporotic PHF in elderly patients, using a minimally invasive, semirigid device.</s></p><p><s>Surgical treatment strategies for severely displaced PHF comprise joint preserving methods, such as plate osteosynthesis, intramedullary nailing, k-wire based methods, and anatomical and reverse arthroplasty (RSA).</s></p><p><s>Hemiarthroplasty (HA) has long been the gold-standard in treating severely displaced PHF <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>However, outcome after HA is strongly dependent on tuberosity healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>High rates of tuberosity resorption and bad functional outcome after HA for primary fractures treatment are reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Due to its biomechanical features, functional outcome after RSA is more independent from tuberosity healing.</s><s>Therefore, RSA gained popularity in fracture treatment of severely displaced PHF in elderly patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In a recently published systemic review, the authors found significantly better results for RSA than for HA in the treatment of PHF.</s><s>However, complication rate was not significantly different <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In a recent matched-pair analysis comparing RSA and CRIF using the Humerusblock for the treatment of three-and four-part fractures significantly better results were found in the CRIF group <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Alternative strategies to treat PHF are ORIF using plates as well as intramedullary nailing.</s><s>Often, fixed-angled lockingplates are used, giving a sufficient primary stability in young patients for early mobilization of the shoulder.</s><s>In osteoporotic bone secondary perforation or cut-out of the screws is reported in up to 43% <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>This can lead to secondary loss of reduction and damage to the glenoid surface.</s><s>Another risk of rigid implants such as fixed-angled locking-plates is the lack of flexibility not allowing sufficient sintering of the fragments.</s><s>This potentially increases the secondary displacement rate and decreases the rate of bony union <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>In osteoporotic bone, flexible implants, which reduce the forces on the implant-bone interface, show advantages in biomechanical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A fundamental principle of the Humerusblock is dynamic stabilization.</s><s>So a guided sintering of the fragments along the k-wires to assure a continuous contact of the fracture fragments can be achieved.</s><s>Consequently humeral head perforation of the k-wires is not unusual.</s><s>In these cases, in order not to jeopardise the glenoid surface, shortening of the k-wires is necessary before starting active movements.</s><s>In our patients, retrieval of perforating k-wires was necessary in 21.8%.</s><s>Of course this leads to another operation and even though this can be done in a local anesthesia it still shows a disadvantage of the procedure.</s></p><p><s>In general a higher rate of AVN is described in literature after ORIF, mainly due to compromising soft tissue and the blood supply of the humeral head during surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>In closed reduction soft tissue bridges can be preserved.</s><s>Periosteal bridges between shaft and head fragment especially are not disturbed through this technique.</s><s>They often present the only left perfusion for the humeral head.</s><s>This is validated in our data where we found a humeral head necrosis rate of 6.2% compared to 10% in open reduction techniques of a collective with an average age of 62 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>75% of all AVN were found in the group of four-part fractures.</s><s>This suggests the consideration of primary arthroplasty in those special cases.</s></p><p><s>In the presented study all tuberosities healed.</s><s>This is a better prerequisite if conversion to secondary arthroplasty will be necessary after occurrence of AVN.</s><s>With anatomically healed tuberosities and an intact rotator cuff, anatomical shoulder replacement can be considered.</s></p><p><s>A revision rate of 10.9% in patients with the average age of 80 is compared to other implants in the lower range <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Taking a look at four-part fractures the reoperation rate increases to 35.7%.</s><s>A conversion to RSA due to secondary displacement was necessary in four patients.</s><s>In one case nonunion was treated with a blade-plate.</s><s>The clinical results of four-part fractures treated with the Humerusblock are far below those of two-and three-part fractures.</s></p><p><s>A disadvantage in all semirigid implants is the necessity of immobilizing the shoulder.</s><s>In younger patients an immobilization for about three weeks is adequate; in advanced age immobilization needs to be extended to four weeks.</s><s>However, passive mobilization is started immediately after surgery.</s></p><p><s>Some limiting factors of the present study have to be mentioned.</s><s>The main limitation is its retrospective design.</s><s>Furthermore, a follow-up rate of only 62% could be achieved.</s><s>However, all patients were of advanced age and most of them have comorbidities, which can explain the high dropout rate.</s><s>Another limitation is the missing comparison group to other implants like angle-stable plates or intramedullary nails.</s><s>A multicentre study is projected to compare different options of operative treatment of PHF in elderly patients.</s></p></div>
