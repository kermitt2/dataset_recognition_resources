<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>The Ethics Committee at Charité University Hospital Berlin approved this study.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent for this research study.</s></p><p><s>The study period included all live kidney donations from January 1, 2000, until December 31, 2010, at the Benjamin Franklin Campus (n = 30) and from January 1, 2004, until December 31, 2009, at the Mitte Campus (n = 131) of the Charité Hospital Berlin.</s><s>LDNs were performed at the Mitte Campus while ODNs were carried out at the Benjamin Franklin Campus.</s><s>Both transplant centers had different volumes of waiting list.</s><s>For that reason, we had a difference in the number of patients included in each group of the study.</s></p><p><s>All donors underwent an extensive medical workup to rule out malignancies and chronic diseases.</s><s>Renal vascular imaging was performed with multi-slice CT angiography and with MR angiography.</s><s>Routine assessment of donor split renal function was carried out using 99mTC-MAG3 renography.</s><s>In cases of a relevant difference between the left and the right donor kidney (i.e.</s><s>&gt;5% difference in GFR), we procured the kidney with inferior function, regardless of the renal vascular anatomy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Parameters</head><p><s>Several parameters were examined like creatinine level, blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), proteinuria and medication.</s><s>To estimate the economic impact and expenses of the procedures, the period of hospitalization and duration of sick leave were included.</s><s>Pregnancies and abortions after the LDN serve to guide attention specifically to the donor compliance of women and how LDN affects their willingness to have a pregnancy after the procedure.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, the occurrence or remainder of damages due to the surgery such as bleeding, blood transfusion, revision, organ loss, chylaszitis, wound healing dysfunctions, incisional hernia, wound relaxation, elevated transaminases, hematoma, chronic wound pain, paresthesia and CFS were evaluated.</s></p><p><s>Another important aspect in the comparison between the open and LDN is the patient's willingness to repeat the same procedure again, given the choice of both procedures.</s><s>To evaluate this, patients were asked if they, based on their recent experience, would choose the same surgical technique in the hypothetical scenario that the surgery was repeated.</s></p><p><s>Quality of life also plays an important role in the complete evaluation of a patient's health status.</s><s>The assessment tool used was developed in our hospital measuring tool of quality-of-life research and allows analysis of the health-related quality of life in a manner that is independent of current health status and age.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgical Technique</head><p><s>Laparoscopic Donor Nephrectomy LDN was performed as a pure laparoscopic, non-hand-assisted procedure using a 4-port transperitoneal access.</s><s>A pneumoperitoneum of 15 mm Hg was routinely used.</s><s>Arteries were secured with 12 mm Hemolock and titanium clips.</s><s>For right-side LDN, the renal vein was secured with an Endo-TA multi-fire stapler, while the left renal vein was typically secured and transected with a vascular Endo-GIA stapler.</s><s>Kidneys were extracted via a flank incision of approximately 6 cm in length before being flushed with ice-cold HTK solution.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>A few years ago, the consensus was that living kidney donation does not pose a long-term health risk to the donor and post-donation life expectancy was similar to that in the normal population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</s><s>However, more recently, large studies described an increased long-term risk of end-stage renal disease among donors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In their recent work, Grams et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> combined demographic and health characteristics to estimate the projected long-term risk of end-stage renal disease among living kidney donor candidates.</s><s>This new approach may help to improve donor selection in the future.</s></p><p><s>In large transplant centers, the laparoscopic approach has overtaken the ODN due to its superiority in optimizing postoperative pain, reducing hospital stay, earlier recovery and return to the donor's daily routine, as well as an improved cosmetic result <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> .</s><s>In addition, these advantages of LDN are not accompanied by inferior graft function <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15]</ref> .</s><s>Most donors would choose the minimally invasive method in the hypothetical scenario of a repeated donation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In the present study, total operating time was significantly shorter in the LDN group.</s><s>Nicholson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> reported an average operating time in the LDN group of 160 versus 150 min in the ODN group.</s><s>Øyen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> required an average of 180 min for LDNs versus 140 min for ODNs with an average WIZ of 270 and 90 s for the LDN and ODN group, respectively.</s><s>The shorter operating time in the LDN group is most likely a result of surgeon experience.</s><s>Previously, we were able to show that total operating time and warm ischemia time for the pure laparoscopic non-hand-assisted DN significantly decreased along with surgeon experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>All grade III Clavien complications included perioperative hemorrhage.</s></p><p><s>The rate of primary complications ( ≥ Clavien grade III) in our study is comparable with that from Mjøen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> .</s><s>Patel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> reported a rate of 4.2% for major complications.</s><s>In both studies, intraoperative organ injury and hemorrhage were reported as primary complications.</s><s>The authors defined the following risk factors for primary complications after donation: obesity, smoking and age &gt;50 years.</s><s>Lucas et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> compared outcomes after LDN and after hand-assisted LDN (HALDN).</s><s>The complication rate was 0.7% in the LDN group and 0.9% in the HALDN group.</s><s>Complications included a revision for postoperative hemorrhage (LDN) and a wound infection (HALDN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Two out of 30 patients in the ODN group required revision of an incisional hernia.</s><s>No incisional hernias occurred after LDN.</s><s>Dolce et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> reported the same number of hernias after both ODN and LDN.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, the duration of sick leave was not different between the 2 groups.</s><s>This is in line with previous results from Nicholson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> , who compared postoperative morbidity and time to return to work between ODN and LDN.</s></p><p><s>Proteinuria indicates nephron hyperfiltration and may be an early indicator of renal parenchymal damage.</s><s>A review by Garg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> describes independent risk factors, which may promote post-donation proteinuria, and showed that male donors were more prone to develop significant proteinuria than female donors.</s><s>Furthermore, they stated that the extent of proteinuria following live donation is dependent on duration of postoperative follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> .</s><s>In the present study, the incidence of proteinuria was significantly higher in the ODN group com- Mean arterial BP

difference between groups (p = 0.396).</s><s>The proportion of patients who developed post-donation hypertension requiring medical treatment was comparable between groups.</s><s>When looking at both cohorts 13% of donors showed increased BP measurements following DN.</s><s>Previous studies have investigated the long-term effects of DN on BP independent of the surgical technique used.</s><s>Segev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> and Berber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> reported in their follow-up that after 6 or alternatively 5 years post donation, 7% of donors had developed hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25]</ref> .</s><s>Berber et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> concluded that in contrast to the general population the incidence of hypertension was greater in donors &gt;55 years when follow-up was beyond 10 years.</s><s>Naganuma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> compared the cardiovascular risk of live donors with patients, who underwent nephrectomy due to other reasons.</s><s>They reported a hypertension rate of 23% of live donors and draw attention to the importance of diligent postoperative medical follow-up of the donor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> .</s><s>During their follow-up of 12 years, Ibrahim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> determined that 7% of live donors had newly diagnosed hypertension post donation.</s><s>Furthermore, they found that the risk of hypertension correlates with age and the BMI value <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</s><s>Hence, it seems that the risk factors for the development of hypertension after live kidney donation are similar to those present in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</s><s>In the literature, the proportion of live kidney donors who had to be treated with antihypertensives post donation is described as 21-24% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref> .</s><s>In the present study, the proportion of live kidney donors who had to be started on antihypertensives or who had to increase their medications post donation was at 24.6%.</s><s>Thus, our results do not differ from other published data in this regard.</s><s>The development of hypertension is often caused multifactorial.</s><s>Our results reiterate the need for proper post-donation medical care and for a healthy lifestyle in order to minimize long-term morbidity.</s></p><p><s>Only a few studies on post-donation pregnancy rates exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6]</ref> .</s><s>Reisaeter et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref> claimed a potentially higher risk for preeclampsia in pregnant women, who previously donated a kidney.</s><s>In our study, 72% of donors in the LDN group and 67% of donors in the ODN group were women.</s><s>Of these, 15 were in the child-bearing age range of 18-45 years at the time of donation.</s></p><p><s>In total, 2 women each bore a healthy child without complications during pregnancy with one having preg-nancy induced via in-vitro fertilization.</s><s>Additionally, 2 women reported an unfulfilled desire to have children, one of whom was planning pregnancy via in-vitro fertilization.</s><s>The remaining female donors had fulfilled their desire to have children.</s><s>Some of the female donors donated a kidney to their own child, which was affected by renal disease, so that the decision not to have another child very likely precipitated out of these circumstances.</s><s>These results show that postoperative child wish as well as pregnancy incidence among female kidney donors in the child-bearing age is rather low.</s><s>Despite these preliminary retrospective data, female donors willing to become pregnant should be informed about the increased risk of post-donation preeclampsia.</s></p><p><s>Questions surrounding fatigue as a long-term effect of live kidney donation was investigated by Kok et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> .</s><s>The researchers compared the open surgical technique (mini-incision DN) with the LDN and questioned their donors with the help of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20).</s><s>In particular, generalized and physical fatigue was significantly increased post donation compared to pre-donation.</s><s>No difference was observed when comparing the effect of the surgical technique (mini-incision versus LDN on fatigue incidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> .</s><s>de Groot et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> showed a significant impact of post-donation fatigue on the donor's quality of life.</s><s>For our study purposes, we extracted questions from the MFI-20 covering most of the important parameters such as physical or mental weariness, exhaustion and debility.</s><s>While 17% of donors in the ODN and 8% of donors in the LDN group declared being fatigued, no significant difference was found between the 2 groups.</s><s>Whether live organ donation promotes the development of fatigue syndrome could not be answered with the current data.</s><s>Larger prospective studies are necessary to determine a possible link between the 2.</s></p><p><s>We asked donors about their willingness to donate again in the hypothetical scenario of repeat donation.</s><s>Overall 96% of donors would undergo live donor nephrectomy again.</s><s>For the next question, donors had to choose which surgical technique (ODN vs. LDN) they would prefer in case of repeated surgery.</s><s>Hereby, 99% in the LDN group stated that they would choose the same laparoscopic approach, while only 67% of donors in the ODN group, knowing about the alternative minimally invasive option, said they would repeat the open surgical technique again.</s><s>This preference for the laparoscopic technique was highly significant and supports previous results by Giessing et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> .</s><s>In their study, 85% of donors who underwent LDN stated they would choose this Urol Int 2016;97:450-456 DOI: 10.1159/000447064 456 approach again <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> .</s><s>These data underscore the high acceptance of minimally invasive techniques for live DN.</s><s>This could increase the willingness to donate among potential live kidney donors.</s></p></div>
