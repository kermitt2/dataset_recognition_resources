(2) life expectancy of at least 3 months; (3) Karnofsky index &gt;50%; (4) adequate organ functions, defined as leukocyte count ≥3.5 cells × 10 9 /l, platelet count ≥100 × 10 9 /l, creatinine and total bilirubin 1.25 × the upper limit of the normal range or less; (5) no prior treatment with treosulfan; (6) no second malignancy (except basilioma or cervical cancer in situ); (7) no ascites/pleural effusion without evaluable or measurable tumor lesion or not elevated CA125;
