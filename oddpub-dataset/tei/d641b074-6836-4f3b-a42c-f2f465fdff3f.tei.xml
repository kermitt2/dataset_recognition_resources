<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>A fundamental theoretical debate about the nature of meaning and concepts dominates the cognitive and brain sciences.</s><s>Classic cognitive psychologists propose that semantic and conceptual processes are carried by a dedicated symbolic semantic system functionally detached from sensory and motor modules and specialized for handling information about meaning and concepts related to signs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ellis and Young, 1988</ref>).</s><s>An alternative approach, sometimes referred to by the terms 'embodiment' and 'semantic grounding' , states that meaning is intrinsically related to (or grounded in) action and perception information and processed in the brain by distributed action perception circuits that reach into motor and sensory brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barsalou, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barsalou, , 2008;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Pulvermüller, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Glenberg and Gallese, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Some recent attempts to amalgamate both positions into one integrative proposal either maintain that semantic processing is processed by an amodal system, whereas modality-preferential cortices, such as the sensorimotor areas, play an optional, merely "coloring" role <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mahon and Caramazza, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Caramazza et al., 2014)</ref>, or they postulate semantic integration in a 'semantic hub' (typically placed in temporal cortex) and allow for additional modality-specific semantic centers across the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Patterson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Binder and Desai, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kiefer and Pulvermüller, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, similar to the symbolic systems position, these proposals attribute true semantic processing and related deficits primarily to semantic hub areas.</s><s>To cite but one relevant statement here: "understanding the word "run" occurs in modality-independent neural systems" <ref type="bibr">(Bedny and Caramazza, 2011, p. 92;</ref><ref type="bibr">our own emphasis)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is not clear whether this type of 'integrative' position allows for the explanation of category-specific deficits arising from a focal lesion in one modality-preferential cortical system.</s></p><p><s>Much recent imaging work has accumulated evidence that the motor cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Damasio et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Martin et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hauk and Pulvermüller, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hauk et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Pulvermüller et al., 2006)</ref> and a range of sensory systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(González et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Kiefer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Barrós-Loscertales et al., 2012)</ref> become active when words and concepts from different semantic categories are being processed.</s><s>In particular, the motor system instantaneously activates in a somatotopic fashion when subjects hear or read words semantically related to different parts of the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Pulvermüller et al., 2005b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Shtyrov et al., 2014)</ref>, thus arguing against the view that the 'grounded' sensorimotor activations may only emerge at a late stage of post hoc interpretation and supporting their genuine role in semantic information access.</s><s>Category-specific semantic activation across the motor system has originally been reported for action-related verbs, but has recently been replicated for nouns semantically related to the mouth and hand (food and tool nouns; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Carota et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Although some researchers argue some of these effects are difficult to reproduce <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Postle et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Caramazza et al., 2014)</ref>, systematic comparison of studies across labs demonstrated good reproducibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carota et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kemmerer et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Semantically related activation in the motor system has even been reported for abstract words related to emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Moseley et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, although these brain activation studies are consistent with, and confirm predictions of, the groundedsemantic account postulating the relevance of modality preferential areas for semantics, neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies can never proove the functional relevance and necessity of brain areas for cognitive function.</s></p><p><s>To investigate this crucial issue, lesion studies in neurological patients and neurostimulation approaches are necessary.</s></p><p><s>Here, a range of results has so far been suggestive of a role of sensorimotor systems in semantic processing.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Pulvermüller et al. (2005a)</ref> applied single TMS pulses to primary hand and foot motor cortex while verbs semantically related to hand or foot actions had to be recognized in a Lexical Decision Task (LDT).</s><s>As the recognition latencies for handand leg-related action verbs was differentially affected by TMS stimulation site (an effect confirmed by a significant interaction of these factors), a causal role of the motor cortex on semantic word type processing was evident.</s><s>The latter conclusion was also supported by further TMS work in healthy subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Willems et al., 2011)</ref> and by behavioral experiments in which subjects engaged in motor activity while linguistic-semantic information had to be processed <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glenberg et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Witt et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Shebani and Pulvermüller, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, as most of the causal effects of motor activity on semantic processing were manifest in RTs but not accuracies (ACCs), it may still be that the functional role of motor systems for category-specific semantic processing is only relevant for optimizing word processing, but not necessary for it.</s></p><p><s>Stronger claims about the necessity of modality preferential, including sensorimotor, cortex for semantics can potentially be derived from lesions studies.</s><s>Important and well-known classic work reported lesion-related category-specific semantic impairments for words related to manipulable objects <ref type="bibr">(Warrington and</ref><ref type="bibr">McCarthy, 1983, 1987)</ref>, animals and foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Warrington and Shallice, 1984</ref>; for a recent review see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gainotti, 2010)</ref>, which were manifest in task ACCs.</s><s>On closer inspection, the observed patterns of impairments confirm that lesions of regions that include motor areas can lead to selective and pronounced deficits in the processing of action verbs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Damasio and Tranel, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bak et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neininger and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pulvermüller, 2001, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arevalo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kemmerer et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Similar results, supportive for theories of embodied cognition, were found after lesions of auditory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bonner and Grossman, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Trumpp et al., 2013)</ref>, and visual systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gainotti, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pulvermüller et al., 2010)</ref> for the processing of words with auditory or primarily visual semantics.</s><s>Whereas lesions in modality-preferential sensorimotor cortex brings about deficits in processing action-related words, the granularity of the category-specific deficit is under discussion (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arevalo et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Reilly et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>At present no evidence exists for a differential involvement of hand-or face-related action words, which can be found amongst verbs ('write' vs. 'chew') but also amongst the nouns (hand-related tool vs. mouth-related food words) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arevalo et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Unfortunately, several limitations apply to the majority of previous patient studies.</s><s>First, the patient populations under investigation typically suffered from large lesions typically caused by stroke or degenerative brain disease.</s><s>Most of these lesions included motor or sensory cortex but, in addition, other parts of the brain, as in strokes, or even were of diffuse nature, as in motor neuron disease and semantic dementia.</s><s>Therefore fine grained conclusions about the functional role of specific brain areas in word processing are difficult to derive and it is not entirely clear whether the sensorimotor lesion was indeed the primary cause of the patterns of deficits reported.</s><s>Second, from a psycholinguistic perspective, the choice of stimulus materials allowed different interpretations of the results.</s><s>For example, the popular comparison between action-related verbs and object-related nouns frequently led to evidence of a categorydeficit, but it is not always clear whether such a deficit is best explained by semantic factors (action-and object-relatedness) or in terms of the lexical (or grammatical) category difference instead (nouns vs. verbs).</s><s>In addition, relevant psycholinguistic variables such as word length and word frequency were not always matched in previous studies, thus opening further options for alternative explanation of presumed 'category differences'.</s><s>However, a small number of recent studies looking at rather focal lesions suggest that auditory and action-recognition systems may also be necessary for processing the semantically related words <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Neininger and Pulvermüller, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Campanella et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Trumpp et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although some evidence for a causal and possibly even necessary role of modality preferential cortex for categoryspecific semantic processing exists, no similar data are available for abstract words whose semantic information is somewhat detached from specific sensory and motor modalities.</s><s>A major claim held by most symbolic systems accounts, and equally the integrative proposals mentioned above, is that abstract semantic processing is removed from, and does not require, sensory and motor systems of the brain.</s><s>In contrast, proponents of grounded cognition have argued that, in order to learn the meaning of an abstract word, it is necessary to know at least some concrete semantic instantiations and contexts in which it can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barsalou and Wiemer-Hastings, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Borghi and Cimatti, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pulvermüller, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>At the neuromechanistic level, it has therefore been proposed that abstract meanings, similar to concrete ones, are organized as distributed neuronal circuits including neurons in multimodal and sensorimotor systems, although their links into modalitypreferential areas may be weaker than those of concrete conceptual representations.</s><s>This idea is supported by behavioral <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glenberg et al., 2008)</ref> and fMRI findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Moseley et al., 2012)</ref>, both indicating an involvement of motor processing in comprehension of abstract words.</s><s>A strong version of a semantic grounding position thus implies that modality preferential sensorimotor cortex also takes a crucial role in abstract word processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Glenberg et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Havas et al., 2010)</ref>, but to our knowledge this has so far not been shown with neither neurostimulation, nor lesion approaches.</s><s>If correct, this position predicts that lesions in modality preferential cortex, and in motor areas specifically, can lead to category-specific semantic deficits in processing abstract words.</s><s>Positive evidence for this statement would certainly falsify symbolical semantic accounts and most integrative proposals still leaning toward abstract-symbolism, too <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mahon and Caramazza, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Dove, 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>On the background of this pre-existing work, the current study addresses the putative necessary role of the modality preferential sensorimotor cortex in the processing of both, action-related and abstract words by examining two patients with focal brain lesions.</s><s>Although group studies were once claimed necessary for drawing strong conclusions on the brain basis of cognition and language, we would argue that single case reports are indeed suited perfectly well to provide existence proofs for the claimed causality, as they are relevant for the current debate.</s><s>In addition, some researchers have highlighted the advantages of single case studies, especially if brain localizations of function can strongly differ between individuals -as it is known to be the case for sensorimotor functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Elbert et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998)</ref> -and the grouping of patients with necessarily non-identical lesions is always debatable <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Caramazza, 1986)</ref>.</s><s>However, we hasten to add that, whereas case studies can confirm claims about existence ('there is one case for which it applies that. .</s><s>.'), they clearly cannot found general ('all') statements.</s></p><p><s>To overcome the mutual confounding of word semantics and grammatical class, as present in previous patient studies, the current study probed both nouns and verbs separately.</s><s>This opens the possibility of finding category-semantic deficits that are, in addition, specific to lexical class.</s><s>With the inclusion of abstract word categories, it becomes possible to investigate whether semantic grounding in modality-preferential cortex applies exclusively to concrete words, or extend to the domain of abstract semantics.</s><s>To allow conclusions about semantic processing rather than to other stimulus features, semantic categories were matched for a range of psycholinguistic features (see Methods).</s><s>Word recognition was monitored using a speeded LDT.</s><s>Performance on this task has previously been shown to be sensitive to aspects of word semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Chumbley and Balota, 1984</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">Neininger and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pulvermüller, 2001, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the LDT has important advantages over other tests frequently used in previous studies of semantic category specificity, including, for example, picture naming or categorical classification.</s><s>These latter tasks require a similar semantic relationship between words and pictures (which, however, differs between concrete and abstract items) and similar perceptualsemantic similarity structure (which differs, for example, between animals and tools), the absence of which limits the scope of their use.</s><s>In contrast, the LDT offers a straightforward possibility to test performance across word categories differing in their (e.g., abstract vs. concrete) semantics; it has therefore been applied frequently in previous research targeting effects of concreteness and semantic category specificity (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">James, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kroll and Merves, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Jin, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Neininger and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pulvermüller, 2001, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Samson and Pillon, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>The rational underlying this research strategy is the following: If semantic processes elicited by one semantic type of words are specifically supported by a given area and if this area is lesioned, the recognition process of the respective word category can be impaired (delayed and/or less accurate).</s><s>And if a deficit specific for a specific semantic category results from a focal lesion, the lesioned area is a likely key site for processing the affected semantic type.</s><s>The theoretical background for this prediction is the theory of distributed semantic circuits, according to which neuronal networks with different cortical distributions underlie the processing of different semantic word types (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pulvermüller, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>A focal lesion in an area belonging to the distributional pattern of one semantic word type, but not other word types, would lead to a reduction of the excitatory feedback in the respective category-specific semantic circuits and therefore to delayed and more errorful word recognition.</s><s>By testing two patients suffering from focal lesions in their frontocentral sensorimotor cortices, this study aims at fine grained conclusions on the functional involvement and necessity of the focal brain areas for the recognition of words from specific semantic categories.</s><s>Adding abstract words to the stimulus material thereby allows to test whether such a crucial role of these modal areas just applies to the processing of words related to concrete concepts or even extends to abstract words.</s></p></div>

errorless performance and therefore demonstrates absence of aphasia.</s><s>In particular, the excellent results obtained by both patients on the subtest on Word Comprehension show good general reading skills, which are important for written word and pseudo-word processing required in the LDT.</s><s>Despite the absence of aphasia, both patients exhibited impairments in the LDT, arguably due to its higher processing load, especially the strict time constraints and emphasis on accuracy, compared with clinical testing with the AAT battery, where speed is not an issue.</s><s>One might still argue that, possibly, additional general cognitive deficits, e.g., in praxis, attention, memory, or planning might have been present in the patients, but remained undetected and may have affected the results.</s><s>However, general cognitive deficits can be expected to lead to reduced performance across semantic word categories.</s><s>In contrast, the processing deficits observed in both patients, which were significantly most pronounced for one semantic word category, argues against an explanation in terms of general cognitive defects and in favor of one emphasizing specific and semantic origins.</s><s>It is possible that the overall very poor LDT performance across all semantic categories seen in CA was due to the functional role of the affected SMA and adjacent pre-SMA in decision

etiology of the lesions in CA and HS, it may seem that the lesions might not entail the focality needed to draw conclusions about the functional roles of specific brain areas, as proposed in the introduction.</s><s>As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Karnath and Steinbach (2011)</ref>, it might be problematic to precisely tell apart functional and non-functional tissue in brain tumor patients.</s><s>Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Karnath and Steinbach (2011)</ref> also highlight the possibility that gradual functional reorganization may continuously occur during the extended period of tumor growth, thus compensating for the impaired functionality.</s><s>Both objections would resemble a blurring of the inferences that can be drawn on the functional role of lesioned brain areas.</s><s>With regard to the former objection, it has to be noted that HS showed a rather circumscribed lesion and patient CA's metastasis (in contrast to other tumors like for example gliomas) did allow for fine grained differentiation between lesioned and nonlesioned tissue.</s><s>In addition, the disadvantage of a possibly poor spatial resolution of causal inferences on the functional role of brain areas is not unique to tumor patients, but indeed resembles a general problem for all kinds of lesion studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Shallice and Skrap,

using psycholinguistic methods in both patients, whereas functional reorganization would have predicted absence of such specificity.</s><s>Even if functional reorganization occurred in any of the patients, it can be assumed to be insufficient to recover normal function so that a functional role of the lesioned brain areas can still be soundly derived <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Duffau, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, we should remark that for many other patients, the argument is still valid and significant category-deficits may not arise from motor systems lesions.</s><s>Functional reorganization provides one important reason why category differences may be frequently absent after focal lesions.</s></p><p><s>With regard to the lesion in patient HS, it has to be noted that

and primary and pre-motor cortex, may have been affected in their function.</s><s>We should, however, draw attention to the fact that the patient's tumor had been subject to intensive therapy previous to testing, including partial extirpation, so that it appears unlikely that pressure was exerted on adjacent areas.</s><s>Still, the possibility that partial lesion of pre-SMA played some role in causing the deficit in abstract noun processing cannot be ruled out with certainty based on our present data.</s></p><p><s>Clinical observations are consistent with the claim that patient CA, but not HS, was suffering from depressive symptoms at the time of testing, although this could not be objectified using psychological tests.</s><s>Intuitively, this depressive mood could be seen as a (non-neurological) reason for the processing deficit for abstract-emotional words.</s><s>However, previous studies either indicated that LDT performance was not affected by depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Clark et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Challis and Krane, 1988)</ref> or even led to a facilitation of LDT performance on emotionally congruent word stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Olafson and Ferraro, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Note that most of the abstract emotion words used in the present study were negative in valence and therefore congruent with the negative emotional state of depression.</s><s>The observed performance reduction for abstract emotion words seen in patient CA contrasts with these earlier observations, rendering it unlikely that the observed category-specific semantic word processing deficit was based on emotional state of the patient at the time of language testing.</s></p><p><s>Apart from the neurological and clinical factors mentioned above, one could try to argue that the specific impairments found in the two patients might in fact not be due to compromised processing of word semantics, but rather to impairments of basic visual or linguistic processing.</s><s>It is well-known that, in order to solve the LDT, it is not necessary to engage semantic processing, because words, but not pseudo-words, are familiar entities stored as whole lexical entries in the brain-internal 'mental lexicon'.</s><s>Nevertheless, the LDT paradigm has previously been shown to be sensitive to manipulation of semantic content <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(James, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Chumbley and Balota, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kroll and Merves, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr"

semantic word categories after focal brain lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gainotti, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, the examined semantic word categories, within each greater lexical category, were meticulously matched for a range of psycholinguistic features, including word length, lemma frequency, character, bi-and trigram frequencies and their word-initial counterparts, as well as number and word frequency of orthographic neighbors.</s><s>Therefore, the observed category-effects can soundly be attributed to differences in word semantics and not to sublexical, morphological or other psycholinguistic properties, some of which have previously been shown to modulate the activity of motor areas during language processing, independent of semantics <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Pulvermüller et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">de Zubicaray et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the close matching of words and pseudo-words with regard to

focal lesions in the motor system, d and ACC data showed that the healthy control population performed similarly on all semantic noun categories and the same applied for the matched verb categories too.</s><s>However, semantic category differences may be suggested by the control subjects' response time data, which yielded significant differences due to slightly slower responses to abstract and hand-action related nouns.</s><s>These were the two categories, respectively, affected in our patients.</s><s>To examine the theoretical possibility that the processing difference suggested by controls' RT data may explain the category specific patterns in our patients, analyses were repeated with a subset of the word stimuli matched for response times in healthy controls.</s><s>The RT-matched semantic word category sets did not yield any significant performance difference in our healthy subjects, neither in ACCs nor in RTs, but the category-differences for semantic noun categories in both patients' ACC values were reconfirmed.</s><s>These results rule out the possibility that, whatever might have caused the RT differences in our control population could explain the category differences seen in the patients.</s></p><p><s>In both patients, the category specific impairments were only found for nouns, but not for verbs.</s><s>This observation might appear surprising, as the majority of previous studies on motor semantics highlighted the role of the sensory-motor systems for the processing of action verbs.</s><s>Considering the stimuli selected for the present LDT though, one cannot conclude from this result that the functional role of motor areas applies exclusively to the processing of nouns.</s><s>The experimental setup was designed to compare processing of semantic categories separately within semantic subtypes of nouns and, again, for subtypes of verbs.</s><s>Because psycholinguistic matching was not performed across noun and verb categories, a direct comparison between the lexical classes is not straightforward.</s><s>For example, verbs had higher lemma frequencies than nouns and therefore were more familiar.</s><s>This implies that the LDT was generally easier for verbs compared with nouns.</s><s>At the same time, pseudo-verbs consistently differed in only one syllable from proper verbs (because of the shared suffix '-en'), whereas nouns differed between each other in both of their syllables, thus making it necessary to process more information for making lexical decisions on nouns than on verbs.</s><s>In addition, it is well known that verbs carry more syntactic information and are generally more strongly action-related semantically but are, on the other hand, less imageable than nouns <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Pulvermüller et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bird et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Some of these differences between the lexical categories (e.g., the greater imageability of nouns) may underlie the observed processing advantage of nouns over verbs, as found in the healthy controls' d' and RT results and in CA's reduced performance on all verb categories.</s><s>These general psycholinguistic differences between nouns and verbs may also in part account for the fact that category differences could only be documented for one of the lexical categories, because a difference on one of the psycholinguistic dimensions may have moved one of the categories away from a ceiling or floor so that performance differences could become selectively manifest.</s></p><p><s>While patient HS' overall performance for verbs on the LDT was comparable to that of healthy controls, results for CA revealed a strong impairment across all verb categories, which was only paralleled by the severely affected abstract word category of nouns.</s><s>Being aware of the mentioned psycholinguistic differences between our lexical class stimuli, we should still mention the possibility that the latter observation could, in theory, originate from the relatively higher relevance of action knowledge for the semantics of verbs.</s><s>From an Embodied Cognition perspective, the observed impairment for all verb categories with action dominant semantics seem to fit to CA's lesion site in the left SMA, an area known to be involved in motor planning independent of motor effector and body part <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Roland et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Fried et al., 1991)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, given that potential differences in task difficulty cannot be ruled out when comparing nouns and verbs, this interpretation has to be treated with caution before less ambiguous experimental evidence is available.</s><s>In the case of patient HS, the fact that no semantic category effects were seen for verbs could be seen as a side effect of the high performance close to ceiling for verbs, whereas average performance on nouns was relatively reduced.</s><s>Our data did not show significant differences in processing different semantic sub-categories of verbs, thus confirming the corresponding observation by <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributed Semantic Circuit Account of the Current Results</head><p><s>In order to explain the category-preferential semantic deficit in processing hand-action-affording and abstract-emotional nouns, one may claim that our results are consistent with theories that view the motor system as the main carrier of meaning processing for these specific semantic types.</s><s>Although such strong statements -that motor cortices but no other areas integrate concepts and word meaningshave hardly been made, some arguments against semantic grounding (e.g., in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mahon and Caramazza, 2008)</ref> seem to focus on this hypothetical position.</s><s>Indeed, some authors have stated "that the modalities of action and perception are integrated at the level of the sensorimotor system itself and not via higher association areas" <ref type="bibr">(Gallese and Lakoff, 2005, p. 459</ref>), and such statements may have laid the ground for the idea that motor systems, but not association or convergence zones such as the prefrontal or anterior-temporal cortex, might carry meaning.</s><s>Although even such a strong postulate about semantic integration in motor but no other multimodal brain systems could indeed be strengthened by the present data, it is not the only position that explains the present results.</s><s>Considering a wider spectrum of data, which also show semantic activation of and semantic deficits after lesion in multimodal areas (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Patterson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Binder et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Vigliocco et al., 2014)</ref>, the more appropriate explanation of the present data needs to be phrased in terms of distributed semantic circuits in which neurons in motor areas play a functional, causal and necessary role.</s></p><p><s>In this perspective, the sensorimotor parts of the distributed semantic circuits would carry aspects of word meaning and contribute to a process of immediate 'simulation' of semantic information (in the sense of <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Jeannerod, 2006)</ref> when symbols are perceived, even if subjects do not actively attend to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Pulvermüller et al., 2005b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Shtyrov et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the observations made in both patients on nouns seem to fit especially well into theoretical frameworks that assume distributed cell assemblies with different cortical distributions to be the basis of semantic processing of words <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Pulvermüller, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Those cell assemblies are assumed to be the result of correlational learning mechanisms driven by Hebbian learning principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hebb, 1949)</ref>.</s><s>If a word often co-occurs with specific sensory and or motor experiences, or likewise with specific sensory or motor imagery, that word's semantic circuit would gradually be represented by a distributed cell assembly reaching into the sensory or motor areas where relevant activations had been present.</s><s>A word like "hammer" co-occurring with performance, perception or imagery of specific motor movements afforded by the tool, would co-activate the perception action circuit for the word form and the action-related neuronal circuit, thus yielding a higher-order distributed semantic circuit in which neurons in motor areas take a causal and necessary functional role.</s><s>This proposal does not postulate a unique role of the motor system (or 'modality specific cortices') as a seat of semantics, but a semantic role of cortical circuits distributed over perisylvian, sensorimotor and multimodal convergence areas.</s><s>Specificity in cortical function arises from the fact that, for different meaning types, these semantic circuits have different cortical distributions -with some (action related) semantic circuits, but not others (non-action related ones), reaching into the motor system.</s><s>Importantly, in this view, the word 'hammer' is not exhaustively semantically processed in multimodal areas, as postulated by disembodiment (or weak 'integrative') approaches to semantics, and there is no preferential status of the motor system for semantics either.</s><s>Semantic circuits for abstractemotional words would include neurons in the limbic systembecause emotional-affective 'inner states' are essential for at least some abstract words <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Meteyard et al., 2012)</ref> -and in the motor system -because the learning of at least some abstract-emotional words requires the grounding of word forms in emotions expressed in overt body movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Moseley et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This integrative action perception model appears to us to be consistent with known lesion results on brainlesion-elicited semantic impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kiefer and Pulvermüller, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pulvermüller, 2013)</ref> and to do best justice to the present data.</s></p></div>
