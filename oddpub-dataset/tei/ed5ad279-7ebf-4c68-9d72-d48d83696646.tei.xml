<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>According to the standard model of bacterial translation initiation, the small ribosomal 30S subunit binds to the initiation site of an mRNA with the help of three initiation factors (IF1-IF3).</s><s>Here, we describe a novel type of initiation termed "70S-scanning initiation," where the 70S ribosome does not necessarily dissociate after translation of a cistron, but rather scans to the initiation site of the downstream cistron.</s><s>We detailed the mechanism of 70S-scanning initiation by designing unique monocistronic and polycistronic mRNAs harboring translation reporters, and by reconstituting systems to characterize each distinct mode of initiation.</s><s>Results show that 70S scanning is triggered by fMet-tRNA and does not require energy; the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is an essential recognition element of the initiation site.</s><s>IF1 and IF3 requirements for the various initiation modes were assessed by the formation of productive initiation complexes leading to synthesis of active proteins.</s><s>IF3 is essential and IF1 is highly stimulating for the 70S-scanning mode.</s><s>The task of IF1 appears to be the prevention of untimely interference by ternary aminoacyl (aa)-tRNA•elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu)•GTP complexes.</s><s>Evidence indicates that at least 50% of bacterial initiation events use the 70S-scanning mode, underscoring the relative importance of this translation initiation mechanism.</s></p><p><s>protein synthesis | ribosomal functions | translational initiation | 30S-binding initiation | 70S-scanning initiation I t is textbook knowledge that 30S subunits initiate protein synthesis in bacteria; they recognize the initiation site of the mRNA composed of the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, the AUG codon, and fMet-tRNA, together with three initiation factors (IFs) forming the 30S initiation complex (30SIC).</s><s>Association of the large 50S subunit triggers the release of the IFs, leading to the 70S initiation complex (70SIC) that enters the elongation phase of translation (reviewed in 1).</s><s>We term this initiation path the "30S-binding mode" of bacterial initiation.</s><s>After elongation and termination, it is thought that the ribosome dissociates into its subunits, thus providing 30S subunits for the next round of initiation.</s></p><p><s>The functional role of IF2 is well defined.</s><s>It can bind directly to the 30S, providing a docking site for fMet-tRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(2)</ref>, but it can also enter the 30S subunit as ternary complex fMet-tRNA•IF2•GTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Both IF2 and IF3 are essential for viability.</s><s>IF3 has a binding site at the 30S interface (4), which explains its antiassociation effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6)</ref>, as well as its role in dissociation of the terminating 70S ribosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(7)</ref>.</s><s>However, the in vivo concentration of IF3 is 100-fold less <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(8)</ref> than required for full dissociation of 70S in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(4)</ref>.</s><s>Evidence for the presence of IF3 on 70S ribosomes was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(9)</ref>, indicating that the functional spectrum of IF3 is possibly not restricted to an antiassociation effect.</s><s>Both IF3 and IF2 are also responsible for the fidelity of decoding the initiation AUG by fMet-tRNA Met f at the P site of 30S subunits <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(10)</ref>.</s><s>IF1 is universal <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(11)</ref> and essential for viability <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(12)</ref>.</s><s>It is the smallest factor, with 72 amino acid residues in Escherichia coli, and binds to the decoding center at the ribosomal A site <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(13)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several functions have been described, including stimulation of the formation of the 30SIC and subunit association <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Interference with the binding of ternary complexes aminoacyl (aa)-tRNA•elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu)•GTP to 30S subunits has also been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(15)</ref>.</s><s>Omitting IF1 in 30Sbinding tests decreased the accuracy of fMet-tRNA selection over the elongator Phe-tRNA about 60-fold, which was suggested to account for the essential nature of IF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(16)</ref>.</s><s>All three factors are thought to dissociate upon 50S arrival or shortly thereafter <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(1)</ref>.</s><s>IF1 is required for proper initiator-tRNA selection on 70S along with IF2 and IF3, in contrast to the 30SIC, where IF2 and IF3 provide tRNA selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(17)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the 30S-binding initiation, a second initiation mode exists that has a niche existence in bacteria: Leaderless mRNA (lmRNA) contains an initiator AUG codon within the first 5 nt at the 5′-end, and thus does not contain an SD sequence.</s><s>This initiation mode uses 70S ribosomes with the special feature that the ribosomal proteins S1 and S2 are not required, which are otherwise important for the 30S-binding mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Initiation of lmRNA can even occur in the absence of all IFs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20)</ref>.</s><s>Additional information about lmRNAs is provided in SI Appendix, Introduction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Until now, two initiation modes for bacterial translation have been described: (i) the standard 30S-binding mode, where the small ribosomal subunit selects the initiation site on an mRNA with the help of three initiation factors (IFs), and (ii) the rare initiation of leaderless mRNAs, which are mRNAs carrying the initiation AUG within the first 5 nt at the 5′-end.</s><s>The existence of a third "70S-scanning" mode for bacterial initiation was conjectured in past decades but has remained experimentally unproven.</s><s>Here, we demonstrate the existence of a 70S-scanning mode of initiation and characterize its mechanistic features.</s><s>The three initiation modes demonstrate specific patterns of requirements for IF1 and IF3.</s></p><p><s>The existence of a third initiation mode, viz. a 70S type of bacterial initiation, has been conjectured several times previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(23)</ref>, although no in-depth mechanistic evidence has verified this mode thus far.</s><s>For example:</s></p><p><s>i) The formylation of the initiator Met-tRNA Met f in bacteria was interpreted as an indication of a 70S initiation mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, only the anticodon loop of a tRNA and a part of the anticodon stem interact with the 30S subunit <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25)</ref>, leaving the fMet residue as a substrate for the peptidyltransferase center on the large subunit within the 70S ribosome.</s></p><p><s>ii) When an AUG codon without a preceding SD sequence follows a stop codon within a distance of &lt;20 nt, a mutational study unexpectedly revealed that efficient protein synthesis can be initiated in vivo at this AUG codon.</s><s>The interpretation was that ribosomes were sliding down from the stop codon of the preceding cistron, although it was not analyzed whether 70S ribosomes or 30S subunits were involved in sliding or whether factors were required <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Further evidence for a 70S type of initiation is described in SI Appendix, Introduction and concerns both studies of translational coupling and a consideration of the fact that more than 75% of the intercistronic distances are shorter than 30 nt, which is too short to allow an independent termination of cistron n and initiation of downstream cistron n + 1 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 A and B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Here, we demonstrate that there is an additional and frequent initiation mode that we term "70S-scanning initiation."</s><s>The 70S ribosomes, rather than the 30S subunits, scan the sequence surrounding the termination signal for the presence of an SD sequence after termination.</s><s>Furthermore, we show that the requirement of IF1 and IF3 for the three initiation modes (30S binding, 70S scanning, and initiation of lmRNAs) is distinct for each mode.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We first assessed the sucrose-density gradient A 260 profiles of E. coli lysates, and performed Western blot analysis with antibodies against IF1 and IF3 across gradient fractions (SI Appendix, Results).</s><s>The results demonstrate that both IFs are present on 30S ribosomal subunits, and, surprisingly, also on 70S ribosomes and disomes (polysomes; SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2 A and  B</ref>).</s><s>These findings may possibly reflect 70SICs containing IF1 and IF3 that are more frequent than anticipated by the generally held view, where the IFs leave the ribosome upon 50S association, forming 70S ribosomes.</s></p><p><s>First Circumstantial Evidence for a Scanning Mechanism: Expression of Renilla and Firefly Luciferase from a Bicistronic mRNA.</s><s>The first pilot experiment was performed in a coupled transcription/ translation assay, where we assessed the extent to which the expression of a second cistron of a bicistronic mRNA depends on the expression of the first one.</s><s>We adapted the dual-luciferase assay using Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and firefly luciferase (Fluc), which require different sets of reaction partners for their chemiluminescence, and thus allow both enzymes to be measured independently with high precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(27)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The bicistronic mRNA in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> contains a 5′-UTR and an intercistronic region (IR) of 73 nt free of secondary structures.</s><s>An optimal SD region for 30S-binding initiation precedes both cistrons.</s><s>To block translation of one or the other cistron specifically and a possible scanning over the IR, we designed antisense oligo-DNAs specifically targeting Rluc, Fluc, and the middle of the IR (anti-Rluc, anti-Fluc, and anti-IR, respectively) because DNA/RNA helix structures severely impede ribosomal elongation rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(28)</ref>, and thus the translation of a cistron.</s><s>The mRNA was transcribed and translated in RTS lysate (Roche; SI Appendix), and luminescence was normalized to 100%.</s><s>Hybridization of an oligo-DNA did not impair the stability of the synthesized mRNA (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S3A</ref>).</s><s>Further controls with monocistronic mRNA coding for Rluc or Fluc demonstrated that both anti-Rluc and anti-Fluc blocked expression of their corresponding cistron but exhibited low effects (&lt;20%), if any at all, on the other cistron due to an unavoidable low sequence similarity with the target mRNA.</s><s>Most importantly, the anti-IR did not block Fluc expression at all (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, hatched columns and SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Rluc (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, red bars) is reduced with the addition of any antisense DNA;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The idea that a ribosome dissociates after every translation of a cistron to supply 30S subunits for initiation dates back to 1968, when Kaempfer (43) demonstrated an intensive subunit exchange between heavy and light ribosomes.</s><s>A convincing point was that known translation inhibitors could block subunit exchange.</s><s>However, the experimental method raises some questions: (i) 18 amino acids were added, which is not enough for protein synthesis, and (ii) sonication leading to a breakdown of polysomes into 70S monosomes containing mRNA fragments did not significantly reduce the subunit exchange.</s><s>Most short mRNA fragments do not contain a stop codon, and thus do not allow for orderly termination.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, the 30S-binding mode of initiation is well documented (1) but poses several paradoxes, as described in the Introduction.</s><s>The 70S-scanning mode first postulated in 1966 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(44)</ref> can resolve these contradictions.</s><s>Our experiments suggest that 70S ribosomes do not necessarily dissociate after termination, but rather scan the mRNA around the stop codon searching for a nearby SD sequence.</s><s>We do not know whether and when the 70S ribosome dissociates and leaves the mRNA during an RRF/EF-G•GTP-dependent recycling process, as described below.</s></p><p><s>Three observations indicate that it is not the 30S subunit, but rather the 70S ribosome, that scans the surrounding nucleotides of the last stop codon for an SD sequence:</s></p><p><s>i) The bicistronic mRNA used in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref> was designed to prevent 30S initiation, and, indeed, a 30S-binding mode of initiation was not observed (lanes 9 and 10), in contrast to a 70S-dependent initiation causing a strong translation of the second GFP cistron requiring 70S scanning.</s><s>ii) Robust 70S scanning from a posttermination complex was triggered by fMet-tRNA Met f and was not affected by the presence of an excess of competing mRNAs, which would sample the ribosomes after dissociation (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>; compare the 1-AUG bands of lane 4 with the 1-AUG bands of lanes 5 and 6).</s><s>Even the presence of both an excess of competing mRNA 3 and RRF+EF-G•GTP did not diminish the strength of the 1-AUG band (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>, lanes 8 and 9).</s><s>RRF+EF-G•GTP is thought to be required for dissociating a posttermination 70S complex.</s><s>The latter results are particularly interesting, because they suggest that 70S dissociation (recycling) is not an obligatory phase after termination of the translation of a cistron.</s><s>iii) Finally, scanning worked equally well using X-70S ribosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>, compare lanes 2 and 4).</s><s>We conclude that the 70Sscanning initiation represents an important alternative initiation mode complementing the 30S-binding initiation.</s><s>The 70S scanning also seems to work upstream in a few cases (in 7% of all IRs of E. coli, where 70S ribosomes after translation of a cistron should move upstream for limited distances of 1, 2, and 4 nt;
