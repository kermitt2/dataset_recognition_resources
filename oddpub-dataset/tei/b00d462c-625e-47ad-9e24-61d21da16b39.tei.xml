<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Berberine reduces diarrhea and gastrointestinal hypermotility in mice</head><p><s>Moreover, the i.p. administration of berberine(0.5, 1 and 5 mg/kg)produced a potent, dosedependent antinociceptive effect in the capsaicin (i.c.) and acetic acid (i.p.) (Fig 3C <ref type="figure">and 3D</ref>, respectively) mouse model of visceral pain.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Berberine changes opioid receptor expression in mouse intestine</head><p><s>Berberine at the dose of 1, 2 and 5mg/kg increased MOR mRNA expression in the mouse ileum and at the dose of 2 and 5 mg/kg in the colon (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>).</s><s>DOR expression was also increased in the mouse GI tissues; however, in the colon only the highest dose of berberine (5 mg/kg) produced statistically significant results <ref type="bibr">(Fig 4B)</ref>.</s><s>No effect of berberine on KOR mRNA expression was found in the mouse GI tract (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Berberine changes opioid receptor expression in rat brain cortex</head><p><s>Previous studies have demonstrated that opioid receptor agonists affect neuronal activity in the CNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>; furthermore, primary culture of cortical neurons is widely used in the research on neurological disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.However, owing to difficulties in dissection and culture of mouse fetal cortical neurons, a universally accepted protocol for their derivation has not yet been determined.</s><s>As a result, the effect of berberine was examined on cultured rat fetal cortical neurons.</s></p><p><s>As shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>, nearly all rat fetal cortical neurons were β-tubulin, MOR and DAPIpositive after7 days of culture.</s><s>Determination of neuronal purity using dark field imaging showed that the percentage of β-tubulin-immunostained neurons was over 95%.</s><s>Incubation of cortical neurons with berberine (10 −8 mol/L, added to a 7-day culture 1 and 2 days before collection) significantly increased the mRNA expression of MOR compared with the control group (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Patients with IBS-D suffer markedly from loose and frequent stools, and from the associated urgency and fear of incontinence, which generate panic and anxiety.</s><s>Furthermore, mental disorders constitute an important factor in intestinal dysfunction, and the disease itself is often closely related to mental ailments, such as anxiety, anger, depression, and fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Another main symptom of IBS is abdominal pain, presented in most patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of berberine in treating IBS-D using mouse models mimicking physiological conditions and disease symptoms.</s><s>We found that berberine prolonged the whole gut transit time; of note, a classic non-selective opioid antagonist naloxone, as well as selective MOR (β-funaltrexamine) and DOR (naltrindole) blocked the anti-motility effect, suggesting that both receptor types may be involved in regulation of whole gut motility by berberine.</s><s>This is in line with earlier reports showing that berberine inhibits myoelectrical activity and GI transit through the endogenous opioid system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.In the recent years, MOR-DOR interactions were studied in detail and it was found that MOR and DOR may form heteromers, if co-expressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The co-expression of MOR and DOR and functional interaction has been widely reported.</s><s>For example, MOR was shown to co-internalize with DOR and target lysosomal degradation after treatment with a DOR agonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, DOR can alter the functions and the trafficking of MOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study we showed that the activation of MOR by berberine may simultaneously affect DOR function in physiological conditions.</s><s>However, berberine prolonged the time to diarrhea in the mouse model induced by orally administered castor oil exclusively in a β-funaltrexamine-dependent manner.</s><s>These results suggest that MOR is principally responsible for berberine action in pathophysiological conditions.</s></p><p><s>Earlier reports demonstrate that the activation of MOR and DOR controls pain signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>For example, it was found that peripheral MOR and DOR play a major role in the tonic inhibition of mechanical allodynia <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>and MOR and DOR agonists alleviate mechanical pain and relieve heat and mechanical hyperalgesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>; opioid receptor agonists of different background and chemical structure also produce antinociception in inflammatory or chemically-induced pain (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>).In line, our results showed that berberine significantly relieved visceral pain induced by mustard oil, capsaicin and acetic acid which blocked by MOR and DOR antagonists in mustard oil test, confirming crucial role of peripheral MOR and DOR in berberine-mediated action.</s></p><p><s>By now there have been no studies investigating in detail the interaction of berberine in the endogenous opioid system.</s><s>Here we showed that the administration of berberine in mice significantly enhanced MOR and DOR mRNA expression in ileum and colon.</s></p><p><s>Since berberine was shown to easily cross the blood brain barrier after systemic administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>and may thus affect CNS, we also investigated the effect of berberine on opioid receptor expression in fetal cortical neurons.</s><s>Interestingly, MOR expression was significantly enhanced after berberine treatment in 7 days cortical neurons, while DOR was up-regulated also in 7 day neurons.</s></p><p><s>Earlier reports show that the activation of MOR and DOR reduces depression, possibly as a result of stress or anxiety relief <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies revealed that already a single treatment with MOR and DOR agonists produce antidepressant-like effects in the forced swimming test, which is one of the most popular animal models for screening antidepressants <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, acute administration of the selective MOR agonists, such as methadone, fentanyl, morphine, hydrocodone, buprenorphine, and nalbuphine in an intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) blocked both stimulation of stretching and depression produced by lactic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.Recently a novel DOR agonist, KNT-127 demonstrated antidepressant-like and antinociceptive effects in mice without producing convulsions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>The fact that berberine simultaneously acts through MOR and DOR, but also enhances their expression in the CNS may have vital implications in the treatment of anxiety symptoms and depressive-like behavior, which are typical for IBS patients.</s><s>This action must not be overlooked in further, clinical trials of berberine.</s></p><p><s>Finally, patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) suffer markedly from loose and frequent stools, with the associated urgency and a fear of incontinence.</s><s>Another main symptom of IBS is abdominal pain, presented in most patients.</s><s>Furthermore, this disease itself is often closely related to mental ailments.</s><s>According to our berberine mechanism research here, it encourages to use in the anti-IBS treatment.</s><s>However, further clinical studies are needed to investigate this mechanism and effects in detail.</s></p></div>
