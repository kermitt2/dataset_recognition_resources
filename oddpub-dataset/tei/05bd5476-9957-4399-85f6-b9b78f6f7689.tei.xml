rates were very high already under standard care.</s><s>This is consistent with our study.</s></p><p><s>In a recent cluster RCT from the Netherlands (OPTIMAL), an SDM intervention also aimed at enhancing patients' achievement of treatment goals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Patients were asked to choose between an intensive treatment strategy according to the ADDITION protocol and a less intensive treatment based on guideline recommendations.</s><s>The findings showed no significant difference between the groups.</s><s>Almost half of the patients in the intervention group switched from less intensive to intensive treatment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>However, benefits from intensifying therapy in type 2 diabetes are questionable.</s><s>In our previous RCT on the ISDM-P, more patients achieved their HbA1c level goals because they set slightly higher HbA1c targets after the teaching session. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>We offered and supported patients to prioritise and set realistic treatment goals.</s><s>GPs of the OPTIMAL trial found the decision aid helpful, but it remains unclear if patients understood the information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>ost of the ISDM-P consultations with the GP did not take longer than usual consultations, with a mean duration of about 11 min.</s><s>The implementation trial of the statin choice decision aid in Spain reported consultation times of almost 20 min without significant differences between intervention and control groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>In our study, GPs just had to perform the last steps of the SDM process, as patients had been well prepared for decision-making by MAs.</s><s>Hence, GPs could discuss four health topics-blood glucose, blood pressure, statin use and smoking-and related treatment options with their patients in a single encounter.</s><s>The duration of the group teaching session provided by MAs was comparable to other DMP teaching sessions.</s></p><p><s>Recently, Ballard et al assessed the routine use of the statin choice decision aid and the diabetes medication choice decision aid in a tertiary care centre under routine care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref></s><s>Half of the clinicians used the statin choice decision aid and 9% the medication choice decision aid.</s><s>Reasons for not using the material were lack of awareness that the tools were available, time constraints and attitudinal barriers, for example, clinicians found the decision aids not helpful or not accurate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref></s><s>Recommendations to address such barriers are workshops to improve SDM skills, development of brief evidence-based consultation tools, interventions to prepare patients in decision-making and the development of measurements to be used in practice Open access to identify knowledge gaps and preferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Our ISDM intervention already addresses all these aspects.</s><s>The ISDM-P training included a demonstration of a patientteaching session and role play in order to help teams gain more insight into differences between usual counselling and SDM-based consultations.</s><s>Our training took longer than trainings in other studies, but this time duration was perceived as appropriate by participants.</s></p><p><s>Meaning of the study: possible explanations and implications for clinicians and policy-makers In our study, we determined that patients under standard care did not have adequate risk knowledge to make informed decisions.</s><s>Healthcare providers do not have access to education and patient information material which fulfil the criteria for evidence-based health information.</s><s>The ISDM-P remedies this: it not only provides understandable and relevant risk information to healthcare personnel and patients, it also enables a patientphysician communication on equal footing and helps patients and GPs to pursue common treatment goals as recommended in DMP guidelines.</s><s>Our study shows that the ISDM-P can be integrated in everyday practice without large extra effort.</s><s>It meets the criteria to be covered by health insurance companies.</s><s>unanswered questions and future research Further research will focus on extending the ISDM-P concept to other clinical decisions.</s><s>In particular, drug facts boxes on the increasing number of oral antidiabetic agents should be made available.</s><s>Structured treatment and teaching programmes need to be updated and optimised based on criteria for evidence-based patient information and SDM. <ref type="bibr">22 25 42</ref></s><s>Web-based formats allowing individual training and exchange with healthcare professionals have to be developed.</s><s>This will also allow a more personalised selection of teaching modules on diabetes or hypertension care.</s></p><p><s>Current clinical practice guidelines do not provide well-structured information on benefits and harms of medication or other treatments that could readily be used within consultations with patients.</s><s>Fact boxes or other decision tools should be considered in guideline development. <ref type="bibr">3 43</ref></s><s>Finally, open access trainings in evidencebased medicine, risk information and SDM for healthcare providers are required.</s><s>Maintaining and updating an entire ISDM treatment and teaching programme will require an up-to-date online platform for patients and healthcare providers.</s></p><p><s>The implementation of the ISDM-P concept would meet national and international guideline recommendations as well as the
