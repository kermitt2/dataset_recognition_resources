type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with its antioxidative and protective activities to counteract oxidative damage inflammatory challenges, several studies have clearly shown that

type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref> .</s><s>In fact, SFN is a well-known pharmacologic promoter/activator of Nrf2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s><s>Nrf2 is a ubiquitously expressed redox-sensitive transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of the

cycle, the urea cycle, heme biosynthesis, iron and calcium homeostasis, and steroid biosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> .</s><s>While mitochondrial function is vital for cell survival these organelles play a significant role in the execution of apoptosis (programmed cell death), a process for the removal of potentially dangerous cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> as well

that they contain their own DNA that encodes 13 important proteins essential for energy production while the rest of approximately 78 proteins are encoded by the nuclear DNA.</s><s>Additionally, more

genomes is crucial to meet the energy demands of the cell or tissues as well as for efficient functioning of mitochondria.</s><s>Because of the complexity of mitochondria, the exact role of mitochondria in development of number of degenerative diseases or drug toxicities is still not well understood.</s><s>To address this knowledge gap, a comprehensive transcriptomics tool, MitoChip was designed and developed that consists of genes encoded by both genomes associated with various mitochondrial pathway/biological processes including, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid β-oxidation, Krebs cycle, heme biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion and fission, mitochondrial DNA transcription, replication and repair, apoptosis, and various mitochondrial membrane transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> .</s><s>Unlike commercial high-density whole genome expression arrays, MitoChip contains genes encoded by both genomes to understand a cross-talk between two genomes during various disease conditions or toxic insults.</s><s>In this study we focused our attention on a specific subset of targets encompassing enzymes function in the redox metabolism, antioxidative response and detoxification systems.</s><s>For example glutathione S-transferase alpha (GSTAs) and glutathione S-transferase mu types (GSTMs) are phase 2 enzymes involved with xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress.</s><s>Glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) is also a phase 2 enzyme which catalyzes the conjugation of hydrophobic and electrophilic compounds with reduced glutathione.</s><s>Catalase (CAT) and Thioredoxin 1 (Txn1 are key enzymes involved with redox biology whereas CAT promotes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, thus protecting the cell from oxidative damage by ROS.</s><s>Hexokinase Type I (Hk1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (Pdk1) are enzymes responsible for the regulation of homeostasis of carbohydrate fuels and glycolysis/energy homeostasis, etc.</s><s>In addition, we look at a major regulator of cerebral iron homeostasis such as ferroportin (Slc40a1) also implicated in the modulation of mitochondrial redox metabolism and cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> .</s></p><p><s>For these purposes ue used a mouse MitoChip array encompassing a total of 1,027 unique genes associated with mitochondrial structure and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> to obtain important insights into the effects of SFN.</s><s>In parallel, by western blotting, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and integrated cell culture (ICC), we investigated the cellular impact of
