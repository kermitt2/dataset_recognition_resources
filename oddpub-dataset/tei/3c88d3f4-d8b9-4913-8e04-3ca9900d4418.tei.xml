<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Main Outcomes</head><p><s>The main outcomes were total and annual costs for AMI.</s><s>From a healthcare payer perspective, we defined annual costs as the annual summation of hospitalization, ambulatory care, practitioner claims, and drug costs incurred for all patients with AMI as the primary diagnosis.</s><s>Other outcomes were distribution of healthcare costs by MI subtypes (ST-segment elevation MI [STEMI], non-STsegment elevation MI [NSTEMI], and undefined/recurrent MI [Other MI]), and by sex and age (\ 50, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and C 80 years).</s><s>We also examined distribution of hospitalization costs by revascularization procedures (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p><s>Our study of healthcare costs for patients with AMI in the province of Alberta, Canada showed that AMI cost the province approximately Can$1 billion between 2004 and 2013 (Can$100 million per year, equaling 0.4% of provincial health expenditure in 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>).</s><s>Hospital services accounted for the greatest share and practitioner claims accounted for the smallest share of total AMI healthcare costs.</s><s>During the study period, annual AMI healthcare costs decreased due to a reduction in drug costs and stable hospitalization and ambulatory care costs.</s><s>NSTEMI was the main cost driver for patients with AMI in the province of Alberta.</s></p><p><s>In response to ever-increasing healthcare costs, cost containment efforts have been implemented in many countries, including Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, there have been significant advances in diagnosis and treatment of AMI in the last several decades, which may lead to productivity improvements in AMI care <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>For example, there has been a substantial increase in the use of PCI and a decrease in the use of CABG, which is far more costly and resource-intensive than PCI in AMI patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the Canadian Institution for Health Information reports a substantial increase in the generic share of prescriptions in Alberta from 56.6% in 2008 to 72.1% in 2013, and this could contribute to the decreased annual drug costs as observed in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>The combination effect of these factors might explain the decrease in annual   healthcare costs for AMI in Alberta.</s><s>However, further investigation is needed to better understand this effect.</s><s>We found the per cost of AMI in Alberta was Can$31.7 per capita in 2010 (Can$117.4 million for a population of 3.7 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>).</s><s>This is lower than the cost of Can$131.2 per capita in the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> (converted to Can$, 2016 values using the Federal reserve system exchange rate [29] and Bank of Canada inflation calculator <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>).</s><s>In addition, we observed a downward trend in healthcare costs while Heidenreich et al. forecasted the opposite to happen in the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>This may be due to the fact that the US study included a broader population (AMI plus angina pectoris and other forms of chronic ischemic heart disease).</s><s>Furthermore, variations in patterns of practice between the two countries may have an impact on medical costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref>, and overall drug prices in the US are approximately 2.9 times higher than in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our study confirmed that hospital services and drugs account for the majority of total healthcare costs for patients with AMI.</s><s>While Seo et al. reported that hospitalization costs could account for 73% of total medical costs for AMI in Korea <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>, Mantovani et al. reported a 77 and 15% attribution of inpatient care and drug costs, respectively, to the total medical costs for AMI in Italy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to opportunities to improve quality of care while controlling costs by preventative strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>, these findings emphasize the importance of cost-saving strategies in hospital (i.e., utilizing the right procedure for the right patient and reduction of LOS).</s><s>During the study period, we observed decreased costs per hospitalization which may be a composite effect of the reduction in costs for patients who underwent PCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> and decreased LOS during the study period.</s><s>It was reported previously that differences in procedure and LOS could contribute 34 and 53% to the
