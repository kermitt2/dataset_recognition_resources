<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Brv1 Is Required for Mechanotransduction in Larval</head><p><s>Class III da Neurons that Sense Gentle Touch To determine whether Brv1 mediates mechanotransduction, we examined its role in touch sensation.</s><s>The brv1 loss-of-function (LOF) mutant larvae were tested for defects in touch sensation using a previously established behavioral assay, by which the thoracic segments were touched with an eyelash and the gentle-touch responses were scored <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kernan et al., 1994)</ref>.</s><s>The mutant brv1 DEL was generated by the deletion of 92 amino acids (112-204) within the two putative transmembrane helixes predicted by the TMHMM program (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A and S1B</ref>), and brv1 STOP is a previously described nonsense mutant with a stop-codon insertion at Leu563 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Gallio et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>We found that both brv1 DEL and brv1 STOP larvae were viable and displayed normal morphology; however, these mutants showed severe defects in their behavioral response to gentle touch.</s><s>The gentletouch response scores of brv1 DEL and brv1 STOP larvae were significantly lower than those of the wild-type (WT) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>The brv1 LOF larvae had a touch score predominantly distributed at the type 0 ''no response,'' in contrast to the type 2 response ''recoil'' for the WT (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), implying that Brv1 mediates larval responses to gentle touch.</s></p><p><s>Previous behavioral studies in Drosophila have identified class III da neurons as the substrates of gentle-touch detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Yan et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>To address the question of whether Brv1 and class III da neurons act interdependently to mediate touch sensation, we targeted brv1 in these neurons using RNAi under the control of a class III da neuron-specific Gal4 driver (19-12-Gal4) and evaluated the larval responses.</s><s>The restricted knockdown of Brv1 in class III da neurons resulted in a decrease in the gentle-touch response; conversely, expression of a WT brv1 transcript in class III da neurons using the 19-12-Gal4 driver functionally rescued the touch sensitivity in the brv1 LOF larvae (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A and 1B</ref>).</s><s>The functional requirement of Brv1 in class III da neurons was studied in more detail by examining the touch responses of class III da neurons using GCaMP6, a genetically encoded Ca 2+ indicator.</s><s>In response to a 40-mm touch displacement lasting 300 ms, an increased intracellular Ca 2+ signal in class III da neurons was recorded in WT larvae.</s><s>In contrast, the Ca 2+ response was reduced by targeting brv1 RNAi in class III da neurons.</s><s>Moreover, the Ca 2+ signal response to touch stimuli in class III neurons of brv1 STOP larvae was dramatically reduced, but the defect was rescued by class III neuron expression of Brv1 <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1C,</ref><ref type="bibr">1D,</ref><ref type="bibr">and S1E)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To test whether Brv1 is expressed in class III da neurons, we used an antibody generated against the C terminus of the Brv1 protein to identify Brv1, and class III da neurons were labeled with 19-12-Gal4-driven expression of UAS-mCD8-GFP.</s><s>Immunostaining of the larval body wall identified Brv1 expression in class III da neurons (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E and S1F</ref>), whereas no immunofluorescence was evident in brv1 STOP larvae (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>).</s><s>Altogether, these results demonstrate that Brv1 is required for gentle-touch sensation, likely functioning via class III da neurons in Drosophila larvae.</s></p><p><s>Brv1 Is a Pore-Forming Subunit in a Cation Channel Several mechanosensors, such as NOMPC for gentle touch and dPIEZO for mechanical nociception, have been shown to act as mechanosensitive ion channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Kim et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yan et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore set out to determine whether Brv1 forms ion channels.</s><s>We cloned full-length brv1 from third-instar larvae into the pIRES2-EGFP vector for heterologous expression in HEK293T cells and assessed the channel activity of Brv1 using electrophysiological recordings.</s><s>We found that Brv1-transfected cells, but not vector-transfected cells, displayed an outwardly rectifying current-voltage (I-V) relationship in whole-cell recording at holding potentials ranging from À100 to +100 mV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Brv1 currents were blocked by gadolinium (Gd 3+ ), whereas ruthenium red (RR) had no inhibitory effect.</s><s>Replacing Cl À in the bath solution with NaMES had no effects on the current amplitude, suggesting that the currents are carried by cation channels.</s><s>The ionic selectivity of Brv1 was determined by recordings under asymmetric buffer conditions in which the external Na + in the bath solution was replaced with various cat-ions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Reversal-potential measurements revealed that the Brv1 channel is permeable to both monovalent and divalent cations, with a relative permeability of K + &gt; Cs + z Na + z Ca 2+ &gt; N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>Altogether, these results demonstrate that Brv1 forms a cation channel.</s></p><p><s>Next, we determined the single-channel activity in Brv1transfected HEK293T cells in the outside-out excised patch configuration.</s><s>The spontaneous openings of Brv1 displayed an outwardly rectifying feature with outward single-channel conductance (65 ± 8 pS) that was $1.5-fold that of the inward conductance (42 ± 5 pS) (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D and 2E</ref>), whereas no current was detectable in excised patches from vector-transfected cells.</s></p><p><s>Previous structural-functional studies have shown that mutations of negatively charged residues surrounding putative pore region modify the properties of cation channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kang et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yan et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>A pore-forming architecture of TRPP channels has been indicated by the recently resolved structure of TRPP2, in which transmembrane segments S5-S6 and the intervening pore loops contribute four individual subunits to form an ion-conducting pore <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Shen et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Alignment of the Brv1 protein sequence to TRPP2s identified two negatively charged residues, Asp552 and Glu558, located in a predicted pore helix of Brv1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>We found that alanine substitution of Asp552 (D552A) or Glu558 (E558A) drastically reduced the  (legend continued on next page) channel activity in whole-cell recordings and resulted in altered I-V curves of the spontaneously activated Brv1 channel (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>), thus providing further evidence that Brv1 forms an ion channel.</s></p></div>
