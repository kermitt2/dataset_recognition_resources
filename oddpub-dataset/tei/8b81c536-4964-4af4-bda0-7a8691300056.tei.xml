<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPORTANCE</head><p><s>The effectiveness of intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke is time dependent.</s><s>The effects are likely to be highest if the time from symptom onset to treatment is within 60 minutes, termed the golden hour.</s></p><p><s>OBJECTIVE To determine the achievable rate of golden hour thrombolysis in prehospital care and its effect on outcome.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS</head><p><s>The prospective controlled Prehospital Acute Neurological Treatment and Optimization of Medical Care in Stroke study was conducted in Berlin, Germany, within an established infrastructure for stroke care.</s><s>Weeks were randomized according to the availability of a specialized ambulance (stroke emergency mobile unit (STEMO) from May 1, 2011, through January 31, 2013.</s><s>We included 6182 consecutive adult patients for whom a stroke dispatch (44.1% male; mean [SD] age, 73.9 [15.0] years) or regular care (45.0%</s><s>male; mean [SD] age, 74.2 [14.9] years) were included.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTERVENTIONS</head><p><s>The STEMO was deployed when the dispatchers suspected an acute stroke during emergency calls.</s><s>If STEMO was not available (during control weeks, when the unit was already in operation, or during maintenance), patients received conventional care.</s><s>The STEMO is equipped with a computed tomographic scanner plus a point-of-care laboratory and telemedicine connection.</s><s>The unit is staffed with a neurologist trained in emergency medicine, a paramedic, and a technician.</s><s>Thrombolysis was started in STEMO if a stroke was confirmed and no contraindication was found.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</head><p><s>Rates of golden hour thrombolysis, 7-and 90-day mortality, secondary intracerebral hemorrhage, and discharge home.</s></p><p><s>RESULTS Thrombolysis rates in ischemic stroke were 200 of 614 patients (32.6%) when STEMO was deployed and 330 of 1497 patients (22.0%) when conventional care was administered (P &lt; .001).</s><s>Among all patients who received thrombolysis, the proportion of golden hour thrombolysis was 6-fold higher after STEMO deployment (62 of 200 patients [31.0%] vs 16 of 330 [4.9%]; P &lt; .01).</s><s>Compared with patients with a longer time from symptom onset to treatment, patients who received golden hour thrombolysis had no higher risks for 7-or 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratios, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.09-1.70];</s><s>P = .21</s><s>and 0.69 [95% CI, 0.32-1.53];</s><s>P = .36)</s><s>and were more likely to be discharged home (adjusted odds ratio, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.09-3.41];</s><s>P = .02).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE</head><p><s>The use of STEMO increases the percentage of patients receiving thrombolysis within the golden hour.</s><s>Golden hour thrombolysis entails no risk to the patients' safety and is associated with better short-term outcomes.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Prehospital stroke treatment within the STEMO concept increased the number of tPA treatments within the golden hour almost 10-fold.</s><s>Golden hour thrombolysis was associated with improved patient outcomes regarding the discharge destination from acute in-hospital care.</s><s>We observed no increased risk The major difference in proportions between the group treated after deployment of the stroke emergency mobile unit (STEMO) and the group treated with conventional care can be observed within the first 60 minutes of symptom onset.</s><s>for hemorrhagic complications or mortality in patients undergoing golden hour thrombolysis.</s><s>Deployment of STEMO led to a significant proportion of patients with extremely early treatment, even in a setting with already short median doorto-needle times and OTT in the control group (36.0 [IQR, 28-51] and 105.0 [IQR, 81-145] minutes, respectively).</s><s>Our results regarding safety and discharge status after golden hour thrombolysis are in line with previous analyses of the association of improved outcomes with shorter OTT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref></s><s>hrombolytic treatment within the first 60 minutes has rarely been reported.</s><s>Only 4 of 3670 patients with time to treatment within 1 hour were included in the randomized stroke thrombolysis trials according to the last pooled data set. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref></s><s>Nevertheless, the term golden hour has become used frequently in acute stroke management. <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s>The rapid death of brain cells after blockage of cerebral blood supply makes immediate treatment to dissolve or remove clots indispensable.</s></p><p><s>Starting treatment at the scene has become a realistic scenario.</s><s>The high percentage of early treatments also raises hopes for other potentially effective treatments, such as neuroprotective substances.</s></p><p><s>This study has limitations.</s><s>The significance and generalizability of the results presented here are limited owing to the nature of a post hoc analysis.</s><s>These explorative results need to be confirmed using a prospective approach.</s><s>The PHANTOM-S study was originally designed to detect a reduced time from the emergency call to treatment and was not powered to detect functional outcome differences.</s><s>The use of discharge destination from acute in-hospital care can only be interpreted as a surrogate variable.</s><s>The higher frequency of patients discharged home was only shown for patients treated within the golden hour and not for the entire cohort of patients who received STEMO care.</s><s>Randomization was not performed at the patient level, but weeks were allocated to usual stroke care or additional STEMO availability.</s><s>Finally, bias of spontaneous recovery remains a possibility when comparing extremely early vs late thrombolysis.</s></p><p><s>The question of generalizability of the prehospital thrombolysis concept warrants further studies.</s><s>Not all countries are accustomed to emergency physicians in the field, which may be required for adaptation of the STEMO concept.</s><s>The OTT found in our study after STEMO deployment (median OTT, 80.5 minutes) and during conventional care (median OTT, 105.0 minutes) were much shorter than in published stroke thrombolysis registries (median OTTs, 144 minutes in Saver et al 2 and 140 minutes in Wahlgren et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">7</ref> ) or even in best-practice hospital systems (median OTT, 119 minutes for Meretoja et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">9</ref> ).</s><s>Apart from a selection bias by restriction to patients with ambulance care, this difference may be explained at least in part by a well-established metropolitan stroke care system with trained dispatchers and paramedics, short distances to stroke units, and rather optimized in-hospital procedures.</s><s>During the study period, the dispatchers identified patients with typical stroke symptoms during the emergency call and notified the emergency medical services, which may have raised awareness of the entire rescue chain.</s></p></div>
