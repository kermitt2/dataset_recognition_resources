<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study Design.</head><p><s>A retrospective analysis of 12 genotype 1 infected liver graft recipients with recurrent HCV who underwent TVR-based antiviral triple therapy between March 1, 2012, and July 31, 2013, at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery at Charité University Hospitals, Berlin, Campus Virchow, was performed.</s><s>All patients included in this study had confirmed HCV recurrence with detectable HCV RNA in the PCR analysis and biopsy-proven graft fibrosis according to the Desmet and Scheuer classification (0, absent; 1, mild without septa; 2, moderate with few septa; 3, numerous septa without cirrhosis; and 4, cirrhosis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The indication to perform TVR-based antiviral therapy was based on sufficient renal function (glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and red blood cell count (hemoglobin levels ≥ 10 g/dL), as well as on adequate patient compliance.</s><s>TVR treatment was not considered in patients with allograft cirrhosis, renal insufficiency, or general contraindications to IFN therapy.</s><s>This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments and approved by the institutional ethic committee.</s><s>All patients were extensively educated about treatment-related side effects and the increased risk of DDIs during TVR therapy.</s><s>Written consent to perform TVR/ PegIFN/RBV triple therapy and consecutive PegIFN/RBV dual therapy by each patient was documented in the medical records.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Treatment Algorithm.</head><p><s>The overall antiviral treatment duration was scheduled as 12 weeks of TVR/PegIFN/RBV triple therapy and 36 weeks of consecutive PegIFN/RBV dual therapy.</s><s>Primary immunosuppression was switched from tacrolimus (TAC, Prograf5) to cyclosporine (CyA, Sandimmun Optoral5) prior to the beginning of treatment, and a sufficient therapeutic range for the CyA dosage was defined as a total body clearance (TBC) from 80 to 120 ng/mL depending on the time that had elapsed since OLT.</s><s>In addition, all patients underwent a lead-in phase of 4 weeks of RBV (Cope-gus©; Roche) at a daily dose of 600 mg to estimate hematological and renal tolerance.</s><s>Hemoglobin and serum creatinine levels were measured once a week during the lead-in phase, and the RBV dosage was eventually adjusted.</s><s>Triple therapy was then begun with TVR (Incivo©; Janssen-Cilag International NV), PegIFN (Pegasys©; Roche), and RBV (Copegus©; Roche).</s><s>TVR was given at either two daily doses of 1,125 mg or three daily doses of 750 mg, respectively, to reach a daily dose of 2,250 mg.</s><s>The CyA dosage was reduced by 50% for each patient on the day that TVR treatment started.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Treatment Efficacy and Definitions.</head><p><s>To assess the treatment efficacy, HCV RNA was measured at baseline, at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 of antiviral treatment, and then at weeks 12, 30, and 52 after the end of the treatment course (Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Roche Cobas TaqMan, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany; lower level of quantification (LLOQ) = 15 IU/mL).</s><s>A rapid virological response (RVR) was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at week 4, and a complete   48 weeks of complete antiviral treatment.</s><s>An SVR 12 and SVR 52 were then achieved in 7 out of the 12 patients (58%).</s><s>All 7 patients had maintained the SVR in the two-year follow-up after the end of triple therapy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>severe declines in general patient conditions combined with manifest hematological side effects (anemia and leukopenia) in each of the 4 patients and an additional renal decompensation in one patient.</s><s>Two of the 6 patients who completed the full treatment duration also required an RBV dose reduction to a daily dose of 400 mg or 200 mg, respectively.</s><s>During the 12 weeks of TVR/PegIFN/RBV therapy, the mean hemoglobin level dropped from 7.4 mmol/L to 5.7 mmol/L, whereas the mean WBC count dropped from 4.8/nL to 3.4/nL, respectively.</s><s>Five patients (45%) developed anemia with hemoglobin levels below 6.2 mmol/L and required EPO administration during this time period.</s><s>Four of these patients also received blood transfusions.</s><s>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GC-SF) was given to 5 patients due to a WBC below 2.5/nL.</s><s>We did not observe a decrease of GFR under TVR therapy.</s><s>The median GFR decreased from 72.0 mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 to 58.6 mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 from the beginning to the end of the TVR/PegIFN/RBV triple therapy.</s><s>In addition, 3 patients (27%) developed infections: urinary tract infections in 2 patients and clostridium difficile diarrhea in 1 patient (9%).</s><s>Skin changes expressed by a mild rash were observed in 2 patients (18%), and 1 patient (9%) reported a disturbing anorectal pruritus (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The introduction of PIs has fundamentally changed the treatment options for patients with primary HCV and HCV recurrence after OLT even in GT1 patients with a prior nonresponse to antiviral therapy and may thus be considered as a first step towards modern HCV therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>The promising results regarding the antiviral efficacy of this rather revolutionary treatment approach have, however, been overshadowed by an increase in directly treatment-associated AEs, especially in immunocompromised patients, in whom dual therapy has already proven particularly challenging <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>At the time our study began, the two PIs TVR and BOC were approved for antiviral therapy in Europe.</s><s>The therapy costs were similar, but as previous authors have noted, TVR appeared to be more "streamlined" to us in comparison to BOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Benito et al. also reported that triple therapy with TVR exhibits greater early antiviral activity than that with BOC which has been demonstrated to be a principal predictive factor for consecutive SVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Morisco et al.</ref> recently also reported that RVR was the only independent predictive factor of antiviral response in cirrhotic patients treated by triple therapy with TVR.</s><s>An even shorter therapy may thus be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we analyzed the antiviral efficacy and safety of TVR/PegIFN/RBV triple therapy in HCV GT1-infected liver transplant recipients, a patient cohort in whom SVR rates after former standard dual therapy were rather low in comparison with genotypes 2 and 3.</s><s>In our study, we showed that despite the complexity in this setting, TVR-based triple therapy was feasible and efficient also in the long-term outcome.</s><s>Eight of the 12 patients (67%) achieved an ETR, including 2 patients who had to discontinue consecutive dual therapy prematurely due to treatment-related side effects.</s><s>One patient had an HCV relapse 21 days after regularly finishing the 48-week complete antiviral treatment course.</s><s>An SVR 12 and SVR 52 were then obtained in 7 of these patients (56%).</s><s>Our results are in accordance with Faisal et al., who analyzed TVR-based triple therapy for HCV recurrence after OLT in a multicenter trial and reported an ETR of 75% and an SVR 12 of 61.5% <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>As an important and novel finding of our study in comparison to other reported results all patients with an SVR 12 also achieved an SVR 52.</s><s>Severe PI's treatment-related AEs including death have been reported in several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, 10 of the 11 patients who underwent TVR therapy &gt;4 weeks suffered from treatment-related AEs.</s><s>These AEs were clinically severe enough to discontinue TVR therapy in one patient and consecutive dual therapy in 4 additional patients.</s><s>The treatment discontinuation rate in our study is comparable to the results of Gallegos-Orozco in nontransplanted (high-risk) cirrhotic patients (24%), thereby underlining the particularly difficult conditions for TVR therapy in immunocompromised patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, hematological side effects were the most common treatment-related AEs.</s><s>Five patients developed anemia, all of whom required EPO administration and 4 of whom required blood transfusions.</s><s>Triple therapy is associated with a 20% increase in the incidence of treatment-related anemia compared with the former standard PegIFN/RBV therapy, and, according to a recent interim analysis of patients who underwent TVR therapy after OLT, 77% of all patients require EPO administration under TVR therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, 5 patients in our cohort had leukopenia and required G-CSF administration.</s><s>Both anemia and leukopenia are most likely explained by the bone marrow-suppressive and nonimmune hemolytic anemia effect of RBV, which is aggravated when RBV is given in combination with TVR Hepatitis Research and Treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, two patients also had to discontinue antiviral therapy due to severe renal decompensation, which may also be explained in the context of RBV therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>The RBV dosage may be adapted to hemoglobin and GFR levels under PI therapy with no negative effect on later SVR rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>A complete cessation of RBV, however, requires a discontinuation of TVR therapy and therefore needs to be carefully evaluated.</s><s>In our study, RBV dose reduction was necessary in two of the six patients who completed the full antiviral treatment duration; one of these patients experienced HCV relapse 21 days after the regular end of the 48-week antiviral treatment course.</s><s>In an attempt to assess hematological and renal tolerance before beginning TVR therapy, all patients in our study underwent a 4-week RBV lead-in phase.</s><s>It appears to be reasonable to include IFN in this lead-in phase, not only to assess general therapy tolerance but also to possibly identify interferon-insensitive patients who are at risk of developing protease-resistant HCV strains during TVR therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Patients at high risk for SAEs or virological nonresponse may thereby be identified before beginning expensive and potentially harmful TVR therapy.</s><s>Another major issue for TVR therapy in transplanted patients is the complex management of immunosuppression.</s><s>Dose reductions and adjustments of CNIs are required during the entire TVR treatment course due to severe DDIs.</s><s>In addition to the risk of CNI toxicity, previous studies have also reported rejection episodes in 4 to 6% of patients during antiviral therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>Generally, the CyA dosage appears to be less difficult to manage because of the slighter required dose reduction compared with TAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, an additional antiviral action of CyA has been described due to the involvement of cyclophilin A in the viral replication of HCV, which is underlined by the results of a meta-analysis showing that during dual therapy more patients achieved SVR with CyA than with TAC <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s>All of our patients were therefore switched to CyA before beginning TVR therapy.</s><s>Despite deviations in the total CyA body clearance (TBC), especially in the first days of TVR therapy, no patient developed signs of toxicity or rejection.</s><s>Of course, our study is limited by the small sample size and the lack of randomization.</s><s>Additionally, our patients were all well selected with regard to their general conditions and a rather less distinct fibrosis progression in comparison with studies that included rather difficult-to-treat patient populations, including patients with cirrhosis or cholestatic hepatitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</s><s>However, we may still conclude that TVR therapy in general as well as the concomitant management of immunosuppression may safely be performed in HCV GT1-infected liver graft recipients with promising SVR 52 rates.</s><s>In the context of the rapid developments in HCV treatment options in the last years, the clinical relevance of first generation PIs has however to be considered as rather negligible nowadays.</s><s>The recent introduction of novel nextgeneration antiviral agents such as sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, simeprevir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and dasabuvir has led to a fundamental change in the treatment perspectives of modern HCV therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s><s>Several clinical studies have demonstrated that a combination of these new drug classes now allow interferon-free treatment regimens with a less harmful SAE spectrum, a superior antiviral efficacy, and no significant interference with immunosuppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s>The EASL guidelines for HCV treatment before and after liver transplantation have therefore recently been adapted <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s>However, the worldwide replacement of PIs by novel DAAs is until today amongst other factors limited by economic burdens.</s><s>Long-term results of PI therapy efficacy as well as the emergence of resistance thus need to be continuously analyzed in order to allow an optimal and evidence-based HCV treatment also in health care systems with limited access to recent achievements of modern HCV therapy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
