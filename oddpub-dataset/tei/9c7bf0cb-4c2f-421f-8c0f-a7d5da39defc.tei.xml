<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The national surveys in all four countries were designed to investigate the coverage of adequately iodised household salt as well as the levels of iodine in the salt.</s><s>This paper assessed the relationship between household salt iodine content and a number of factors previously found to be associated with household access to adequately iodised salt.</s><s>In single variable regression analyses, salt iodine content was significantly associated with indicators of: location (strata), socio-economic status (particularly the MPI living standards domain), knowledge and awareness of iodised salt (having heard of it and looking for it at the point of purchase), and salt supply (salt obtained in a sealed pack and salt grain type).</s><s>The results of the multiple variable regression analysis provide a clear indication that various characteristics of the salt supply are the most important factors associated with household salt iodine level.</s><s>In particular, the level of iodine in refined salt was considerably higher than in larger coarse and crystal salt.</s><s>These results also highlight the high level of sub-national variation in the quality of salt accessible to households.</s></p><p><s>The tendency for lower income, rural, households to have greater access to non-iodised or inadequately iodised, presumably lower-priced, salt has been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">23]</ref>.</s><s>A notable outcome of the multiple variable regression analyses was that in all countries, the significance of any positive association between respondent awareness of iodine deficiency and iodised salt with salt iodine content was removed after the influence of supply-related factors were accounted for.</s><s>This does not mean that supply-chain and consumer-focused communication activities are not an important part of a programme to achieve optimal iodine nutrition through USI.</s><s>However, it indicates that demand-side activities such as communication and awareness raising, in the absence of concurrent interventions to strengthen supply-side awareness and practices, are unlikely to be the main factor driving household access to adequately iodised salt.</s><s>This finding has been reported elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Another main finding was that the highly significant single variable associations between salt iodine and salt supply-related factors, such as packaging and brand name, were generally reduced when grain type was held constant, suggesting an overlap between these factors, as would be expected.</s><s>Experience has shown that salt with a finer grain type is more likely to be: iodised homogenously, subject to production quality control and regulatory monitoring, packaged and labelled as iodised, and to be produced by a larger scale producer with a known brand name <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The low household access to adequately iodised salt in small-scale salt producing areas of Bangladesh, Ghana and Senegal indicates a lack of progress following efforts, over many years, to improve salt iodisation technology and quality assurance capacity among small-scale producers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr">[28]</ref>.</s><s>These areas had higher household access to coarse salt (66.2%, 69.0% and 78.6% respectively) than in other strata within the same country (data not shown).</s><s>Across all four surveys, household salt with lower iodine content was generally found to be unrefined with a larger crystal size, which is typically produced by smaller-scale enterprises.</s><s>Smaller production units often face technical and financial challenges to integrate quality-assured iodisation into the production process, although this has been done relatively successfully in some contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>.</s><s>For a number of reasons, including costs and logistics, local authority officials are also less likely to implement national guidelines for regulatory monitoring within the decentralised, often seasonal, environment of small-scale salt production (Yusufali R, Situma R, Bohac L, Khan L and J Gorstein.</s><s>A Review of Country Experiences in Small-Scale Salt Iodization.</s><s>Submitted for publication) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, India has made impressive progress towards achieving USI.</s><s>In fact, the goal of ƒõ90% household coverage has already been achieved in the urban areas of the Central, North and North-East zones.</s><s>This was reflected in the urinary iodine results from the 2015 survey that showed at the national level WRA had adequate iodine status (MUIC 158 ¬µg/L) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The WHO recommended cut-off indicating adequate iodine status is a population MUIC of 100 ¬µg/L, however some research indicates this should be lower for WRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>.</s><s>It appears that national success in salt iodisation is in part due to the Salt Department strategy to consolidate the industry and improve quality assurance and regulatory monitoring procedures.</s><s>Based on the higher iodine content noted in refined, packaged salt and the outcome of the multiple variable analysis, it could be presumed that if these same strategies are continued and expanded to remaining areas of the country, coverage should improve in the South and rural-Central areas and the target of 90% national household coverage with adequately iodised salt will be achievable.</s><s>However, the recent policy decision to close down the Salt Commissioner's Department may adversely affect the success story of USI in India.</s></p><p><s>In Bangladesh, the survey report <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref> and the outcome of the multiple variable regression analysis indicated that iodisation of salt from small-scale production may be more operational than in Ghana or Senegal.</s><s>A higher proportion of coarse salt is packaged in Bangladesh than in the other two countries and packaged coarse salt was more likely to be iodised than loose coarse salt.</s><s>Despite this, there is still evidence of overall low household coverage with adequately iodised salt in the rural-low-performing areas and of low median and mean iodine content of coarse salt.</s><s>The multiple variable regression indicated that the variable "respondent looked for iodised salt" remained significantly associated with household salt iodine, which is an encouraging indication that consumer awareness may influence choice in this country.</s><s>However, only about 10% (179 respondents) of the total weighted sample reported to have looked for iodised salt at purchase.</s><s>The 2015 survey in Bangladesh did not include assessment of iodine status.</s><s>However, the 2011 survey results indicated a high level of association between household salt iodine and population iodine status.</s><s>This suggests that the population in areas of the country where lower quality, coarse, salt is readily available may have lower, possibly inadequate, iodine intake.</s></p><p><s>In Ghana, the higher iodine content of coarse salt in the North compared with the Mid strata is difficult to explain, however, may be related to the expectation of increased regulatory monitoring check points during the longer journey to retail points in the North.</s><s>Despite this difference, the fact that the mean iodine level of coarse salt was below 10 mg/kg in all four strata indicates that a similar strategic response is required to ensure that this type of salt is adequately iodised.</s><s>The national MUIC among WRA of 202 ¬µg/L indicates adequate iodine intake among this population group, suggesting that sources of dietary iodine, other than iodised household salt, are available (personal communication from Ghana Health Services on the unpublished draft survey report).</s><s>Sources could be naturally occurring iodine and/or iodised salt used in frequently consumed processed foods, such as bouillon and tomato paste.</s><s>One study conducted in the North of Ghana supports this hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In Senegal, it appears that within each of the urban and rural-salt-producing strata, access to iodised household salt was consistent.</s><s>Within the urban stratum, the majority of households were using salt with just about adequate iodine content, whereas in the rural-salt-producing stratum, household salt tended to have very low estimated iodine content.</s><s>In contrast, households in the rural non-salt-producing stratum were accessing salt with either relatively high or else low level of iodine.</s><s>The MPI living standards score appeared to be a key driver of access to better iodised salt in this stratum, suggesting that salt of varying quality was available, but that access to higher quality iodised salt was associated with salt pricing/affordability.</s><s>Until the challenge of small-scale supply of lower-iodisation quality salt is addressed, it is unlikely that much can be done to influence the effect of the socio-economic factor on household salt use.</s><s>In contrast to the findings in Ghana, the low percent access to adequately iodised salt was reflected in a relatively low MUIC (98 ¬µg/L) among WRA nationally <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The iodine content of household salt is an important indication of iodine intake from salt iodisation, however, there is now a large body of evidence indicating that industrially-processed food salt is an increasingly important source of, potentially iodised, salt <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34]</ref>.</s><s>Food industry salt is included in the definition of USI.</s><s>This manuscript presents evidence of large variations in access to adequately iodised household salt and highlights some of the challenges to improving this situation.</s><s>It is, therefore, recommended that USI implementing guidelines should be expanded to include enforcement of the use of adequately iodised salt by the processed food and condiment industry to improve population-wide access to salt iodine.</s></p><p><s>It was possible to apply the same regression model in each country and conduct some comparison between them because they were designed with similar questionnaire modules.</s><s>In addition, the stratification design and multiple regression analyses provided results that can be used as an evidence base for future programme strategies to increase equity of access to adequately iodised salt.</s><s>A national process for dissemination and strategic use of these findings has been encouraged in all four countries.</s></p><p><s>The external quality assurance of laboratory performance rated all four laboratories conducting salt iodine analyses as "Good", providing confidence in the salt iodine results.</s></p><p><s>A limitation to the sample size in Senegal occurred due to the misplacement of salt samples from 13 PSUs across different strata.</s><s>Salt iodine data were adjusted for this since the occurrence could not be considered as random non-response.</s><s>The non-response for valid household salt iodine results in Ghana was random and more related to households that typically purchased small quantities of salt and not having any in the household at the time of the survey, and to collection of insufficient salt for analysis.</s></p></div>
