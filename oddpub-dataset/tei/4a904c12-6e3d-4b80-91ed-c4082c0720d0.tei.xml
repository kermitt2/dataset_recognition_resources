<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data processing</head><p><s>Bibliometrics of 2,528 articles resulting for our WoS search were exported as tab-delimited data and imported into MS Excel as one bibliometric data set (Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>In the raw data set each entry referred to one publication.</s><s>We included data on title, authors, address of authors' affiliated institution, publication year, source, language, document type, cited references, funding agency, publisher and subject category in further analysis.</s><s>Other columns were deleted from the data set.</s><s>Information on addresses of author's affiliated institution, e.g.</s><s>institution name, sub-departments and institution address including city and country, were split into separate columns.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the network</head><p><s>Since the first reported EVD outbreak in 1976 until today the total number of publications on EVD in WoS has exceeded more than 4500 publications, of which 2528 were original research articles.</s><s>Like in scientometric analyses we used joint publishing as a proxy indicator of scientific collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> and thus knowledge exchange for our SNA of the co-authorship network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed for the EVD overall network we identified research contributions from 1,644 research institutions in 101 countries; most actors are indeed coming from the US <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Since 1994 EVD research publications have increased continuously, steadily and independently of the major West African outbreak.</s><s>This growth in publications is mirrored by a growth in the number of institutions (from 30 to 1,489) and edges (from 60 to 9,176) and therefore on-going network growth accompanied by a decreasing network density.</s><s>The overall network is an extensive aggregation of 166 different communities with a clearly dominant anglophone and francophone community.</s><s>This same dominance is seen when analysing the most central actors by degree and betweenness centrality both confirming the dominance of 10 institutions in powerful, control or broker positions in the network <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the network</head><p><s>The pattern of a growing EVD network in size but with a reducing density is characterised by some outliers (106 institutions not connected), frequently less connected contributions from developing countries and the private sector, but with a strong and stable core of dominant or 'central' institutions.</s><s>These characteristics of the network are supported by many of the analyses we performed.</s><s>For example the relatively and increasingly poorly connected nature of the network (network density), the heavily skewed node degree distribution with the median node degree remaining rather constant, the relatively compact nature of the network (path lengths) and the strong centralisation showing a dominance of a few very strongly connected actors and many poorly connected actors.</s></p><p><s>Although we acknowledge that our analysis is weakened by the absence of a comparator network (a common challenge in emerging research fields), we also believe that our analysis bring some added value.</s><s>For example SNA metrics for the overall network shows a density of 0.007 and calculating network density for each decade individually showed progressively decreasing density from 0.138 in the first decade to 0.008 in the last decade.</s><s>While this is largely influenced by both the size (the more actors a network includes, the more difficult it is for all actors to be connected) and also the correspondingly rapid growth in the network (connections take time to build), we still believe that these figures should raise questions about whether the network-and therefore research outputs-could benefit from greater connectivity and linkages and in doing so greater optimise knowledge transfer and the spread of innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The node degree distribution (for the last decade from 2006-2015) further confirms both the observed increase in the average node degree is attributable to only a few central actors whereas the overall network was not well connected in this period.</s><s>Thus, the network growth during the 2014/2015 epidemic diluted connectivity, at a time when collaboration was arguably most needed.</s></p><p><s>These observations are built on when we look further at the node degree distribution for 2006-2015 .</s><s>This confirms that while most actors only had few connections during this time, some actors are extremely connected.</s><s>This distribution form has been described as "power law" or "scale free distribution" and is typically observed amongst poorly connected networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>This 'concentrated core' is corroborated by the high number of the average weighted node degree (17.89), in contrast to the average node degree (12.05), which is also an indicator that some actors in the EVD network are connected more strongly to each other than others due to repeated publishing <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>It shows that these actors have on-going collaborations, share research results intensely by jointly publishing-but focus sharing amongst their co-authors.</s><s>This latter finding is something confirmed by our SNA results, which show strong centralisation amongst six institutions (CDC USA, NIH, USAMRIID, WHO, the University of Marburg and the University of Harvard), suggesting that knowledge is mostly exchanged within the network between and/or through these actors.</s><s>Centrality is a measure of power in SNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, this is especially the case for our central actors whose knowledge broker status is confirmed with regard to EVD research due to their high degree and betweenness centralities.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, observation of the path lengths reveal further insight into the efficiency of information exchange, with the shorter the average path length of a network diameter, the more efficient is information exchanged within the network structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s>We found that the average paths lengths (3.02) of the overall network is lower than the average node degree (12.05), indicating both that some institutions have a lot of direct neighbours and that on average nodes can reach other nodes by crossing only two other nodes.</s><s>The network diameter (8.0) suggests that sub-graphs within the network do not span more than across a chain of eight nodes.</s><s>Taking both aspects into account this implies that the overall structure of the network is characterized by isolated and weakly connected components, i.e. localized small networks that have only few relations amongst each other.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network actors</head><p><s>Although our study cannot, unfortunately, reveal anything about the 'type' of research conducted, observations on the type of research institution maybe serve as a proxy for this insight.</s><s>Two notable observations here were both the relative underrepresentation and disconnectedness in the overall network of both research institutions from affected countries and the private sector.</s><s>Among the unconnected nodes appear some private industry actors (e.g., Novartis Vaccines, Biohelix Corp, Baxter Bioscience and Oravax Inc.), in addition to African universities such as the University of Benin and the University of Mbarara.</s><s>While there may be many good reasons that explain the disconnectedness, for example proprietary restrictions to collaboration (in the case of industry), new entrants to the field or for resource-related barriers to International collaboration.</s><s>This observation remains significant for a number of reasons, presumably both of these actor types posses' unique and distinct knowledge and capabilities that could diversify and strengthen the expertise within the network if better and more broadly integrated, this is likely even more the case during a public health emergency of international concern.</s><s>Also, this ability to identify disconnected but valuable nodes, demonstrates a great added value of tools such as SNA.</s><s>Finally the recent entry into the network of non-traditional research actors such as MSF should be welcomed, especially as endemic country capacity is being developed and integrated into international networks, due to their unique position as being close to patients in the field yet able to advocate-distant funders-on the need for a well-supported, needs-driven research agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Network-implications for policy</head><p><s>We believe the structure, nature and evolution of the international EVD research network described in this paper presents some learnings for policy.</s><s>Looking positively, the network itself has maintained a similar structure-a relatively compact network with a few consistent actors at its core-over the four decades studied, implying it is a stable constellation.</s><s>This institutional memory provides a solid foundation for knowledge maintenance over time, indeed without central actors networks might be disrupted and knowledge exchange hampered <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The growth in the network over time through the entry of new actors, particularly since 2014/ 2015, is positive as it likely indicates the arrival of new ideas and approaches.</s><s>However although collaboration has increased over time, our analysis found that the network remains relatively poorly connected.</s><s>Hence there may be an additional role for the 'central actors' to expand their role beyond a hub for dissemination and exchange into a facilitator for integrating the newer actors and expertise into the network.</s><s>Additional opportunities presented by the network analysis include: a reflection on the, perhaps, over-reliance or vulnerability to the network of all of the 'central actors' being public government or university institutions.</s><s>The importance of predictable, sustainable, funding flows to their continued role as network 'brokers' feels more exposed in these current financially and politically turbulent times.</s><s>While the dominance of these institutions is not surprising, we assume that they have the infrastructure, capability and public-financing, it may represent a weakness in two respects: firstly, with respect to its insufficiently diverse expertise mix, particularly with respect to the translation of this research into the development of tangible, context-relevant tools and capacity building in affected countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>; secondly, with respect to the risk of over-centralising expertise, resulting in the stifling or suppression of innovation and growth and development of new ideas.</s></p><p><s>Finally, in small research areas for diseases predominantly impacting the lives of those in low-income countries such as EVD, the inherent market failures indicate that this reliance of public-financing will likely continue [Wo ¨lfel in: 3,5-7].</s><s>Given this, we believe, that a valuable insight from our study is to observe ways in which the network efficiency could be enhanced to extract greater patient-impact from the public financing inputs.</s><s>For example: focused efforts on integrating new collaborators into the network, provision of tools to enhance the productivity and improved transparency and sharing of research data <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> the identification of expertise gaps and targeted filling of these gaps and lastly, but perhaps most importantly, National alignment, focus and financing coordination (strategic research planning) around the globally agreed prioritised research agenda <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Although many of these calls have already been made by many actors, particularly since the 2014/2015 EVD outbreak we believe this study represents an important empirical tool to support these calls and inform National and global policy development as the global community works to avert the next EVD outbreak.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The use of bibliometric data has intrinsic limitations and restrictions related to any analysis of secondary data and where data ceases to provide information, in particular in relation to content or results of published research.</s></p><p><s>Two major limitations to our study were identified and previously highlighted.</s><s>The first being the absence of other publications with which to contextualise and compare our results.</s><s>This absence of relativity in our conclusions limits the comparative value of our findings although the absolute data remain valid.</s><s>Although SNA is increasingly being used as a tool to analyses research areas it remains a relatively new field so we are optimistic that this is a timelimited constraint.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, we acknowledge that our study would be greatly enriched by an ability to analyse the data by 'type' of research not only type of publication i.e. basic, applied, clinical, implementation research, translation, health systems etc.</s><s>However, at present, this is not a search field within WoS, so we were unable to attain the source data.</s><s>Should key, public, medical, search engines enable this in the future, SNA such as ours would be an even more powerful tool to provide insight into research focus and productivity.</s><s>This analysis we believe would have great value-supplementing existing financing and development pipeline analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>-in providing a more granular understanding of product development gaps and the persistent absence of tools for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of EVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">44]</ref>.</s><s>Our analysis of decreasing network density over time could have been further triangulated with the use of an additional metric such as the percentage of the giant component or the clustering coefficient.</s><s>Other limitations include reporting delays and the possibility that some publications were not included in the WoS database, however sample testing of other databases, including PubMed.gov, did not reveal other publications on EVD.</s></p><p><s>Although the impact of missing publications was likely small future studies could aggregate studies from diverse databases and in particular try to assess contribution of private industries R&amp;D.</s><s>Despite manual and automated attempts to resolve challenges with institution name cleaning and disambiguation it cannot be excluded that some actors and/or relationships were not captured or were captured incorrectly.</s><s>Although unlikely, errors of the software used cannot be completely excluded and different algorithms might lead to different presentations of results.</s><s>Therefore network visualisations should be critically assessed in context to minimise misinterpretations.</s><s>We further note that GeoLayout visualisation can be misleading since it locates the African continent in the map centre and visualised edges may overlap nodes.</s><s>For this reason a country distribution was processed additionally with Force Atlas 2. The use of only free available software and easy accessible bibliometric data from WoS both facilitate the easy reproducibility of our study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>We conducted the first systematic landscaping of published EVD global research bibliometrics using SNA tools for analysis and visualisation.</s></p><p><s>Since 1976 Ebola outbreak EVD research, numbers of authors and affiliated institutions and links between them are constantly increasing, mostly independent from outbreaks and inparticular in the past two decades.</s></p><p><s>The overall EVD research network is organised around a few co-authoring key actors, mostly publicly financed.</s><s>Low network density indicates room for increased cooperation between institutions, in-particular links to less connected and more peripheral institutions could foster knowledge exchange and innovation.</s><s>Key network actors, such as the CDC USA, maintained network coherence over time-and probably kept EVD research on-going.</s><s>Limited scientific collaboration of research organisations from LMIC and the private industry, and how they utilise their expertise and knowledge, is neglected.</s></p><p><s>However, the absence of effective treatments for EVD questions the existing EVD research network efficacy and efficiency and suggests the need for both direction and structure to optimize the network to focus on research relevant for treatments.</s><s>Since most institutions in the global network are publicly funded, guidance to direct and re-orientate research might be facilitated by funders (through calls targeting knowledge and translation gaps) and be offered by supranational policy setting entities such as WHO and its Global Observatory on Health Research and Development.</s></p><p><s>Further in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis, e.g.</s><s>text mining of publications abstracts, analysis of EVD research study methods and separate R&amp;D product pipeline analysis, is recommended to ensure empirically based strategic research guidance and relevant to EVD product development.</s></p><p><s>In any case, SNA of co-authorship networks is an innovative tool to evaluate research collaborations between individuals, organizations and countries, contributes to the understanding of the evolution of research networks and should be used for strategic research planning and a regular monitoring.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .Fig 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
