<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D</head><p><s>espite decades of study and debate, the role of adjunctive "low-dose" hydrocortisone treatment (200-300 mg/d) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The current recommendation for hydrocortisone use is mainly based on 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2</ref> In the study by Annane et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">3</ref> hydrocortisone improved survival and reversal of septic shock in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.</s><s>In the CORTICUS study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">4</ref> septic shock was reversed more quickly but mortality was not significantly reduced.</s><s>The higher risk of mortality and septic shock severity in the study by Annane and colleagues resulted in more restrictive recommendations for hydrocortisone use only in patients with inadequate response to fluid and vasopressor resuscitation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2</ref> However, septic shock reversal in the CORTICUS study was reported to be significantly accelerated by the administration of hydrocortisone irrespective of the adrenal response to corticotropin.</s><s>An international consensus statement recommended replacing the terms relative or absolute adrenal insufficiency, which reflect only adrenal cortisol release, by the critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) concept. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">5</ref></s><s>6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[7]</ref> In a smaller RCT in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hydrocortisone significantly improved survival and prevented progression to shock. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">8</ref></s><s>Furthermore, 2 recent RCTs 9,10 and a meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">11</ref> revealed positive effects of steroids in patients with CAP.</s><s>Assuming that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease continuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone administration might prevent shock development owing to the attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first RCT investigating the effects of hydrocortisone to prevent progression to shock in patients with severe sepsis presenting without shock.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>The Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS) study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, placebocontrolled, double-blind RCT supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.</s><s>The study was conducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence Network (SepNet) and the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, which provided internet-based randomization and data capture, assurance of accuracy and completeness of data, biostatistical analysis, and pharmacovigilance.</s><s>Monitoring of sites was performed on defined intervals.</s><s>The protocol was approved by the responsible ethics committees of all 34 participating sites.</s><s>The trial protocol is available in Supplement 2.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Patients</head><p><s>Patients were screened in intermediate care units or intensive care units (ICUs) of university and community hospitals for eligibility, and written informed consent was obtained from pa-tients, patient-authorized representatives, or legal representatives.</s><s>Patients were enrolled if they met all inclusion criteria (for details, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1): (1) provided informed consent; (2) had evidence of infection; (3) had evidence of a systemic response to infection, defined as at least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">12</ref> ; and (4) had evidence of organ dysfunction present for not longer than 48 hours.</s><s>The main exclusion criterion was septic shock.</s><s>Other exclusion criteria were being younger than 18 years, having known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol (placebo), or having a history of glucocorticoid medication with indication for continuation of therapy or other indications for treatment with glucocorticoids.</s><s>Patients were not excluded for using etomidate within 72 hours before enrollment, using a short course of glucocorticoids within 72 hours before enrollment, or using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions</head><p><s>Septic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate volume status for longer than 4 hours (ie, mean arterial pressure &lt;65 mm Hg, systolic arterial pressure &lt;90 mm Hg, or the use of vasopressors to keep mean arterial pressure ≥65 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressure ≥90 mm Hg).</s><s>Patients who had a transient need for vasopressors during initial resuscitation but were not hypotensive and did not use vasopressors for at least 2 hours were eligible for enrollment when septic shock was not present at the time of randomization.</s><s>Adequate volume status was defined as a central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg or greater (≥12 mm Hg in ventilated patients) and a central venous oxygen saturation greater than 70%.</s><s>For fluid replacement, patients were to receive at least 500 to 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300 to 500 mL of colloids over 30 minutes.</s><s>The use of hydroxyethyl starch preparations was discouraged owing to possible harmful effects on kidney function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">14</ref></s><s>Use of vasopressors was defined as therapy with dopamine at a dosage of at least 5 μg/kg/min or with any dose of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or other vasopressors.</s><s>For further details and definitions, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomization</head><p><s>Randomization was stratified by participating center and sex.</s><s>It was performed with an internet-based computerized randomization tool that uses a modified version of the Pocock minimization algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">15</ref> with a random component to generate balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time.</s><s>All</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key Points</head><p><s>Question Does adjunctive early hydrocortisone therapy prevent the development of septic shock in patients with severe sepsis who are not in shock?</s><s>Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 380 adults, occurrence of septic shock was not significantly different between patients who received hydrocortisone or placebo (21.2% vs 22.9%, respectively).</s></p><p><s>Meaning Administration of hydrocortisone did not prevent the development of shock in patients with severe sepsis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Medication</head><p><s>The study medication (hydrocortisone and placebo) was produced and released by BAG Health Care GmbH.</s><s>The medication was delivered in boxes, each containing 17 brown glass vials for 1 patient.</s><s>Each vial contained 100 mg of lyophilized hydrocortisone hydrogen succinate or the same amount of lyophilized mannitol as placebo, which was indistinguishable from hydrocortisone.</s><s>The medication was administered as an intravenous bolus of 50 mg, followed by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 200 mg on 5 days, 100 mg on days 6 and 7, 50 mg on days 8 and 9, and 25 mg on days 10 and 11.</s><s>Hydrocortisone dose corresponded to those used in the 2 major RCTs performed earlier, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">4</ref> which had shown significant effects on septic shock resolution.</s><s>A continuous infusion was preferred to avoid possible undulation of the blood cortisol concentrations by bolus administration, which had been reported to complicate blood glucose control. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">16</ref></s><s>A continuous infusion was also recommended in the recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2</ref> To reduce possible hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">17</ref> hydrocortisone was tapered over several days as in the CORTICUS study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">4</ref></s><s>Study medication was discontinued for safety reasons or when patients were discharged from the ICU or reached the primary end point.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this RCT, low-dose hydrocortisone did not prevent the evolution from severe sepsis to septic shock.</s><s>There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to mortality or LOS in the ICU or hospital, or mortality up to 180 days.</s><s>Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a significantly higher risk of developing hyperglycemia and a lower risk of developing delirium in a post hoc analysis.</s><s>The rationale for this study was based on the notion that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect stages of a disease continuum with increasing mortality. <ref type="bibr">28</ref></s><s>Occurrence of septic shock was chosen as the primary outcome variable for the following reasons.</s><s>First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">24</ref></s><s>Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nitric oxide formation-a key mediator of septic shock pathophysiology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">17</ref></s><s>Thus, it was hypothesized that attenuation of inflammation in early severe sepsis could prevent progression to shock.</s><s>Third, this hypothesis was supported by data of Confalonieri et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">8</ref> showing that septic shock was prevented by hydrocortisone in patients with CAP.</s><s>Fourth, because occurrence of septic shock is associated with an increased risk of mortality, 28 it was hypothesized that prevention of septic shock leading to organ dysfunction could also affect secondary outcome variables such as LOS in the ICU or mortality.</s><s>If prolonged administration of hydrocortisone was able to prevent septic shock development, this beneficial effect of hydrocortisone could outweigh adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, which can be readily treated by administration of insulin.</s><s>Vasopressor-dependent (volume-resistant) septic shock in patients with sepsis is still the key indication for suggesting hydrocortisone in the current international guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">2</ref></s><s>Hence, it seems plausible to take this as a primary end point if prevention of septic shock is tested.</s><s>We assumed a rate of septic shock of 40% in patients with severe sepsis based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> and data from the Sep-Net Clinical Trials Group.</s><s>However, owing to different study populations, effect sizes, and septic shock criteria, only a rough estimation was possible (see limitations described later).</s><s>According to recommendations of the German Sepsis Society to transfer patients with severe sepsis to an intermediate care unit or ICU, only patients treated in these units were enrolled in HYPRESS.</s><s>This was different from a recent retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis and similar lactate values but lower hospital mortality (7.9% mortality in the study by Liu et al 29 vs 13.1% mortality in this study), who were treated predominantly in the general ward. <ref type="bibr">29</ref></s><s>owever, the current study did not show a protective effect on shock development, time to septic shock, mortality, or LOS in the ICU or hospital.</s><s>The results are in contrast to a small study in 46 patients with severe CAP, in which hydrocortisone administration was associated with improved survival and significantly lower rates of septic shock.</s><s>This study was prematurely stopped after an interim analysis owing to improvement of oxygenation and hospital mortality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">8</ref></s><s>The presented data did not support that hydrocortisone was more effective with regard to the primary or secondary end points in patients with pneumonia or in the subgroup of patients with CAP.</s><s>However, recent larger RCTs of steroids in patients with CAP did not reveal reduction of mortality but did show some beneficial effects on other outcomes.</s><s>In 304 non-ICU patients, a 4-day treatment with 5 mg of dexamethasone reduced median hospital LOS by 1 day. <ref type="bibr">30</ref></s><s>Another RCT enrolled 120 patients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response who received methylprednisolone at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg twice daily or placebo for 5 days. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">10</ref></s><s>Primary end points were parameters of early (&lt;72 hours) or late (72-120 hours) treatment failure.</s><s>Treatment failure rates were lower in patients who received steroids than in those who received placebo (13% vs 32%, respectively;

thus, it cannot be excluded that hydrocortisone would have been more effective in patients with a higher risk of death.</s><s>Fourth, data on delirium should be interpreted with caution because patients had to be excluded owing to incomplete data sets, only 1 daily assessment was performed in most patients, and interrater reliability was not assessed.</s><s>Analyses were performed post hoc and results should therefore be regarded as hypothesis generating.</s><s>Fifth, secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing, as these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention.</s><s>Adjustment for clustering within site was not performed because site was a stratification factor for randomization.</s><s>Sixth, the observed rate of septic shock in the placebo group (23%; 95% CI, 17%-30%) was lower than originally presumed for sample size calculation (40%).</s><s>The point estimate of the difference of septic shock occurrences was −1.8% (ie, close to 0) with a 95% CI of −10.7% to 7.2%.</s><s>Hence, the trial gives no indication of a clinically relevant major benefit of hydrocortisone treatment, which it was designed to detect.</s></p></div>
