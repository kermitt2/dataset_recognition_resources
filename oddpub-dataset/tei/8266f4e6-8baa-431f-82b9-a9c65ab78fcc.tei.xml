(2012)</ref> used univariate filters with different thresholds in order to identify a subset of SNPs that were considerably correlated to the neuroimaging data.</s><s>The reduced set of SNPs was further searched for association with the neuroimaging data using two multivariate strategies, penalized Partial Least Squares regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Wold, 1975)</ref> and regularized Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Hotelling, 1936)</ref>.</s><s>The authors showed that a relatively large number of SNPs was needed after filtering in order to comprise all true positives.</s><s>However, to avoid over-fitting, irrelevant SNPs had to be filtered out although the authors did not define a clear threshold for the filters.</s><s>In addition to univariate filtering, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Le Floch et al. (2012)</ref> applied Principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Pearson, 1901)</ref> for dimensionality reduction.</s><s>Specifically, they performed PCA on both the neuroimaging and the SNP data set and kept as many components as necessary to explain 99% of the variance in each modality.</s><s>However, all methods based on PCA failed to identify generalizable associations.</s></p><p><s>PCA-based dimensionality reduction was also conducted in a study by <ref type="bibr">Hibar et al. (2011a,b)</ref>.</s><s>The authors searched for associations between 448,293 genome-wide SNPs and 31,662 whole-brain voxels in a large sample of 731 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI).</s><s>To reduce the total number of tests, SNPs were grouped into 18,044 genes based on gene membership.</s><s>Principal component regression was then implemented to search for the combined effect of multiple SNPs on the brain.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Hibar et al. (2011a,b)</ref> named their technique voxel-wise gene-wide association study (vGeneWAS).</s><s>However, no genes identified were significant after correction for multiple testing.</s></p><p><s>Using the same data set of genome-wide SNPs and wholebrain neuroimaging voxels from the ADNI, in a recent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hua et al. (2015)</ref> performed dimensionality reduction by selecting 119 brain regions of interest based on an anatomical brain atlas.</s><s>Distance covariance <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Székely et al., 2007)</ref> was applied to infer the relationship between the single SNP predictors from the entire genome and the average voxel values at the 119 brain regions, utilized as multivariate response.</s><s>In order to overcome the multiple testing problem, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Hua et al. (2015)</ref> also introduced a local false discovery rate (FDR) modeling algorithm.</s><s>The authors showed that using their method, they were able to find 23,128 significant SNPs at α-level 0.05, while simple linear regression yielded no significant SNPs.</s></p><p><s>As previous studies have shown, dimensionality reduction using univariate filters or PCA solves critical over-fitting issues in genetic neuroimaging applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Le Floch et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, both strategies present major limitations.</s><s>As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Le Floch et al. (2012)</ref>, univariate filters are not the optimal choice, since they can not account for interdependencies between variables.</s><s>The genetic and the neuroimaging variants are, however, naturally highly collinear.</s><s>PCA has two major limitations.</s><s>First, PCA explicitly depends on the input data, since it uses an optimization criterion to transform the original variables into a set of orthogonal principal components <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Goel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sulić et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Second and most importantly, it is computationally expensive, since its runtime is quadratic in the number of dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Menon, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, in genetic neuroimaging, where the data sets may capture the whole brain and the whole genome, respectively, PCA is infeasible in case there is no powerful compute server available in the lab.</s></p><p><s>A dimensionality reduction technique that is computationally efficient is Random projection (RP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Johnson and Lindenstrauss, 1984)</ref>.</s><s>RP uses a random matrix with unit Euclidean column norms to find a lower-dimensional subspace that approximately preserves the distances between all pairs of data points in the original space <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Kaski, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dasgupta, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bingham and Mannila, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lin and Gunopulos, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vempala, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>In a number of data mining and biological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Papadimitriou et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bingham and Mannila, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Goel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sulić et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Liu and Fieguth, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Palmer et al., 2015)</ref>, RP has been shown to provide good results.</s><s>Several studies also compared RP and PCA and showed that their overall performance was comparably similar, while RP had much lower computational requirements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bingham and Mannila, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Goel et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we propose a new approach that uses RP for dimensionality reduction to efficiently assess the relationship between genetic variation and brain imaging measures as an example for high-dimensional genotype-phenotype association problems.</s><s>In particular, we consider Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLSC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(McIntosh et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Tucker, 1958)</ref>, which has been shown to be most appropriate for combined analysis of SNP and neuroimaging data in a systematic comparison of multivariate techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Grellmann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A key limitation of current PLSC implementations is that they are computationally expensive in handling large numbers of variables.</s><s>We therefore incorporate RP into PLSC, and name our new method PLSC-RP.</s><s>Using both simulated and experimental data sets containing whole genome SNPs and whole brain neuroimaging measures, we demonstrate that PLSC-RP provides statistically equivalent results to traditional PLSC.</s><s>However, using PLSC-RP, runtime is reduced from hours to seconds.</s><s>We also provide evidence that dimensionality reduction using RP is data type independent and can thus be applied to both continuous and count data.</s><s>To establish RP for multivariate analysis of high-dimensional genotype-phenotypeassociations is, to our knowledge, a strategy never used before.</s><s>Importantly, compared to previous applications of RP in data mining and biological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Papadimitriou et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bingham and Mannila, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Goel et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sulić et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Liu and Fieguth, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Palmer et al., 2015)</ref>, we had to address two additional problems.</s><s>First, in order to be able to evaluate the contribution of a single genotypic or phenotypic variable, the multivariate associations detected by PLSC-RP must be interpretable in the original spaces after dimensionality reduction.</s><s>In contrast, previous applications exploited RP such that learning, classification or clustering were carried out directly in the compressed domain (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Liu and Fieguth, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Palmer et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Second, in genotype-phenotype association studies, both the genetic and the phenotypic data, are naturally high-dimensional.</s><s>Thus, RP needs to be applied for dimensionality reduction in both domains.</s><s>The PLSC-RP method we introduce in this study is favorable since it fulfills both requirements: the back-transformation of results after dimensionality reduction is straightforward, and it can be applied to reduce the number of both the genetic and phenotypic variables.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we explicitly applied PLSC-RP for efficient assessment of genome-wide and whole-brain relations as an example for high-dimensional association problems.</s><s>However, the application of PLSC-RP is not limited to the combined analysis of brain imaging and genotype data.</s><s>It might be considered for fusion of multimodal biological assays such as genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, for fusion of multimodal brain imaging techniques or, in epidemiological research, for fusion of environmental factors and measures characterizing health status.</s><s>Since PLSC-RP depends on sample size only and is independent of the number of variables, it is especially attractive for large-scale multicenter association studies or other data sharing projects.</s></p></div>
