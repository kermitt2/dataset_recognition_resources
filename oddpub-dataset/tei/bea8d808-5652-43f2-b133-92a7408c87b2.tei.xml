<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Optimal use of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is important for patients to obtain maximal benefits from treatment.</s><s>The pattern of compliance during the first week of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is predictive of longerterm device usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and improving patient experiences with PAP therapy is also likely to influence their willingness to engage with therapy over time.</s></p><p><s>Maintaining good compliance with PAP therapy is important because the effects of this intervention on a number of outcomes have been shown to be dose-dependent, meaning that higher hours of device usage are associated with better therapeutic effects, including: daytime sleepiness [2e6], memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, sleep latency and quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and several cardiovascular parameters <ref type="bibr">[8e11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As a long-term strategy requiring commitment of resources for successful treatment, PAP therapy is ideally suited to management using telemonitoring-based strategies.</s><s>Interest in this approach has increased exponentially over recent years, and there is a growing body of published evidence on the use of telemedicine in patients using PAP therapy.</s><s>Studies to date have used heterogeneous strategies and reported conflicting results <ref type="bibr">[12e18]</ref>.</s><s>However, taken together, available data suggest that telemonitoring-guided support for PAP-treated patients reduces the number of patients terminating therapy, can improve PAP usage, reduce the workload associated with follow-up for care providers, and improve the economic model of treating sleep apnea patients <ref type="bibr">[13e19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite these promising results, there is clearly room for telemedicine-based strategies to further improve compliance and satisfaction with PAP therapy.</s><s>Making patients feel more connected to and engaged with their therapy could possibly increase the likelihood that they will use their device.</s><s>In addition to proactive telemonitoring strategies, tools designed to improve patient engagement with PAP therapy are now available.</s></p><p><s>The current study used big data from a German homecare provider to investigate the effects of adding a real-time feedback patient engagement tool to a proactive telemedicine strategy on adherence to PAP.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Patient population/sample</head><p><s>De-identified study data were retrospectively obtained from the database of a German national home healthcare supplier (ResMed Healthcare Germany).</s><s>Patients were eligible for inclusion who: started PAP therapy (with CPAP, automated positive airway pressure (APAP), bilevel PAP (BPAP) or adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV)) for the first time with this homecare provider between 1 September 2009 and 30 April 2014, with a start date at least 180 days previously; used a nasal mask, nasal pillows or a full face mask as the interface; and had an engagement tool activation date that was within 7 days of the telemonitoring start date.</s><s>Use of telemonitoring (AirView™; ResMed Corp., USA) with a PAP device (AirSense 10 or AirCurve 10; ResMed) was defined as proactive care (control), while the group that had the patient engagement tool (myAir™; ResMed Corp., USA) added to their PAP device telemonitoring-guided management was referred to as the patient engagement group.</s><s>The patient engagement tool was added to telemonitoring when it became available.</s><s>Therefore, patients in this group started PAP treatment later in the assessment period than those in the proactive care group.</s><s>The 180-day period was chosen because it was thought that this would provide representative PAP therapy usage, and it was clinically relevant in the setting where the study was conducted (the German healthcare system requires 6 months of usage data to approve continued device use).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Patient management</head><p><s>The proactive care group was managed using a cloud-based remote monitoring system (AirView™; ResMed) that connected wirelessly with the PAP therapy devices (the first night of using this PAP system was recorded on 11 November 2013).</s><s>The homecare provider telephoned patients if compliance during the first 2 weeks of PAP therapy fell below the required level (&lt;4 h/day).</s><s>For the period from 2 weeks to 6 months, patients were telephoned again if continued periods of no or low usage were identified from telemonitoring data.</s><s>From 6 months of therapy onwards, patients were notified via telephone call or letter if telemonitoring data showed that PAP device usage dropped significantly or did not reach the required threshold (average of 4 h/night).</s><s>When contacted, patients were provided with detailed information on use of their PAP therapy device and management of side effects (eg, upper airway dryness, pressure, etc).</s></p><p><s>The patient engagement group consisted of the first 500 patients to have the patient engagement tool added to telemonitoring-guided care (including the standard homecare provider follow-up) as soon as the new tool became available.</s><s>The patient engagement tool provides patients with information on what their sleep and therapy looked like on the previous night (including a score, summary statistics and charts showing trends over time), coaching tips (including time-based educational tips to increase skills and knowledge, and encouragement messages based on therapy data), and education (including mask fitting, changing humidifier settings, tailored coaching, and tips on how to make therapy more comfortable).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data extraction</head><p><s>A de-identified dataset was retrieved from the German homecare provider database for the purposes of this research.</s><s>Regional ethics committee approval and specific patient consent were not required because German data protection law allows for the use of such data, if strictly anonymous and for scientific purposes.</s></p><p><s>In addition to demographic and clinical data, a number of prespecified variables for each patient were extracted from the database, including the occurrence and time of any therapy termination, device usage frequency, and sleep-disordered breathing indices (including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), apnea index (AI), hypopnea index (HI) and leak).</s><s>The healthcare provider database that was queried included less information than a full electronic medical record, and therefore data on some parameters (eg, device used for screening/diagnosis, sleep apnea severity and comorbidities) were not available.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Outcomes</head><p><s>The primary outcome measure was the proportion of nights with CPAP usage of !4 h (categorical variable), based on the usage level required by the German healthcare system for continued prescription/funding of CPAP after 6 months.</s><s>Secondary endpoints were other measures of device usage over the first 180 days of therapy, and sleep apnea parameters.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Data analysis</head><p><s>Propensity scores were used to match patients in the patient engagement group with similar individuals from the proactive care group (1:1 ratio).</s><s>Scores were calculated using a logistic regression model that predicted whether the patient used the patient engagement tool or not, using baseline patient characteristics.</s><s>Baseline variables used in the propensity model were: sex, age at start of therapy, first device type, first mask type and insurance type (public vs private).</s><s>A sample size calculation was performed for the primary outcome "proportion of nights with PAP device usage of !4 h".</s><s>It was calculated that a sample size of 493 would provide 80% power to detect a mean of paired differences of 3.3, with an estimated standard deviation of differences of 32.0 and a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided Wilcoxon test, assuming that the actual distribution was double exponential.</s><s>Data were approximately normally distributed according to the central limit theorem.</s><s>Differences between the patient engagement group and the corresponding patients in the proactive care group were analyzed using a paired samples t-test.</s><s>For categorical variables the McNemar's test was applied.</s><s>In general, p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</s><s>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 22 and R version 3.0.2</s><s>(IBM, USA).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Patient population</head><p><s>The patient engagement group comprised the first 500 consecutive patients using the patient engagement tool in addition to telemonitoring-guided care, matched with the same number of patients managed with telemonitoring alone (proactive care).</s><s>All patients met all other inclusion criteria, including start date of therapy, known gender, start date of first mask, and having !180 days since the first telemonitoring.</s><s>A CONSORT diagram showing the patient selection pathway is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Patient demographic and clinical data at baseline are detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Primary endpoint</head><p><s>The proportion of nights with PAP device usage of !4 h was 77 ± 25% in the patient engagement group compared with 63 ± 32% in the proactive care group (between-group difference 14%; p &lt; 0.001) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Secondary endpoints</head><p><s>The proportion of patients who terminated therapy in the first 180 days was 3.4% (n ¼ 17) in the proactive care group compared with 0.6% (n ¼ 3) in the patient engagement group (p &lt; 0.001, McNemar's test).</s><s>These values refer to the proportion of patients who returned their device to the homecare provider, and represent the most extreme form of non-adherence (rather than just poor compliance).</s></p><p><s>Positive airway pressure device usage was consistently and significantly higher in the patient engagement group compared with the proactive care group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), and the proportion of patients with higher levels of device usage (!5 h/night) was significantly greater in the patient engagement group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In addition, those in the patient engagement group were significantly less likely to have usage of &lt;2 h/night (6% vs 23% in the proactive care group; p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>When patients were stratified by type of first mask, device usage remained consistently higher in the patient engagement versus proactive care group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>In addition, patients in the patient engagement group who started with a nasal or nasal pillows mask used significantly fewer masks than similar patients in the proactive care group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Sleep apnea parameters were similar in the two groups, apart from leak, which was significantly higher in the proactive care group overall (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), and when the first mask was a nasal or full face mask (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>This analysis of a large cohort of patients being managed under routine clinical practice conditions showed that the addition of a patient engagement tool was associated with a significant improvement in device usage in patients receiving PAP therapy for the first time, irrespective of the interface used.</s><s>Increases were seen in both the hours of device use each night and the number of days with device usage.</s><s>In addition, there was a significant reduction in leak in patients managed using a patient engagement approach compared with proactive care (telemonitoring alone).</s><s>In this analysis, both groups of patients should have had the same attitude to connected health and be equally motivated about their healthcare because all had signed up for telemonitoring.</s><s>The addition of the patient engagement tool in some patients was based on availability of the technology rather than any patient-specific factors.</s><s>Potential explanations for the observation of better device usage during use of the patient engagement tool include better education and feedback in this group compared with standard care.</s></p><p><s>On their own, telemonitoring approaches (proactive care in the current study) have been shown to be useful in facilitating the management of patients receiving PAP therapy.</s><s>Several studies</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gender known N=12,874</head><p><s>The addition of a patient engagement tool adds another level to telemonitoring.</s><s>Focusing on patient engagement recognizes that patients have an important role to play in their own healthcare.</s><s>Patients can get involved by increasing their health literacy (accessing, understanding and implementing health information), and via shared decision-making with their healthcare professional <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The patient engagement tool used in the current study contributed to health literacy in several different ways.</s><s>Patients were provided with specific information about their sleep, device use and therapy-related factors, received education to increase skills and knowledge, and were sent personalized coaching information.</s><s>Features such as encouragement messages and the ability of patients to change their behavior based on available information could contribute to making patients feel like they have a role in decisions about their therapy.</s></p><p><s>Reasons why the addition of the patient engagement tool might have been associated with increased device usage in the current study are as follows.</s><s>First, due to the lack of randomization, it is possible that patients who chose to use the patient engagement tool might have been more motivated to improve their health, meaning that patient characteristics contributed to the observed effect, as has been previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The significant reduction in leak seen in the patient engagement group could have contributed to better acceptance of, and therefore better compliance with, PAP therapy given that air leak has been reported to reduce compliance with CPAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Also, the use of real-time feedback could help to keep patients actively engaged with their therapy, and remind and motivate them to use their device.</s></p><p><s>The findings of a meta-analysis of the limited number of published studies investigating patient engagement strategies suggested a link between the use of engagement interventions and improved outcomes of patients with chronic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>It was noted that specific behavioral targets and tracking of these targets over time are essential components of an effective patient engagement strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Ideal characteristics of a tool include technologies that facilitate the input of real-time clinical data and allow real-time responses that incorperate personalized recommendations based on the data received <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>These features are included in the patient engagement tool used in the current study.</s></p><p><s>One challenge in this field will be consistent definition and application of patient engagement technology.</s><s>A standardized and well-validated measure of engagement has been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>This might be useful in refining patient engagement tools for future research, ensuring that four key features are met: (1) the patient believes that they have an important role to play in their healthcare; (2) the patient is provided with the confidence and knowledge to take action; (3) the patient takes action to maintain and improve their health; and (4) the patient persists with the program even during times of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Two randomized, controlled trials have investigated internetbased patient engagement tools for the management of patients with diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Both reported significant reductions in decreased glycosylated hemoglobin levels (indicating improved metabolic control), but neither included the level of real-time patient feedback offered by the tool used in the study.</s><s>Also in diabetes, improving patient engagement via text messaging to encourage physical activity was associated with improved outcomes, including increased exercise and better glycemic control <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Even the beneficial effects of pharmacological antihyperglycemic therapy have been shown to be improved when combined with active patient engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One of the strengths of this study was its large sample size.</s><s>Another was that patients were treated in a real-world setting that was broadly applicable to clinical practice, at least in healthcare settings similar to the one where the study was performed.</s><s>However, this was a non-randomized study, making it susceptible to bias.</s><s>Propensity score matching was used to minimize bias, but the effects of other unrecognized confounding variables (eg, socioeconomic status, education level, health literacy) cannot be ruled out.</s><s>As mentioned above, selection bias may have been present, given that patients were self-selected into the patient engagement group.</s><s>Nevertheless, compliance in the proactive care group was more than adequate, suggesting that all patients were well managed.</s><s>Patients in the current study were not randomized to the different monitoring strategies, instead the patient engagement group consisted of the first 500 patients managed using the new patient engagement tool, which was not available when some patients in the proactive care group started PAP therapy.</s><s>This introduced the possibility of time course bias, and it is therefore possible that the results were due to an improvement in patient care over   time rather than a result of the different patient management approach.</s></p><p><s>Although increasing PAP adherence by 1 h has been shown to have a clinically meaningful impact on relevant clinical endpoints, such as blood pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">30]</ref>, it is unclear from the current study whether the higher PAP usage seen in the patient engagement group would translate into better patient outcomes.</s><s>Future research should focus on linking increased PAP device usage achieved via the use of patient engagement tools to specific clinical endpoints and patient outcomes, and on the potential for increased patient engagement to reduce healthcare resource use.</s></p></div>
