<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Etrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the b7 integrin subunit that has shown efficacy vs placebo in patients with moderate to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).</s><s>Patients with colon tissues that expressed high levels of the integrin aE gene (ITGAE) appeared to have the best response.</s><s>We compared differences in colonic expression of ITGAE and other genes between patients who achieved clinical remission with etrolizumab vs those who did.</s><s>METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from 110 patients with UC who participated in a phase 2 placebo-controlled trial of etrolizumab, as well as from 21 patients with UC or without inflammatory bowel disease (controls) enrolled in an observational study at a separate site.</s><s>Colon biopsies were collected from patients in both studies and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling.</s><s>Mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry.</s><s>We identified biomarkers associated with response to etrolizumab.</s><s>In the placebo-controlled trial, clinical remission was defined as total Mayo Clinic Score 2, with no individual subscore &gt;1, and mucosal healing was defined as endoscopic score 1. RESULTS: Colon tissues collected at baseline from patients who had a clinical response to etrolizumab expressed higher levels of T-cellÀassociated genes than patients who did not respond (P &lt; .05).</s><s>Colonic CD4 þ integrin aE þ cells from patients with UC expressed higher levels of granzyme A messenger RNA (GZMA mRNA) than CD4 þ aE À cells (P &lt; .0001);</s><s>granzyme A and integrin aE protein were detected in the same cells.</s><s>Of patients receiving 100 mg etrolizumab, a higher proportion of those with high levels of GZMA mRNA (41%) or ITGAE mRNA (38%) than those with low levels of GZMA (6%) or ITGAE mRNA (13%) achieved clinical remission (P &lt; .05)</s><s>and mucosal healing (41% GZMA high vs 19% GZMA low and 44% ITGAE high vs 19% ITGAE low ).</s><s>Compared with ITGAE low and GZMA low patients, patients with ITGAE high and GZMA high had higher baseline numbers of epithelial cryptassociated integrin aE þ cells (P &lt; .01 for both), but a smaller number of crypt-associated integrin aE þ cells after etrolizumab treatment (P &lt; .05</s><s>for both).</s><s>After 10 weeks of etrolizumab treatment, expression of genes associated with T-cell activation and genes encoding inflammatory cytokines decreased by 40%À80% from baseline (P &lt; .05) in patients with colon tissues expressing high levels of GZMA at baseline.</s><s>CONCLUSIONS: Levels of GZMA and ITGAE mRNAs in colon tissues can identify patients with UC who are most likely to benefit from etrolizumab; expression levels decrease with etrolizumab administration in biomarker high patients.</s><s>Larger, prospective studies of markers are needed to assess their clinical value.</s></p><p><s>U lcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon.</s><s>Current therapies, such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies, are not universally effective at induction and maintenance of remission, 1 with z25% of patients requiring colectomy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>This variable response to treatment and disease progression may reflect significant heterogeneity in disease pathobiology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>Improved stratification driven by patient heterogeneity may help guide choice of therapeutic intervention and enhance efficacy and safety.</s></p><p><s>The integrin-dependent migration and retention of leukocytes to the gut plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Subsets of immune cells, including B cells, naïve and gut homing T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, stimulated macrophages, monocytes, and eosinophils 7 express a4b7 to mediate binding to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAd-CAM-1) on high endothelial venules of Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and postcapillary venules of gut lamina propria (LP). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Interaction of a4b7 with MAdCAM-1 mediates the extravasation of naïve and activated leukocytes from blood to gut-associated lymphoid tissues and the LP.</s><s>Increased MAdCAM-1 expression has been reported in active UC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Recent studies that show induction of clinical remission in UC patients after immunoblockade of leukocyte trafficking support the importance of leukocyte homing in disease pathobiology.</s><s><ref type="bibr">10À12</ref> b7 integrin can also heterodimerize with aE integrin to mediate binding to E-cadherin expressed on epithelial cells.</s><s>The aEb7 integrin is expressed on subsets of T cells, dendritic cells, mast cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> innate lymphoid cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and tumorinfiltrating NK cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Within the gut, the interaction between aEb7 and E-cadherin enables retention of lymphocytes in the intraepithelial compartment.</s><s>More than 90% of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and a minority of LP lymphocytes express aEb7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>The proportion of mucosal T cells that express aE was higher in intestinal tissues compared with other organs, such as the lungs and spleen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>E expression has been shown to enhance IEL activation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> promote antitumor cytotoxicity of T lymphocytes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and modulate cell motility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>he understanding of the role of aEb7 integrin in both IEL and LP cells in the gut is evolving.</s><s>In murine studies, IELs can act as effector memory T cells to protect the epithelium from pathogens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>There is emerging evidence that aEb7 þ cells may play a pathogenic role in the gut, and aberrant activation of aEb7 þ cells may contribute to inflammation and pathobiology of UC (unpublished data, 2014).</s><s>aEb7 þ memory CD8 þ T cells with the capacity to produce proinflammatory cytokines are highly enriched in the gut compared with other tissues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>aE þ CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells from UC patients, but not control subjects, have an effector phenotype with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines compared with controls (unpublished data, 2014).</s><s>aE þ cells from the gut also have high levels of perforin and granzyme A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> aE þ intraepithelial type 1 innate lymphoid cells were also found to be increased in patients with Crohn's disease and contribute to the inflammatory process in anti-CD40Àinduced murine colitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Consistent with this, anti-aE treatment has been shown to attenuate experimental colitis in mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>trolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the b7 integrin subunit, blocks both a4b7:MAdCAM-1 and aEb7:E-cadherin interactions to reduce homing of leukocytes to the gut mucosa and retention of lymphocytes in the intraepithelial compartment, respectively.</s><s>A recent phase 2 study of etrolizumab demonstrated efficacy relative to placebo in patients with moderate to severely active UC.</s><s>Subsequent analyses of these data indicated that patients with high aE gene expression or aE þ cell numbers in baseline colonic biopsies might have increased benefit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>In the current study, we evaluated baseline differences in colonic gene expression between patients who achieved clinical remission with etrolizumab in the phase 2 study compared with those who did not to identify additional predictive biomarkers of response.</s><s>The relationship of these genes with etrolizumab therapeutic efficacy was then evaluated.</s></p></div>
