<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>RESPONSE is an international, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study.</s><s>The study design and primary analysis results have been described previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref></s><s>Briefly, eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ruxolitinib (10 mg twice daily) or best available therapy (single-agent therapy deemed most appropriate by treating physician).</s><s>Treatment options for best available therapy included hydroxyurea, interferon or pegylated interferon, pipobroman, anagrelide, immunomodulators (e.g.</s><s>lenalidomide, thalidomide), or observation without pharmacologic treatment (except aspirin).</s><s>Dose adjustments were permitted for safety and efficacy in patients receiving ruxolitinib; modifications could be made to best available therapy regimens for lack of response or side effects requiring treatment discontinuation.</s><s>Low-dose aspirin was administered to all patients unless contraindicated.</s><s>Phlebotomies as monotherapy or in combination with study treatment were mandatory for patients with a confirmed hematocrit &gt;45% that was ≥3 percentage points higher than baseline or a confirmed hematocrit &gt;48%, whichever were lower.</s><s>Patients randomized to best available therapy were permitted to cross over to ruxolitinib at Week 32 if the primary endpoint was not met or after Week 32 following signs of disease progression (i.e.</s><s>phlebotomy eligibility or splenomegaly progression).</s><s>The study was approved by the central ethics committee or institutional review board at each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; all patients provided written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoints</head><p><s>The primary analysis occurred when all patients completed the Week 48 visit or discontinued; the current preplanned analysis occurred when all patients completed the Week 80 visit or discontinued.</s><s>The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving both (1) hematocrit control without phlebotomy (defined as no phlebotomy eligibility between Weeks 8 and 32 with ≤1 phlebotomy eligibility from randomization to Week 8; phlebotomy eligibility was defined as hematocrit &gt;45% and ≥3 percentage points higher than baseline or &gt;48%, whichever were lower) and (2) ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume (as measured by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) at Week 32.</s><s>Complete hematologic remission (CHR; defined as hematocrit control, platelet count ≤400×10 9 /L, and white blood cell count ≤10×10 9 /L) was a key secondary endpoint.</s></p><p><s>Because most patients randomized to best available therapy crossed over to receive ruxolitinib at or immediately after Week 32, long-term comparisons between study treatment arms were no longer appropriate.</s><s>Therefore, this analysis evaluated the durability of efficacy in patients originally randomized to the ruxolitinib arm and in those who received ruxolitinib after crossover, including durability of the primary response, hematocrit control, spleen volume reduction, and CHR.</s><s>Patient-reported outcomes were not collected after Week 32, with the exception of the endof-study visit for patients who discontinued; therefore, these data are not summarized.</s></p><p><s>Adverse events are reported regardless of causality and not limited to those considered to be related to treatment; serious adverse events and deaths are also reported.</s><s>Adverse event data from the 80-week analysis are reported for patients originally randomized to the ruxolitinib arm, patients who received ruxolitinib after crossover (i.e.</s><s>all randomized to the best available therapy arm and received ≥1 dose of ruxolitinib after crossover), and patients who received best available therapy.</s></p><p><s>Please see the Online Supplementary Section for details concerning exploratory and statistical analyses included in this report.</s></p></div>
