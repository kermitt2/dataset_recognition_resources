better approaches for avoiding ACD recurrence and episodic exacerbation are needed.</s></p><p><s>Our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the sensitization to allergens, the response to allergen exposure, and the resolution of inflammation in ACD patients is largely shaped by the results of mouse studies of contact hypersensitivity (CHS).</s><s>In these CHS studies, mice are sensitized and then challenged with an experimental allergen (e.g., oxazolone [OXA] or dinitrofluorobenzene [DNFB]) by topical application to the skin.</s><s>For example, CHS studies revealed the role of TLR signaling in the sensitization phase and the importance of several T cell subsets, as well as dermal dendritic cells, for the inflammatory response to allergen challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the vast majority of CHS studies are acute CHS studies (i.e., limited to investigations of the sensitization phase and the acute inflammatory response to a single allergen challenge).</s><s>A few CHS studies used continued repeated allergen exposure to investigate the mechanisms of subchronic CHS <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, and all of them were limited to a few weeks of allergen exposure.</s><s>There are no models or studies of chronic CHS (CCHS; i.e., repeated chronic allergen challenge over several months); as a consequence, the mechanisms of CCHS and ACD remain ill-defined.</s></p><p><s>Mast cells (MCs) are tissue-resident effector cells of innate immune responses to pathogens and IgE-mediated allergic inflammatory reactions.</s><s>Two independent lines of evidence suggest that MCs may play important roles in the episodic exacerbation of chronic ACD and CCHS.</s><s>First, MCs are predominantly located in organs that border our environment (e.g., airways, intestine, and skin).</s><s>Large numbers of MCs are present in skin areas that are frequently exposed to contact allergens and that are predilection sites of ACD, such as the hands and the face <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Also, chronically affected skin sites of ACD patients show markedly increased numbers of MCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Second, MCs were reported to promote acute CHS responses to a single allergen challenge in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, although not all <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>MCs also were demonstrated to limit and reduce acute CHS responses to a single allergen challenge in one study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> but not another <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of our study was to better characterize the mechanisms that drive and control CCHS to better understand chronic responses in ACD.</s><s>To this end, we developed and used a murine model of CCHS, which mimics the recurrent sporadic allergen encounters that occur in ACD patients and lead to pronounced episodic exacerbation and persistence of their condition.</s><s>This CCHS model, which involves repeated OXA challenges in sensitized mice every 30 d over several months, was applied to genetically MC-deficient mice and normal control mice to identify and characterize the relevance and role of MCs in CCHS.</s></p></div>

to the dLNs and to the spleen and by controlling CD4 +  The Journal of Immunology T cells via IL-2.</s><s>In our chronic CHS study, cutaneous MCs at sites of allergen challenge control CHS by effects on T RM cells.</s><s>In both studies, MCs protect from allergic inflammation induced by repeated allergen challenge.</s><s>The differences in the mechanisms involved may reflect differences in the models used or point to the involvement of multiple mechanisms in MC-mediated suppression of allergic skin inflammation, which may change in relevance as CHS progresses from acute to subchronic to chronic.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first CHS study to use two independent MC-deficient mouse models showing very similar results.</s><s>In both MC-deficient mice, CCHS inflammation was significantly more pronounced than in WT mice, but only Sash mice, and not Cre + mice, showed skin scaling and necrosis at CCHS sites.</s><s>The most likely explanation for this is that the MC-depleted Cre + mice contain more skin MCs than Sash mice.</s><s>Under noninflammatory conditions, the depletion efficiency of skin MCs in Cre + mice is .90%</s><s>(12) (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>).</s><s>However, in CCHS we found only a 75% reduction in skin MCs in Cre + mice compared with a .90%</s><s>reduction in Sash mice (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that the depleting effect of DT is counteracted by the accumulation of local skin MCs, probably triggered by the induction of local inflammation.</s><s>In line with this, WT mice  showed MC activation (degranulation) and MC accumulation at CCHS skin sites (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The key findings that led us to explore the importance of CD8 + T RM cells for MC-mediated suppression of CCHS were that Th1 cytokine levels and numbers of CD8 + T cells at CCHS skin sites were increased in the absence of MCs.</s><s>The critical role of these Ag-specific T RM cells is underlined by the outcome of our extensive characterization of CCHS skin infiltrates and our depletion experiments that, taken together, indicate that MCs control CCHS by controlling CD8 + T RM cells at sites of allergen challenge.</s><s>MC-deficient mice showed higher numbers of adoptively transferred and endogenously generated CD8 + T RM cells.</s><s>This suggests that MCs may limit the recruitment of CD8 + T RM cells to the skin sites of CCHS and/or limit their generation in the dLNs.</s><s>Gaide et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> recently demonstrated the relevance of Ag-specific expansion of T RM cells in ACD, as well as in DNFB-induced CHS, in mice.</s><s>Because TGF-b, IL-7, and IL-15 are known to be secreted locally in the skin and required for the maintenance of cutaneous CD8 + T RM cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, we analyzed these cytokines in our CCHS model and found higher IL-15 levels in the ear skin of MC-deficient Sash mice compared  with controls.</s><s>Furthermore, we found that chymase and CPAs are able to degrade IL-15 in vitro, as also shown earlier for several other cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>MCs are the sole source of chymase and CPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, but the effects of other CPA-secreting cells cannot be ruled out.</s><s>However, it seems that MCs may impair the survival or proliferation of skin CD8 + T RM cells in CCHS by contributing to the reduced local levels of IL-15, which is believed to be the mechanism that decreases the availability of IL-15 in situ <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, our present findings and the ability of IL-15 to suppress chymase activity that was reported earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> point to a novel feedback loop that regulates the levels of IL-15 and chymase.</s><s>In addition to the possible enzymatic degradation of IL-15, MCs have a high expression of IL-15Rs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>, are highly responsive to IL-15 in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and, under in vitro conditions, consume large amounts of IL-15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>However, the effects of MCs on other cells producing IL-15 (e.g., mononuclear cells) (34) cannot be ruled out.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we show that the increased accumulation of CD8 + T RM cells in the skin of MC-deficient mice results in exacerbated inflammation upon repeated allergen challenge.</s><s>This supports an immunoregulatory function for cutaneous MCs and encourages the further study of this role of MCs in T RM cell-mediated diseases, such as ACD or psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>.</s><s>Approaches that increase local skin MC numbers or enhance their functions could limit or reduce the exacerbation of
