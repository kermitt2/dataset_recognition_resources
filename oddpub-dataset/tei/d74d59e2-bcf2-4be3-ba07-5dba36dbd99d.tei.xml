<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FMD Cycles Reduce Disease Severity in the MOG 35-55 -Induced EAE Model</head><p><s>We examined the effects of 3 cycles of a very-low-calorie and low-protein FMD lasting 3 days every 7 days or a KD continued for 30 days in EAE-induced by active immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 (MOG 35-55 ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Groups of mice were treated semi-therapeutically (EAE FMD (S), where FMD treatment started after 10% of the immunized population showed signs of EAE) or therapeutically (EAE FMD (T), where FMD treatment started after all of the immunized population showed signs of EAE).</s><s>FMD and KD treatment decreased disease severity compared to that in the control group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>However, the FMD reduced the mean severity score to 1, whereas a KD reduced the severity score to 2 at the later stages (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>In the EAE FMD (S) group, FMD treatment not only delayed the onset of disease but also lowered the incidence rate (100% versus 45.6%; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>In the EAE FMD (T) group, FMD cycles completely reversed the severity score to 0 in 21.7% of the cohort (no observable signs; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) and reduced the severity score to &lt;0.5 in &gt;50% of mice (12 out of 23 mice; Fig- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">ure 1E</ref>).</s><s>To address whether the FMD cycles also have beneficial effects in chronic EAE models that have established disease, we initiated FMD treatment 2 weeks after the initial signs of EAE were observed (EAE CTRL-FMD).</s><s>Prior to treatment, the control diet EAE group (EAE CTRL) and EAE CTRL-FMD cohorts had similar severity scores (3.19 ± 0.52 versus 3.30 ± 0.27; day 24).</s><s>After three FMD cycles, we observed a significant reduction in severity score in the EAE CTRL-FMD cohort compared to the EAE CTRL cohort (3.3 ± 0.57 versus 2.1 ± 0.89; day 42; p &lt; 0.05; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</s><s>As infiltration of immune cells and demyelination are histopathological hallmarks of EAE and MS, spinal cord sections from control and FMD(T) mice were stained with H&amp;E to visualize infiltrating immune cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>) or solochrome cyanine to visualize myelin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>).</s><s>To assess demyelination and axonal damage, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against myelin basic protein (MBP) or dephosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI-32; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1I</ref>).</s><s>At day 3, levels of infiltrating immune cells and demyelination were similar in the EAE CTRL and EAE FMD groups (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J and S1H</ref>).</s><s>At day 14, sections of EAE CTRL mice displayed severe immune cell infiltration corresponding to demyelinated lesions, reduced MBP expression, and increased SMI-32 expression (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J-1M</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, sections of EAE FMD mice at day 14 displayed significantly reduced immune cell infiltration and demyelination (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J-1M</ref>).</s><s>Although MBP staining showed no significant difference between EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice at day 14 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1L</ref>), neurofilament dephosphorylation in EAE FMD mice was reduced compared to EAE CTRL mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1M</ref>).</s><s>Overall, these results suggest that FMD cycles reduce EAE disease severity in part by reducing inflammation and preventing demyelination and axonal damage.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FMD Cycles Reduce Infiltration of Immune Cells in the Spinal Cord</head><p><s>To investigate the capacity of FMD cycles to reduce potential autoimmune T cells, we measured circulating white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes in naive, EAE CTRL, EAE FMD, and EAE FMD:RF (measured 4 days after returning to a standard ad lib diet) mice after three cycles of the FMD regimen (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>The FMD resulted in a temporary 40%-50% reduction in total WBCs, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes.</s><s>Upon returning to the standard ad lib diet (EAE FMD:RF), all complete blood counts (CBCs) returned to either naive or lower levels than those observed in the EAE CTRL, with the exception of granulocytes, indicating that the FMD cycles cause both WBC death and regeneration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Next, we measured the inflammatory markers associated with EAE pathophysiology.</s><s>Day 3 and day 14 spinal cord sections of the EAE CTRL mice were extensively populated with CD11b + cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>However, at day 14, the EAE FMD mice displayed a 75% reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in spinal cord-associated CD11b + cells compared to mice on the control diet (11.7% versus 2.8%; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Since myelin-specific effector T cells migrate into the CNS and initiate demyelination, we investigated the accumulation of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in the spinal cord.</s><s>A large number of CD4 + T cells were detected in the white matter of spinal cord sections from the control diet cohort (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the FMD-treated cohort displayed a &gt;4-fold reduction (p &lt; 0.01) in CD4 + T cells at day 3 (8.6%</s><s>versus 1.5%; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>) compared to the control diet cohort, which remained lower even at day 14.</s><s>The FMD group also had reduced CD8 + T cells (day 3: 1.3% versus 0.4%; p &lt; 0.01; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>) compared to the control diet group.</s><s>To investigate whether the FMD affects APCs, we isolated splenocytes from EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice at day 3, stained them for CD11c and F4/80, and characterized them by flow cytometry.</s><s>We observed a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in CD11c + dendritic cells in the EAE FMD cohort compared to the EAE CTRL cohort (3.08% ± 0.70% versus 1.46% ± 0.31%), but we did not observe any changes in the number of F4/80 + macrophage cells in the control or FMDtreated groups (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E and S2B</ref>).</s><s>To determine the effects of the FMD treatment on T cell infiltration in the spinal cord, we measured T cell activation levels.</s><s>The number of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells in EAE CTRL and EAE FMD mice was similar (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C and S2D</ref>), but the ratio of splenic naive (CD44 low ) to activated (CD44 high ) CD4 + T cells was increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the FMD group compared to the control group (1.95 versus 3.67; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>No difference in CD8 + T cells was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the total number of effector (CD44 high and CD62L low ) T cells was reduced in the FMD compared to the control group, but the ratio of effector (CD44 high and CD62L low ) to memory T (CD44 high and CD62L high ) cells did not change .</s><s>These results indicate that FMD cycles reduce the number of dendritic cells and increase the relative number of naive T cells, which may explain the reduced autoimmunity caused by the FMD.</s></p></div>
