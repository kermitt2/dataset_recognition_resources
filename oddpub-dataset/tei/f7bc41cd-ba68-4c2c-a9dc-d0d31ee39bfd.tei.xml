<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data processing</head><p><s>Datasets for WGCNA related to osteosarcoma were obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) with accessing number GSE12512.</s><s>The combined dataset consists of 22 samples.</s><s>We firstly mapped the array probes to their respective gene IDs by using the array annotations.</s><s>Probes matching multiple genes were removed from the dataset, and then, we calculated the average expression values of genes measured by multiple probes.</s><s>A proper threshold was settled based on the amount of genes filtered out.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Co-expression networks and modules</head><p><s>The influence of power value on the scale independence and mean connectivity were analyzed by using the function softConnectivity in WGCNA package.</s><s>The "randomly selected genes" parameter was set as 5000; other parameters' set was default.</s><s>The power parameter was pre-calculated with the function pickSoft-Threshold in WGCNA.</s><s>In this function, an appropriate soft-thresholding power for network construction was provided by calculating the scale-free topology fit index of several powers.</s><s>That is, if the scale-free topology fit index for the reference dataset exceeded 0.8 for low powers (&lt; 30), then the topology of the network is scale-free without batch effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Next, we summarized the expression values by using the function collapseRows in the R package.</s><s>Cluster analysis was subsequently performed by flashClust <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The interactions (correlations) of each module was analyzed and visualized by heat map.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hub genes and the functional annotations</head><p><s>We performed a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for top 5 modules with most genes by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Functional enrichment analysis of the hub genes were carried out at GO terms and KEGG pathways (p &lt; 0.05) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>Before assigning enrichment score for each cluster to make interpretation of the results more straightforward, functional annotation clustering combines single category with a significant overlap in gene content.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-processing of the osteosarcoma datasets</head><p><s>To generate gene co-expression networks, the raw gene expression of osteosarcoma datasets were downloaded from the GEO data repository (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).</s><s>The combined dataset (GSE12512) contained a total of 22 classic OS samples (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?</s><s>acc=GSE12512), and the microarray platform is GPL7192.</s><s>Then, we identically pre-processed the raw data from every microarray dataset for background correction and normalization.</s><s>Firstly, probes matching multiple genes were removed out from these datasets, and secondly, the average expression value of gene measured by multiple probes was calculated as the final expression value.</s><s>Finally, we identify in total 19,015 genes that were expressed.</s><s>Hereafter, we plotted the relation of gene numbers and gene expression values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and found that the lowest value is 6.9 and the highest is 14.8.</s><s>Since the WGCNA was restricted to 3600 genes, we chose the genes of which expression values are larger than 9.</s><s>In total, 2228 genes were filtered out based on the requirement, which processed 11.7% of the total gene amount.</s></p><p><s>The 2228 genes were further investigated as input for hierarchical clustering analysis, which was performed with the function flashClust.</s><s>We found that these 22 samples mainly yielded two clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>), where GSM314346, GSM314348, GSM314349, GSM314352, and GSM314355 became one cluster; the other 17 samples yielded the other one.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of gene co-expression networks and modules</head><p><s>The choice of the soft-thresholding power is necessary to construct a WGCNA, to which co-expression similarity is raised to calculate adjacency.</s><s>Prior to WGCNA conducted to further study the 2228 genes obtained from the 22 samples discussed above, we first performed the analysis of network topology for various softthresholding powers in order to have relative balanced scale independence and mean connectivity of the WGCNA.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, power 4, the lowest power for which the scale-free topology fit index reaches 0.90, was chosen to produce a hierarchical clustering tree (dendrogram) of the 2228 genes (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Seven modules were generated and labeled 1-7 from largest to smallest.</s><s>The largest module contained 838 genes, while the smallest contains 318 genes, and averagely, each module contained 318 genes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation between each modules</head><p><s>Based on the network heatmap plot, each module showed independent validation to each other.</s><s>Therefore, we calculate and cluster the eigengenes of entire modules on their correlations to further quantify coexpression similarity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4a</ref>).</s><s>These seven modules yielded two main clusters; one contained two modules, while the other contained the other five modules which can also be divided into three sub-clusters.</s><s>This result was also supported by the heatmap plot of the adjacencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4b</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional enrichment and clustering analysis</head><p><s>Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for the first five largest network modules was performed by using the Database for Annotation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://david.abcc.</s><s>ncifcrf.gov/).</s><s>Supported by the network heatmap plot, each module had great difference with each other.</s><s>Genes in module 1 were mainly enriched in cell cycle and negative regulation of cellular protein, especially protein ubiquitination, modules 2 and 4 were enriched in translation process, and module 3 was enriched in energy synthesis while module 5 was enriched in antigen processing and immune response.</s></p><p><s>To verify the result of GO enrichment analysis, KEGG pathways were analyzed on the same modules (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The first four modules were enriched in proteasome (module 1), ribosome (modules 2 and 4), and cell signaling and lysosome (module 4), while the module 5 was enriched in antigen processing, which is in consistence with GO result.</s><s>Therefore, we speculated that the module 5, antigen process and immune response, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The main objective for this study was to utilize a global approach to construct a gene co-expression network that predicts clusters of candidate genes involved in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.</s><s>We hypothesized that tightly co-expressed gene modules with common functional annotation would be able Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Clustering of genes together with assigned module colors.</s><s>The dissimilarity was based on topological overlap.</s><s>The y-axis is the distance determined by the extent of topological overlap to predict gene sets that underlies a given biological process.</s></p><p><s>WGCNA is a relatively novel statistical approach based on gene correlations and has been used not only to construct gene networks and detect modules/ sub-networks, but also to identify hub genes and select candidate genes as biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Usually, module detection in WGCNA needs a knowledgeindependent process.</s><s>However, selection of a threshold for culling the network to limit noise would probably rely on empirical judgment and functional annotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, WGCNA can only provide a set of hub genes instead of specific genes related to the background, such as osteosarcoma in this study.</s><s>Therefore, further studies should be carried out to narrow down the gene targets.</s><s>Such as RMT method, this lies in its ability to automatically localize the noise-to-signal threshold instead of using empirical judgment or annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, construction of mutant will also help to understand the role of one or more specific genes in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.</s></p><p><s>Here, WGCNA was applied to investigate 2228 genes of 22 samples that were compromised from a dataset obtained from NCBI, and seven modules were yielded.</s><s>According to correlation study by network heatmap plot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>), all the modules have almost no correlation with each other.</s><s>GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were performed to further study the biological functions of genes enriched in five largest modules.</s><s>Both GO and KEGG showed that, in consistence with correlation study, no module is involved in the same functions/pathways with each other (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>Modules 1-4 were involved in protein ubiquitination, translation process, energy synthesis, etc.</s><s>But interestingly, the genes in module 5 were consistently involved in antigen and immune system in both GO and KEGG result.</s></p><p><s>Endo Munoz et al. have reported that OS are characterized by an early deregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and suggest that patient prognosis is determined early in tumor development and that enhancing antigen presentation may be clinically valuable in treating OS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, several immune molecules, such as cytotoxic T cell lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and CD40 (TNF  receptor superfamily 5), have targeted clinically in osteosarcoma.</s><s>It was discovered that they can break the immune tolerance in tumor <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we suggested the genes in module 5 might play a key role in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and thereby provide potential targets for treating OS.</s></p></div>
