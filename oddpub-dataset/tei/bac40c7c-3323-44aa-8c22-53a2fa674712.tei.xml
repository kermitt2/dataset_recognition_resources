type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>COPD is characterized by a not-fully reversible airflow limitation, which is usually progressive and associated with chronic inflammatory and immune responses of the lungs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>COPD not only causes high mortality but also affects disability, healthrelated quality of life, and economic burden, which is further enhanced by COPD exacerbation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>The foremost pathological component of COPD is emphysematous lung destruction resulting from pathological processes initiated by cigarette smoke (CS) in most cases.</s><s>Emphysema pathogenesis involves activation of a complex network of various inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes (CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and B cells) organized into follicles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Additionally, oxidative stress, extracellular matrix proteases such as MMP-12, and alveolar cell apoptosis also contribute to alveolar destruction in emphysema. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>phingolipids are constituents of cellular membranes implicated in cellular homeostasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Notably, ceramide, a common sphingolipid structural component, plays a central role in the sphingolipid signaling pathway mediating or regulating many cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, senescence, and stress responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Elevated ceramide levels in the lungs have been reported to contribute to lung parenchymal destruction in both COPD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and an apoptosis-dependent emphysema model caused by the blockade of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors in rats and mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Moreover, the signaling mediated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a downstream prosurvival ceramide metabolite, determines cell fate, and lung remodeling responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Furthermore, plasma sphingolipids are associated with specific COPD phenotypes, such as emphysema and conditions characterized by frequent COPD exacerbation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>hese results indicate that sphingolipid metabolism plays pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema.</s></p><p><s>S1P receptor (S1PR) modulators have been recently used in the clinical setting.</s><s>Clinical trials have revealed that S1PR modulators are beneficial in multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>dditionally, several clinical trials of S1PR modulators in CNSrelated, autoimmune, and cancer diseases are currently in progress. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>In mouse studies, S1PR modulators showed protective effects in various inflammatory lung disease models, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxin shock, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> influenza viral infection, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and emphysema induced by VEGF receptor inhibition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Fingolimod, also known as FTY720, is an agonist for S1PR1 and S1PR3-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> that eventually downregulates S1PR1.</s><s>Therefore, fingolimod is known as an S1PR modulator.</s><s>ONO-4641, used in the present study, is a novel selective agonist for S1PR1 and S1PR5, which, similarly to fingolimod, downregulates S1PR1 and contributes to lymphocytopenia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Therefore, ONO-4641 is also recognized as an S1PR modulator.</s><s>However, the effects of S1PR modulator administration in other emphysema models, including elastase-induced and CS-induced emphysema, have not been elucidated.</s></p><p><s>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous cell population generated in the bone marrow from common myeloid progenitor cells that suppress T cell proliferation and function and expand during cancer, inflammation, and infection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>urine MDSCs are defined as cells expressing both CD11b and Gr-1 markers that inhibit T cell activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>It has been previously shown that the S1PR modulator fingolimod ameliorates chronic graft-versus-host disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and immunological hepatic injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> in mice through stimulation of MDSC expansion.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we used mouse models of COPD, namely porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced and CS-induced emphysema, and COPD exacerbation generated by pneumococcal infection on the background of elastase-induced emphysema, to examine the effects of ONO-4641, a novel selective agonist of S1PR1/S1PR5 and a functional S1PR1 suppressor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>We showed that ONO-4641 ameliorated pulmonary emphysema by augmenting the expansion of immunomodulatory MDSC-like CD11b + Gr-1 + cells and by inhibiting lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>ONO-4641 inhibits lung lymphocyte infiltration and causes the expansion of CD11b + Gr-1 + cells We first examined whether the S1PR modulator ONO-4641 modulates known immune cell populations in naive wild-type (WT) mice.</s><s>The mice were intragastrically administered with ONO-4641 (0.3 mg/kg) daily for 7 days, and single-cell suspensions prepared from the lungs and the spleen were analyzed by flow cytometry the day after the last administration.</s><s>To determine the effect of ONO-4641 on major immune cell populations, we compared the numbers of B cells (B220 + ), NK cells (CD3 − NK1.1 + ), γδT cells (CD3 + γδT + ), and T lymphocytes (CD4 + and CD8 + ) in both the lungs and the spleen of vehicle-and ONO-4641-treated mice.</s><s>The numbers of lymphocytes, except for that of NK1.1 + cells in the lungs, were significantly lower in ONO-4641-treated animals (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a, b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, ONO-4641 caused a significant expansion of splenic and lung CD11b + Gr-1 + cell populations in naive mice by 2.2-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c, d</ref>).</s><s>In addition, ONO-4641 administration decreased the numbers of B lymphocytes (B220 + ) and T lymphocytes (CD4 + and CD8 + ), and increased the CD11b + Gr-1 + cell population in a time-dependent and dosedependent manner (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S1a-d and S2a-d</ref>).</s><s>Previous studies have demonstrated that MDSCs, which are characterized by CD11b + Gr-1 + surface marker expression, consist of two major subsets: monocytic MDSCs (CD11b + Ly-6G − Ly-6C + cells) and granulocytic MDSCs (CD11b + Ly-6G + Ly-6C low cells). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>We confirmed that ONO-4641 stimulated the expansion of both of these CD11b + Gr-1 + cell populations, and the Ly-6C:Ly-6G ratio was found to be ~1:1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>).</s><s>That ratio was also around 1:1 in vehicle-treated CD11b + Gr-1 + cells (data not shown).</s><s>Cytospin examination indicated that CD11b + Ly-6G − Ly-6C + and CD11b + Ly-6G + Ly-6C low cells displayed monocytic and granulocytic morphology, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f, g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Previous human and animal studies have suggested that various sphingolipid signaling pathway modulators might have promising therapeutic potential; ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), an important ceramide metabolite, had a protective effect against CS-induced airway inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>Therefore, we evaluated how various modulators of the sphingolipid pathway, including ONO-4641, affected the number of CD11b + Gr-1 + cells.</s><s>Importantly, ONO-4641 (a selective agonist of S1PR1/S1PR5 and a functional S1PR1 suppressor) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and CYM-5442 (a selective S1PR1 agonist and a functional S1PR1 suppressor) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> increased the percentage and number of lung and splenic CD11b + Gr-1 + cells, whereas another S1PR1-selective agonist, SEW2871, as well as C8-C1P and C16-C1P, had no effect (Fig. <ref type="figure">1h, i</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, treatment with ONO-4641 or CYM-5442 decreased the numbers of B lymphocytes (B220 + ) and T lymphocytes (CD4 + and CD8 + ), whereas SEW2871 decreased only the number of CD4 + lymphocytes in the lungs (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S3a-c</ref>).</s><s>Lung CD11b + Gr-1 + cells from ONO-4641-treated mice showed lower S1PR1 gene expression and higher S1PR5 gene expression compared with that from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">1j</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these results suggest that S1PR1 functional antagonism causes the expansion of CD11b + Gr-1 + cells, although there is a possibility that S1PR5 agonism also contributes to this effect.</s></p><p><s>ONO-4641-expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells exhibit anti-inflammatory properties To further characterize the phenotype of ONO-4641-expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells, we initially performed arginase activity and carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) T cell proliferation assays in the presence of sorted splenic CD11b + Gr-1 + cells obtained from vehicle-treated and ONO-4641-treated mice.</s><s>We found a significant increase in the arginase activity of ONO-4641expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells as compared to that of CD11b + Gr-1 + cells from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the histogram of CFSE intensity in CD3 + T cells co-cultured with ONO-4641expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells shifted to the right along the X-axis compared to the pattern seen in CD3 + T cells co-cultured with CD11b + Gr-1 + cells from control animals (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b, c</ref>), indicating that ONO-4641-expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells attenuated CD3 + T cell proliferation.</s><s>These findings in ONO-4641-expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells were consistent with the features of MDSCs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> suggesting that ONO-4641-expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells were MDSC-like cells.</s></p><p><s>We next examined ONO-4641-expanded splenic CD11b + Gr-1 + cells for the presence of various surface markers reported to be expressed on MDSCs and/or myeloid cells, including CD244, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> CD49d, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Sca-1, 25 CCR2, 25 CX3CR1, 26 CXCR2, 25 CXCR4, 25 CXCR5, 27 CD80, 25 CD31, 28 CD62L, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> ICAM-1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> MHC class II, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> CD115/M-CSFR, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> IL-4Rα, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> CTLA-4, 30 CD40, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> and PD-L1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Notably, CD244 expression was higher in ONO-4641-expanded CD11b + Gr-1 + cells than in vehicle-treated CD11b + Gr-1 + cells (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref>;
