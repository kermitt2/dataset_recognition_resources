<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>The bacterial 70S ribosome is formed by a small 30S-and a large 50S subunit.</s><s>While the small subunit consists of one 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 21 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins), the large subunit contains two rRNAs (23S and 5S rRNA) and 33 r-proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Reconstitution of intact ribosomal subunits in the test tube is possible using components derived from purified ribosomes, but requires non-physiological conditions, such as high Mg 2+ concentration and incubation temperatures of up to 50°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>In vivo, this process critically depends on biogenesis factors, which are proteins that process, modify and chaperone rRNA or r-proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Ribosome assembly is characterized by a highly coordinated sequence of events consisting of rRNA synthesis and r-protein uptake.</s><s>Since assembly takes place co-transcriptionally (i.e. during rRNA synthesis) there is a hierarchical order of binding events with early-and late assembly r-proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Each r-protein gene is present in a single copy per genome, whereas rRNAs are encoded by multiple rrn operons (seven ones in E. coli).</s><s>One 16S, 23S and 5S rRNA (and several tRNAs) are contained in one primary transcript that is processed by site specific RNases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Due to this genetic organization ribosomal subunits are consequently produced in equal stoichiometric amounts.</s><s>Furthermore, synthesis of rRNA and r-proteins are synchronized <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> with the consequence that free cytosolic pools of r-proteins are close to zero under optimal conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, ribosome assembly is a fast process taking place within a couple of minutes at 37°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>It follows that r-proteins upon synthesis are rapidly taken up by nascent ribosomal subunits.</s><s>If selected rproteins were fluorescence labeled, it further follows that the fluorescences signal would represent subunit precursors and whole subunits rather than free cytosolic pools of r-proteins.</s></p><p><s>Treatment of cells with chemical agents or occurrence of mutations (e.g.</s><s>affecting genes encoding r-proteins or biogenesis factors) can lead to ribosome assembly defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>One possible fate of defective assembly intermediates is a selective clearance by RNase based control mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref

fluorescent protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, hereafter mAzami) and S15-mCherry was constructed and exhibited normal growth, indicating an intact translation apparatus.</s><s>We used synthetic gene knock out of rplC (encoding L3) and rpsQ (encoding S17), respectively, or ribosome directed antibiotics to induce subunit assembly defects.</s><s>A 254 and fluorescence analysis of

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rationale</head><p><s>In order to generate a reporter strain suitable for monitoring ribosome assembly landscapes, we selected ribosomal protein candidates from each subunit according to the following criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>: The candidates should be i) distant from functional sites, ii) accessible to C-terminal tagging with fluorescent proteins, iii) early assembly proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and iv) subject of feedback regulation.</s><s>The ribosomal proteins S15 and L1 fulfill all these criteria: Their surface exposed C-termini (Additional file 1A) allow convenient tagging (with mCherry and mAzami).</s><s>Although these proteins are not essential <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> deletion strains have exaggerated generation times at 37°C.</s><s>In addition, absence of S15 results in severe cold sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and ribosomes lacking L1 show 50% reduced translation activity in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, growth would be severely hampered if the fusion proteins do not fully complement the wild type protein's function.</s><s>According to in vivo ribosome assembly maps (Additional file 2), both are early assembly proteins and consequently present in ribosomal particles of each state of maturation.</s><s>Finally, feedback regulation by autogenous control <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> ensures that they are not produced in excess.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenotypic and biochemical characterization of the engineered strains</head><p><s>To generate E. coli strains harboring modified genes coding for S15-mCherry (MCr*) and L1-mAzami (MCg*) fusion proteins (Additional file 1B), we used the technique of lambda red recombineering <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>The final reporter strain MCrg* producing both S15-mCherry and L1-mAzami fusion proteins was constructed, using P1 phage transduction.</s></p><p><s>To exclude that tagging of r-proteins with FPs interferes with regular cell functions and growth, we analyzed reporter strains in more detail.</s><s>Spot tests revealed that growth of the genetically engineered strains did not differ from that of the wild type strain at various temperatures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>To analyze possible growth differences more precisely, all strains were grown to stationary phase at different temperatures and their growth rates were calculated (Figures 1B).</s><s>It turned out that the growth rate of MCrg* at 37°C was 5-10% less than the wild type strain.</s></p><p><s>Next, the protein content of MCr*, MCg* and MCrg*derived ribosomes was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C, D</ref>).</s><s>While MCr* and MCg* ribosomes contained one fusion protein (migrating at 37 and 57 kDa, respectively), two fusion proteins were observed in MCrg* ribosomes.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, the data indicate that growth behavior and functional competence of the ribosomes of MCrg* are similar to those of the parental strain.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of ribosome subunit specific assembly defects and in vitro analysis</head><p><s>To induce assembly defects in the small or the large ribosomal subunit, conditional gene knock outs of rpsQ (encoding S17) and rplC (encoding L3), respectively, were generated in the reporter strain background (Additional file 1A).</s><s>It has been shown previously that defects in each of these genes caused ribosome assembly defects that were supposed to be subunit specific <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The resulting strains (MCrg*ΔsQ and MCrg*ΔlC) carried plasmids containing wild type copies of the genes deleted from the chromosome under control of an IPTG inducible promoter.</s><s>The withdrawal of IPTG in liquid cultures should result in impaired growth and in subunit specific assembly defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> as soon as the number of intact ribosomes becomes limiting.</s></p><p><s>To this end, we grew MCrg*, MCrg*ΔsQ and -ΔlC cells in the absence of IPTG to mid-logarithmic phase and examined the ribosomes by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and polysome profile analysis (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref>).</s><s>MCrg* ribosomes showed the expected pattern consisting of 30S-, 50S-, 70S-, and polysome peaks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), whereas depletion of rpsQ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) led to dramatically reduced amounts of 70S ribosomes and polysomes, increased amounts of 50S subunits and a broad peak of particles in the region of the 30S subunits.</s><s>Likewise, depletion of rplC reduced the amount of 70S ribosomes and led to a defined peak of 30S subunits and a large and broad peak of particles migrating between mature 50S and 30S subunits (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>This was expected because both absence of rpsQ and rplC should result in defective small and large ribosomal subunits, respectively.</s><s>Consequently, the reduced number of functional subunits limited the amount of monosomes and polysomes.</s></p><p><s>Fluorometric analysis of the sucrose fractions provided fluorescence profiles of MCrg*, MCrg*ΔsQ and -ΔlC derived ribosomes (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D-F</ref>).</s><s>Comparing A 254 and fluorescence profiles of MCrg* ribosomes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>) revealed reasonable coincidence of the individual peaks.</s><s>For completeness the entire profile, also including early low molecular weight fractions, is depicted as insert (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref> fluorescence -representing the small subunit-was decreased in intensity relative to largest peak of green fluorescence -representing the large subunit-(in comparison with Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the red fluorescence peak was in addition left shifted due to absence of rpsQ.</s></p><p><s>The largest peak of green fluorescence was slightly left shifted and showed a shoulder at the lower left side overlapping with the red peak, indicating defective large ribosomal subunits.</s><s>This indicates that a selective assembly defect of the small subunit is also associated with an accumulation of 50S assembly intermediates.</s><s>Finally, as shown in the insert there was no increased fluorescence in the low molecular weight fractions, indicating proper autogenous control of S15-mCherry and L1-mAzami.</s><s>Combined analysis of A 254 and fluorescence profiles of MCrg*ΔlC ribosomes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2J</ref>) revealed a decrease in the green fluorescence peak relative to the red fluorescence peak, in comparison with Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the green fluorescence peak was clearly left shifted, due to assembly defects in the absence of rplC.</s><s>In the A 254 profile the peak of the large subunit appeared higher than the peak of the small subunit.</s><s>This is presumably the case because peaks of both subunits are overlapping each other (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>), thereby producing a dominant broad peak in the region of the large subunit.</s><s>Investigation of the low molecular weight fractions in the insert showed strict feedback regulation of S15-mCherry and L1-mAzami.</s></p><p><s>In summary, assembly defects of the small and large ribosomal subunit could be provoked and were readily detectable by fluorescence analysis of sucrose gradient centrifugates.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vivo analysis of subunit specific assembly defects</head><p><s>Next, we asked whether subunit assembly defects could be detected by fluorescence readout in vivo using MCrg*?</s><s>Fluorescent labeling of the early assembly r-proteins L1 and S15 results in fluorescent subunits of all stages of maturation.</s><s>Since both subunits are systemically produced in equal amounts, any shift in the fluorescence ratios is expected to be a consequence of subunit specific turnover (facilitated by ribonucleases and proteases).</s><s>Increased turnover of the large subunit should reduce the amount of green fluorescence and consequently lower the normalized fluorescence emission ratio of mAzami/mCherry, while increased turnover of the small subunit in turn should increase the ratio.</s></p><p><s>MCrg*, MCrg*ΔsQ and MCrg*ΔlC cells were transferred to 384-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 10 hours in M9 medium.</s><s>Fully automated sample handling was possible, using a robotic platform equipped with incubator, microplate reader and robotic arm.</s><s>Both A 650 values and fluorescence intensities were measured (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) in one-hour intervals.</s><s>From the latter, normalized fluorescence ratios were calculated.</s><s>While MCrg* grew unperturbed, MCrg*ΔsQ and MCrg*ΔlC cells showed impaired growth and reached lower cell densities after 10 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>The background corrected and normalized fluorescence ratios of MCrg*ΔlC reached a minimum of 0.8 after 6 hours, revealing a defect of the 50S assembly, whereas the ratios of MCrg*ΔsQ increased instead reaching a maximum of 1.3 after 9 hours indicating a defect in the 30S assembly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We conclude that depletion of rplC and rpsQ, respectively, causes severe assembly defects of ribosomal subunits.</s><s>Moreover, the changes in fluorescence ratios suggest that there is turnover of defective subunits.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Probing MCrg* with ribosome-targeting antibiotics</head><p><s>It has been shown that translation inhibitors such as chloramphenicol <ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>We tested all of the before mentioned antibiotics and included a fourth one (kanamycin) that, to our knowledge, was not investigated so far for its potential to cause ribosome assembly defects.</s><s>Using MCrg*, we set out to clarify, whether treatment of cells with ribosome targeting antibiotics results in assembly defects of one or both of the ribosomal subunits.</s><s>The fact that early assembly proteins are fluorescently labeled should allow detailed analysis of the assembly landscapes upon antibiotic treatment.</s><s>In addition, cell based assays were used to elicit whether there are indications for subunit specific turnover.</s></p><p><s>MCrg* cells were grown in M9 medium for seven hours in the absence or presence of chloramphenicol (7 μg/ml), erythromycin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (7 μg/ml) or neomycin (7 μg/ml).</s><s>While each antibiotic led to impaired cell growth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), chloramphenicol caused strongest growth defects.</s><s>Erythromycin, kanamycin and neomycin treatment did not show a significant change in fluorescence ratios (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Treatment with chloramphenicol, by contrast, led to an increased fluorescence ratio, with a maximum of about 1.20 after 7 hours.</s><s>This suggests that treatment of cells with chloramphenicol might decrease the relative amounts of the small subunit.</s></p><p><s>This hypothesis was tested by analyzing ribosome profiles obtained from MCrg* cells that grew in the presence of the antibiotics or without (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C-G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> shows the A 254 profile of ribosomes derived from non-treated cells.</s><s>The 70S peak and the polysomes (not shown) were reduced in intensity since no chloramphenicol was added prior to harvesting.</s><s>In our previous study, it turned out that addition of chloramphenicol (immediately before harvest) to antibiotic-treated cells caused extremely broadened 70S peaks.</s><s>Ribosomes derived from chloramphenicol (D) or erythromycin (E)  Chloramphenicol treatment caused an additional peak (left-lateral of 30S), while after erythromycin treatment the 30S peak had a shoulder on the left.</s><s>Treatment with kanamycin had no apparent influence on the 50S peak but provoked an additional peak left-lateral of the 30S peak (F).</s><s>Neomycin treatment caused a slight reduction and left shift of the 50S peak and an additional peak on the left of the 30S peak (G).</s><s>Overlay diagrams (combining A 254 and fluorescence read outs) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H-M</ref>) show that ribosome profiles from non-treated cells are congruent (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H</ref>).</s><s>Profiles from chloramphenicol and in particular erythromycin treated cells revealed an extra portion of green fluorescence within the region of the 30S peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4J-K</ref>).</s><s>Ribosome profiles derived from kanamycin and neomycin treated cells possessed additional green fluorescent peaks of very weak intensity but at similar positions within the profile (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4L-M</ref>).</s><s>The particles within the green peaks migrating slower than that of the 50S subunits presumably represent defective assembly intermediates of the large subunit that are caused by all the antibiotics used in this study, but to different extent.</s><s>For a more detailed analysis the green fluorescence profiles were aligned and the one derived from non-treated cells was compared with all the others obtained from antibiotic treated cells (Additional file 3), illustrating the presence of assembly intermediates of the large subunit.</s><s>Comparison of the red fluorescent peaks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H-M</ref>) indicates that treatment with all antibiotics produced a more or less pronounced shoulder on the left side.</s><s>To analyze potential defects of the small subunit in more detail, the red fluorescence profiles derived from antibiotic treated cells were compared with the one obtained from non-treated cells (Additional file 4).</s><s>It turned out that treatment with all four antibiotics caused distinct left-sided shoulders of the red fluorescence peak, indicating small subunit assembly defects.</s><s>This is either due to accumulation of the 21S precursor of the 30S subunit, or assembly dead-ends of this subunit.</s><s>A more thorough analysis, which includes quantitation of the 16S and 23S rRNA within the sucrose fractions is given in the supplementary material (Additional file 5), confirms all hypothesized assembly intermediates.</s><s>Taken together, the administration of a representative collection of ribosometargeting antibiotics caused assembly defects of both subunits in each case, but to different extents.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our analyses demonstrated that ribosome assembly defects are detectable by fluorometric analysis of fractions collected after sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of ribosomal preparations.</s><s>Assembly defects caused by gene depletions (of rplC and rpsQ) or by treatment of reporter cells with four
