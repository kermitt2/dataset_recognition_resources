<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>If the chemically synthesized ManNAc derivatives, ManNProp and ManNBut are analyzed via mass spectrometry, only the correct mass peak for both specimens should be identified.</s><s>Therefore, the products can be assumed to have a purity of over 99%.</s><s>Small amounts of Neu5Gc, which is normally not found in human cells 29 , are detected in the membrane fractions of the lysed cells.</s><s>This most likely occurs through a salvage pathway that recruits Neu5Gc from fetal bovine serum sialoglycoconjugates in the media <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Treatment with the natural precursor of sialic acid biosynthesis, ManNAc, drastically lowers the expression of the Neu5Gc epitope on the cell surface.</s></p><p><s>Application of modified mannosamines is negligibly toxic to all cells investigated so far.</s><s>Cells accept increased millimolar sugar concentrations within the medium, which is necessary, since there are no specific transporters for N-acylmannosamines.</s><s>It has been demonstrated that signal transduction pathways are activated upon application of N-acylmannosamines, which could affect cell growth or differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Whether this is due to a changed sialylation pattern or reflects direct effects on the modified sialylation is not known so far.</s><s>Growth of cells in the presence of the C2-modified ManNAc analogs, ManNProp or ManNBut results in the expression of non-natural sialic acid species carrying the corresponding N-acyl substitution.</s><s>The metabolic efficiency of the two tested N-acyl modified mannosamines varies.</s><s>Treatment with ManNProp usually leads to expression of the corresponding Neu5Prop on the cell surface and to a decreased expression of Neu5Ac as well as Neu5Gc.</s><s>Other N-acyl modified mannosamine analogs, like N-cyclopropylcarbamyl mannosamine, tend to have an even higher metabolic efficiency 22 .</s></p><p><s>Previous studies revealed that sialic precursors interfere with polysialylation.</s><s>Polysialic acids are nearly exclusively expressed on the NCAM.</s><s>Interestingly, NCAM can be polysialylated by two distinct polysialyltransferases expressed in the Golgi (ST8SiaII and ST8SiaIV).</s><s>It turned out that ManNProp, ManNBut, and other N-acyl-modified mannosamines interfere with polysialylation and that this is predominantly due to interaction with ST8SiaII 14 .</s><s>This sialyltransferase is expressed during development and is important for the development of the brain.</s><s>Interestingly also, many tumors from neuronal origin re-express ST8SiaII increasing their malignancy and further making them undetectable from the immune system 33 .</s><s>In contrast, the application of ManNAc leads to an increase of polySia, since it leads to an increase of CMP-Neu5Ac, which is the natural substrate of both polysialyltransferases.</s></p><p><s>MGE is a unique method to introduce novel sialic acids on proteins of interest (e.g., erythropoietin) and to modulate thereby its function.</s><s>Furthermore, it can be used to modulate cell surface glycosylation, which might be of interest in many diseases, such as cancer, since many cancer cells try to escape the immune system by expressing high levels of sialic acid.</s><s>The method presented here allows: first, to perform glycoengineering using cell cultures, and second, to analyze engineered glycans to prove successful glycoengineering.</s><s>The method is very robust and up to now, no pitfalls are reported; in contrast, the method has been expanded to introduce chemical active groups to perform clickchemistry on cells 13 .</s></p><p><s>Here we present two ManNAc analogs with aliphatic N-acyl side chain modifications that are comparably simple to synthesize, even by laboratories with less equipment and less experience in chemical synthesis.</s><s>Groups that are more familiar to organic chemistry could synthesize other ManNAc analogs with more complex structures and use these for MGE, including the so-called 'bioorthogonal' analogs, which can be utilized, for example, to visualize sialylated glycoconjugates.</s><s>There are review articles giving an overview of the N-acetyl-mannosamine derivatives that have been synthesized to date <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>N-azidoacetyl mannosamine (ManNAz), a substance that is frequently used, to visualize sialylated glycans, is commercially available.</s><s>Because of the low membrane permeability of ManNAc analogs, it can be advantageous to use derivatives of these sugars with protected hydroxyl-groups, e.g., peracetylated ManNAc analogs.</s><s>After entering the cytoplasm, the protecting groups are cleaved by cytoplasmic esterases, thereby releasing the active monosaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>However, peracetylated ManNAc analogs expose higher cytotoxicity compared to the corresponding unprotected derivatives.</s></p><p><s>In this manuscript, we chose immortalized neuroblastoma cells for our experiments with MGE.</s><s>Generally, MGE (especially with ManNProp and ManNBut) can be applied in a wide variety of cell lines, including immortalized cell lines (see Wratil et al. 13 for examples) and primary cells .</s><s>The treatment time and the concentration of the ManNAc analogs in MGE experiments can be varied to affect the metabolic efficiency of this method.</s><s>From our experience, longer treatment and higher concentrations correspond with better replacement of the naturally occurring sialic acid species in glycoconjugates by modified Neu5R.</s><s>If very high concentrations of ManNAc derivatives are to be used, the cytotoxicity of the treatment should be evaluated, e.g., by the MTT assay or the resazurin reduction assay.</s></p><p><s>In this manuscript, we suggest using ultra-sonication for cell homogenization.</s><s>Other cell lysis methods were tested in our laboratory, including douncing on ice (approximately 250 strokes) and french press disruption (10,000 psi, 4 passages), with comparable outcomes regarding the amount of sialic acid detected in the samples.</s><s>The advantage of ultra-sound homogenization is that it needs little time and does not require the addition of DNAase to the samples prior to lysis.</s></p><p><s>We focused our analysis on the membrane fractions of cell lysates, because we wanted to show alterations in the sialylation of membrane bound glycoconjugates.</s><s>Sialic acid derivatives and their concentrations can also be measured in the cytosol of cells, after the membrane fraction has been separated by high-speed centrifugation, using the same method as described above.</s><s>However, the concentrations of sialic acid in the cytosol are up to 100x lower compared to sialic acid expression on the cell membrane 7 .</s><s>Thus, larger amounts of cells are needed to generate reliable results.</s><s>The pool of cytosolic, activated CMP-sialic acid can be measured indirectly by pre-treating the cytosolic fractions of cell lysates with sodium borohydride prior to hydrolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>In order to hydrolyze sialic acid in glycoconjugates and sialic acid with hydroxyl modifications, the cells were incubated with 1 M TFA.</s><s>Other acidic solutions can be used for hydrolysis, as well, e.g., 2 M propionic acid, 2 M acetic acid, or 1 M HCl.</s></p><p><s>A possible encountered issue during HPLC analysis is that peaks of interest are overlapping with undefined peaks.</s><s>This is especially problematic when the amount of sialic acid in a sample is to be calculated by the area under the curve of a certain peak.</s><s>To separate a peak of interest from an undefined peak, the acetonitrile concentration in the HPLC solvent might be adjusted (± 3%).</s><s>We suggest using steady solvent concentrations for HPLC analysis, giving the advantage of preparing the solvent mixture before chromatography.</s><s>Therefore, our method requires only one HPLC pump and is feasible for a wide range of different HPLC systems.</s><s>If more than one pump is available in the HPLC system, an isocratic gradient with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile can be applied, e.g., 4-9% in 35 min</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>45</head><p><s>. By using this technique, the retention time of certain HPLC peaks will be altered considerably.</s><s>This strategy can also help to achieve better separation of overlapping peaks.</s><s>Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was successfully established to verify the expression of modified sialic acid species on the cell surface 45 , and thus serves as an equivalent to the ESI-MS method presented here.</s></p><p><s>Due to the hydrophilicity of ManNAc analogs and the lack of specific transporters for the uptake of these derivates 46 , high concentrations are needed in MGE experiments with these compounds.</s><s>Therefore, in up-scaled experiments and, especially in in vivo trials, large amounts of the respective ManNAc analogs are necessary showing a possible limitation of this technique.</s><s>On the other hand, depending on the cell lines used, a certain minimal number of treated cells is necessary to obtain reliable results in the HPLC analysis.</s><s>From our experience, a minimum of about 100,000 adherent cells or 150,000 suspension cells (1-2 wells of a 96-well plate with confluent cells) is sufficient.</s><s>This can become a bottleneck, if the analysis is to be downsized, for example in screening approaches.</s></p><p><s>With the methods presented in this manuscript, sialic acid and its derivatives can be detected in cell lysates.</s><s>However, the structure and composition of glycoconjugates in cells treated with ManNAc derivatives cannot be assessed with the herein described technique.</s><s>Resolving the structure of glycoconjugates, e.g.,N-and O-glycans, generally requires greater experience and a glycomics facility The advantage of MGE compared to the techniques described here, is that it is easy to apply and adaptable to a myriad of different experiments, from in vitro trials to cell based assays and in vivo experiments.</s><s>An alternative method to measuring the expression and concentrations of different sialic acid species in cell samples is by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed electrochemical detection 50 .</s><s>By using this method, the expression of sialic acid is measured directly and not after labeling with a fluorescent dye.</s><s>The advantage of this method is that it can be utilized also to analyze monosaccharides other than sialic acid and its derivatives in cell-and protein-samples.</s><s>Unfortunately, the sensitivity of HPAEC is lower compared to fluorometric detection of DMB-sialic acid.</s><s>Thus, HPAEC is limited to experiments with the availability of large sample amounts 51 .</s></p><p><s>The herein described methods can be used to reveal unknown characteristics of glycoconjugates.</s><s>A multitude of examples for the use of MGE to investigate sialic acid dependent interactions already exists 13 , showing the feasibility of this technique in context of a wide range of experimental setups.</s></p><p><s>Nowadays, MGE with N-acetylmannosamines is mainly used by researchers in the field of glycobiology.</s><s>We hope that this technique will be recognized by a broader audience as a versatile tool to modify glycoconjugates.</s><s>Other fields, including immunology, virology, neurology, or oncology will benefit by adapting this technique for their own purposes.</s><s>Such cross-over research might enable the discovery of yet uncharted areas, and therefore give a better understanding of health and disease.</s><s>In early studies, for example, this technique was used to produce glycoproteins with modified glycosylation, which later serve for in vivo vaccination.</s><s>In certain cases, treatment with such glycoengineered vaccines lead to production of antibodies that exposed advanced avidity and toxicity to the respective targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>Others successfully used MGE to develop a model for targeted tumor therapy in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>Another study showed that systemic in vivo injection of ManNProp promoted nerve regeneration 55 .</s><s>In the case of polySia, it was shown that diminishing the expression of this epitope in neuroblastoma cells by the methods presented in this manuscript, increases the sensitivity of these tumor cells to radiation or treatment with anticancer drugs 56 .</s></p><p><s>The amounts of sialic acid measured within samples might differ depending on the method used to detach the treated cells.</s><s>In this manuscript, incubation with trypsin was used to detach cells.</s><s>If other techniques are to be used, such as scraping the cells or long-time treatment with PBS + EDTA, the amounts of sialic acid measured in the samples might differ.</s><s>Even adapting the incubation time with trypsin can have an impact on the sialic acid concentrations measured later on.</s><s>From our experience, the impact of the cell detachment method on the amounts of sialic acid measured is below 15%, but if results are to be normalized and compared, this might become an important bottleneck.</s><s>Additionally, the method for lysis of the cells can affect the outcome of the HPLC analysis.</s><s>Thus, we recommend the reader to standardize cell detachment and lysis in their experiments.</s></p><p><s>To achieve separation of the membrane fraction in cell lysates, we used centrifugation for 2 h at 20,000 x g and 4 °C (section 5.1).</s><s>Other centrifugation protocols might affect the separation and therefore the amounts of sialic acid detected in the samples.</s><s>A critical compound within this protocol is DMB, because it is very sensitive to light and degrades over time.</s><s>Here we recommended to aliquot small portions of the DMBsolution and store it as stocks at -20 °C, protected from light (section 1.6.1).</s><s>This way the DMB-solution can be stored for several weeks.</s><s>If the results from DMB-HPLC analysis show decreasing signals for sialic acid species or increasing signals within the first 6 min of the HPLC measurement, representing DMB and its reaction products, new DMB-solution should be prepared.</s><s>Do not re-freeze and re-use DMB-solution after thawing it.</s><s>After DMB labeling, all samples should be analyzed immediately.</s><s>If larger numbers of samples (&gt; 10) are to be analyzed, these samples should be divided into smaller badges and gradually labeled with DMB.</s><s>Both the labeling reaction as well as the DMB-labeled probes should be protected from light at all times.</s><s>After elution, the DMB-labeled sialic acid species should be analyzed immediately by ESI-MS.</s><s>Direct coupling of the HPLC with the ESI-MS system (in a LC-ESI-MS setup) is not necessary, but can be advantageous to achieve higher quality of the mass spectrometry analysis.</s></p></div>
