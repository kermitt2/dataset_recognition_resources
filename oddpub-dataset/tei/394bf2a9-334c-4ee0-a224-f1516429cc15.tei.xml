<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Glutamate/GABA Co-Release in a Developing Circuit</head><p><s>Our findings show that glutamate can be both released and detected at GABAergic synapses from autapses expressing VGLUT3.</s><s>However, in neural circuits in the brain, GABAergic synapses co-releasing glutamate must exist on the same postsynaptic target cells as bona fide glutamatergic synapses.</s><s>Therefore, we examined whether we could still detect glutamate released from GABAergic striatal neurons expressing VGLUT3 when they were cultured in the presence of glutamatergic neurons from hippocampus.</s><s>We performed paired whole cells recordings from mixed cultures of striatal and hippocampal neurons infected with VGLUT3, and pharmacologically isolated the PSCs as previously described (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1, 3-4</ref>).</s><s>On average, the responses from VGLUT3-expressing GABAergic presynaptic neurons were almost completely blocked by application of Bic, indicating that glutamatergic co-release could not be detected.</s><s>To test whether the lack of detection of glutamate co-release from GABAergic neurons was due to a low expression level of VGLUT3 in mixed striatal/hippocampal cultures, we performed sister-culture experiments with pure striatal neurons or mixed striatal/hippocampal neurons plated on astrocyte microislands, and again recorded from autaptic striatal neurons expressing VGLUT3 or from paired neurons in multi-cell microisland circuits.</s><s>We found, again, that the majority of autaptic GABAergic neurons expressing VGLUT3 had an NBQX-sensitive component of their evoked release (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, the PSCs detected in paired recordings from multi-cell microislands where striatal GABAergic neurons expressing VGLUT3 were co-cultured with hippocampal neurons were almost entirely blocked by Bic application.</s><s>Plotting the total amplitude of each cell against its amplitude in the presence of Bic (''glutamatergic component'') demonstrates the influence of the culturing system on the size of the glutamatergic component compared to the influence of the total response size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>While this could indicate that VGLUT3 is actively excluded from GABAergic vesicles in mixed cultures, a more likely explanation could be that even though glutamate is co-released from GABAergic terminals expressing VGLUT3, the detection could be limited by the availability of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, which may be sequestered by bona fide glutamatergic synapses in a network environment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Co-release of two or more classical neurotransmitters from the same neuron is now considered to be a common principle throughout the nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Whittaker et al., 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jonas et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Higley et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beltrán and Gutiérrez, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>We studied the co-release of glutamate and GABA in striatal interneurons, which exogenously expressed VGLUT3, and present the following findings: (1) Striatal GABAergic SVs do not have active mechanisms to exclude vesicular glutamate transporters and the presence of VGLUT on these vesicles is enough to induce glutamate co-release; (2) Glutamate and GABA are at least partially stored in the same vesicles and these vesicles are involved in both spontaneous and evoked (asynchronous) release; (3) Co-storage of glutamate and GABA does not result in neurotransmitter synergy as GABA content is unaltered in VGLUT3-expressing vesicles; and (4) In a network of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons co-release of glutamate is not sufficient to induce clustering of AMPA receptors at the GABAergic postsynaptic structure.</s></p><p><s>Pharmacological dissection of evoked PSCs from GABAergic neurons expressing the VGLUT3 transporter has shown that these responses contain both a glutamatergic and GABAergic component (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Weston et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, these measurements cannot discern between glutamate and GABA released from the same or separate synapses or vesicles.</s><s>Therefore, to further investigate this question, we took advantage of the distinct kinetics of postsynaptic responses mediated by GABA A and AMPA receptors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>We found that a portion of spontaneously released mPSCs in striatal autapses expressing VGLUT3 showed a postsynaptic response, the decay of which was a convolution of the kinetics of GABA A and AMPA receptor responses, suggesting that glutamate and GABA are released from the same vesicle.</s><s>Importantly, we could also show that co-release of glutamate and GABA can occur in response to presynaptic stimulation, as asynchronous PSC evoked in the presence of SrCl 2 also contained a population with mixed GABA A and AMPA receptor kinetics (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>It should be noted that the percentage of mixed events detected from the total population of spontaneous or asynchronous events does not represent the fraction of vesicles that contain glutamate and GABA per se as the composition of postsynaptic receptors is unlikely to be uniform.</s></p><p><s>Does the co-storage of glutamate in GABAergic vesicles have synergistic effects on filling?</s><s>Our findings and a recent study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Case et al. (2014)</ref>, indicate that GABA content is not influenced by co-packaging of glutamate (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zander et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>A series of studies show that the presence of VGLUT3 in cholinergic and serotonergic terminals stimulated the uptake of ACh and serotonin (5-HT) to SVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gras et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amilhon et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>These so called ''synergistic effects'' have been attributed to an increase in the pH gradient ( pH) across the vesicle membrane due to the presence of glutamate, which then drives neurotransmitter uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hnasko et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">El Mestikawy et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, neurotransmitter transport by the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) into SVs depends largely on pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Johnson et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nguyen et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Because accumulation of GABA by VGAT depends both on the transmembrane potential ( ψ) and on pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hell et al., 1990)</ref>, the acidification of SVs by VGLUTs seems to be less important than in the case of the positively-charged ACh, dopamine and 5-HT.</s></p><p><s>Even though multiple cell types in the brain have been identified where vesicular GABA and glutamate transporters are co-expressed, it has been difficult to prove co-release of GABA and glutamate at those synapses.</s><s>Co-release of the two fast-acting NTs has been shown in the lateral superior olive (LSO;

however, in the presence of glutamatergic input, AMPA receptor distribution becomes punctate <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rao et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>We found that in the presence of glutamatergic input in mass culture or multicellular microislands, corelease of glutamate from GABAergic terminals was no longer detectable through AMPA receptor-mediated currents (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Because our experiments comparing co-release in isolated, GABAergic striatal neurons and GABAergic striatal neurons in mixed mass culture used sister cultures expressing VGLUT3 from the same constructs, we speculate that the lack of AMPA receptor-mediated currents in only the mass culture model is not due to lack of VGLUT3 expression in these cells.</s><s>Instead, we favor the interpretation that with glutamatergic input, AMPA receptors are recruited to glutamatergic synapses, and that co-release of glutamate from a GABAergic terminal is not sufficient to induce AMPA receptor clustering at its postsynaptic element.</s><s>However, it cannot be ruled out that at GABAergic synapses endogenously co-expressing VGLUT3, that the postsynaptic element may contain specific molecules promoting the capture of AMPA receptors.</s></p><p><s>We have shown, as a proof of principle, that on a quantal level, expression of both VGLUT and VGAT in a presynaptic terminal leads to glutamate/GABA co-release.</s><s>How might this co-release influence signaling at VGLUT3expressing GABAergic terminals?</s><s>It is feasible that co-released glutamate could act through a spillover mechanism to activate metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which are present on GABAergic terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Somogyi et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Another distinct possibility is that glutamate may activate high-affinity NMDA receptors, which have been suggested to exist at VGLUT3expressing GABAergic terminals in adult rat hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Stensrud et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, activation of NMDA receptors by co-released glutamate has been proposed as the mechanism by which expression of VGLUT3 in GABAergic synapses refines the tontopic map in auditory brainstem <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Gillespie et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Noh et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Further details regarding how glutamate co-release at GABAergic terminals in various regions with endogenous VGLUT3 expression affects signaling at the synaptic level and function at the circuit level are interesting questions to be addressed by further studies.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | VGLUT3 expression promotes glutamate release in GABAergic neurons.</s><s>(A) Exemplary traces of current responses to an unclamped AP of a striatal GABAergic neuron exogenously expressing VGLUT3 in control extracellular solution (ECS;
