<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS Study population and design</head><p><s>The architecture of the multinational, prospective EUSTAR database has been described elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">6 16</ref></s><s>n order to be able to document clinical data of patients, each participating centre obtained ethical approval by its local ethics committee; written informed consent was acquired from each patient registered.</s><s>The demographics and disease characteristics of patients collected between the database inauguration in June 2004 and the date of censoring (18 February 2014) were exported, provided that the patients were older than 18 years at their first EUSTAR visit and fulfilled the 1980 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SSc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>In order to capture patients early in their disease course, that is, to simulate an inception cohort, the analysis was restricted to patients who had their first EUSTAR visit within 1 year after RP onset.</s></p><p><s>Several outcome measures were analysed as a function of time after RP onset: the evolution of the mRSS, the presence of skin sclerosis (defined as an mRSS ≥2 points at the body area of interest), the presence of diffuse cutaneous involvement (defined as an mRSS ≥2 points in at least one of the six skin areas proximal to the elbows and knees, ie, upper arms, chest, abdomen, thighs) and the presence of DUs (defined as ulcers distal to or at the proximal interphalangeal joints, and not thought to be due to trauma).</s><s>The effect of sex, age (dichotomised at the median age at RP onset) and autoantibody status on skin sclerosis and DU incidence was assessed in more detail.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Frequencies and percentages of categorical variables were compared using Pearson's χ 2 tests.</s><s>Means and SDs, and for nonnormally distributed variables, additionally medians and IQRs, were reported; two-group comparisons were performed using Student's t tests or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.</s></p><p><s>Using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods, we assessed the time to the first diagnosis of the manifestations.</s><s>The date of the visit at which these were first observed was used as the end time.</s><s>In case the manifestation was already present at the first visit, the date of this first visit was regarded the end time.</s><s>If the manifestation was never observed, the date of the last follow-up visit was regarded the censor time.</s><s>KM estimates were compared by log-rank tests and incidence rates, and their 95% CIs were calculated.</s><s>Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the combined effect of the potential risk factors sex, age and autoantibody status on disease manifestations.</s><s>All data were analysed using Stata V.13.1 (Stata, Texas, USA).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient characteristics</head><p><s>At the time of the data export, the EUSTAR database included 9891 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria.</s><s>Of these, 695 patients had their first EUSTAR visit within 1 year of RP onset.</s><s>These patients had a median observation time of 2.1 years (IQR 0.7-4.6;</s><s>mean 3.1 years, SD 3.0).</s><s>The patients included in our analysis were approximately 9 years older, had a higher baseline mRSS and had more frequently antitopoisomerase-I (anti-TOPO) or anti-RNA polymerase-III (anti-RNAP-III) autoantibodies than the patients excluded (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the percentage of men was significantly higher in the group analysed than in the excluded group.</s><s>In contrast, DUs and anticentromere autoantibodies (ACA) were less frequent.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study has analysed prospectively the incidence of SSc skin manifestations in patients who present as early as 1 year after the onset of RP.</s><s>An important finding is that most patients acquire the maximal gain of skin sclerosis within 1 year after RP onset and that diffuse cutaneous involvement emerges newly in only a minority of patients after 5 years of disease onset.</s><s>This study, in which we also map the evolution of skin sclerosis at different body areas, underlines that the fibrotic process is most fulminant initially in all body areas, and is less active at later stages.</s><s>The study by Steen and Medsger also highlighted that an mRSS &gt;40 points mainly occurred in the first 3 years in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, but the study was not able to detail the evolution of skin sclerosis during the first 3-year period and to investigate the disease evolution in patients with an mRSS &lt;40 points. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>ur study confirmed that the presence of some autoantibodies is associated with the severity of skin sclerosis, as demonstrated in several cross-sectional studies. <ref type="bibr">6 19 20</ref></s><s>Although two small cross-sectional studies suggested an association between anti-RNAP-III autoantibodies and diffuse cutaneous involvement or a higher mRSS, <ref type="bibr">19 20</ref> none of these studies compared several autoantibodies simultaneously, and none of these studies highlighted the effect of anti-RNAP-III positivity on the incidence and mRSS kinetics during the early disease course.</s></p><p><s>It is still a matter of debate as to whether patients with late-age onset SSc are more likely to have limited or diffuse cutaneous SSc than patients with early-age onset SSc. <ref type="bibr">12-14 21</ref></s><s>ome investigators found no differences in the severity of skin involvement between age-of-onset groups. <ref type="bibr">14 22</ref></s><s>In line with a previously published cross-sectional analysis of our cohort, younger age at SSc onset was not associated with a higher mRSS in this longitudinal analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>he short median time to mRSS peaking and the fact that the mRSS gain is highest in the first year of disease, regardless of the magnitude of the maximal mRSS, suggest that SSc kinetics peaks within the first year in the skin despite inter-individual differences in the final severity of skin sclerosis.</s><s>Interestingly, the risk factors governing the extent and severity of skin involvement (eg, male sex and autoantibody status being associated with the development of diffuse disease) were not found to influence the disease kinetics (eg, the time to mRSS peaking).</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the rapid initial evolution of skin sclerosis, the probability to develop DUs increased more continuously over time.</s><s>In our study, only the presence of anti-TOPO, and not anti-RNAP-III autoantibodies, was associated with an increased incidence of DUs, compared with the presence of ACA.</s><s>These findings are in line with several previous studies that suggest a higher prevalence of DU in patients with anti-TOPO autoantibodies compared with patients without these autoantibodies. <ref type="bibr">6 23</ref></s><s> small retrospective cohort also suggested that patients with anti-RNAP-III autoantibodies had less peripheral vascular disease than patients with anti-TOPO autoantibodies, and similar rates to patients with ACA.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Most studies agree in the observation that DUs are less prevalent in late-age than young-age onset patients.</s><s><ref type="bibr">6 9 10 12-14</ref> The univariate analysis of our prospective study also highlights a higher DU incidence in patients who are young at disease onset, but interestingly this association was lost after controlling for sex and autoantibody status.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of our investigation are the large sample size and the longitudinal multinational nature of our cohort.</s><s>The mRSS score has been validated as a reliable outcome measure and demonstrated large effect sizes and sensitivity to change. <ref type="bibr">3 4</ref></s><s>A somewhat smaller effect size must be taken into account when interpreting skin scores of isolated body sites, and the mRSS interobserver variability must be accounted for when interpreting cohort data.</s><s>We also only analysed patients who had been recruited into EUSTAR within the first year after RP onset, thereby simulating an inception cohort.</s><s>This selection and the fact that we only recruited patients who fulfilled the ACR classification criteria for SSc is, however, also a limitation of this study, as evidenced by the high prevalence of risk factors generally attributed to an adverse outcome (male sex and anti-TOPO positivity) in the patients included, as compared with those excluded. <ref type="bibr">6 15 25</ref></s><s>As a consequence, the patients included had a comparatively higher median mRSS and more often diffuse cutaneous involvement at the baseline visit.</s><s>Therefore, the results of our study must not be generalised to patients who present with SSc later than 1 year after RP onset.</s><s>It should be also noted that the temporal evolution of skin manifestations might be underestimated, as some patients already had skin sclerosis at baseline.</s><s>By including in this study only patients with a baseline visit within 1 year after RP onset, we tried to keep this effect low.</s><s>In future studies, it may be interesting to follow patients who only meet the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism, and not the ACR classification, criteria for SSc to study drug effects.</s></p><p><s>Our study, nevertheless, critically contributes to the management of those patients with SSc who present early after RP onset.</s><s>By mapping the temporal evolution of skin sclerosis and DUs and identifying risk factors early during the disease course, our findings will enable physicians to more accurately counsel patients with SSc presenting early.</s><s>The long-term prospective data on the large number of EUSTAR patients presented here will facilitate the design of clinical trials aiming to prevent disease evolution as well as those evaluating new diagnostic tests and therapeutic strategies.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
