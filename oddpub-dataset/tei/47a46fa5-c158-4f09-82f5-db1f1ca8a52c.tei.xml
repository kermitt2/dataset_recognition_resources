<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>OCT has recently made it possible to explore changes in ocular layers as axial progresses and the globe is stretched.</s><s>These findings consist of dehiscence of retinal layers known as retinoschisis, tractional ILM detachment, macular holes (lamellar and full thickness), posterior retinal detachment and choroidal neovascular membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>According to these OCT findings, patients in this study were separated into 3 groups.</s><s>This study showed that HMMH eyes without subretinal fluid (Groups 1 and 2) obtained better postoperative anatomical and functional outcomes than eyes with subretinal fluid (Group 3).</s><s>In addition, the HMMH patients with ERM traction, retinoschisis (Group 1) regained more visual function than patients with full-thickness macular holes (Group 2).</s><s>This result suggests that subretinal fluid represents an advanced damage stage.</s><s>Other research groups have also reported this observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, Group 1 through 3 approximated HMMH at varying severities stage in its natural course.</s><s>Indeed, preoperative IS/OS defects, BCVA and RS all differed significantly among the three groups, providing clinical significance for the grouping of patients performed in our study.</s></p><p><s>The integrity of inner and outer segments of photoreceptors (IS/OS) is closely related to visual recovery after successful MH closure surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Visual acuity is generally used as a gold standard to indicate visual function, although it represents only one aspect.</s><s>In this study, microperimetry was applied to quantify foveal and perifoveal retinal sensitivity and correlate these results to the microstructural findings in HMMH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, we used the IS/OS defect as an anatomical parameter and BCVA and retinal sensitivity (RS) as functional parameters to evaluate the relationship between microstructure and function in the HMMH eyes that underwent surgery.</s></p><p><s>We found that in all 3 groups, the IS/OS defect decreased significantly as time progressed, indicating a potential regeneration of photoreceptors.</s><s>Similarly, BCVA and RS measurements gradually reached significant improvement after surgery.</s><s>Interestingly, the preoperative IS/OS defect was significantly correlated with both the preoperative and postoperative BCVA and RS values (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Although great care must be taken with small patient cohorts, our study revealed the potential prognostic value of the size of the IS/OS defect in conjunction with other known factors (e.g., retinal or RPE atrophy) and the preoperative diameters of macular holes.</s><s>Furthermore, 52.9 % (9 of 17 eyes) eyes in Group 1 approached postoperative closure, only 16.7 % (2 of 12 eyes) in Group 2 and 0 in Group 3 at 9 months after surgery.</s><s>The minimum preoperative diameter of IS/OS defect in each group was 305.88 μm in Group 1, 1258.82 μm in Group 2, and 2317.64 μm in Group 3. As this parameter has showed a potential prognostic value, this result explained the significant differences in postoperative closure rates between groups.</s></p><p><s>Subretinal fluid is a generally regarded as a negatively prognostic complication of HMMH, because, in theory, chronic fluid may aggravate damage to photoreceptors.</s><s>Assuming that subretinal fluid is a severity-dependent complication in the evolution of HMMH, it is even more important to perform effective surgery at a less damage stage for optimal postoperative functional recovery and restoration.</s><s>Our study suggests that the appearance of ERM traction and consequent retinoschisis without subretinal fluid in HMMH, indicates a better prognosis for surgical intervention.</s><s>Although some patients may show no subjective symptoms for years at this stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, visual acuity impairment should indicate surgery in the affected eye.</s></p><p><s>Based on its low complication rate, transconjunctival 23-gauge (23G) pars plana vitrectomy, as performed in our cases, was an effective treatment for HMMH.</s><s>Nonetheless, our study lacks long-term results exceeding 9 months.</s><s>Indeed, vitrectomy in myopic cases is associated with a postoperative risk for retinal detachment and subsequent visual loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, which we fortunately did not observe within these 9 months.</s><s>Generally, MH closure is less frequently observed following vitrectomy in HMMH compared to emmetropic cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>These less favorable results may be explained by the presence of persistent macular traction because of continued elongation and staphyloma formation in pathologic myopia.</s><s>Based on this hypothesis, other groups have suggested that an additional procedure, such as an episcleral macular buckle, may be useful to counteract the posterior traction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Although a variety of procedures are available for HMMH, there is still no unified standard treatment method.</s><s>Therefore, additional longer-term studies are required.</s><s>ICG toxicity and damage to the retina has been reported in in vitro and in vivo studies, and following macular surgery.</s><s>Toxic effects can occur to retinal glial cells, to the nerve fiber layer, to retinal ganglion cells, and to the optic nerve.</s><s>ICG at concentrations higher than 1.25 % or application of the dye in air are very likely causing retinal damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, a concentration of was applied in every case with a less than 30 seconds dyeing time to minimize the ICG toxicity as far as possible.</s></p><p><s>Our study has a number of limitations.</s><s>First, none of the eyes in Group 3 and very few in Group 2 closed, whereas the postoperative BCVA were all significantly improved.</s><s>This may result from the underestimation of the preoperative visual acuity due to cataract.</s><s>The improved paracentral vision thanks to the regeneration of IS/OS structure as time progressed could also be a part of the explanation.</s><s>Second, ICG toxicity and damage to the retina has been reported in in vitro and in vivo studies, and following macular surgery.</s><s>Toxic effects can occur to retinal glial cells, to the nerve fiber layer, to retinal ganglion cells, and to the optic nerve.</s><s>ICG at concentrations higher than 1.25 % or application of the dye in air are very likely causing retinal damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, a concentration of was applied in every case with a less than 30 seconds dyeing time to minimize the ICG toxicity as far as possible.</s><s>Third, this study lacks longterm results exceeding 9 months.</s><s>Further prospective, long-term study would be needed for detection of further anatomical and functional changes.</s></p></div>
