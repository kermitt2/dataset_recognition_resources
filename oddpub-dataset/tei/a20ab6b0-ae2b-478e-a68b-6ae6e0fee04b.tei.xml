<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>The science of sitting and sedentariness, which comprises research on behaviors such as TV viewing, sitting at work and sitting for transport, is considered an emerging public health field.</s><s>Evidence on the health risks of sitting is accumulating, with studies among large cohorts of adults showing detrimental effects of sitting on allcause mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, cardio metabolic risk profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Too much sitting can thus be hazardous to population health, even though its health implications seem to be attenuated by physical activity participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Similar to trends in the US and the UK, sitting time of Asian adults, such as Chinese and Indians, is predicted to rise over the next decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, current research among adults from other countries in Asia found that they engage in high levels of sitting too.</s><s>For example, results from a Singapore population-based study showed that 37% of the 2319 participants included in the study, sat for at least 8 h a day <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>These figures correspond with another study done in Japan, in which adults' self-reported average sitting time was 8.4 h a day, and accelerometer data collected among the same participants showed an average sitting time of 8.8 h a day <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recent research among both Western and Asian working adults found that occupational sitting time contributed greatly toward daily sitting time <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>In modern, technologically advanced and automated societies, it is no surprise that adults spend a large proportion of their working time sitting at their desks or in meetings.</s><s>Subjective and objective assessment of sitting in office workers further showed that participants accumulated higher levels of sitting time on working days compared to non-working days <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, and that they had fewer breaks from sitting during working hours compared to non-working hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>It is still largely unclear whether occupational sitting time has a more profound effect on health than e.g., leisure time sitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, which is a more frequently examined domain of sitting.</s><s>Nevertheless, the workplace could be a key setting in which to reduce adults' sitting time and occupational sitting may therefore be of specific interest to researchers around the globe.</s></p><p><s>To support the development of effective intervention programs to reduce sitting time, O'Donoghue and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review summarizing the evidence on individual, social, environmental and policy-related correlates and determinants of sitting in adult populations.</s><s>They reported that individual level factors such as older age, low physical activity levels, high body mass index (BMI) and female gender have often been examined and all seem to be associated with having higher sitting time.</s><s>Yet, of the 74 studies that were included in this review, the vast majority was based on data from the US, Europe or Australia.</s><s>Only four studies were conducted in Asia: three in Japan and one in Hong Kong.</s><s>Research on sitting has predominantly been done in Western cohorts, and the emphasis has largely been on assessing sitting prevalence and/or its health effects.</s><s>To further progress this field, research needs to focus on more diverse, non-Western populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and the identification of factors influencing sitting behaviors.</s></p><p><s>In this context, the research aims of the current study are: a) to describe the socio-demographic and lifestyle correlates of different domains of sitting, namely occupational, leisure and total sitting in a large cohort from Singapore; b) to investigate potential differences in correlates of sitting time among Chinese, Malay and Indian subgroups; and c) to explore, in light of the suggested non-linear relationship of sitting and health risks, whether correlates of sitting time are consistent for continuous versus dichotomous (low/high) outcomes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The Multi-Ethnic Cohort (MEC) was formed by amalgamating two existing population-based cohorts recruited between 2004 and 2007: the Singapore Prospective Study Program (SP2) and the Singapore Cardiovascular Cohort Study (SCCS2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, with additional recruitment of participants from 2007 to 2010.</s><s>The SP2 and SCCS2 recruited 8340 participants from four previous cross-sectional studies: In addition to the participants from SP2 and SCCS2, a further 6125 Singapore residents were recruited into the MEC study through public outreach and referrals from existing cohort members.</s><s>Invitation to participate was opened to any Singapore citizens or long-term residents aged 21 to 75 years old.</s><s>Recruitment drives were carried out at community events, mosques and temples to enrich the proportion of Malay and Indian participants.</s><s>Due to the complex nature of the different recruitment strategies, tracking of response and eligibility were not feasible.</s><s>People who have or had heart disease, stroke, cancer and renal failure were excluded from participation in the MEC.</s><s>Furthermore, for this study, participants who were not working over the past 12 months (n = 5088) or had missing data on working status (n = 8) were excluded from the analyses.</s><s>Those without data on sitting time (n = 4) were excluded from the analyses too.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection and outcome measures</head><p><s>All MEC participants were visited and interviewed at home by trained interviewers.</s><s>The approximately onehour long interview included information on sociodemographic details, medication use, medical history, family history of disease, environmental tobacco exposure, use of tobacco and alcohol, diet, physical activity, sitting time and health-related quality of life.</s><s>Participants were also invited to attend a physical examination, which included blood and urine collection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent variables: sitting time</head><p><s>Questions on sitting time were modified from the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> and the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Participants reported the average hours per day they spent sitting down while at work over the past three months, and during leisure time on week days and weekend days.</s><s>Occupational sitting time was derived for each occupation reported by the participants, acknowledging that one person may hold two or more jobs.</s><s>The reported number of hours was multiplied by the number of days per week workedfor that specific joband then divided by 7. Occupational sitting time was calculated for both part-time and full-time workers.</s><s>Leisure sitting time was calculated by collating the time spent sitting during free time on week days and weekend days.</s><s>Values were weighted (5× for week day sitting and 2× for weekend day sitting, divided by 7) to get an accurate estimate for leisure sitting time per day.</s><s>Total sitting time was calculated by summing the values from occupational and leisure sitting.</s><s>For the current study, all domains of sitting were expressed in hours per day.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent variables: socio-demographics and lifestyle</head><p><s>Socio-demographic variables were self-reported by questionnaire and included age <ref type="bibr">(21-30, 31-40, 41</ref>-50, 51-60, 61+ years), gender (males, females), ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, Indian), marital status (married, never married, separated/divorced/widowed), and level of education (no formal or primary education, secondary education, A'level, university and above).</s><s>Lifestyle variables were also self-reported by questionnaire and included smoking, caloric intake derived from diet and leisure time physical activity (LTPA).</s></p><p><s>Smoking status was sorted into three groups: nonsmokers, former smokers, and current smokers.</s><s>Nonsmokers were categorized as those who had never smoked in their life, or who had previously smoked, but not for 30 days or more continuously.</s><s>Former smokers were those who had smoked for 30 days or more continuously in the past, but had since quit.</s><s>Current smokers were those that reported that they were currently smoking.</s></p><p><s>Physical activity was assessed with the SP2 Physical Activity questionnaire (SP2PAQ), which was adapted from several established questionnaires validated in other populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>The SP2PAQ has a recall period of the previous 3 months and encompasses transportation, occupation, leisure time and household activities.</s><s>For the current study, we only included moderate-tovigorous LTPA, which has been used widely as a general indicator of physical activity.</s><s>To categorize participants, those with no LTPA were clustered in the '0' group, while remaining participants who did engage in LTPA were split into two groups based on the median value as calculated in MET-h/week (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To assess diet, the MEC questionnaire utilized a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that was validated in the Singaporean context <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>The FFQ asked about past month consumption frequency of a large variety of food groups, including rice, noodles, vegetables and bean curd, meat, seafood, desserts and local snacks etc. From the raw data, total caloric intake (Kcal/day) was computed.</s><s>To determine the cut-offs for consumption amounts, we used quartiles and split the data into four groups for each gender separately, accounting for sex differences in caloric consumption.</s><s>Values of quartiles for males were (in Kcal/day): 550.56 to 1791.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Descriptive statistics (mean and SD, or proportions) were derived for all dependent and independent variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>).</s><s>Missing data were only present in the marital status (n = 4), education (n = 2) and smoking (n = 1) variables, and were kept as missings in the analyses.</s><s>All sitting time distributions were checked and diagnosis plots revealed a slight right-skew.</s><s>Due to the large sample size and variation, along with homoscedasticity, non-normality of outcome variables was considered negligible and sitting time was not transformed in the analyses.</s><s>We tested for effect modification by ethnicity (data not shown), and based on these findings, multivariable regression models were used to examine associations between socio-demographics and lifestyle and all domains of sitting time, for the entire sample and subsequently stratified for Chinese, Malay and Indian participants.</s><s>Additional multivariable regression models were used to examine the association between socio-demographic and lifestyle factors and dichotomized sitting time, i.e., for the 'low' sitting versus the 'high' sitting group.</s><s>Cut-offs were taken from Chau et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>: &lt;8 h/day versus ≥8 h/day for total sitting time and &lt;4 h/day versus ≥4 h/day for occupational and leisure sitting time since they contributed roughly equal parts to total sitting time.</s><s>All multivariable models were corrected for the independent variables listed above, as well as total working time in hours per day.</s><s>For example, the association of age with occupational sitting time was adjusted for gender, ethnicity, marital status, education, smoking, diet, physical activity and total working time.</s><s>To assess whether there were ethnic differences between 'low' and 'high' sitting groups (using the cut-offs above), chi-squared tests were used.</s><s>Participants of non-Chinese, non-Malay and non-Indian ethnicity (n = 31) were retained in the total sample analyses, but results were not presented in the main analyses tables (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2, 3</ref>, 4 and 5) due to their small numbers.</s><s>To test the robustness of our results, all multivariable models were repeated for participants who were considered to work full-time, i.e., ≥38 h/wk.</s><s>(n = 8034).</s><s>Results from these analyses were compared with the results of the original sample (n = 9384), which also included part-time workers.</s></p><p><s>To check for selection bias, we compared the full MEC dataset (n = 14,476) with our final sample on key socio-demographic variables using chi-squared tests.</s><s>All analyses were conducted with R statistical software version 3.4.1,</s><s>and findings were considered statistically significant if p &lt; 0.05.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlates of sitting</head><p><s>Our results on correlates of sitting across the entire sample are generally in line with those reported in the systematic review of O'Donoghue and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in which evidence was presented for associations of older age, being female and smoking with higher sitting time.</s><s>O'Donoghue et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> also considered diet to be associated with higher sitting time, though the studies that were included in the review assessed consumption of high calorie snacks and not daily caloric intake.</s><s>According to the authors, associations of marital status with sitting time were mixed, while our analyses showed that those who were never married, compared to married participants, had higher sitting time.</s><s>They also mentioned that socio-economic status was possibly the most consistent indicator of sitting.</s><s>Likewise, betas of educational level on sitting time were relatively large among our sample compared to those of other explanatory variables.</s><s>Overall, it may be concluded that the sociodemographic and lifestyle factors that influence sitting time in an Asian population, are fairly similar to those in more Western-oriented populations.</s><s>One exception is the engagement in LTPA, which we found to be associated with higher sitting time instead of lower sitting time but associations were inconsistent with small betas.</s><s>For overall physical activity, O'Donoghue <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and colleagues reported that the majority of included studies found an inverse association with sitting.</s><s>It may be that those who sit more try to compensate for this by engaging in greater LTPA.</s><s>Alternatively, higher education could be partly responsible for the association between LTPA and higher sitting time, which would be consistent with findings across the European region showing that higher socio-economic status (mainly derived from education level) is correlated with both higher sitting time and higher LTPA engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Generally, we would like to highlight that the observed differences in prevalence and correlates of sitting time between our study and the (cohort) studies described above may be due to other factors than those already mentioned.</s><s>Possible influential factors include the type of sample analysed (representative sample versus longitudinal/cross-sectional cohorts), differences in population characteristics (multi-ethnic versus primarily one ethnicity), the way occupational sitting time was calculated and expressed, and also the fact that Singapore being a city state with a very consistent environment may have less diversity in the environment individuals are exposed to compared to larger countries.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Domain-specific sitting</head><p><s>One of the most important features of our study is the ability to distinguish between the associations of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors with occupational and leisure time sitting, showing associations in opposite directions for both sitting domains.</s><s>Our analyses showed that these associations were highly depending on the domain of sitting assessed.</s><s>For example, those of older age spent more time in occupational sitting, but less time in leisure time sitting.</s><s>Women engaged in higher occupational and total sitting time, but in lower leisure sitting time, compared to men.</s><s>For those who were separated, widowed or divorced, or smokers, the association pointed in the opposite direction: less occupational sitting time, but more leisure sitting time.</s><s>Educational level and engaging in LTPA were associated with higher sitting, except for leisure time sitting and occupational sitting, respectively.</s><s>These findings highlight the need to focus on separate domains of sitting when trying to identify determinants of this behavior, as different sitting time domains might be associated with different factors.</s><s>Recently validated self-report instruments offer the opportunity to assess sitting in different contexts such as at work, during travel, while watching TV (for leisure), while using the computer (for leisure), with the possibility to further focus on week-versus weekend days or working-versus non-working days <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Busschaert et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref> evaluated an even more detailed contextspecific sedentary behavior questionnaire, which also included sitting to e.g., care for (grand) children, making phone calls and/or having meals.</s><s>Researchers are encouraged to use more comprehensive tools for the identification of important factors influencing sitting time.</s><s>Yet, it should be acknowledged that such tools may come at the expense of 'higher' assessed sitting levels, making comparisons to previous studies more difficult.</s></p><p><s>In addition, our findings indicate that the content of intervention programs should be tailored to domain-specific sitting rather than to sitting in general.</s><s>Around the globe, interest in such approaches is increasing.</s><s>For example, a review summarized 20 controlled trials which tested the effect of interventions to reduce sitting time at work, e.g., the use of sit-stand desks or treadmill work stations, providing computer prompts, and/or counselling <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Although the database search was not limited to an earliest publication date, all studies were conducted relatively recently, between 2009 and 2015.</s><s>Yet, the authors concluded that there is a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of any type of intervention in the workplace, and they urged researchers to conduct cluster-randomised trials with a sufficient sample size and long-term follow-up to tackle this issue.</s><s>Another systematic review and meta-analyses presented a more positive picture i.e., when pooling the intervention effects of selected studies, a significant reduction in workplace sitting for intervention groups was found.</s><s>Interventions including multiple components such as education plus environmental changes reported the greatest decrease in sitting time <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, one criticalbut missing from the current studycomponent influencing occupational sitting time is job type.</s><s>Previous research has repeatedly shown an association of white collar/professional occupations with higher occupational sitting time <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Future studies on sedentary behavior should account for this.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continuous versus dichotomous outcomes of sitting</head><p><s>When sitting time was analyzed as a dichotomous outcome, results were fairly comparable to the results from the multivariable models with a continuous outcome.</s><s>Yet, significant associations of most age groups with occupational sitting time disappeared.</s><s>This was also the case for significant associations of gender and LTPA with leisure sitting time, and marital status and LTPA with total sitting time.</s><s>Additional significant associations were found for educational level and leisure sitting time (those with a secondary education had higher odds to be in the 'high' sitting group) and diet and occupational and leisure sitting time (those with higher daily caloric intake had higher odds to be in the 'high' sitting group).</s><s>It is generally accepted that sitting in itself is not a problem, but high levels of sitting are.</s><s>Hence, the associations from dichotomous analyses may be more informative for intervention development.</s><s>Yet, it has to be noted that there is no consensus on the cut-off for sitting too much, nevertheless we used a cut-off from a recent meta-analysis, which provides one of the first indications of how much sitting might be considered unhealthy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Researchers should take into account that such cut-offs are highly influenced by assessment methods, as e.g., accelerometry and domain-specific sitting questionnaires will give substantially higher sitting estimates than single item sitting questions such as those used in our study.</s></p></div>
