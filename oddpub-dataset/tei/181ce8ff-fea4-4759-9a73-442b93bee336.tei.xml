infrequent pandemics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 as well as the Asian flu of 1957 and the Hongkong flu in 1968 pandemics caused the death of millions of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In 2009 the pandemic swine origin influenza A H1N1 virus as well as the outbreak of H7N9 in China in 2013 has reminded the world of

target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The genome of influenza virus consists of eight segmented negative RNA strands.</s><s>The envelope bilayer harbors the two spike glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), and the M2 proton channel.</s><s>The homotrimeric HA is the most abundant protein on the viral surface.</s><s>It mediates attachment to the host cell surface via binding to sialic acid (SA) residues of cellular receptors, and upon endocytic virus uptake it triggers fusion of the envelope with the endosomal membrane releasing the viral genome into the cytoplasm.</s><s>NA cleaves glycosidic bonds with terminal SA facilitating the release of budding virions from the cell.</s></p><p><s>In diagnostics, antibodies against spike proteins are the preferred tool for identification and serotyping of viruses.</s><s>Development of therapeutic antibodies against influenza is a challenge, as the high viral mutation rate (antigenic drift) and genetic reassortment of the virus genome (antigenic shift) continuously lead to new strains escaping from neutralization by antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>.</s><s>This goes along with adaptation to small molecule inhibitors (e.g.</s><s>oseltamivir) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Vaccines can only temporarily control the recurring epidemics of influenza, because antigenic changes are typical for HA and NA.</s><s>16 avian and 2 bat serotypes of influenza A virus HA (H1-H18) are known, but only three (H1, H2, and H3) have been adapted to humans.</s><s>Antibodies binding to regions of hemagglutinin conserved among serotypes have been developed which demonstrated broad specificity and neutralization potency <ref type="bibr"

specifically to the spike proteins can be produced in automated high-throughput synthesis at low costs.</s><s>HA-binding peptides have been recently obtained by phage display, lead structure

more epitope-oriented accession to binding peptides is the search for paratope-derived peptides from variable regions of specific antibodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Antibodies against HA have been described, and at least 6 antigenic sites (A-F) on the HA-trimer have been identified, localized either at the receptor binding site, the interface of the three HA-monomers, or at

finding, we chose linear peptides corresponding to the CDRs of VH of monoclonal antibody HC19, having the majority of contacts with the HA1 domain of the strain A/Aichi/2/1968 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27]</ref>.</s><s>The antibody and the derived peptides bind to HA at the SA binding site, in particular to the 130-loop and the 190-helix, which belong to the antigenic sites A and B, respectively.</s><s>This binding site is conserved among several HA serotypes providing a basis for a peptide with broader specificity <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selection of antibody-derived peptides</head><p><s>Our aim was to obtain peptide inhibitors that recognize the conserved region of the sialic acid binding pocket of HA with a broader specificity to cover several influenza virus strains.</s><s>The three CDRs of the VH-chain of antibody HC19 against hemagglutinin of influenza virus Aichi H3N2 were used as templates to design peptides being a potential inhibitor of virus binding to host cells.</s><s>We used complementary experimental approaches as SPR and peptide microarrays, and MD to select appropriate peptides and to enhance their affinity to HA by site directed substitutions of amino acids.</s><s>This was validated by assessing their potential to prevent virus binding to cell surfaces and, eventually, infection of host cells.</s></p><p><s>Three peptides-PeA, PeB and PeC-have been derived from the three CDR sequences of the HC19 antibody's heavy chain.</s><s>In agreement with predictions from our MD calculations of peptide-HA complexes, we found by SPR experiments that binding of surface immobilized peptide PeB to HA from Aichi H3N2 was superior to PeC (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, and as PeB matches the conserved sialic acid binding site better than PeC (PDB 2vir) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>, subsequent studies were performed with PeB and its derivatives.</s><s>Inhibition of virus binding to surface immobilized fetuin and 2,6'-sialyllactose by PeB confirmed the specific binding of the peptides to the sialic acid binding pocket of HA.</s><s>The IC 50 values are in the range of 75-120 μM, depending on the assay, which is about one order of magnitude lower than the IC 50 of α-2,6-sialyllactose.</s></p><p><s>An important observation which may be also of interest for upcoming studies is that we found specific binding of viruses to surface immobilized peptides consisting only of amino acids representing the PeB core sequence, and a four lysine long linker (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Nevertheless, PeB and its derivatives harboring only those amino acids which are essential for the recognition of SA are presumably not efficient binders in their monomeric form.</s><s>The affinities of the peptides are in the micromolar range, whereas the reported K D value of antibody HC19 binding to hemagglutinin from Aichi H3N2 is 28 ± 8 nM <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[47]</ref>.</s><s>However, weak binding interactions for such shorter monomeric peptides could be enhanced by a multivalent interaction as it occurs very likely in the SPR based experiments, where binding of even 6.5Á10 8 viruses ml -1 to immobilized PeB could be detected (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Extensions of the C-and N-termini of the CDR sequences could be important for (i) the formation of a stable peptide structure, which exposes the CDR loop region in its native arrangement or (ii) direct involvement in binding and foster interaction with HA.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substitutional analysis and improvement of binding affinity of PeB</head><p><s>According to the MD simulations PeB adopts a strand-loop-strand conformation with the loop consisting of residues D6 to Y11.</s><s>As shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>, residues within and adjacent to the loop (Y5 to Y12) include the residues yielding the largest contributions to the binding free energy.</s><s>Most of these contributions are attractive (negative free energies changes) but some are also repulsive (positive free energies changes).</s><s>The contributions of each amino acid to the free energy calculated by MM-PBSA were largely consistent with the results of microarray-based substitutional analysis, despite the described discrepancy for D8.</s><s>Possibly, substitution of D8 changes the secondary structure leading to a lower affinity.</s></p><p><s>In the light of improving the affinity of PeB and to enable a broader specificity we also probed the binding of the peptide to HA of other virus strains by microarray-based substitutional analysis.</s><s>We identified that Y11 is also an important residue for improving binding.</s><s>Based on that, we investigated the affinity of selected variants of PeB having two substitutions.</s></p><p><s>In this screen, we identified PeB GF as the best binder.</s><s>The two substitutions, D6G and Y11F, altered the ligand moiety and its binding contacts, resulting in favorable changes to the contribution to the free energy change of residues 6, 8 and 10 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>The mutation of residue 6 (D6G), replacing a charged amino acid by a neutral one, resulted in two major changes.</s><s>Firstly, it induces a decrease of its own electrostatic contribution to the binding free energy, but such a change is largely overcome by an increase in the contribution to the polar solvation free energy change (S3 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>On the other hand, one should notice that residues 6 and 8 are located in close contact to each other in the loop region.</s><s>As a consequence for PeB, this involves repulsive interaction between two negatively charged residues (D6 and D8).</s><s>The replacement of D6 by an uncharged residue in PeB GF probably induces a slight reorganization in the loop structure, favoring van der Waals and polar solvation interaction contributions between this residue and the HA moieties (S3 Fig).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibition of virus binding and infection by peptides</head><p><s>Due to its orientation towards the SA binding region of HA, CDR3 sequences of antibody HC19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27]</ref> against HA of Aichi H3N2 are promising candidates for getting variants with broad influenza strain specificities.</s><s>Indeed, both peptides PeB and PeB GF were found to bind to HA of other strains (Rostock H7N1, New York H3N2, and California H1N1).</s><s>It is worth to note that all HAs of different influenza subtypes, which could be bound and inhibited by peptides PeB or PeB GF reveal strong structural similarities, especially for those amino acids involved in peptide binding (S2 Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s><s>This close relation supports the wide binding ability and inhibitory potency of PeB for a variety of influenza A strains.</s></p><p><s>Such broader specificity is also supported by the similarity between the VH-CDR3 of the mouse antibodies against Aichi H3N2 hemagglutinin in PDB 1ken (antibody HC63, amino acids 97-109: AAFYYDYDFFFDY) and PDB 2vir, antibody HC19,

too.</s><s>A similar observation was made for Rostock H7N1 when using the microneutralization assay, which provides a direct measure for viral replication.</s><s>However, for Aichi H3N2 we did not find a preference for PeB GF indicating strain dependent differences of the antiviral potential of the peptides.</s></p><p><s>The inhibitory potential of our antibody derived peptides demonstrated a remarkable performance compared to other published peptides binding to HA (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>).</s><s>As summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>, PeB and PeB GF provides better inhibition against Aichi H3N2 compared to Rostock H7N1, with the exception of the results from the HAI assay.</s><s>However, we should take into consideration that the performance of a peptide as inhibitor depends on many factors.</s><s>As a consequence, the hemagglutination inhibition efficiency may not necessarily be stronger against Aichi H3N2, even though the peptide was derived from an antibody binding to this influenza strain.</s><s>One can speculate that Rostock H7N1 is more prone to neutralization by blocking this binding site, while for Aichi H3N2 PeB and PeB GF can be displaced more easily in a binding competition experiment with erythrocytes.</s><s>This trend could also be explained by the use of erythrocytes derived from different species (see Material and Methods).</s><s>Similar strain-dependent efficiencies have been obtained by López-Martinez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Although a peptide was designed against broadly conserved epitopes, the antiviral efficiency was not the same against all tested serotypes (three different H1N1 strains and H5N2).</s></p><p><s>Short oligomeric biomolecules with sufficient affinity are of high interest for diagnostics and drug design, as development, synthesis and further chemical modifications are easy to implement.</s></p><p><s>Linear short CDR derived peptides as used here can be expected to differ from the loop structure they adopt within the antibody, leading to lower affinity.</s><s>However, there are promising ways to largely improve them.</s><s>Cyclisation of CDR peptides using a D-Pro-L-Pro template has been shown to force them into canonical conformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>.</s><s>In this report, the L3 loop of the HC19 antibody adopted a hairpin structure and an aromatic T-stacking as in the antibody crystal structure.</s><s>This and other strategies to generate peptidomimetics by stabilizing or
