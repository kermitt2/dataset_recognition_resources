<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>The congenital cleft lip with or without cleft palate belongs to one of the most common and important congenital malformations resulting in an anomaly of the lip, nose, and face.</s><s>Its incidence varies according to geographical and ethical belonging.</s><s>In Europe, between 1/500 and 1/700 babies are born with clefts of the lip or palate, or both. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref></s><s>The proportion of male patients increases, as lesion and defects are more severe.</s><s>Functional impairments include nutritional problems, speech disorders, recurrent middle-ear infection, misalignment of teeth, and nasal breathing problems.</s><s>In addition to functional impairments, the aesthetical stigma of nasal and lip deformity has an undeniable influence on the affected patient's life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>t can lead to social retraction and exclusion as well as primary and consecutive psychological problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>ffective treatment is important and one key is surgery aiming to reconstruct an appearance as close to normal as possible. <ref type="bibr">2</ref></s><s>The surgery should include functional improvements as well to support a normal self-perception. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Examples for this are a reconstruction of the palate to enable normal eating and drinking, placement of middle-ear drainage tubes to improve hearing and to support normal speech development, and correction of nasal breathing problems by functional septo-rhinoplasty.</s></p><p><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Although important, these methods are not sufficient if used without any further references.</s><s>Patient-reported outcome measures that include aesthetic results, speech, functionality, self-image, incorporation into society, and quality of life (QOL) provide surgeons with a more comprehensive assessment of surgical outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>The main consequences of a cleft lip and or palate are facial and functional impairments that seem to be intimately related to difficulties in psychosocial functioning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>t is of high interest to investigate if efforts to reduce aesthetic and functional impairments by rhinoplasty (single or multiple) can result in a reduction in interpersonal problems and an increased satisfaction with appearance and QOL.</s><s>For measuring health-related QOL, a number of measures are available.</s><s>Only a few of them are directed specifically toward cosmetic surgery to asses concerns about physical appearance and that are sensitive to the outcome of appearancealtering effects of surgical treatment.</s></p><p><s>The Derriford scales have been designed to meet this need and are extensively studied, demonstrating excellent validity, reliability, and internal consistency in both clinical and general populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>There are two versions of the scale: the Derriford Appearance Scale 24 (DAS-24), a short form composed of 24 items, and the Derriford Appearance Scale 59 (DAS-59), a longer form containing 59 items. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Both scales are designed to generate a comprehensive assessment of the disruption represented by the score obtained through the scales.</s><s>A higher score is associated with a higher degree of image-related distress and dysfunction.</s><s>The DAS-59 thus generates a full-scale score and five factorial subscale scores of which three are not feature specific (general self-consciousness of appearance [GSC], social self-consciousness of appearance [SSC], and negative self-concept [NSC]) and two are feature specific (sexual and bodily self-consciousness of appearance [SBSC] and facial self-consciousness of appearance [FSC]). <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>he DAS-24 generates a single score without a factorial structure and its detail, but still maintains a strong relationship with the original factorial scale. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>As an acceptable short form of the original DAS-59, it also is widely applicable, psychometrically robust, and discriminates well between patient groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Both scales meet the need for an objective measure of the spectrum of psychological distress and dysfunction that is characteristic of disfigurements, deformities, and aesthetic problems of appearance.</s><s>The scores are highly sensitive as a measure of change following surgical treatment with large and significant preoperative-postoperative reductions in full scale and, for the DAS-59, the factorial scores of patients treated for facial features or bodily/sexual features. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Furthermore, a patient's score can be compared with normative data available for a clinical and/or general populations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Previous studies showed an increase of patient satisfaction after secondary rhinoplasty in cleft lip patients using the validated Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE) questionnaire. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Results showed a significant improvement in both aesthetic appearance/self-perception and nasal breathing.</s><s>Interestingly, the improvement in aesthetic appearance was judged more as successful. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>It was therefore of great concern to investigate the distress and dysfunction in relation to self-consciousness of appearance using DAS-59 and DAS-24 in patients with a cleft lip-palate before and after undergoing rhinoplasty.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, the objective of this study was to investigate if one or multiple rhinoplasties in patients with a cleft lippalate result in an improved QOL as measured by the DAS-59 that ideally would be as close as possible to what a control group perceives as normal.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>The surgical patient database of the Academisch Medisch Center (AMC), Amsterdam, the Netherlands, was searched for patients who were diagnosed with uni-or bilateral cleft lippalate who had received one or several rhinoplasties between October 2004 and May 2011 with the aim to improve and at best to normalize facial appearance.</s><s>Typically, prior to rhinoplasty, a closure of a cleft lip and palate had already been performed and was followed by one or several rhinoplasties according to a strategy proposed by us earlier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Sixty-one patients could be retrieved with complete contact information.</s><s>Those patients who were not in active treatment or do not have any sort of dependency at the AMC were contacted via mail stating that participation in the study was completely voluntary and anonymous; the former surgeons were blinded for participation and responses and that data would only be used for the purpose of statistical analysis and subsequent publication in a scientific journal.</s><s>They were asked to complete the DAS-59 questionnaire from the perspective before and after the last rhinoplasty.</s><s>Nonrespondents were given reminders via telephone by a nurse.</s><s>Of the 61 patients, 26 returned complete questionnaires (13 females and 13 males) with an average age of 31.</s><s>The youngest patient was 12 years old and the oldest patient was 63 years old.</s><s>The average time passed after the last surgery was 3.9 years with a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 6 years after the surgery.</s><s>Therefore in the view of the authors, in all cases sufficient time after surgery had passed to allow complete healing and to assume a concluded settling into the altered body image.</s><s>Twenty-three of the respondents were of Caucasian origin, two were Dutch-Surinamese (a multi-ethnic state with African, Asian, and European influence), and one was of Asian background.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>Data management and statistical analysis were performed using Excel 2011 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, CA) and EpiCalc 2000 (version 1.02, freeware; Brixton Health, Brixton, UK).</s></p><p><s>The data were analyzed using within-group paired Student t-test.</s><s>For comparison with data retrieved from the literature, mean values and standard deviation were statistically compared with data published by Carr et al 11 containing a sample from the general population (n ¼ 1,001), the general population who are not concerned about appearance (n ¼ 528), and who are concerned about appearance (473).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-and Postoperative DAS-59 Scores</head><p><s>Preoperative mean DAS-59 score of 98.2 was measured that decreased significantly to 70.1 postoperatively (►Table 1).</s><s>Similarly, scores in all five subscales showed a significant decrease reflecting an improvement in the "general-, social, sexual, and bodily, as well as facial self-consciousness of appearance" and a reduction in "negative self-concept."</s></p><p><s>The most prominent reduction in percentage was found in the categories of "self-consciousness of sexual and bodily appearance" (SBSC) (48%) and of "facial appearance" (52.5%).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of DAS-59 Scores of Patients with a Cleft to a Nonclinical Population</head><p><s>To put the acquired data into a wider perspective, we compared the scores determined for the patients with a cleft with previously published scores of a "nonclinical/ general population" divided into concerned and unconcerned about their appearance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>he purpose of this comparison was to investigate if differences between the populations had changed after surgery.</s></p><p><s>A comparison between the general population unconcerned about appearance and patients with a cleft preoperatively showed a highly significant difference (p &lt; 0.001) in their distress level with full-scale DAS-59 scores of 29.2 and 98.2, respectively (►Table 2).</s><s>Similarly, the comparison of the DAS-59 subscales resulted in all cases in highly significant differences.</s></p><p><s>Surgery resulted in patients with a cleft in a reduction in the full-scale and all subscale scores, compared with the general population unconcerned about appearance indicating lower distress level.</s><s>However, only for the subscale of FSC, the reduction of the score was sufficiently high to diminish any significance.</s></p><p><s>The comparison of the general population concerned about appearance, displaying a higher level of distress, to patients with a cleft before surgery revealed a significant difference (DAS-59 score, 79.70 vs. 98.23; p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>Yet after the surgery, no significance was found for the full-scale score and the subscale scores of GSC, SCC, and FSC.</s></p><p><s>While for the subscale representing SBSC pre-operatively no difference in the score from the general population concerned about appearance was apparent, after surgery an improvement was observed that led to a significant difference (DAS-59 score, 11.45 vs. 5.04; p &lt; 0.001).</s></p><p><s>Scores for the subscale of negative self-concept remained significantly different; however, a reduction in the postoperative score could be noted.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>• The full scale and all subscale scores of the DAS-59 were significantly lower after surgery demonstrating an improvement in all categories.</s><s>• Postoperatively, no difference in FSC between the unconcerned population and concerned population was apparent.</s><s>• The postoperative subscores for FSC, SSC, and GSC showed no difference from those obtained from a population concerned about appearance.</s><s>• The postoperative subscore for SBSC indicated improvement beyond the level found in the concerned control population.</s><s>• Due to only a low improvement in the NSC subscore, a statistically significant difference to the concerned population remained, possibly indicating that therapy beyond surgery is needed.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Comparison of pre-and postoperative DAS-59 scores</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Factor</cell></row></table><note><p><s>a p &lt; 0.001, one tailed Student t-test.Facial Plastic Surgery Vol.</s><s>32 No. 2/2016 Long-Term Follow-up of Patients with a Cleft Lip-Palate after Rhinoplasty Albers et al. 221</s></p></note></figure>
