<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Health literacy describes the personal motivation and ability to access, appraise, and use health information to judge and decide upon healthcare (both preventive and health promoting measures) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>This concept has been increasingly recognised over the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> due to growing evidence that many health inequalities and health outcomes are closely linked to individuals' health literacy levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>For example, low health literacy levels have been associated with poor adherence to medications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, lower use of preventive healthcare services <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, increased hospitalisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and increased mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>While research suggests clear links between health literacy and health outcomes, a major shortcoming of these findings is that the data were frequently derived from suboptimal measurement instruments.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jordan et al. (2011)</ref> found salient limitations regarding the general conceptualisation of health literacy coupled with weak psychometric properties of the instruments used <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Due to these shortcomings, the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) was developed in Australia in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In order to ensure that the HLQ included variables that are pertinent to all stakeholders involved, particularly community members, patients and clinicians, the developers of the HLQ applied a comprehensive process across all stages of instrument development, validation, and implementation, a process they had previously introduced as 'the validity-driven approach' <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>This method has already been applied successfully across several instrument development projects <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>An important feature of the process is the deliberate avoidance of theory when conceptualising the target construct.</s><s>Instead, a broad range of stakeholders is invited to brainstorm ideas on a defined topic in interviews and concept mapping workshops.</s><s>Concept mapping workshops are a structured approach to systematically generate ideas, which are then organised into clusters, analysed, and finally grouped into a 'concept map' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Concept mapping facilitates the emergence of a theoretical model that is grounded in the daily lives and practices of community members, patients, and practitioners.</s><s>The statements and clusters generated during this process form the basis for the questions (items) and the latent variables (domains/scales) of the new questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For the development of the HLQ, the consultation process included two concept mapping workshops as well as interviews with patients in Australia, and two nominal group workshops with both patients and experts overseas.</s><s>These exercises and several steps of item writing and testing in both a calibration (n = 634) and a validation (n = 405) sample eventually led to the final instrument consisting of nine distinct health literacy domains.</s><s>Applying a strict confirmatory factor model (no cross-loadings, no correlated residuals) resulted in excellent psychometric properties of the final instrument <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to its strong psychometric properties, the particular strengths of the HLQ lie in its practical relevance.</s><s>That is, the nine HLQ domains have been developed in a way that they can be used not only in standard surveys and outcomes assessments but to also derive health literacy profiles, which in turn can facilitate intervention development, service improvement, and evaluation.</s><s>Among other projects in Australia and overseas, these profiles are currently applied in the Ophelia (OPtimising HEalth LIteracy and Access) Study <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date, there is no health literacy instrument in Germany with comparable content, application, and psychometric properties as have been described for the HLQ.</s><s>While the European Health Literacy Survey is a large and important project <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, including a German translation of the European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, it was designed to compare populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> instead of facilitating intervention development, service improvement, and evaluation as is intended by the HLQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Further, while a head-to-head comparison between the two instruments is still missing, the face validity of the HLS-EU-Q suggests study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Competing interests:</head><p><s>The data used for the present study were collected as part of a larger study exploring the effectiveness of a telephonebased health coaching (TBHC) intervention, which was funded by the Kaufma ¨nnische Krankenkasse Hannover (KKH), Germany.</s><s>The KKH is a health insurance company that is part of the German public statutory health insurance system.</s><s>We confirm that the funder (KKH) had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</s><s>We further confirm that our relationship with KKH will not affect our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.</s></p><p><s>only some overlap between the two instruments.</s><s>Hence, the HLQ and the HLS-EU-Q may rather complement each other, depending on the purpose of the (research) project being undertaken.</s><s>Further, the Functional Communicative Critical Health Literacy (FCCHL) questionnaire from Japan was recently translated into German.</s><s>Given its brevity, however, the translators critically discussed that it may be insufficient to capture the entire concept of health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>As a result, the HLQ was deemed an important measure of health literacy for Germanspeaking populations, and it was therefore translated and culturally adapted to the German context.</s><s>The aim of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the German HLQ (HLQ-G).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Setting</head><p><s>Data for the validation of the HLQ-G were collected as part of a large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) that was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a telephone-based health coaching (TBHC) intervention.</s><s>Inclusion criteria for the RCT were: insuree of the KKH (Kaufma ¨nnische Krankenkasse Hannover), a large German health insurance company, age (!18 years), sufficient German language skills, ability to participate in telephone coaching, and presence of at least one chronic condition at the time of study entry.</s><s>Included diagnoses were: diabetes, coronary artery disease, asthma, hypertension, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic depression or schizophrenia.</s><s>The RCT was carried out by the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, over a period of four years, with data collected at baseline (T 0 ), 12 (T 1 ), 24 (T 2 ), and 36 (T 3 ) months.</s><s>Further details on the RCT are described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Study participants were grouped into intervention group, controls, and people who had declined to participate.</s><s>As the RCT had already begun at the time of the HLQ translation, the HLQ-G could only be included at T 3 .</s><s>Given that the intervention group had already been exposed to the TBHC at that point, variation in these data was deemed too low to be suitable for a validation sample, which was supported by preliminary analyses of these data.</s><s>Consequently, we decided to exclude intervention group subjects from the validation.</s><s>T 3 sample sizes were n = 580 (controls) and n = 494 (declined participation) leading to a sample size of n = 1,074.</s></p><p><s>Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the State Chamber of Physicians in Hamburg (Germany).</s><s>All participants gave written informed content.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>This study undertook rigorous processes to translate and culturally adapt the Health Literacy Questionnaire to the German context, and to validate the translated version.</s><s>The data indicate excellent reproduction of the original English-language HLQ items in a different language, culture, and healthcare setting.</s><s>The HLQ-G has satisfactory psychometric properties, suggesting that this instrument measures nine distinct domains of health literacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>All scales also demonstrated excellent reliability.</s><s>In summary, the results from this study, using data from a large RCT on TBHC <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, suggest an almost perfect replication of the original HLQ and its hypothesised factor structure.</s></p><p><s>The vast majority of respective HLQ-G factor loadings were well within the range of the original HLQ loadings, with over 75% of the items showing deviations of 0.10 or less.</s><s>Items with larger deviations in respective factor loading are difficult to interpret in the context of translations of self-report instruments.</s><s>One could argue that respective latent variable has less influence on responses on items that showed a smaller loading, following Bollen's (1989) notion of the "direct structural relation" (p.197) between latent and indicator variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>As smaller loadings were more frequently observed for HLQ-G items, it can be interpreted as the respective item being less important to define its hypothesised latent variable in the Germanlanguage version.</s><s>However, as we are dealing with a translation and cultural adaptation of a self-report instrument-as opposed to a revalidation of an instrument in the same language-it is also conceivable that the meaning of respective latent variable and/or the individual item is slightly different in the two cultures.</s></p><p><s>Further, the Part 1 item response scale may be perceived differently between the English and the German version.</s><s>When comparing the HLQ with the heiQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, a questionnaire that some of the authors developed and translated several years ago, the 4-point response scale contained slightly disagree and slightly agree as the mid categories.</s><s>As disagree/agree is comparatively strong in German as used in the present HLQ, adding slightly may have been more suitable for the HLQ in the German context.</s><s>Before such a change could be made, however, this question would need to be tested thoroughly.</s><s>A change in response format compared to the original English-language HLQ would not only severely compromise the comparability between English and German HLQ data but it would affect the many translations of the HLQ that are currently underway, such as Danish, Dutch, and Norwegian.</s><s>It remains to be shown whether this observation is also an issue in other translation efforts.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some limitations.</s><s>First, we used a convenience sample from a large RCT on TBHC recruited from a health insurance company.</s><s>The sample not only included insurees of that particular company, but also respondents with at least one chronic condition.</s><s>Further, mean age was high (71 years), the level of education was relatively low (48.5% reported 9 years of schooling), and 76.7% indicated being retired; hence, the sample recruited for the coaching intervention was not representative of the German general population.</s><s>The HLQ is aimed to be implemented across populations, for example, as a screening instrument.</s><s>Consequently, further work needs to be done in a wider range of respondents, such as the calibration sample of the original HLQ in Australia consisting of a wide range of respondents from community health, hospital, and home care settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>However, given that the German sample was older with rather low educational background is reassuring at the same time.</s><s>That is, given the particular context of our study, i.e. health literacy, this first validation of the HLQ-G was undertaken in a sample that may be expected to have more problems with this type of questionnaire.</s><s>Therefore, we feel the sample does not weaken the study but it may indeed strengthen it.</s><s>That is, it is expected that it should be possible to replicate our findings in alternative samples that are more representative of the German general population, i.e. samples that would be younger with a higher educational status.</s><s>In summary, these first results show promising psychometric properties of the translated version of the HLQ, which was based on a large sample ensuring robustness of the statistical outputs.</s><s>However, it remains that these results should be confirmed in the general population as well as in different disease groups.</s></p><p><s>Second, our experience suggests that use of a professional translator may not be necessary, indeed even potentially counterproductive.</s><s>Registered translators often focus on generating a linguistically accurate translation, rather than ensuring readability by people who may have a limited vocabulary or ensuring that the actual meaning of each item is conveyed.</s><s>This appeared to be the case in our study where careful re-consideration of the item intent by the translation team resulted in at least some adjustment to over 90% of the initial forward translations.</s><s>For future translation endeavours, we suggest that it would be easier and more efficient to have the translations carried out by bilingual field workers, psychometricians or researchers from related fields with experience in instrument translations.</s></p><p><s>Third, the finding of high to very high inter-factor correlations of Part II factors requires further work.</s><s>While neither the item content of each scale nor the statistical output suggest combining factors at this stage, alternative model specifications, for example with higher order factors or a bifactor solution, should be explored in future research.</s><s>This includes Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling, which may be a more appropriate approach for these kinds of data as it allows for some 'wiggle room' for factor loadings and residual correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>That is, a model as strict as the one applied may impose unnecessarily narrow restrictions on the model, which may have led to an artificial inflation of the inter-factor correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p></div>
