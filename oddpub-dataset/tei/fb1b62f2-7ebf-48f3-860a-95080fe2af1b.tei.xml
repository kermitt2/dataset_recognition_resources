.</s><s>Mendelian hypertension elucidates mechanisms of blood pressure regulation.</s><s>Here we report six missense mutations in PDE3A (encoding phosphodiesterase 3A) in six unrelated families with mendelian hypertension and brachydactyly type E (HTNB) 2 .</s><s>The syndrome features brachydactyly type E (BDE), severe salt-independent but age-dependent hypertension, an increased fibroblast growth rate, neurovascular contact at the rostral-ventrolateral medulla, altered baroreflex blood pressure regulation and death from stroke before age 50 years when untreated 3,4 .</s><s>In vitro analyses of mesenchymal stem cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and chondrocytes provided insights into molecular pathogenesis.</s><s>The mutations increased protein kinase A-mediated PDE3A phosphorylation and resulted in gain of function, with increased cAMP-hydrolytic activity and enhanced cell proliferation.</s><s>Levels of phosphorylated VASP were diminished, and PTHrP levels were dysregulated.</s><s>We suggest that the identified PDE3A mutations cause the syndrome.</s><s>VSMC-expressed PDE3A deserves scrutiny as a therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension.</s></p><p><s>The mendelian hypertension syndromes described thus far involve increased sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron <ref type="bibr">5</ref> .</s><s>The sole exception is autosomal dominant hypertension with BDE (HTNB; MIM 112410), first reported in a Turkish kindred <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> .</s><s>HTNB was linked to chromosome 12p in six unrelated families <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8</ref> .</s><s>The locus accounts for a difference of ~50 mm Hg in mean blood pressure at age 50 years 2 .</s><s>Penetrance is 100% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Previously, we reported a rearrangement on chromosome 12p shared by all affected families <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> .</s><s>A linkage study in Chinese hypertensive families without BDE identified a linkage signal coinciding with the HTNB locus, supporting the relevance of this locus to essential hypertension <ref type="bibr">10</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We performed whole-genome sequencing of Turkish family members and identified a heterozygous missense mutation in PDE3A (NCBI Gene 5139), which encodes a cyclic GMP (cGMP) and AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase with a prominent role in the heart, VSMCs, oocytes and platelets <ref type="bibr">11</ref> .</s><s>Resequencing of all 48 affected individuals in 6 unrelated families identified 6 independently clustered heterozygous missense mutations in exon 4 of PDE3A.</s><s>The altered amino acids, residues 445, 447 and 449, belong to a highly conserved PDE3A domain (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 and 2a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We detected none of the previously described chromosomal breakpoints on chromosome 12p12.2-12.1,</s><s>perhaps owing to high repetitive content in the breakpoint regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> .</s><s>We noted intrafamilial phenotypic variability, with an affected individual (VI/9; 145/77 mm Hg (diastolic/systolic blood pressure)) showing only mild BDE and height (159 cm) in the 30th percentile in comparison to one of his severely affected cousins (142 cm, first percentile; VI/1; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) <ref type="bibr">7</ref> .</s><s>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) identified a posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) loop (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr">4</ref> .</s><s>Haplotype analysis detected a new recombination event that reduced the size of the linkage interval and eliminated an inversion common to all affected individuals in the six families (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>) <ref type="bibr">9</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, the affected mother's haplotype showed cosegregation with the more severe brachydactyly phenotype.</s></p><p><s>PDE proteins are involved during early stages of osteogenesis <ref type="bibr">12</ref> .</s><s>PDE4D mutations have been associated with severe brachydactyly in acrodysostosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">14</ref> .</s><s>In mice, Pde3a is expressed in the developing limbs, consistent with a role during chondrogenesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,b</ref>).</s><s>Chondrogenic downregulation of expression of the PTHLH gene, encoding the parathyroid hormone-related peptide PTHrP, was associated with BDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">15</ref> .</s><s>We also observed PTHLH downregulation in chondrogenically induced fibroblasts from affected individuals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We addressed the functional consequences of the identified PDE3A mutations in HeLa cells expressing the mutant proteins.</s><s>Forskolin and l-arginine stimulate adenylate and guanylate cyclases, respectively, to enhance cellular cAMP and cGMP levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">17</ref> .</s><s>We detected significantly reduced cAMP levels in comparison to wild-type PDE3A (P â‰¤ 0.001), consistent with gain-of-function mutations, with no change in cGMP levels (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,b</ref>).</s><s>Three PDE3A isoforms-PDE3A1 (microsomal), PDE3A2 and PDE3A3 (both microsomal and cytosolic)-have been identified in human myocardium <ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">19</ref> .</s><s>PDE3A3 does not contain the sequence harboring the altered residues.</s><s>The predominant isoform in VSMCs is PDE3A2 (refs.</s><s>18,20).</s><s>To directly elucidate the effects of the mutations, we compared the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of cAMP-hydrolytic activity for recombinant Flag-tagged wild-type and Thr445Asn PDE3A1 and for wild-type and Thr445Asn PDE3A2 purified from transfected cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>,b and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d-k</ref>).</s><s>The p.Thr445Asn alteration increased the affinity (decreased the K M ) of both PDE3A1 and PDE3A2 for cAMP without affecting V max (the maximum catalytic velocity of the substrate-saturated enzyme).</s><s>This increase in affinity relative to the wild-type enzyme was enhanced for both isoforms l e t t e r s when cAMP-mediated signaling was stimulated by exposure of the transfected cells to forskolin.</s><s>Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) measurements for milrinone, a PDE3 inhibitor used to augment cardiac contractility and decrease vascular resistance in patients with heart failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">22</ref> , showed that higher concentrations of the inhibitor were necessary to inhibit the recombinant Thr445Asn forms of both PDE3A1 and PDE3A2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c,d</ref>), whereas the IC 50 values for cGMP inhibition of cAMP-hydrolytic activity were nearly equivalent for the wild-type and mutant isoforms (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also used a vector with the luciferase gene under the control of a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) to determine the effects of all six PDE3A mutations on cAMP-mediated signaling in cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">23</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with the observed gain-of-function effects from increased cAMP-hydrolytic activity, the expression of all six PDE3A mutants decreased luciferase expression in comparison to wild-type PDE3A (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We obtained mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from two affected individuals with the p.Thr445Asn alteration (VI/9 and VI/17).</s><s>MSCs were characterized by FACS and differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes, demonstrating their multilineage potential (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a,b</ref>) <ref type="bibr">24</ref> .</s><s>MSC-derived VSMCs expressed smooth muscle actin Î± (SMAÎ±), calponin and transgelin at high levels (SM22Î±; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>).</s><s>Deletion of mouse Pde3a suppressed VSMC proliferation, indicating the importance of PDE3A during arteriogenesis and arterial remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">25</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we focused on the vascular relevance of the PDE3A mutations.</s><s>In our earlier studies, we had observed an enhanced cell growth rate for fibroblasts and hyperplastic arterial walls from affected individuals, concerning the thickened VSMC layer 9,26 .</s><s>We hypothesized that the PDE3A mutations were responsible for enhanced mitosis and arterial remodeling.</s><s>In HeLa cell proliferation assays with full-length PDE3A transfection constructs (encoding PDE3A1 and PDE3A2), as well as in VSMCs derived from patients with the p.Thr445Asn substitution, we observed higher mitotic rates in cells expressing mutant PDE3A.</s><s>Transfection with vector for wild-type PDE3A also increased cell growth in comparison to endogenous levels of PDE3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>,f and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The Ser428 and Ser438 residues that are adjacent to the residues altered by the PDE3A mutations can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) or protein kinase A (PKA), causing increased cAMP hydrolysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) <ref type="bibr">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">28</ref> .</s><s>Thus, we investigated phosphorylated PDE3A levels without and after exposure to PMA (phorbol-12myristate-13-acetate; to activate PKC) or forskolin (to increase cAMP content and thereby activate PKA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">30</ref> .</s><s>Phosphorylation of PDE3A1 Thr445Asn and PDE3A2 Thr445Asn at Ser428 and Ser438 was increased in PMA-and forskolin-treated transfected HeLa cells, in comparison to cells with endogenous protein levels or cells transfected to express wild-type PDE3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a-e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">19</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, in unstimulated MSCs and VSMCs derived from the affected individuals harboring p.Thr445Asn, we detected higher PDE3A Ser428 and Ser438 phosphorylation levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4f,g</ref>).</s><s>Inhibiting PKA or PKC showed that both kinases phosphorylated PDE3A Ser438 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>We investigated whether the alteration in PDE3A phosphorylation could be attributed to preferential mRNA expression from the mutated allele.</s><s>We used pyrosequencing to dissect allele usage and detected no differences between the wild-type and mutated alleles (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).</s><s>npg l e t t e r s</s></p><p><s>Reduced phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) at Ser157, mediated by PKA, has been linked to enhanced VSMC proliferation after angioplasty <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">31</ref> .</s><s>Elevated full-length PTHrP levels enhance neointimal proliferation, whereas the PTHrP peptide (residues 1-36) inhibits VSMC proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">32</ref> .</s><s>We observed reduced VASP Ser157 phosphorylation and elevated PTHrP levels in PMA-stimulated HeLa cells expressing the mutant enzymes.</s><s>VASP Ser157 phosphorylation was not greatly altered in forskolin-treated HeLa cells expressing the mutant enzymes, presumably because the forskolin-induced increase in cAMP levels was sufficient for PKA activation despite hyperactive PDE3A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4h</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, we detected increased expression of full-length PTHrP protein and decreased expression of the PTHrP peptide (residues 1-36) in cells from affected individuals (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In a peptide SPOT assay, we synthesized 30-mer peptides representing Ile421-Leu450 of wild-type PDE3A and the six mutants, including alanine or aspartic acid replacements for Ser428 and Ser438 (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a and 5a</ref>, and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">33</ref> .</s><s>The spotting of Ser438 or prephosphorylated Ser428 or Ser438, followed by in vitro phosphorylation by PKA, identified significantly enhanced phosphorylation at the PDE3A Ser438 residue of the six mutants, confirming the previous results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a,b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">14a-c</ref>).</s><s>To further elucidate the increased phosphorylation signal at Ser438 (peptide lanes 7 and 9), we examined whether PKA phosphorylated additional residues.</s><s>Interestingly, the PKA signals increased even when Ser428 and Ser438 were substituted with alanine residues.</s><s>This result could be due to increased levels of phosphorylation at Ser439 and Thr440, which are close to Ser438 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">14d-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Finally, we replaced Ser428, Ser438, Ser439 and Thr440 with alanine residues and repeated the Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of Flag-tagged wild-type PDE3A1 and PDE3A2 versus the Thr445Asn mutant isoforms.</s><s>The alanine substitutions diminished cAMP l e t t e r s hydrolysis, supporting the notion that mutation-dependent enhanced phosphorylation at these sites is responsible for increased cAMP hydrolysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We observed that mutant PDE3A was more extensively phosphorylated than wild-type PDE3A at the Ser428 and Ser438 residues and that PTHrP isoforms were dysregulated.</s><s>Our results suggest that increased PKA-mediated phosphorylation at Ser438 and PKC-mediated phosphorylation at Ser428, reported to increase PDE3A2 activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">27</ref> , may have contributed to the increase in the cAMP-hydrolytic activity of the mutant enzymes, leading to reduced cAMP levels and enhanced cell proliferation.</s><s>This result would be consistent with the increased affinity of the Thr445Asn mutants for cAMP that we observed after exposure of transfected cells to forskolin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,b</ref>).</s><s>Further studies will aim to characterize the possible allosteric effects of these mutations on other phosphorylation sites that may modulate enzyme activity and proteinprotein interactions involved in PDE3A function-for example, the interaction of PDE3A with phospholamban, SERCA2 and AKAP18 described in mouse and human heart <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[36]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Augmented full-length PTHrP levels, decreased amounts of PTHrP peptide (residues 1-36) and reduced VASP Ser157 phosphorylation may additionally promote VSMC proliferation in individuals with these gain-of-function PDE3A mutations, leading to vessel wall hyperplasia.</s><s>The IC 50 measurements showed that a higher milrinone concentration is necessary to abrogate the increased hydrolysis of cAMP by PDE3A1 Thr445Asn and PDE3A2 Thr445Asn.</s><s>These data are compatible with our previous results indicating that milrinone-induced forearm vasodilation was not significantly different in affected individuals and controls 8 .</s></p><p><s>Our data strongly suggest that PDE3A mutations in HTNB are responsible for hypertension by contributing to a general increase in peripheral vascular resistance (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref>) 2, <ref type="bibr">26</ref> .</s><s>The fact that PDE3 inhibition lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertensive heart failure and in patients with pulmonary hypertension is consistent with this hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">37</ref> .</s><s>cAMP inhibits myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) through phosphorylation of the latter by PKA, thereby causing VSMC relaxation.</s><s>Dephosphorylation of myosin light chains by MLC phosphatase also produces relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">38</ref> .</s><s>Enhanced PDE3A activity could, by lowering the intracellular cAMP concentration in VSMCs, promote increased peripheral vascular constriction.</s><s>Furthermore, increased VSMC proliferation could induce remodeling npg l e t t e r s favoring hypertension, perhaps by changes in vascular structure or neurovascular contact.</s><s>Our studies of PDE3A mutants with increased activity showing enhanced mitosis are consistent with the observed decrease in VSMC proliferation when Pde3a was deleted in an earlier study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">25</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The milder BDE of subject VI/9 suggests that regulatory DNA elements or noncoding RNAs in the excluded inversion region epigenetically trigger the pathogenesis of BDE and short stature.</s><s>We found that PDE3A, which is involved in mouse chondrogenesis, could contribute to PTHLH downregulation, which has been associated with BDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">39</ref> .</s><s>In chondrocytes, PTHrP is regulated by cAMP and transduces signals through the PTH/PTHrP receptor, activating adenylate cyclase for cAMP production <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">41</ref> .</s><s>We suggest that increased cAMP hydrolysis could cause PTHrP downregulation through a regulatory feedback loop (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">15</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have identified independently clustered PDE3A mutations in individuals with HTNB, which exhibit a gain-of-function effect on cAMP hydrolysis.</s><s>We found evidence for mechanisms mediating VSMC hyperplasia and increased peripheral vascular resistance.</s><s>Studying the functional consequences of the PDE3A mutations in animal models will result in further insight into normal and pathogenic vascular and skeletal development.</s></p></div>
