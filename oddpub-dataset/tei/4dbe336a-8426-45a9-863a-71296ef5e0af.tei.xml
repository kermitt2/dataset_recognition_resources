<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>How cells sense a chemical concentration gradient and polarize towards regions of high or low concentrations is a fundamental biological question.</s><s>Encoding of spatial information in chemoattractant gradients is essential for many processes, including the directional migration of leukocytes and neutrophils or the directional growth of yeast and neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Cellular response of eukaryotic cells in response to extracellular cues generally involves establishing a cellular axis of polarity through accumulation of small GTPases, such as Ras and Cdc42, in cortical domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The establishment of such a self-organizing polarity zone is a process of pattern formation on the cell cortex.</s></p><p><s>As model eukaryotic cells, budding and fission yeasts have been used to study basic properties of chemical sensing mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Under mating conditions, these organisms respond to the pheromone gradient secreted by the opposite mating type cells, in order to identify the closest potential partner, grow towards it by formation of a shmoo extension, and fuse with it <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Recent studies have shown that this process involves an initial assembly of a "patch" or "zone" that is established independently of the direction of the pheromone gradient (Fig 1A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">and 1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Over time, the patch that contains activated Cdc42 and co-factors reorients and stabilizes towards the chosen pheromone-secreting partner and starts growing toward it via Cdc42-dependent recruitment of the cell growth machinery.</s><s>The partner search strategy is different between the two yeasts.</s><s>The budding yeast patch executes a biased diffusion along the cell cortex towards high pheromone concentration regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>By contrast, fission yeast implements an exploratory search involving complete patch disappearance and re-appearance at a different cortical location, followed by patch stabilization (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>It has been proposed that the fission yeast strategy helps the whole cell population explore space of possible mating configurations, thus optimizing population mating efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the localization of pheromone transporter and components of the signal transduction cascade suggest that the spatial gradient information is produced and sensed locally from the polarity zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Models of the mechanism of yeast pheromone gradient sensing have to explain both the ability of cells to organize a patch and the change of its location.</s><s>Many theoretical studies have considered the process of Cdc42 patch formation for bud growth during the mitotic cell cycle.</s><s>In budding yeast cells lacking Ras-like Rsr1, the bud forms randomly along the mother cell cortex through a process of spherical symmetry breaking <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Theoretical studies have suggested that a positive feedback in Cdc42 activation gives rise to a Turing-type pattern formation mechanism which breaks symmetry and establishes a single patch through amplification of a stochastic fluctuation at a random location <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>However, the relative contributions of Cdc42 activity regulators and actin to the positive feedback have been debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>To explain observed oscillations between competing patches in initial stages of bud site selection required implementing an additional negative feedback mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>During budding yeast mating, experiments and mathematical models have suggested two different mechanisms for patch diffusion toward the pheromone gradient.</s><s>McClure et al. suggested that perturbations caused by the localized delivery of vesicles near the patch site dilute polarity factors, an effect counteracted by polarized G proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Hegemann et al.</ref> proposed that a secondary positive feedback between the actin-based receptor trafficking and Cdc42 allows for patch diffusion toward the gradient that stabilizes in the high concentrations of Cdc42-GTP <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our aim in this work is to propose and test a model implementing a mechanism for fission yeast mating patch formation, exploration, and stabilization, a process that has not been explored theoretically.</s><s>This study is motivated by recent findings emphasizing the role of Ras1, the only Ras GTPase homolog in fission yeast.</s><s>Ras1 is an upstream regulator for Cdc42 and its activity is critical for both mating and polarity establishment during interphase, since ras1Î cells are sterile and round <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>During early stages of mating, active Ras1 (Ras1-GTP) localizes at the same exploratory sites as active Cdc42 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The appearance and disappearance of the patch is an evidence for regulation through positive and negative feedback loops.</s><s>Indeed, in S. pombe, Ras1 activation in mating conditions is promoted by the pheromone-induced Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) Ste6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>It has been shown that Ste6 pheromone-induced expression is itself regulated by Ras1 activity, which in turn creates an additional positive feedback loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Ras1 inactivation is promoted through interaction with its GTPase activating protein (GAP), Gap1.</s><s>The deletion of Gap1 abolishes the Ras1 polarity patch <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, increases the lifetime of the Cdc42 patch during exploration and results in reduction of mating efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>It was found that Gap1 is recruited to the active Ras1 patch, occupying a larger area on the membrane where it remains for a longer time compared to Ras1-GTP during patch disappearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>These observations are consistent with Gap1-dependent hydrolysis of Ras1-GTP forming a local negative feedback to temporally control the polarity patch.</s></p><p><s>In this study we developed a 3D reaction-diffusion model, which accounts for the fission yeast cell geometry, to study the dynamic regulation of Ras1 during fission yeast mating.</s><s>To develop this model, we performed experiments to measure the kinetics of diffusion and membrane dissociation of active Ras1 (Ras1-GTP), inactive Ras1 (Ras1-GDP), and Gap1.</s><s>Since many of the biochemical interactions of the Ras1 positive and negative feedbacks are not yet known we adopt a phenomenological approach, inspired by prior studies in budding yeast.</s><s>We illustrate that by tuning the rate constants for the positive and negative feedback loops, the model can reproduce the appearance and disappearance of Ras1 patch at random locations.</s><s>We investigate the switch to patch stabilization upon sensing of a high level of pheromone and show that the patch in our model can be stabilized at positions with a higher positive feedback rate constant, which might represent regions of higher pheromone concentration.</s><s>The model predicts that the patch size can be regulated by positive and negative feedback.</s><s>In simulations, increase in negative feedback resulted in narrower patches and increase in positive feedback resulted in formation of multiple patches.</s><s>These results were tested and confirmed experimentally.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of a model that reproduces the exploratory Ras1 dynamics</head><p><s>We developed a model based on a system of reaction-diffusion equations to study regulation of Ras1-GTP exploratory behavior and stabilization during fission yeast mating (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>The model accounted for the diffusion and reaction of Ras1-GTP, Ras1-GDP and Gap1 along a 3D curved surface with surface densities C RT ; C RD , and C GAP that vary along the cell surface (see Material and Methods).</s><s>These three

assume that the cytoplasmic concentrations of Ras1-GDP and Gap1 are uniform in space and constant over time, but that there is a finite pool of GEF that provides an upper Ras1 activation limit <ref

type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, where it hydrolyzes Ras1-GTP and diffuses laterally before dissociation.</s><s>The Gap1 recruitment rate depends nonlinearly on Ras1-GTP concentration to generate oscillations, as in the GAP mechanism implemented to reproduce Cdc42 oscillations in S. cerevisiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>This nonlinearity is supported by the experimental evidence that Gap1 full localization to sites of Ras1-GTP needs more than its GAP domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>All membrane-bound Gap1 is assumed to be able to hydrolyze Ras1-GTP but we note that this is an approximation since one possibility is that Gap1 remains bound to Ras1-GDP, and thus inactive, after GTP hydrolysis.</s></p><p><s>By varying the unknown rate constants of activation and inactivation and using other parameter values from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we found that the model can reproduce exploratory behavior through the formation and disappearance of an active Ras1 zone <ref type="bibr">(Fig 4B and S1 Movie)</ref>.</s><s>A zone  initially forms when random fluctuations (implemented as stochastic noise) trigger the positive feedback to take off at a random location along the cortex.</s><s>The Gap1 that is simultaneously recruited spreads by diffusion faster than Ras1-GTP, restricting the lateral expansion of the zone, contributing both to its finite size and to its eventual disassembly.</s><s>Some Gap1 remains at the former zone site after Ras1-GTP decays (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C and

local accumulation of Ras1-GTP (as in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3G</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>) and a wider Gap1 compared to Ras1-GTP (as in Fig <ref type="figure"
