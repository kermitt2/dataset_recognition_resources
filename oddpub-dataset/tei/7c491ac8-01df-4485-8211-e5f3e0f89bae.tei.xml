this further supports the benefit of omalizumab in CSU patients with antihistamine-refractory angioedema.</s><s>Patient education and appropriate treatment are required to reduce the fears associated with angioedema in CSU patients.</s><s>Furthermore, the rapid symptom improvement and reduced angioedema-associated fears observed with omalizumab treatment could reduce healthresource utilization, such as the number of patient visits to the emergency department, as well as reducing work productivity loss and/or sick leave duration owing to angioedema. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> In patients with other chronic diseases, depression has been associated with decreased treatment adherence, sleep disturbance, and negative perception of the illness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>Here, the mean WHO-5 score was &lt;13 for both treatment groups at baseline, indicating that depression may be present in these patients and that CSU with angioedema must not be classified as a trivial disease or just a cosmetic problem.</s><s>Following appropriate treatment of CSU-related symptoms with omalizumab, approximately 80% of patients showed no sign of depression (≥13 points in the WHO-5) compared with approximately 40% in the placebo group.</s><s>Thus, omalizumab treatment is not only associated with improvement in the disease condition but also the psychological symptoms associated with CSU.</s></p><p><s>These results suggest that the psychological symptoms observed in CSU patients may be a reaction to the dermatological symptoms experienced;
