defense.</s><s>ISG15 modification is counteracted by the isopeptidase USP18, a major negative regulator of IFN signaling, which was also shown to exert its regulatory function in an isopeptidase-independent manner.</s><s>To dissect enzymatic and nonenzymatic functions of USP18 in vivo, we generated knock-in mice (USP18 C61A/C61A ) expressing enzymatically inactive USP18.</s><s>USP18 C61A/C61A mice displayed increased levels of ISG15 conjugates, validating that USP18 is a major ISG15 isopeptidase in vivo.</s><s>Unlike USP18 −/− mice, USP18 C61A/C61A animals did not exhibit morphological abnormalities, fatal IFN hypersensitivity, or increased lethality, clearly showing that major USP18 functions are unrelated to its protease activity.</s><s>Strikingly, elevated ISGylation in USP18 C61A/C61A mice was accompanied by increased viral resistance against vaccinia virus and influenza B virus infections.</s><s>Enhanced resistance upon influenza B infection in USP18 C61A/C61A mice was completely reversed in USP18 C61A/C61A mice, which additionally lack ISG15, providing evidence that the observed reduction in viral titers is ISG15 dependent.</s><s>These results suggest that increasing ISGylation by specific inhibition of USP18 protease activity could constitute a promising antiviral strategy with only a minimal risk of severe adverse effects.</s></p><p><s>ISG15 | UBP43 | interferon | ubiquitin isopeptidase | influenza P rotein modification by the ubiquitin-like (UBL) modifier interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is strongly

characterized by two ubiquitin-like domains connected by a short linker region <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>In analogy to ubiquitin, ISG15 is covalently conjugated to protein targets via the consecutive action of an E1-activating enzyme (Ube1L) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, an E2-conjugating enzyme (UbcH8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>, and a few E3 ligases.</s><s>All enzymes involved in the conjugation process are themselves strongly inducible by type I IFNs.</s><s>The major E3 ligases for human and murine ISG15 modification (ISGylation) are

respectively.</s><s>hHERC5 is associated with polyribosomes and newly synthesized proteins are modified by ISG15 in a cotranslational manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it was suggested that ISG15 modification of virusderived proteins, which are the most prevalent translational products in a virus-infected cell, mediates the antiviral activity of the ISGylation system.</s><s>In line with this suggestion, ISG15 modification of the human papilloma virus protein HPV16 L1 interfered with virus assembly and decreased the infectivity of HPV in a dominant manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, ISGylation of the influenza virus protein NS1A prevents interaction with importin-α and thereby interferes with the capability of NS1A to counteract host defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>ISG15 is also conjugated to cellular proteins.</s><s>For example, ISGylation increases the stability of the IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in enhanced activation of IRF3 target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with the antiviral function,

stomatitis virus (VSV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are not altered <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>For both influenza B and Sindbis virus infection, the antiviral function of ISG15 is dependent on its ability to form conjugates because mice lacking the ISG15 E1 enzyme, UbE1L, are also susceptible to these infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Viral infections still constitute a major health issue.</s><s>Upon viral infection, interferon (IFN) elicits an antiviral response by activating multiple effector systems.</s><s>The ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 is strongly induced by IFN and mediates its antiviral effect by being covalently conjugated to cellular and viral proteins.</s><s>The protease USP18, which is also an important negative regulator of the IFN response, counteracts ISG15 conjugation.</s><s>Within this study, we have generated knock-in mice expressing USP18, which selectively lacks protease activity.</s><s>ISG15 modification was enhanced in these animals, but the IFN response was unaltered.</s><s>This clearly shows that USP18 has enzymatic and nonenzymatic properties in vivo.</s><s>Elevated ISGylation increased resistance to influenza B infections, qualifying USP18 protease inhibition as a potential antiviral strategy.</s></p><p><s>ISGylation, USP18 knockout (USP18 −/− ) mice develop severe brain malformations and have a shortened lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, these animals fail to properly terminate IFN-signaling, exhibit enhanced IFN target gene expression, and show lethal hypersensitivity to poly(I:C) injections <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, IFN desensitization, which assures long-term refractoriness of the IFN signaling pathway, is abrogated in USP18 −/− mice (24), underlining the role of USP18 as a critical negative regulator of the IFN pathway.</s><s>USP18 −/− mice also exhibit increased resistance to intracranial (i.c.) infections with VSV and LCMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>The phenotypic alterations seen in USP18 −/− mice were first exclusively ascribed to enhanced ISG15 modification.</s><s>However, subsequent analysis of mice doubly deficient for either USP18 and ISG15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> or USP18 and Ube1L <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> surprisingly revealed that the lack of ISGylation cannot rescue the brain injuries and is not able to overcome the lethality induced by poly(I:C) in USP18 −/− mice.</s><s>Furthermore, irrespective of its protease activity, USP18 was shown to compete with JAK1 for binding to the IFNAR2, thereby negatively regulating the type I IFN response <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref> in an isopeptidase-independent manner.</s></p><p><s>To differentiate between enzymatic and nonenzymatic physiological functions of USP18 and to study the consequences of selective inhibition of USP18 protease activity in vivo, we have now generated and characterized knock-in mice expressing mutant USP18 protein selectively lacking the isopeptidase activity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Generation of Mice Expressing Catalytically Inactive USP18 Protein.</s><s>In murine USP18 the cysteine at position 61 (Cys61) was reported to be essential for protease activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>To validate that mutation of Cys61 inactivates the isopeptidase activity, USP18 carrying an N-terminal S-peptide epitope tag (S-USP18) and mutants thereof were expressed in HEK293T cells.</s><s>In particular the codons of USP18 for either Cys61 (C61A), Cys62 (C62A), or both (C61A/ C62A) were replaced by those encoding for alanine.</s><s>Subsequently, protein extracts of transfected cells were analyzed for the ISG15specific reactivity of USP18 and its derivatives using ISG15vinylsulfone (ISG15-VS).</s><s>ISG15-VS acts as an active site-directed probe and irreversibly reacts with the catalytic core of ISG15 proteases.</s><s>ISG15-VS was readily linked to WT USP18 and USP18 C62A but neither USP18 C61A nor USP18 C61A/C62A did react with ISG15-VS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>), showing that Cys61 is essential for the protease activity of USP18.</s><s>To generate mice that express catalytically inactive USP18 C61A , a knock-in targeting strategy was applied (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>Via homologous recombination, the codon for the active site cysteine (C61) was replaced by a codon specific for alanine (C61A).</s><s>Positive ES cell clones were identified and used to generate germ-line chimeras and heterozygous animals were mated to yield homozygous mice (USP18 C61A/C61A ).</s><s>Successful mutation was validated by Southern blot analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>).</s><s>cDNA sequencing proved that USP18 C61A/C61A animals express a mutant USP18 C61A transcript (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>).</s><s>To confirm that targeted mutagenesis of the USP18 gene locus did not alter regulatory properties, bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated and stimulated with IFN-β.</s><s>Western blot analysis showed that the induction kinetics and protein levels of USP18 C61A protein were similar to that observed in WT cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>).</s><s>USP18 C61A/C61A animals were born according to Mendelian ratios and in contrast to USP18 −/− mice, did not exhibit macroscopic alterations, reduced life expectancy, or brain abnormalities.</s><s>Even no abnormalities were detected in USP18 C61A/C61A mice backcrossed to C57BL/6, a genetic background, in which USP18 deficiency causes embryonic lethality accompanied by malformation and growth retardation around embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>Thus, we established a mouse strain in which the endogenous USP18 gene was mutated to express a USP18 protein selectively lacking its isopeptidase activity.</s><s>USP18 C61A/C61A Mice Demonstrate Increased ISGylation.</s><s>In addition to functioning as a deconjugating enzyme for ISG15, it has been shown in cells that USP18 can regulate IFN signaling in a protease-independent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the enhanced ISGylation seen in the USP18-deficient mice could have been due to either the enhanced IFN signaling or impaired deISGylation.</s><s>In addition, previous in vitro studies have provided evidence for other USPs that exhibit cross-reactivity to ISG15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we evaluated whether the loss of USP18 isopeptidase activity is sufficient to augment ISG15 modification in vivo.</s><s>USP18 C61A/C61A or WT mice were stimulated with poly(I:C), and ISG15-conjugated proteins were monitored in lysates from liver, lung, lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3A</ref>).</s><s>In addition, ISG15 modification was analyzed in BMMs treated with IFN-α, IFN-β, poly(I:C), or LPS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3B</ref>).</s><s>Inactivation of the USP18 isopeptidase activity significantly increased levels of ISGylated substrates upon IFN-β, poly(I:C), or LPS stimulation and in all assayed tissues and cell types, indicating that USP18 isopeptidase function is necessary to counteract ISGylation of multiple proteins.</s><s>Remarkably, lungs from USP18 C61A/C61A mice also displayed significantly enhanced levels of unconjugated ISG15.</s><s>We also followed the kinetics of ISGylation over several days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3C</ref>).</s><s>Both in WT and in USP18 C61A/C61A mice, the levels of ISG15conjugated proteins reached a maximum in liver lysates 24 h after induction with poly(I:C).</s><s>Levels of ISG15-modified substrates in USP18 C61A/C61A mice compared with WT controls were significantly elevated on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 after induction.</s><s>However, on days 3 and 4 after induction, levels of ISGylation decreased in both genotypes, suggesting that either other isopeptidases deconjugate ISG15 or that ISGylated substrates are removed by physiologic turnover.</s><s>In contrast, overall ubiquitin modification did not differ between WT and USP18 C61A/C61A murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4A</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results clearly show that selective inactivation of the USP18 isopeptidase activity causes increased and prolonged ISGylation, which appears to be only partially compensated by other isopeptidases in vivo, if at all.</s><s>which 100% of the mice succumbed to poly(I:C)-induced lethality within 1 d, neither USP18 C61A/C61A nor WT mice died (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), showing that the protease activity of USP18 is not essential to counteract the proinflammatory response upon poly(I:C) administration.</s><s>TLR3 stimulation activates a signaling cascade, which culminates in the activation of IRF3 and induces expression of type I IFNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, ISG15 was reported to be conjugated to IRF3, thereby increasing its stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, we evaluated stability and phosphorylation of IRF3 and type I IFN induction upon poly(I:C) stimulation in USP18 C61A/C61A cells and mice.</s><s>Neither the total contents of IRF3 nor the kinetics or the intensities of IRF3 phosphorylation differed between cells of both genotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>Concordantly, IFN-β serum levels in USP18 C61A/C61A mice treated with poly(I:C) were not affected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>These results strongly indicate that the enzymatic activity of USP18 is dispensable for normal poly(I:C)-mediated IFN induction and that its loss does not affect IRF3 stability or activation.</s><s>USP18-deficient fibroblasts also did not exhibit alterations in the kinetic of IRF3 phosphorylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4B</ref>).</s><s>To analyze the potential role of USP18 isopeptidase activity in IFN signaling, STAT1 phosphorylation after IFN-β stimulation was monitored in MEFs and BMMs.</s><s>As reported previously ( <ref type="formula">23</ref>), STAT1 phosphorylation was prolonged in USP18-deficient MEFs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In contrast, kinetics and intensity of STAT1 phosphorylation did not differ between WT and USP18 C61A/C61A MEFs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Similarly, no differences were detected between WT and USP18 C61A/C61A BMMs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>In addition, Northern blot

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The findings from our study are briefly summarized in a model depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref> and answer several questions concerning the function of USP18 in vivo.</s><s>First, the given results show that in general, the molecular function of USP18 as a negative regulator of IFN signaling in vivo is mediated in an isopeptidase-independent manner.</s><s>In contrast to the complete knockout, USP18 C61A/C61A mice did not develop brain injuries, displayed no prolongation of STAT1 phosphorylation, and were not hypersensitive to the administration of poly(I:C).</s><s>Previous experiments provided evidence for a mechanism where the C terminus of USP18 binds to IFNAR2 and competes with JAK1 for binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, mice harboring an amino acid exchange of the conserved leucine 361 at the C terminus in USP18 (USP18 Ity9 ) exhibit increased STAT1 expression upon IFN-β induction, suggesting that the C terminus of USP18 is indeed critical for the negative regulatory role in IFN signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>USP18 together with USP12 is the smallest member of the USP family and does not comprise any other prominent domains besides the catalytic core <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it was surprising that USP18 C61A/C61A mice develop a phenotype so different from the mice lacking USP18.</s><s>Recently, also USPL1, a SUMO-deconjugating enzyme, was shown to exert the stabilization of Cajal bodies in an isopeptidase-independent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, suggesting that nonenzymatic functions of USPs might be more common than generally assumed.</s><s>Thus, loss-of-function experiments and RNAi-based screens inhibiting ubiquitin-and UBL-deconjugating enzymes (DUBs) need to be cautiously interpreted.</s></p><p><s>Second, enhanced ISGylation in USP18 C61A/C61A mice showed that USP18, which so far is the only DUB reported to be specific for ISG15, is a major deconjugating enzyme for ISG15 in vivo.</s><s>All components of the ISGylation system (ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and HERC5/HERC6) are strongly induced by IFN.</s><s>Therefore, enhanced activation of IFN signaling observed in USP18 −/− mice would force ISGylation even if USP18 isopeptidase activity is directed against other proteins or if loss of the protein can be compensated.</s><s>We now show increased and prolonged ISGylation in USP18 C61A/C61A mice, where the IFN signaling pathway is not altered in general, clearly indicating that USP18 is a major ISG15 isopeptidase in vivo and that other cross-reactive USPs (21) cannot fully compensate for the loss of USP18 protease function.</s><s>However, efficient ISGylation in USP18 C61A/C61A mice clearly shows that processing of the ISG15 precursor protein is exerted in an USP18-independent manner.</s><s>Third, our results suggest that increasing the levels of ISG15 conjugation can be protective against viral infection.</s><s>Studies using ISG15 −/− or Ube1L −/− mice have clearly shown that ISGylation is essential for antiviral activity against some viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies in the USP18 −/− mice had shown resistance to viral infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>However, it was unclear if this was due to increased ISG15 conjugates or hypersensitive IFN signaling.</s><s>Furthermore embryonic lethality of USP18 −/− animals on a C57BL/6 background (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>) made it impossible to analyze the consequences of viral infection in this immunologically well-characterized background.</s><s>The results from our study provide strong evidence that enhancing the levels of ISG15 conjugates can protect the host from at least some viral infections.</s><s>It is interesting to note that both influenza B virus and VACV have developed immune evasion strategies to target ISG15 conjugation.</s><s>In the case of influenza B virus, the NS1 protein can block the binding of ISG15 to UbE1L (3), and therefore block conjugate formation, whereas in the case of VACV, the E3 protein can inhibit ISG15 conjugation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>In both of these cases, inactivation of the USP18 protease activity protected the mice from infection.</s><s>The increased resistance observed in USP18 −/− mice infected i.c. with either VSV or LCMV is likely due to the enhanced IFN signaling and not due to the antiviral actions of ISG15.</s><s>This is supported by the lack of a phenotype for either virus infection observed in the ISG15 −/− mice and because no protection was noted when USP18 C61A/C61A mice were challenged with VSV or LCMV.</s><s>In a recent study, USP18 was reported to specifically suppress the IFN response in metallophilic macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>This suppression permits a limited amplification of VSV, which in turn secures replication of a critical amount of virus particles necessary to efficiently promote adaptive immunity.</s><s>In agreement with this function, USP18-deficient mice exhibited reduced survival upon i.v.</s><s>VSV infection where the adaptive immune response is critical to prevent lethality.</s><s>In contrast, USP18 −/− mice exhibit increased resistance to i.c.</s><s>VSV infections where viral clearance is mainly IFN dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>As USP18 C61A/C61A and WT mice did not differ in survival upon i.c. or i.v.</s><s>infection with VSV, it is unlikely that USP18 protease activity contributes to the reported suppression of the IFN response in metallophilic macrophages.</s></p><p><s>There are several potential mechanisms that could mediate the increased resistance observed in the USP18 C61A/C61A mice.</s><s>ISGylation can occur in a cotranslational manner and ISG15 modification of viral proteins has been shown to result in improper viral assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> or interfere with the capability of distinct viral proteins like E3 from VACV or NS1A from influenza to counteract cellular defense mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>.</s><s>As we observed reduced levels of VACV E3 upon infection of BMMs, which correlated with increased levels of overall ISGylation, it was tempting to speculate that ISG15 modification of E3 in USP18 C61A/C61A animals might account for the observed increase in resistance.</s><s>However, we were unable to detect ISGylation of E3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>), even when overexpressed in USP18 C61A/C61A MEFs followed by IFN stimulation, or in HEK293T cells together with expression constructs for ISG15 and E1-, E2-, and E3-conjugating enzymes (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, the reduced E3 protein levels most likely rather mirrors reduced viral load in USP18 C61A/C61A cells than being the cause for the enhanced resistance of USP18 C61A/C61A cells.</s><s>Thus, the exact molecular mechanisms leading to enhanced viral resistance still require further investigation.</s></p><p><s>It is quite conceivable that the lack of USP18 isopeptidase activity increases the pool of ISG15-modified viral proteins thereby enhancing antiviral activity in USP18 C61A/C61A mice.</s></p><p><s>Alternatively, antiviral activities mediated by ISG15-modified cellular proteins could be enhanced.</s><s>Although previous studies have shown that ISGylation of IRF3 enhanced its stability, resulting in increased IFN and ISG production, neither poly(I:C) nor VACV infection substantially altered IRF3 phosphorylation or stability.</s><s>Future studies will be needed to explore the potential targets of enhanced ISGylation in this system.</s></p><p><s>Altogether, our results suggest that small molecule inhibition of the USP18 protease activity might be an attractive strategy for the development of antiviral therapies.</s><s>USP18 C61A/C61A mice represent a well-suited model system to mimic the consequences of such a therapeutic strategy and represent a valuable tool to study the physiological consequences of USP18 protease inhibition and enhanced ISGylation in innate immunity and tumorigenesis.</s></p><p><s>Whereas the severe phenotype of USP18 −/− mice raised concerns about negative consequences of USP18 protease inhibition, the present study puts former results in perspective.</s><s>Lack of USP18 isopeptidase function increases ISGylation and viral resistance without inducing any obvious physical alterations or symptoms, restoring confidence that USP18 protease inhibition could be a well-tolerable antiviral therapeutic approach.</s></p></div>
