al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Jahanshahi et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Within the striatum, dopamine (DA) transmission is known to play a key role in fostering learning via encoding the difference between expectations and outcomes of our actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Montague et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Schultz et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Schultz, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>These prediction error signals (PEs) are utilized to update current beliefs and, importantly, to adapt subsequent behavior.</s><s>Positive PEs are signaled via a transient increase in firing rate ('burst') and negative PEs are associated with a pause in tonic firing ('dip').</s><s>It has been proposed that DA mediates learning from positive as well as negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Van Der Schaaf et al., 2014)</ref>, but via two segregated ('direct' / 'indirect') pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Frank, 2005;</ref><ref

evidence has been provided for this model in healthy volunteers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cox et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the 'direct pathway', striatal D1 receptor expressing neurons predominantly send inhibitory projections directly to the output nucleus of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus interna/substantia nigra pars reticulata (GPi/SNr).</s><s>Postsynaptic D1 receptors are sensitive to bursts in DAergic transmission.</s><s>Thus, correct stimulus-response associations are strengthened via D1-receptor related modulation of synaptic plasticity within the direct pathway subsequent to positive PEs.</s><s>In the 'indirect pathway' <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Gerfen et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Surmeier et al., 2007)</ref>, striatal neurons expressing D2-receptors predominantly send inhibitory projections first to the external segment of the globus pallidus.</s><s>From there inhibitory projections reach the subthalamic nucleus (STN).</s><s>The STN then sends excitatory projections back to the GPi/SNr.</s><s>Postsynaptic D2 receptors are sensitive to detecting transient dips within the tonic DA signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Goto and Grace, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Day et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, wrong stimulus-response associations are weakened through D2 receptor activity in the indirect pathway subsequent to negative PEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Klein et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jocham et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jocham et al., , 2014))</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, too low tonic DA may impair D2 receptor-related signaling, as the magnitude of extracellular tonic DA determines the background stimulation of DA receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Grace, 1991)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, too high tonic DA release may impede D2 receptor-related signaling, as high tonic DA levels can inhibit the phasic DA response via action on presynaptic D2 auto-receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Goto et al., 2007)</ref> or via hyperpolarization of DAergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dyakonova et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, either too low or too high tonic DA levels may specifically impede the capability of detecting dips and, consequently, may alter learning from negative PEs in particular.</s><s>Further, recent data indicate that the hemispheric asymmetry of DA signals is related to the propensity to learn from positive vs. negative PEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Maril et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tomer et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aberg et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>A mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon is missing to date.</s></p><p><s>Consequently, it is important to differentiate between learning from positive and negative feedback to identify the specific involvement of different DA pathways or aspects of DA transmission.</s><s>Further, an investigation of different aspects of DA transmission based on behavior on the same behavioral task will be beneficial for interpretation of the results.</s></p><p><s>Here, we assessed learning in response to positive and negative PEs in three populations that allow different inferences on the role of DA in incidental stimulusresponse learning.</s><s>Importantly, all participants completed the same probabilistic learning task, the Weather Prediction Task (WPT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Knowlton et al., 1994)</ref>.</s><s>To differentiate between learning from positive and negative PEs, we employed a computational reinforcement-learning model.</s></p><p><s>First, we explored the influence of DAergic signaling in a sample of healthy volunteers who repeatedly underwent [ 11 C]raclopride Positron Emission Tomography while completing the WPT with and without corrective feedback.</s><s>Specifically, we investigated the impact of DA release, tonic DA level, and the asymmetry of phasic responses between left and right striatum on learning from positive and negative feedback.</s><s>We hypothesized that the strength of phasic striatal DA transmission during procedural learning is linearly related to the participants' capability of learning from positive PEs.</s><s>Further, we predicted that tonic DA levels within the striatum are associated with the ability to learn from negative PEs in an inverted u-shaped manner.</s><s>Finally, we expected that asymmetry between left and right striatal signaling is related to learning from positive PEs.</s></p><p><s>Second, we investigated the effect of L-Dopa medication on learning from negative PEs in a sample of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were tested both on or off medication when completing the WPT.</s><s>Evidence (e.g.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agid et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kish, Shannak, &amp; Hornykiewicz, 1988)</ref> suggests that in early PD dopamine depletion is mainly limited to dorsal striatum and the ventral striatum is relatively less affected.</s><s>We expected patients on levodopa medication to be selectively impaired in learning from negative PEs compared to off medication due to an nonspecific increase in DAergic tone in the ventral striatum in the on state <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cools et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Frank et al., 2007a)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Third, we investigated learning in a sample of early Huntington's disease (HD) patients, a disease that is associated with a hyper-activation of the 'direct' pathway.</s><s>Thus, we hypothesized that these patients will be selectively impaired in successful learning from positive

predominantly left hemispheric deficits were less willing to invest effort to maximize gain, indicating a selective impairment in approach motivation.</s><s>In contrast, PD patients with a right hemispheric deficit exhibited impairments in avoidance motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Porat et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Further, these patients were impaired in learning from positive vs. negative feedback, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Maril et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to Aberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aberg et al., 2015)</ref>, who reported a positive association between better learning from positive PEs and functional asymmetry in left and right ventral striatum, our data indicate a negative relationship.</s><s>This seeming discrepancy can be explained by the indirect modulation of phasic responses by DA tone via inhibitory actions on the presynaptic cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Goto et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dyakonova et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>So what happens if the balance between the integrity of direct and indirect pathways is compromised?</s><s>Female patients with early progression of Huntington's disease, which is characterized by a hyper-activation of the direct pathway, exhibited exaggerated learning rates from positive feedback in our study.</s><s>In Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative, autosomal-dominant transmitted neurodegenerative disorder, cell death of striatal neurons already occurs in early and even pre-symptomatic stages of the disease.</s><s>The progression of neuronal death in the striatum is gradual and proceeds from dorsal to ventral and from medial to lateral <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Vonsattel et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Aylward et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>In early stages of HD, cell death primarily affects GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons within the indirect pathway.</s><s>Furthermore, HD has been associated with a loss of pre-synaptic D2 auto-receptors, thus impairing the ability of tonic DA to regulate phasic responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cepeda et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Reduced striatal D2 receptor availability has been reported even in asymptomatic HD patients and mutation carriers, suggesting that dopaminergic signaling is compromised early in HD <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Weeks et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">van Oostrom et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, this leads to a hyper-activation of the direct pathway already in very early stages of the disease.</s><s>In line, HD patients in early stages of the disease have been shown to be generally impaired in procedural stimulus-response learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Holl et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Adding to this, our results indicate that in early HD, DA pathways are affected differentially in women and men and that impairments are selective for learning from positive PEs.</s><s>While we predicted specificity for learning from positive PEs, the finding of a gender-specific effect in patients with early HD is novel.</s><s>It has been proposed that a general gender difference in endogenous dopamine levels or other aspects of dopaminergic transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Pohjalainen et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Kaasinen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Laakso et al., 2002)</ref> may account for gender differences in the vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Gillies et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>For Huntington's disease, however, penetrance and prevalence seems to be equal for both sexes.</s><s>Interestingly, a large European study showed recently that women with HD exhibited more severe symptoms and a faster progression of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zielonka et al., 2013)</ref>, and a large US study found that women have a longer duration of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Foroud et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, there might be gender differences in the progression of the disease.</s><s>Our results indicate a severe impairment in learning from positive PEs in women with HD compared to men.</s><s>This might be explained by an interaction of disease-specific effects with sex differences in dopaminergic transmission.</s><s>Women have a higher presynaptic dopaminergic synthesis capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Laakso et al., 2002)</ref> and show a lower binding potential for [ 11 C]raclopride, suggestive of a higher striatal dopamine concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Pohjalainen et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Further, women have been shown to have higher D2-like receptor binding potentials than men in frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kaasinen et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Together, these might produce an additive effect on the hyper-activation of the direct pathway, and, in consequence, exaggerated learning from positive PEs especially in women with early HD.</s><s>However, as positive learning rate was associated with motor symptom severity across all patients, the gender specific effect might alleviate during further progression of the disease.</s><s>In line with our results, Palminteri and colleagues observed an asymmetry in favor of reward-based relative to punishment-based learning in patients with early compared to late HD and to controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Palminteri et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, the authors found a higher reward bias and a higher reinforcement magnitude for gains compared to losses.</s><s>However, learning rates for gain and loss conditions were not different between HD groups or compared to controls in their study.</s><s>Importantly, the task they used differed from the WPT in that participants had to learn to approach, i.e. select, rewarding options and to avoid, i.e. to not choose, punishing options in different conditions.</s><s>Taken together, our results indicate that future work should pay special attention to sex differences in HD.</s></p><p><s>An imbalance between tonic and phasic DA signaling may lie at the heart of alterations in dopamine-based learning, as has been observed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Badgaiyan et al., 2015)</ref>, depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dunlop BW and Nemeroff CB, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Mörkl et al., 2016)</ref>, schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Juckel et al., 2006;</ref><ref

disease (PD) patients on dopaminergic medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jahanshahi et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Further, within healthy volunteers, the layout of the dopaminergic system seems to be intimately linked to the individual level of personality traits such as approach/avoidance bias and impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buckholtz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Tomer et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our results demonstrate that solving the WPT relies on the integrity of different pathways within the dopaminergic system.</s><s>In line with our hypotheses, data from healthy individuals, patients with PD on dopaminergic medication as well as from patients with HD show that variance within each pathway is linked to specific performance differences when solving the WPT.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>The present data reveal that the WPT is suitable to disentangle learning from negative and positive feedback with the help of computational modeling.</s><s>The ability to learn from positive and negative feedback might prove to be a sensitive marker for the integrity of dopaminergic signal transmission.</s><s>In particular, it might differentiate between the involvement of the 'direct' and 'indirect' dopaminergic pathways.</s><s>The present data are interesting beyond clinical context in that imbalances of dopaminergic signaling have not only been observed for psychiatric conditions but also for obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kessler et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Horstmann et al., 2015)</ref> and adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Luciana et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, future work should differentiate between learning from positive and negative feedback since these processes rely on segregate neural mechanisms.</s><s>In the case of medical conditions, specific learning impairments would point to associated specific neural changes that call for different treatment options.</s><s>significant variance explanation.</s><s>All three tested models showed comparable model fit according to pseudo-r² and BIC values.</s><s>While standard QL shows the best fit according to estimated probabilities and model frequencies across all subjects, ΔBIC indicate no strong evidence against the other two models.</s><s>Importantly, despite comparable model fit, only the stepwise model with two learning rates was able to explain significant variance in participants' WPT performance in all three studies according to regression analyses.</s><s>LR = Learning rate.</s></p></div>
