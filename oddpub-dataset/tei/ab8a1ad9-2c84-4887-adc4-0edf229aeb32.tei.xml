Sparrow, L. Tasciotti, 2017) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s><s>This Data in Brief article presents two rounds of survey data conducted in 2011 and 2012 for a panel of 677 dairy farm households in the province of East Java, Indonesia.</s><s>The survey relied on structured questionnaires to collect data on the production and use of biogas, the use of other non-renewable energy sources, farm characteristics, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of households.</s><s>Displays how access to biogas alters household use of renewable and non-renewable energy sources for cooking.</s></p><p><s>Allows an assessment of the various benefits obtained from using biogas.</s><s>Permits cost-benefit calculations associated with investing in biogas producing units.</s></p><p><s>The data set and do files will enable other researchers to replicate the current study and to carry out extended analyses of a sustainable energy initiative.</s></p></div>
