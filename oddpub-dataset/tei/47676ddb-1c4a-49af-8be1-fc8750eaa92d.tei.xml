<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The K-box architecture</head><p><s>We developed a comprehensive method in order to handle inherent contamination problems in two-step PCR-based NGS library preparations.</s><s>This new method is based on three synergistically acting sequence elements referred to as K-box.</s><s>As outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the first amplification primers comprise all three elements (k1, k2 and s in the forward primer and k1 , k2 and s in the reverse primer), whereas the forward and reverse primers of the second amplification contain only k1 and k1 , respectively.</s><s>With the three K-box elements one single K-box is designed by bioinformatics methods and optimized not to form hybrids that might lead to mispriming under a multiplex experimental setup.</s></p><p><s>The rationale behind the introduction of K1 elements is the prevention of carry-over contaminations from previous amplification reactions.</s><s>As outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> only matching K1 sequences in the primers of the first and second PCR allow amplification of the respective PCR product.</s><s>Since K1 sequences are individual for each sample, the amplification of PCR cross-contaminations is suppressed in the second PCR in case of non-concordant K1 elements.</s></p><p><s>In our TCR␤ multiplex analyses K1 sequences comprise exemplary 7 nucleotides (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The K1 elements are designed by a minimization procedure which selects the K1 elements by (i) minimal global similarity to any other K1element, and (ii) a strong dissimilarity rule at the specific 3 ends of the K1 elements.</s><s>The resulting K-box sequences have a very low potential for hybrid formation.</s></p><p><s>A further K-box element is the K2 sequence present only in the first amplification primers.</s><s>While K1 elements lead to suppression of contaminations, the K2 elements serve to detect possible remaining contaminations from previous amplification reactions.</s><s>In our TCR␤ multiplex analyses we de-Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Scheme of the K-box method in two-step PCR.</s><s>In the K-box method (A), three additional sequence elements (K1-, K2-and S-elements) are introduced by the first amplification primers.</s><s>The combination of k1 and k1 (K1 elements) differ from sample to sample but are identical (matched) within a specific first and second amplification primer set.</s><s>(B) A second amplification can only occur with matched K1 elements and therefore the amplification of contaminations from other first or second amplifications is suppressed.</s><s>In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> mismatched K1 elements are indicated by different colors and marked by two flash symbols.</s><s>The combination of k2 and k2`(K2 elements) serves as a bioinformatics indicator.</s><s>Sequences in the PCR mix with unexpected K2 elements are identified as residual contaminations.</s><s>Furthermore, s and s (S elements) are designed as mismatch with the template i.e. the respective genomic TCR␤ V-and J-segments.</s><s>The S elements effectively separate the template matching part of the primers from their 5 -tail thereby reducing the risk of PCR bias.</s></p></div>

Sequences of k-and k -box elements for set 1-9 used for the twostep PCR NGS library preparations</head><p><s>The sequences are listed in 5 -3 orientation as present in the forward and reverse primers.</s><s>The three distinct k-boxes used in the forward primers are marked with green, yellow and red colors and the purple, blue and gray colors mark the three different k -boxes employed in the reverse primers.</s><s>By using all possible k/k combinations of the 3 k-and 3 k -boxes 9 sets were generated.</s><s>signed K2 elements exemplarily with three sample-specific nucleotides (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>For a better understanding of first and second PCR primer matching we introduce here the term 'set' which defines a unique k/k combination.</s><s>Within an individual set a specific second primer pair is designed to work only together with a specific first primer pair.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives an example of 9 sets with K1 and K2 sequences used in the TCR␤ multiplex analyses.</s><s>The 9 possible set combinations are formed by 3 distinct k-and kboxes in the forward and reverse primers.</s><s>Basically with 10 distinct k-and k -boxes 100 unique k/k sets can be generated.</s><s>Therefore, with a linear increase in the effort of primer synthesis an exponential growth in the number of distinct sets is achieved.</s><s>This makes this approach up-scalable with reasonable efforts.</s></p><p><s>In principle, K1 and K2 elements can be of any convenient length.</s><s>We typically use a length of 7 nucleotides for K1 and 3 nucleotides for K2 elements.</s><s>Since the sequences of K1 and K2 elements are variable in a sample specific manner, certain variations may coincidentally match in their last nucleotides on the 3end with the sequence of the target DNA next to the template.</s><s>In that case the template hybridizing part of the first amplification primers would be elongated, possibly leading to higher annealing temperatures and PCR bias.</s><s>To circumvent this problem separator sequences (S elements) are introduced into the first amplification primers (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>They are designed as mismatch with the template i.e. the respective genomic TCR␤ V-and J-segments.</s><s>The S elements effectively separate the template matching part of the primers from their 5 -tail thereby reducing the risk of PCR bias.</s><s>It should be noted that every multiplex PCR assay needs a proper design for S elements, whereas the same K1 sequences and the respective second amplification primers can be used for different multiplex applications.</s><s>Barcodes are introduced into the second amplification primers to allow multiplex sequencing of NGS libraries.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> summarizes the functions of the different K-box elements and the terminology used throughout the manuscript.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing of contamination protection by the K-box in multiplex two-step PCR analyses</head><p><s>To test the effectiveness of the K-box method in a multiplex TCR␤ analysis we first used two different experimental set-ups: (i) runs with matching K1 elements and (ii) runs with mismatching K1 elements simulating e.g.</s><s>pipetting errors.</s><s>We used 400 ng tonsillar DNA as template to allow the amplification of high numbers of different TCR␤ gene rearrangements.</s><s>The two-step PCR protocol employed is given as Supplementary Methods.</s><s>PCR results were analyzed by gel electrophoresis.</s><s>In the experiments with matching K1 elements the 9 primer sets depicted in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> were used.</s><s>In line with the K-box principle these 9 sets were characterized by unique k/k combinations between the sets and concordant k/k combinations within a set.</s><s>The same twostep PCR workflow was used also in a total of 15 experiments with mismatching K1 elements simulating pipetting mistakes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S2</ref>).</s><s>To this end the first amplification product of a given set (e.g.</s><s>set 1) was used as template for amplification with second amplification primers from another (not matching) set (e.g.</s><s>set 2).</s><s>Such a simulation of sample confusion can be regarded as 100% contamination in the second PCR mix.</s></p><p><s>Next, we applied NGS to evaluate the K-box method.</s><s>We used again the 9 TCR␤ multiplex primer sets depicted in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and a synthetic template.</s><s>Generation of the synthetic template is illustrated in the Supplementary Methods in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>.</s><s>This synthetic template covered all TCR␤ V-J combinations (N = 616) relevant for binding of the 44 V-and 14 J-segment specific TCR␤ primers.</s><s>Using the aforementioned 9 primer sets (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) 18 PCR assays were performed, 9 of which without and 9 assays with spike-in contaminations (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S3</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>).</s><s>Spike-in contaminations are here defined as first amplification products with not matching K-boxes to the second amplification primers employed.</s><s>For example, a mix of eight first amplification products amplified with set 1-8 primers are spike-in contaminations if the second amplification is performed with set 9 primers.</s><s>If the amplification of the spike-in contaminations is not completely suppressed by the K1 mismatches, residual contaminations can be detected by the unique k2/k2 combinations.</s><s>The 9 assays with spike-in contaminations were assembled as follows: 60% represented the PCR product of the first amplification with matching K-box combination whereas the remaining 40% were derived from the PCR products of the other 8 first amplifications (5% each) with mismatching K-box combinations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S3</ref>).</s><s>This first amplification mixture was diluted 1:100 and the second amplification assay was S-elements are designed as mismatch with the template i.e. the respective genomic TCR␤ V-and J-segments.</s><s>The S elements effectively separate the template matching part of the primers from their 5 -tail thereby reducing the risk of PCR bias.</s></p><p><s>The typical lengths of K1, K2 and S-elements as used in our TCR␤ multiplex analyses are 7, 3 and 2 nucleotides, respectively.</s></p><p><s>processed as described in the Supplementary Methods.</s><s>Spin column-purified PCR products were sequenced with MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, USA) in paired-end mode (2 × 150 bp).</s><s>For multiplexing standard TruSeq barcodes and MiSeq sequencing default conditions were employed allowing 1 mismatch in the barcode.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of parameters for effective suppression of carry-over contamination</head><p><s>In order to determine the factors needed for effective suppression of carry-over contamination in two-step PCR analyses we analyzed (i) the impact of the number of base pairs of K1 mismatches and (ii) the effect of PT-bonds at the 3 -end of second amplification primers using a proofreading polymerase.</s><s>For this purpose we used DNA of the T-cell line Peer as a template and amplified in a non-multiplex setting specifically the Peer TCR␤ gene rearrangement (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>As visualized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> the absence of K1 mismatches led--as expected--to strong amplification products after second amplification (Lane 1) whereas a K1 mismatch of 1 bp was able to strongly reduce the PCR product intensity (Lanes 2 and 3).</s><s>K1 mismatches of 2 bp (Lane 4) were sufficient to suppress the contaminating second amplification products almost completely.</s><s>As another important factor an increasing number of PT-bonds at the 3 -end of second amplification primers resulted in improved contamination suppression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s><s>Details are given as Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Consequently, conditions for effective carry-over contamination suppression should comprise k1/k1 mismatches of more than 2 nucleotides and the use of at least 2 PT-bonds at the 3 -end of second amplification primers.</s></p><p><s>For comparison to the experiments using a proofreading polymerase and primers with PT-bonds in the sec-e135 Nucleic Acids <ref type="bibr">Research, 2015, Vol. 43, No. 20</ref> PAGE 6 OF 9 The percentages of correct reads and of contaminations were determined according to the respective K2 sequences employed.</s><s>A contamination rate of 0% indicates that no contaminating read was detectable.</s><s>Furthermore, the percentage of random reads with unexpected K2-elements occurring stochastically on V/J-side is given.</s><s>PCR products of the first amplification were defined as 100% contamination and were used as template for the second amplification.</s><s>The size of the gel ladder is given in base pairs.</s><s>ond amplification we performed experiments with a nonproofreading polymerase in the second amplification and primers without PT-bonds.</s><s>In both settings the k-box and k -box contamination suppression increases with an increasing number of K1 mismatches.</s><s>However, contamination suppression is less effective if non-proofreading polymerases are used (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">S5 and S7</ref>).</s><s>A further advantage of proofreading polymerases is their less error-prone DNA-synthesis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Testing of contamination protection by the K-box in multiplex two-step PCR analyses</head><p><s>To test the impact of the K-box method for contamination protection in a multiplex TCR␤ analysis we utilized in a first experiment 9 primer sets in 9 match and 15 mismatch settings.</s><s>In these experiments tonsillar DNA was used as a template.</s><s>The length of K1 mismatches in the mismatch settings was 4-5 base pairs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S2</ref>).</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref> the matched settings led to the production of the expected PCR products.</s><s>On the other hand the K1 mismatch settings between first and second amplification primers completely suppressed the amplification during the second PCR.</s></p><p><s>In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of contamination protection by a highly sensitive NGS we investigated the 9 primer sets in 9 match settings and in 9 assays with matching sets plus spike-in contaminations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S3</ref>).</s><s>For these experiments an artificial template was used (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In total, 18 NGS libraries were prepared, which were tagged by standard Illumina barcodes.</s><s>The libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and demultiplexed by Illumina software (default parameters).</s><s>For 8.52 % of the reads the barcode could not be identified unambiguously.</s><s>These reads were excluded from further analysis.</s><s>Another quality filtering step was imposed by our read-joining algorithm which requires that both reads of each read pair exhibit significant overlaps.</s><s>94.8% ± 1.81% of all read pairs could by joined successfully to one consensus sequence.</s><s>Finally, the joined reads were classified and filtered again for occurrence of possible k1/k1 -boxes, which was the case for 90.6% ± 2.4%.</s><s>In the end, compared to the original raw read numbers, on average 83.5% ± 2.2% of reads were used for the data analysis, which was equivalent to around 8.5 million read pairs.</s></p><p><s>Our observations are summarized in the following and in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3:</ref> r Most importantly, evaluation of NGS results revealed complete suppression of spike-in contaminations.</s></p><p><s>r We compared the percentages of random reads in the runs without spike-ins to the ones with 40% effective contamination by a standard two-sided t-test.</s><s>The resulting  <ref type="table">S5</ref>.</s><s>The base pair length of K1 mismatches and the number of PT-bonds positively correlate with suppression of contaminations.</s><s>The mean for the NTCs (N = 16) and background (N = 16) measurements was 9.9 ± 1.9 Vol.</s><s>% and 9.4 ± 2.3 Vol.</s><s>% respectively.</s><s><ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S2</ref>.</s><s>The size of the gel ladder is given in base pairs.</s><s>P-value is not significant (P = 0.8) which means that the random errors occurred at equal rates in both groups.</s></p><p><s>r The design of our primer sets with integrated K-boxes leads to a highly efficient reduction of contamination in the secondary PCR step, and, if necessary, allows detection and of course computational removal of possibly persisting minor contaminations by bioinformatics sequence analysis.</s></p></div>
