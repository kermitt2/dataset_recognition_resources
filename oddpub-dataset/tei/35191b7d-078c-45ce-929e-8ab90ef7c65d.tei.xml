0.8) of either shared or independent causal variants between pairs of traits (Online Methods, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">9</ref>).</s><s>Four of the eighteen PSC risk loci have not been associated at genome-wide significance with IBD (BCL2L11, FOXP1, SIK2 and UBASH3A) although the lead SNPs at two of these loci (rs72837826 -BCL2L11 and rs1893592 -UBASH3A) did demonstrate strong evidence for colocalisation (posterior probability &gt; 0.8) and suggestive evidence of association (P &lt; 10 −4 ) in the UC cohort (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">9</ref>, 10).</s><s>Of the fourteen PSC loci that had been previously associated with IBD (UC, CD or both), four demonstrated strong evidence that the causal variant is independent from that in UC and CD (IL2RA, CCDC88B, CLEC16A and PRKD2), a finding supported by the low linkage disequilibrium (r 2 &lt; 0.2) between the lead SNPs in PSC and UC/CD at these loci (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">9 and 10</ref>).</s><s>Thus, even for highly comorbid diseases, significant association to the same region of the genome will not always be driven by a shared causal variant.</s><s>This supports similar observations for other related phenotypes such as psoriasis versus psoriatic arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Six of the fourteen loci associated with PSC and IBD displayed strong evidence of a shared causal variant with UC, CD or both (MST1, IL21, HDAC7, SH2B3, CD226 and PSMG1) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">9 and 10</ref>).</s><s>We further tested these six SNPs for evidence of heterogeneity of effect using Cochran's Q test (Online Methods).</s><s>Four showed significantly increased effect size in PSC relative to both UC and CD (MST1, IL21, SH2B3 and CD226) (P &lt; 2.78×10 −3 ) with an additional locus (PSMG1) showing significantly increased effect size relative to CD only (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Simulation studies showed that the observed heterogeneity of effect is unlikely to be driven by the large difference in sample size between the PSC and UC cohorts (P empirical &lt; 3.00×10 −4 at all four SNPs) (Supplementary Note).</s><s>We did not detect evidence of heterogeneity of effect between PSC patients expressing different IBD phenotypes (PSC-UC, PSC-CD or PSC-NoIBD) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>However, our power to detect significant heterogeneity of effect between these PSC subphenotypes was limited by sample size (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">11</ref>).</s></p><p><s>While the much larger size of the UC and CD cohorts gives us power to investigate the effects of PSC risk SNPs in IBD, the PSC cohort is underpowered to do the reverse.</s><s>Thus, to clarify the pairwise genetic correlation between PSC, UC and CD we obtained genome-wide individual level genotype data from the International IBD Genetics Consortium for 6,247 CD cases, 6,686 UC cases and 34,393 population controls of European descent <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and used GCTA to estimate genome-wide genetic correlations (r G ) using a bivariate linear mixed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> (Online Methods, Supplementary Note).</s><s>This analysis quantified the SNPheritability (h 2 SNP ) of PSC as 0.148 (95% CI: 0.135-0.161),</s><s>and showed that in the context of common genetic variation, PSC is significantly more related to UC (rG = 0.29) than CD (rG = 0.04) (P = 2.55×10 −15 ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), consistent with the clinical phenotype most often observed in PSC-IBD patients.</s><s>Moreover, the genetic correlation between UC and CD (rG = 0.56) is significantly greater than that between PSC and either UC or CD (P &lt; 1.0×10 <ref type="bibr">−15</ref> ).</s><s>Due to a lack of data regarding the PSC status of individuals in the UC and CD cohorts we could not remove the approximately 5% of patients we would expect to have comorbid PSC.</s><s>This suggests that, while our estimates of the genome-wide genetic correlation between PSC and both UC and CD may seem surprisingly low, these are likely slight overestimates of the true genetic correlation between the diseases.</s><s>We validated the GCTA co-heritability estimates using a summary statistics-based genetic correlation analysis (LD score regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> ), and found support for the reported genetic relationships (i.e.</s><s>rG CD.vs.UC = 0.68 &gt; rG PSC.vs.UC = 0.39 &gt; rG PSC.vs.CD = 0.09) (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>The low genome-wide genetic correlation between PSC and the IBDs is also supported by known differences in HLA risk alleles <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and our discovery that PSC has both independent causal variants and shared causal variants of heterogeneous effect size compared to both UC and CD.</s><s>The analyses presented in this study, based on common genetic variants (MAF &gt; 1%), suggest functional studies in both the biliary tree and intestinal tract are required if we are to understand the biological consequences of PSC associated genetic variants, whether or not they are shared with IBD.</s></p><p><s>While it is clear that a substantial component of the genetic architecture of PSC is not shared with either CD or UC, our data also show that shared genetic risk factors do certainly exist and likely play some role in disease comorbidity.</s><s>However, under a purely additive genetic liability threshold model, the genetic covariance between the two diseases would need to be greater than 0.76 to fully explain the fact that 60% of PSC cases have comorbid UC (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the observed genetic correlation (rG = 0.29) would generate a PSC-UC comorbidity rate of only 1.6% under this model.</s><s>This demonstrates that the observed extent of comorbidity between PSC and UC is not fully explained by shared additive genetic effects of common variants and that other factors must play a role, such as shared environmental effects or shared rare variants not captured by our GWAS and imputation data.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have performed the largest genome-wide association study of PSC to date and identified four new PSC risk loci.</s><s>We now consider 23 regions of the genome to be associated with disease risk, including four loci only recently associated with PSC in a cross-disease meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>One of our new associations suggests that decreased UBASH3A is associated with a lower risk of PSC through a common NMD variant.</s><s>We have also shown that, even for highly comorbid phenotypes such as PSC and IBD, significant association to the same region of the genome will not always be driven by a common causal variant.</s><s>Furthermore, by conducting genome-wide comparisons with CD and UC we have, for the first time, shown that the comorbid gastrointestinal inflammation seen in the majority of PSC patients cannot be fully explained by shared genetic risk.</s><s>Thus, the biliary and intestinal inflammation seen specifically in PSC should be studied to advance our understanding of the disease and improve clinical outcome for patients with this devastating disorder.</s></p></div>

study <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> were downloaded.</s><s>Where available we used results from their combined GWAS plus Immunochip follow-up study and otherwise used those from the GWAS analysis.</s><s>Definition of the 231 significantly associated loci as CD, UC or both (IBD) was taken from Liu and van Sommeren et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>Due to the limited availability of relevant subphenotype data within the IIBDGC data, we were unable to identify the 3-5% of IBD cases that we expect to have PSC.</s><s>Including these individuals as IBD cases in our comparisons lowers our power to detect differences between the two diseases.</s></p><p><s>Causal variant co-localisation analysis-To identify causal variants within disease associated loci that are shared between diseases we used a summary statistic based Bayesian test of colocalisation (COLOC), implemented in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Briefly, COLOC generates posterior probabilities for five different hypotheses: 1) no association to either disease, 2) association to disease 1 but not disease 2, 3) association to disease 2 but not disease 1, 4) association to both disease 1 and 2 but independent causal variants and 5) association to both disease 1 and 2 with a common causal variant.</s><s>Only SNPs present in all the cohorts (PSC, CD, UC and IBD) were included in the analysis and associated regions were defined as 1MB regions with the most associated SNP at the centre.</s><s>Within each region we calculated the r 2 between the PSC lead SNP and the SNP most associated with each of the other three diseases.</s><s>Default priors were used for the probability of a SNP being a) associated to an individual disease (1×10 −4 ) and b) causally associated to both diseases (1×10 −5 ).</s><s>This prior probability of colocalisation is more conservative in declaring distinct causal variants compared to a recent colocalisation analysis across six immune-mediated disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Heterogeneity of effects analysis-A formal heterogeneity of odds test was performed between PSC and IBD using the Cochran's Q test implemented in METAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> for all 18 PSC risk loci.</s><s>The odds ratios and standard errors were obtained from our current PSC GWAS and the IIBDGC analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>A locus was declared to have significant heterogeneity of effects based on a threshold of P = 2.78×10 −3 to account for multiple testing (Bonferroni correction applied to 5% significance threshold, N=18 tests).</s><s>In order to test whether the significant heterogeneity of effects are due to an overestimation of effect sizes in the smaller PSC cohort, we undertook a simulation study which demonstrated that the observed degree of heterogeneity is unlikely to occur by chance (Supplementary Note).</s></p><p><s>Genetic correlation analysis-Genome-wide SNP data from 12,933 IBD cases and 34,393 population controls of European descent was made available to us by the International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC).</s><s>The quality control and imputation of these data using 1000 Genomes haplotypes has been previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>See Supplementary Note for details of the SNP and sample quality control (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">13</ref>) undertaken across the IIBDGC and PSC data to ensure compatibility and remove duplicated individuals.</s><s>Individual level genotype data for PSC, CD, UC and IBD were used to estimate the proportion of variance in liability explained by SNPs genome-wide under a multiplicative model using the linear mixed model based restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method implemented in the GCTA software <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref> .</s><s>Ancestry principal components were calculated using genotype data from the 1000 Genomes project and were projected for all our cases and controls.</s><s>The first twenty principals components were included as covariates in the linear mixed model.</s><s>We assumed a prevalence of 0.0001 for PSC, 0.005 for CD and 0.0025 for UC.</s><s>A bivariate extension of the linear mixed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , again implemented in GCTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , was used to estimate the additive covariance component and estimate the genetic correlation (r G ) between PSC and either CD, UC, or IBD.</s></p><p><s>In addition, we undertook an alternative genetic correlation analysis that uses summary statistics and LD score regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Of the 7,458,430 SNPs that were shared between PSC and both IBDs, 1,102,210 HapMap3 SNPs were selected for the analysis as recommended.</s><s>Then, pre-computed LD scores from the 1000 Genomes European data were used to run LD score regression to estimate genetic correlation.</s></p><p><s>Calculating comorbidity under a purely pleiotropic genetic model-Under a bivariate liability threshold model, where all disease risk is explained by additive genetics, the probability that an individual has disease 1, given that he has disease 2, is given by where K i is the prevalence of disease i, T i =Φ −1 (1−K i ) is the liability threshold of disease i, is the heritability of disease i, r g is the genetic correlation and F(.) is the multivariate cumulative distribution function for normal distribution.</s></p></div>
