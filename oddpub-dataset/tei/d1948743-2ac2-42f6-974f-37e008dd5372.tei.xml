Pex11p-Dnm1p interaction was inhibited by mutating the Leucine residues at positions 15 and 59 in Pex11p to Alanines (L15A and L59A), mutations which disturbed the Dnm1p-Pex11p interaction (Fig. <ref

of the strain expressing this mutant to grow on methanol (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4C</ref>), indicating that the observed fission defect results from disturbing the

alignment analysis indicates that many of the residues that regulate the Dnm1p-Pex11p interaction in yeast are conserved in mammalian Pex11β, whereas the domain structure of Pex11β is also highly similar (SI Appendix, S3 and S7).</s><s>To investigate the link between Drp1 and Pex11β further, we mutated the residues corresponding to Leu15 and Leu59 in mammalian Pex11β (Trp4 and Leu48) and followed the effect on peroxisome fission in COS-7 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>Expression of Pex11β L48A induced peroxisome proliferation in a similar manner to WT Pex11β <ref

mutations (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S8A</ref>).</s><s>Significantly, introduction of the W4A mutation into a peptide derived from Pex11β disturbed the ability of Drp1 to bind to this peptide in vitro (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S8B</ref>).</s><s>These observations support the conclusion that, similar to yeast, Drp1-mediated peroxisomal fission can be compromised by disturbing the Drp1-Pex11β interaction.</s></p><p><s>The Amphipathic Helix of Pex11p Functions as a GAP for Dnm1p in Vitro.</s><s>GTP hydrolysis by Dnm1p is needed to achieve organelle fission <ref

binding alters the kinetic properties of Dnm1p.</s><s>Purified Dnm1p (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref>) was able to hydrolyze GTP in a time-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>) and displayed a catalytic activity (Kcat) of 2.16 ± 0.42 min −1 and a substrate affinity (K m ) of 381 ± 6.5 μM (Fig. <ref type="figure">7D</ref>).</s><s>These values are similar to those of mammalian Drp1, isolated from S. cerevisiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>The addition of purified Pex11-His 6 resulted in a small increase in the GTPase activity of Dnm1p (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>).</s><s>However, addition of detergents to Dnm1p, which were essential to solubilize full-length Pex11-His 6 , strongly reduced its activity (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>), which hampered the analysis of the effect of full-length Pex11-His 6 on Dnm1p.</s><s>Therefore, we continued our analysis using peptides of Pex11p.</s><s>Peptides corresponding to the binding regions B1 or B3 in Pex11p did not alter the activity of Dnm1p (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6A</ref>).</s><s>However, the B3 binding site resides in a larger amphipathic helix, extending from residues 56 to 86 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>Addition of the complete amphipathic helix to Dnm1p significantly enhanced the catalytic activity (Kcat = 4.14 ± 0.32 min −1 ) as well as substrate affinity (K m = 237 ± 13 μM).</s><s>This stimulation was also observed when reactions were performed in the presence of high salt (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6B</ref>), conditions known to block Dnm1p oligomerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>No increase in activity was observed when a similar peptide was added where Leu59, Leu62, and Phe63 were altered to Alanine residues (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6C</ref>).</s><s>This peptide is unable to bind to Dnm1p in vitro (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S6D</ref>), indicating that the interaction between the amphipathic helix and Dnm1p is crucial for the observed stimulation.</s><s>Finally, we established that

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Pex11p initiates peroxisomal fission by catalyzing organelle elongation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, we identify a new role for yeast Pex11p in the final stage of peroxisomal fission, namely as a GAP for Dnm1p.</s><s>Similar observations were made for the mammalian homologs Pex11β and Drp1.</s></p><p><s>Our data clearly demonstrate that Pex11p and Dnm1p are required for different aspects of peroxisomal fission, as the lack of one protein cannot be suppressed by overproduction of the other.</s><s>Pex11p overproduction in H. polymorpha dnm1Δ cells results in tubulation, but not scission, of the peroxisomal membrane, whereas pex11Δ cells contain a single peroxisome irrespective of whether Dnm1p is overproduced or not.</s><s>These data fit a model where Pex11p and Dnm1p act together in the final step of peroxisomal fission.</s><s>Pex11p also functions as an initiator of the fission process through insertion of an amphipathic helix into the peroxisomal membrane, with Dnm1p-mediated scission of the organelle following.</s><s>However, the observation that Pex11p interacts directly with Dnm1p, plus that this interaction is crucial for peroxisomal fission, establishes that Pex11p performs an additional yet vital role in the last stage of peroxisomal fission.</s><s>How can these data be integrated into the prevailing model describing peroxisomal fission?</s><s>The binding sites for Dnm1p reside in the N-terminal region of Pex11p, as does the membrane remodeling amphipathic helix of Pex11p ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, one Dnm1p binding site (B3, residues 55-70) is present in this amphipathic helix, suggesting the existence of a synergistic relationship between the membrane remodeling and GTPase activating roles of Pex11p.</s><s>Our previous data establish that this amphipathic helix adopts an unstructured conformation in aqueous solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, suggesting that this region of Pex11p can undergo transition from an unfolded to helical conformation.</s><s>This transition may facilitate insertion of the amphipathic helix into the peroxisomal membrane, to initiate fission.</s><s>As the introduction of helix-breaking mutations can disturb the Dnm1p interaction with Pex11p peptides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), we conclude that helix formation is required for Pex11p to bind Dnm1p.</s><s>Hence, Dnm1p binding, and consequently stimulation of Dnm1p GTPase activity, is likely to occur after Pex11p has remodeled the peroxisomal membrane, suggesting a spatiotemporal relationship.</s><s>On the other hand, our data on mammalian Pex11β, which suggest that a different region of Pex11β binds to and stimulates the activity of Drp1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and SI Appendix, Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure">S7  and S8</ref>), indicate that although the GAP activity of Pex11p is conserved in several species, the underlying mechanisms may differ.</s></p><p><s>In S. cerevisiae several Dnm1p binding partners are known to regulate peroxisomal fission, including the membrane protein Fis1p and the cytosolic proteins Mdv1p and Caf4p <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>Originally these proteins were proposed to facilitate Dnm1p recruitment to membranes, yet recent data on mitochondrial fission identified additional, postrecruitment roles.</s><s>Importantly, these binding partners do not stimulate Dnm1p GTPase activity, instead appearing to modulate Dnm1p oligomer assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>In mammals Drp1 binds not only to Fis1p (28) but additionally to the membrane protein Mff <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, and although the role of the Drp1-Fis1p interaction in organelle fission remains unclear, binding to Mff allows Drp1 to associate with organellar membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Significantly, Mff binding does not enhance the GTPase activity of Drp1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, the available data on DLP interacting proteins suggest that DLP-mediated organelle fission is coordinated   by a range of binding partners that provide different functions at different stages of the fission process, including recruitment factors that govern localization, adaptor proteins that control oligomerization, and based on our data, modulators that stimulate activity during membrane separation.</s><s>The recent observation that a 30% increase in the activity of a DLP, as measured with in vitro approaches, can cause a significant increase in membrane remodeling capabilities of the protein in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> supports our observation that a twofold increase in the activity of Dnm1p in vitro translates into efficient peroxisome fission in vivo.</s><s>Binding of Pex11p to a DLP occurs at its site of action, the peroxisomal membrane, guaranteeing that the resulting increase in GTPase activity occurs at the right time and right place for efficient membrane fission.</s><s>Leading on from this, recent data indicate that the activity of Drp1 is enhanced by cardiolipin <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>This lipid, which plays a role in mitochondrial fission <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>, is also a potent stimulator of membrane tubulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>Cardiolipin is present in the peroxisomal membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, whereas the amphipathic helix of Pex11p can only tubulate liposomes that contain cardiolipin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, these observations support the suggestion that DLP activity and, consequently, the final act of organelle fission can be fine-tuned by factors on the organelle membrane.</s><s>Identifying other factors that could control DLP activity in similar ways will provide invaluable insight into how membrane scission is achieved.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T L T K L I N F L E T N N G R D K L V A t w T S E G I R Q P N M L K H F D Y W C V A t w T S E G I R Q P N M L K H F D Y W C Y V T

redistribution of peroxisomal membrane proteins during fission, supporting the idea that the function of Pex11p goes much further than membrane remodeling.</s><s>We propose that Pex11p is in fact a master regulator of peroxisomal fission, providing vital contributions to a range of events that occur during fission.</s></p></div>
