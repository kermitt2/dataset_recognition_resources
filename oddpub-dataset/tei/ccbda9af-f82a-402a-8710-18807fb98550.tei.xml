<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dual Task Decrement</head><p><s>As hypothesized, we found an overall better performance (accuracies) in the single task condition, where no tapping was required as opposed to the dual task condition, where a complex tapping task had to be executed while performing lexical decisions.</s><s>This decrease of performance is a robust effect, referred to as "dual task decrement" (see <ref type="bibr">Medland et al., 2002, for review)</ref>.</s><s>It is assumed to result from increased information processing demands in the dual task condition and leads to longer processing  times and/or increased error rates.</s><s>For latencies, we found a dual task decrement only in Group L who performed lexical decisions with their dominant right hand and the complex tapping task with their left hand.</s><s>Thus, the dual task decrement for latencies in Group L may reflect higher task demands in performing the complex tapping task with the non-dominant hand, resulting in slowing of motor hand responses in the dual task condition.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Right Visual Field Advantage (RVFA)</head><p><s>The significant three-way interaction of the factors Group × Lexicality × Visual Field in latencies and accuracies demonstrated that a RVFA for words occurred only in Group R. The RVFA, a better performance for words presented in the RVF in contrast to the LVF, has been demonstrated by many studies before and indicates left-hemispheric superiority for processing words <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hernandez et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Mohr et al., 1994)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, the RVFA was found only for group R, although all participants were right handed.</s><s>As the RVFA not only occurred in the dual task condition, but also in the single task condition, it cannot be attributed to the influence of tapping.</s><s>Instead, lexical decisions seem to have been strongly influenced by (left) hand motor responses: This is confirmed by the fact that performance for words presented in the LVF (directly projecting to the non-dominant RH) was worse when participants responded with their left hand than with their right hand.</s><s>This finding suggests that when lexical information and motor responses are primarily processed by the same hemisphere, language performance decreases.</s><s>This finding suggests that an inhibitory interference effect might have occurred between learnt word representations and the motor system, which possibly share overlapping neuronal networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hauk and Pulvermüller, 2011)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wendt et al. (2007)</ref> found worse performance for right hand response to RVF presentation and for left hand response to LVF presentation in right-handers.</s><s>This interference effect was explained by ongoing inhibitory processes when the same hemisphere is primarily in charge of processing stimuli and controlling the response hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wendt et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Iacoboni and Zaidel (1996)</ref> found a facilitation effect, a better performance for hand responses ipsilateral to the visual field presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Iacoboni and Zaidel, 1996)</ref>.</s><s>Our results for Group R are consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wendt et al. (2007)</ref>, showing decreased performance, for (left) hand word responses in the LVF.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word Category Differences</head><p><s>Better performance (accuracies) for hand-related as opposed to foot-related action words for Group R, but not for Group L, was found.</s><s>This effect occurred during single and dual task conditions.</s><s>As tapping is performed throughout the entire dual task condition, continuous activation of the contralateral motor cortex during dual task conditions can be assumed.</s><s>In contrast, the hand movement for the response only occurred during the execution of lexical decision responses, resulting in an activation of the contralateral hemisphere during the response only.</s><s>We expected to find a specific effect of tapping on action verb processing, however, we could not confirm our hypothesis.</s><s>Interestingly, this finding is in line with the results of the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Strozyk et al. (2017)</ref> who did not report a body part specific effect of a simultaneous hand-or foot-tapping task.</s><s>In our study, the movement of the responding hand led to a specific effect at least in one group, thus, we assume that the continuous activation of the motor cortex may have diminished interaction effects while recurring activation, due to responses, influenced action verb processing.</s><s>In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boulenger et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fargier et al., 2012a)</ref>, we here found a specific effect for hand-related action word processing in an experiment with simultaneous manual movements.</s><s>This effect occurred in Group R who performed responses with the left hand, most likely resulting in activation of the right motor cortex.</s><s>Hence, in Group R, action verb processing involved the language-dominant left hemisphere, while the lexical decision motor response was controlled by the contralateral RH.</s><s>Thus, the lack of concurrence of the language and motor tasks within the same hemisphere might have led to better performance in Group R only.</s><s>In contrast, in Group L, interference effects between the lexical and motor task within the same hemisphere might have taken place.</s></p><p><s>Several studies indicate a somatotopic activation of the motor cortex in action word processing <ref type="bibr">(Hauk et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Grisoni et al., 2016)</ref>, thus, it could be assumed that our results reflect overlapping and body-part specific neuronal resources in processing action verbs and hand movements.</s><s>In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shebani and Pulvermüller (2013)</ref>, who found an inhibitory effect of hand-, or foot-tapping on recalling hand-related or foot-related action verbs, we here find a facilitating effect for hand-related words.</s><s>As this effect occurred during single and dual task conditions, it might be attributed to the response hand, but less likely to the tapping movement of the contralateral hand.</s></p><p><s>We did not find any differences between uni-manual and bi-manual hand-related action verbs, as expected, based on previous MRI data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hauk and Pulvermüller, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>While differential processing for uni-manual hand-related action verbs (left lateralized motor cortex activation) in contrast to bi-manual hand-related action verbs (bilateral motor cortex activation) were reported in this previous study, our behavioral results do not confirm this finding.</s><s>The following points may need to be taken into consideration: First, data concerning handrelated action verb processing in fMRI studies are not consistent (see section Introduction).</s><s>Second, a lack of word category differences might be attributed to stimulus properties.</s><s>The pilot study showed that participants rated a high percentage of handrelated action verbs to be associated with actions they usually perform with both hands simultaneously; and only few words were associated with actions usually performed with just one hand (variable/question 6).</s><s>Following the stimulus rating study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hauk and Pulvermüller (2011)</ref>, variable 6 was implemented, to distinguish between uni-manual and bi-manual hand-related words.</s><s>Nevertheless, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hauk and Pulvermüller (2011)</ref> created two distinct categories with this question, we were not able to create a category of uni-manual action words based on this variable only (see section Stimulus Rating Study).</s><s>As this question refers to the described action rather than to semantic criteria, different languages (English vs. German) can hardly explain these different results in the rating studies.</s><s>The difficulty in creating a strong category of purely uni-manual hand-related action words as well as the procedure for categorization in our pilot study might explain the non-significant findings with regards to processing of the subcategories of hand-related action verbs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The overall accuracy of all participants was 0.73 (SD = 0.14) and thus is comparable to other studies with a lexical decision design <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Mohr et al., 1996)</ref>.</s><s>However, our sample size might not have been large enough to reveal significant statistical differences in sub-analyses focusing on different action word categories in single-and dual-task conditions.</s><s>Therefore, further studies with larger numbers of participants are desirable to replicate these findings.</s><s>Less complex designs, focusing on only one relevant experimental factor (e.g., visual field) might be preferable to increase the statistical power for sub-analyses on word-category differences.</s></p><p><s>Another potential problem in the present experimental setup could be related to the nature of the motor task in the dual task condition, compared to those employed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Nazir et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fargier et al., 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Postle et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Shebani and Pulvermüller, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Strozyk et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>While in some experiments, the motor task was performed earlier than the language task <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Shebani and Pulvermüller, 2013)</ref>, tapping and lexical decisions were performed simultaneously in the dual task condition of the present study.</s><s>Furthermore, the tapping task itself was challenging.</s><s>While other studies employed a simple one-finger tapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Postle et al., 2013)</ref> or a simple four step sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Strozyk et al., 2017)</ref>, our participants performed a complex one-hand tapping task.</s><s>As very complex dual task paradigms can diminish experimental effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Medland et al., 2002)</ref>, the lack of word category effects in our study could be attributed to this factor.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK</head><p><s>Our results show that the response hand, but not tapping, has a facilitating influence on hemispheric processing of action words, more specifically on hand-related, but not foot-related action verbs.</s><s>Thus, when action word responses involve activation of hand areas within the motor cortex, language performance might be better.</s><s>This may be attributed to facilitating effects within neuronal language-motor networks.</s><s>Furthermore, our results indicate that when action words and motor responses are primarily processed by the same hemisphere (RH), language performance seems to decrease, which might be related to intra-hemispheric interference effects.</s><s>Further research is necessary to address the interaction between language and action-motor processing.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Familiarity</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>SD = 1.21 SD = 1.00 SD = 0.92 task.</s><s>In the dual task condition, they performed lexical decisions while simultaneously engaging in tapping.</s><s>Group R performed the tapping task with the right hand and executed lexical decisions with their left hand.</s><s>Group L performed the tapping task with the left hand and responded with their right hand.</s><s>Before the start of the main experiment, participants practiced the tapping sequence as well as the lexical decision task with a different set of word stimuli.</s><s>During the experiment, each stimulus was repeated four times and was presented in the LVF in the single task condition (a), in the LVF in the dual task condition (b), as well as in the RVF in the single task condition (c) and in the RVF in the dual task condition (d), respectively (see Figures 1A,B for details).</s><s>The experiment started either with a single task sequence or a dual task sequence.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
