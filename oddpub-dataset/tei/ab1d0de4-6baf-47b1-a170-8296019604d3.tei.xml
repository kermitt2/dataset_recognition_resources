<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>It is widely recognized that progress in the biomedical sciences is hampered by the difficulty of integrating multiple disparate data types to obtain a coherent understanding of physiological and disease states <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>A genome-scale network reconstruction represents a curated knowledge-base containing many different data types and sources, including highquality genome annotation, assessment of biochemical properties of gene products, and a wide array of physiological functional information.</s><s>Computational genome-scale models integrate large-scale omics data from these knowledge-bases to aid in the interpretation and prediction of biological functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>In recent years, human metabolic network reconstructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> have generated insights into inborn errors of metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and human microbiome co-metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Using metabolic reconstructions, information about chemical reactions is stored and continually updated in a standardized biochemical and genetic representation through a wellestablished process <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Over the past ten years, updating the human metabolic network reconstruction has focused on expansion of metabolic reaction coverage.</s><s>From the first human reconstruction, Recon1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , to the most recent version, Recon2 3 , the content has been expanded from 1,496 genes (corresponding to 3,311 reactions) to 1,675 genes (7,785  reactions).</s><s>Various other reconstructions have been released and community driven-efforts have been made to ensure interoperability of these resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Our knowledge about human metabolism is continuously increasing and the deluge of 'omics' data provides ample opportunity for updating current knowledge-bases of human metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> .</s><s>In addition to updating metabolic coverage, expanding human reconstructions to include different types, such as metabolite and protein structures as well as atom-transitions, thereby enables a broader scope of biomedical questions to be addressed.</s></p><p><s>Historically, systems biology has focused on characterizing catalytic or regulatory roles of proteins in metabolism without placing emphasis on the three-dimensional structure of the proteins themselves.</s><s>For example, studies on genetic variation have mainly focused on frequency of occurrence <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> or sequence-based attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Only recently have mutations been explored in the context of their three-dimensional location or spatial relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> .</s><s>Exploring mutations in 3D extends beyond nucleotide sequence identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , as mutations that may be far away from each other in linear sequence may actually be proximal in the folded state.</s><s>In recent years, increasingly accessible protein and metabolite data have enabled the progression of systems biology to a 3D perspective.</s><s>In one study, protein structures were mapped to the metabolic network of Escherichia coli, to reveal the role of ribosome pausing in co-translational protein folding <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>In another study, human population variation was studied by integrating protein structures with the human erythrocyte metabolic network to understand the adverse effects of drugs on genetic variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and identify new pathways related to drug perturbation.</s><s>These studies highlight the value of integrating different types of data to address complex biological questions.</s></p><p><s>We present Recon3D, an updated and expanded human metabolic network reconstruction that integrates pharmacogenomic associations, large-scale phenotypic data, and structural information for both proteins and metabolites.</s><s>Recon3D contains over 6,000 more reactions than Recon2, all of which were manually curated to remove redundant or blocked reactions.</s><s>We use Recon3D to prioritize putative disease-causing genetic variants by mapping single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to protein structures.</s><s>We show that deleterious mutations are more likely to cluster together into functional hotspots than non-deleterious mutations.</s><s>In contrast to previous models, these mutation hotspots identify ACAT1 as a cancer-related gene.</s><s>Furthermore, we demonstrate how structural information can be used to investigate the potential mechanisms by which drugs exert an effect on metabolism.</s><s>The Recon3D Resource (http://vmh.life)</s><s>provides new avenues for investigating the molecular basis of disease and may aid the development of treatment strategies, biomarkers, and drug repurposing.</s></p></div>
