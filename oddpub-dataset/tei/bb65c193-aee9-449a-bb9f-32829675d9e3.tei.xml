likely to reflect in addition to altered expression in individual cells the changed cellular composition that is influenced by cell death, acute inflammation and subsequent endogenous repair following spinal cord injury.</s><s>In general, by 4 weeks post-injury the expression of Nrg1 signalling components is replenished or enhanced, and this coincides with progressive remyelination of demyelinated axons by Schwann cells in the injured spinal cord.</s><s>Our in situ hybridization expression data indicated that the main source of Nrg1 influencing Schwann cell remyelination after spinal cord

all active Nrg1 isoforms, while the lack of only IgNrg1 isoforms did not interfere with Schwann cell-mediated remyelination, emphasizing the role of type III Nrg1 in this repair process.</s><s>The fact that IgNrg1 is dispensable for Schwann cell remyelination in the spinal cord is consistent with the previous finding that infusion of glial growth factor (Ig containing type II Nrg1 isoform) did

cell remyelination within the dorsal column for optimal recovery.</s><s>This was apparent both on the BMS subscale and the inclined beam walking task, which requires co-ordination, balance and proprioceptionfunctions that relate to the dorsal column pathway, through which myelinated proprioceptive sensory afferents transit.</s><s>To directly localize this deficit to the dorsal column we undertook electrophysiological assessment by antidromic stimulation of sural afferents (which are principally sensory) within the dorsal column rostral and caudal to the injury site.</s><s>While afferents projecting through the injury site could be detected in control animals (the evoked compound sensory action potential recorded in the sural nerve following rostral stimulation was 25% of that following caudal stimulation) there was a profound deficit in conduction in the conNrg1 mice (which in most cases showed no conduction through the injury site).</s><s>In contrast, the conIgNrg1 mice demonstrated impulse conduction which was no different to controls, consistent with the fact that Schwann cell remyelination was unchanged in these animals.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our data demonstrate that Nrg1 is absolutely essential for Schwann cell-mediated spinal axon remyelination following spinal cord injury.</s><s>We provide evidence that these central Schwann cells derive from the injured spinal cord and are required for action potential conduction in axons passing through the injury site.</s><s>IgNrg1 isoforms are dispensable for this process; however, compromised IgNrg1 signalling also significantly impairs spontaneous locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury, likely a consequence of its role in muscle spindle maintenance.</s><s>However, mice in which all Nrg1 isoforms are inactivated show greater functional deficits than IgNrg1 specific mutants, emphasizing the importance of Schwann cell remyelination of dorsal column axons for optimal functional recovery following spinal cord injury.</s><s>Our data provide novel evidence for the molecular mechanisms that govern a spontaneous endogenous regenerative event after traumatic spinal cord injury, which may
