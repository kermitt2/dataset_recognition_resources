both individual and global levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Although scientific evidence has routinely shown that exposure to tobacco smoke causes death, disease and disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the tobacco epidemic continues to persist at a global scale with a growing emphasis on low and middle income countries.</s><s>In 2015, it was estimated there were 1 billion smokers globally, with 80% of those living in low and middle income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Tobacco is contributing to approximately 6 million deaths each year, with 5 million of those deaths directly attributable to tobacco use <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In 2004, tobacco was responsible for 4%, 11% and 18% of total deaths in low, middle and high income countries, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>A higher tobacco-related mortality can been seen in men than women, and the American and European regions claim the highest proportion of deaths attributable to tobacco <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, tobacco consumption in low and middle income countries is prevalent and such countries 2 of 14 continue to confront growing burdens of such modern health risks.</s><s>A systematic review of smoking prevalence in African adults revealed estimated male smoking prevalence in rural areas up to 22.8% in Rwanda and 40.4% in Zambia <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Without implementation and enforcement of proper tobacco control policies, global smoking prevalence could be as high as <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref>.0% in 2030, with the African region increasing from 15.8% in 2010 to 21.9% in 2030 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts the annual death toll caused by tobacco to rise to 8 million by the year 2030 without policy implementation, with over 80% of those deaths in low and middle income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In order to standardize global tobacco control policy, the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) treaty was negotiated and brought into fruition.</s><s>This FCTC treaty was supported by evidence-based tobacco control research conducted in high income countries and other controlled environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Consisting of 168 signatories, the treaty was unanimously adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2003 and took effect in February 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Created as a response to the expanding globalization of the tobacco epidemic, the treaty encompasses regulatory strategies with legally binding obligations for its parties, which were designed to aid in the protection of public health against the dangers of tobacco usage and against commercial interests of the tobacco industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Such protection is important in industrialized countries and low and middle income countries as well where tobacco companies continue to exploit markets, deliberately targeting non-smokers, young people and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>This FCTC treaty includes not only tobacco control measures, but also addresses product supply, and demand and harm reduction provisions, providing context for comprehensive policy interventions at all levels of governance.</s></p><p><s>To assist country level implementation and management of tobacco control articles recommended in the treaty, the MPOWER package was introduced in 2008 consisting of six policy intervention strategies: monitor tobacco use and prevention policies, protect people from tobacco smoke, offer help to quit tobacco use, warn about the dangers of tobacco, enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and raise taxes on tobacco <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Each intervention reflects one or more provisions described in the treaty.</s><s>Additionally, the treaty encourages countries to develop surveillance programmes to monitor and collect data regarding magnitude, patterns, determinants and consequences of tobacco exposure and consumption, facilitating data comparison at both regional and international levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although there is evidence pointing to the effectiveness of tobacco control policies in reducing smoking prevalence in many high and some middle income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, there is limited data on the effectiveness of such policies in low and middle income countries.</s><s>Furthermore, FCTC research gaps have identified a need to decipher which policies may be effectively transferred and implemented from High Income Countries (HICs) to Low Middle Income Countries (LMICs), and have also suggested a necessity for the acquisition of both country-specific data and to identify further research needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For the primary aim of this study, we analysed levels and trends of tobacco control policy indicator variables between 2007 and 2014 by country income category and region, according to MPOWER data and with a focus on low and middle income countries.</s><s>For the secondary study aim, we examined the association between tobacco control policy and the change in current tobacco smoking by an ecological study.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Overall, the number of legislated WHO policy recommendations for tobacco control increased globally from 2007 to 2014 with

LMICs and UMICs in 2007.</s><s>In 2014, HICs had the highest number of legislated policies of 70%.</s><s>The African region improved policy, but remains far behind all other regions.</s><s>Regression modelling showed a negative association between WHO recommended policy legislations and increase in smoking prevalence, which was stronger in males than females and only significant in males.</s></p><p><s>Although some country specific smoking prevalence reductions have occurred during the past decade, improvements are nonhomogeneous and around 50 million people, mostly males in LDCs and LMICs, have lost their lives due to tobacco usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</s><s>This visible discrepancy between treaty introduction and remaining high tobacco associated mortality most likely cannot be explained simply, but rather by a multitude of intertwined factors.</s><s>However, it is of utmost importance to consider that MPOWER indicator data represent policy legislation and do not necessarily reflect policy implementation.</s><s>The true degree of implementation and policy enforcement could vary heavily and be dependent upon per capita GNI, as tobacco control policies stagnate at low levels of implementation in most LMICs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Some countries may have a limited capacity for enforcement, also suffering from the tobacco industry's heavy influence on local government officials, brand-stretching and the presence of cross-border marketing activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref>.</s><s>A 2013 review pertaining to tobacco control in LMICs discussed the necessity of national level political economy analyses to explore which barriers may be present in tobacco control and the importance of developing a plan against them <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>While there may be a strong relation between the number of legislated policies and enforced policies, it remains clear that, in practice, enforcement is never perfect.</s><s>In other words, our study overestimates the strength of tobacco control policy by exploring national lawmaking only.</s></p><p><s>Our study supports results reported by other research groups in the area of MPOWER policy relating to smoking prevalence.</s><s>Recent research by <ref type="bibr">Dubray et al. analysed</ref> the relationship between the change in current smoking between 2006 and 2009 with a 2008 MPOWER score <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Although most estimates were from HIC and UMIC, it was reported that overall countries with higher policy scores tended to have greater decreases in current tobacco smoking between 2006 and 2009.</s></p><p><s>Another study by Heydari et al. looked at 2008 MPOWER data to provide an overview of policy in the Eastern Mediterranean region, concluding that three of 21 countries scored higher than 50%, while over half of the countries scored &lt;26% <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Our data and other evidence by Heydari et al. suggest that although some progressive policy strengthening has happened in the Eastern Mediterranean, country improvements are not homogeneous and even some policy waning has occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Recent estimations by Bilano et al. predicted rapid increases in smoking prevalence by 2025 for males in Africa and both genders in the Eastern Mediterranean <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Corresponding strengthening of policies could help prevent smoking, hence mitigating the burden of smoking related diseases in such LMICs in early stages of the tobacco epidemic.</s><s>Bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) have been realized to be important in developed countries, but evidence has been accumulating to show the importance of comprehensive TAPS policies in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Blecher et al. concluded that comprehensive advertising bans in developing countries are more effective in reducing tobacco consumption than partial bans.</s><s>Such bans may have a larger impact on tobacco consumption in developing countries relative to the developed world as the number of tobacco advertisements was determined to be 81 times higher in selected low income countries compared relative to HIC <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</s><s>A previous study relating cigarette affordability and consumption showed decreased cigarette consumption in HIC relative to lower income countries that could not be fully explained by changes in affordability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Strong FCTC policy interventions in HICs were postulated to be responsible for decreases in consumption, whereas the social acceptability of smoking and weaker policy interventions could explain the higher tobacco consumption in LMICs.</s><s>Tobacco price does not equate to affordability.</s><s>Although tobacco price is typically higher in HICs than in UMICs, LMICs and LDCs, cigarettes are more affordable in HICs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>However, evidence is inconclusive regarding whether demand for tobacco products in LDCs is more responsive to price than in HICs <ref type="bibr"

smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>.</s><s>As tax and price policies constitute highly effective means in influencing tobacco demand and consumption, implementing such strategies as outlined in Article 6 of the FCTC remains of imperative importance in battling the tobacco epidemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite FCTC legislation, global presence of tobacco industries undermines the effectiveness of tobacco control policy.</s><s>Tobacco companies have been known to employ strategies to evade marketing restrictions by influencing government officials to deter policy making, leading to the maximization of marketing opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Partial advertising bans can be effectively circumvented by the industry targeting non-banned and non-implemented advertising avenues; whereas cross-border advertising can be targeted in countries where full bans have been implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Due to decreasing tobacco consumption in HICs, industries may target markets in LDCs and LMICs in the Asian-Pacific, African and Middle Eastern regions where

that rates of female smoking were higher than males in countries with higher female empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Estimations have suggested higher levels of male smoking (in some LDCs and LMICs) can help mitigate restrictions on female smoking, hence encouraging the habit in females <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.</s><s>The marketing of tobacco company products in LMICs combined with bolder industrial attempts to influence political activity and misrepresent the economic importance of tobacco <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, may increase overall smoking prevalence.</s><s>Together, these research findings indicate an implicit need for heightened tobacco control strategies focussed not only on male, but also on female prevention.</s></p><p><s>As an ecologic study this analysis has several limitations.</s><s>Policy data from WHO reports and estimates on smoking prevalence were unavailable for some countries.</s><s>Additionally, MPOWER policy data reflect the presence of policy legislation and not implementation.</s><s>Furthermore, the indicator "Existence of Government Objectives on Tobacco Control" was exclusively available as a "yes/no" indicator and therefore lacks sensitivity.</s><s>The definition of some policy indicators e.g., "Availability of Cessation support" slightly changed by report year which may have led to some bias within policy estimates over time.</s><s>Nevertheless, we are aware of those limitations and addressed them if possible.</s><s>Our main intention was to incorporate as many of the globally available data as possible.</s><s>Finally, income category and region are highly correlated, i.e., many African countries were contemporaneously categorized as LDCs, many European countries were HICs and vice versa.</s><s>Therefore, it is not possible to estimate independent effects of income category and region.</s></p></div>
