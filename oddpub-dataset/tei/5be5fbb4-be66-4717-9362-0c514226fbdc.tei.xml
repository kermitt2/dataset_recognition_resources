<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 7 (rhBMP7) is applied for treatment of bone fractures, especially tibial non-unions.</s><s>Its application may induce autoantibodies (aAB) affecting the targeted and endogenous signaling pathways and in turn negatively impact treatment efficacy.</s><s>Methods: Novel and sensitive assays for the quantification of BMP7-aAB and BMP2-aAB were established and used to analyze serum samples from healthy controls (n = 100 men, n = 100 women) and patients with long bone fracture (n = 265) treated or not with rhBMP7.</s><s>Sera from three to nine time points per patient were available and enabled the evaluation of aAB over a time course of up to one year.</s><s>Functional activity of the BMP-aAB was tested with a BMP-responsive cell-based reporter assay.</s><s>Consolidation of the fracture was evaluated as clinical outcome potentially affected by BMP7-aAB.</s><s>Results: Prevalence of BMP7-aAB and BMP2-aAB was 1-2.5% in non-treated patients or healthy controls.</s><s>The rhBMP7 treatment induced a transient increase in BMP7-aAB in a subset of patients, returning to nondetectable levels within six months.</s><s>IgG from BMP7-aAB positive sera inhibited dose dependently the BMP7reporter gene activity, whereas control sera were without effect.</s><s>Successful consolidation of the fracture was observed in the majority of both aAB-positive and aAB-negative patients.</s><s>General significance: We conclude that BMP7-aAB can be detected as natural aAB in healthy subjects, and are transiently induced by rhBMP7 therapy in a subset of patients.</s><s>The aAB are capable of antagonizing BMP7 signaling in vitro, but do not preclude treatment success in patients.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Bone is a tissue with a remarkable regenerative potential controlled in part by bone itself and by the interplay with the immune and vascular systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>After fracture, bone often regenerates completely to its original composition without the formation of a scar.</s><s>It can therefore be considered as a truly regenerative tissue.</s><s>Usually, a fracture gap is closed within 3-6 months after trauma.</s><s>However, some fractures (approx.</s><s>10%) show healing difficulties leading to delayed healing, or non-unions also known as pseudarthrosis.</s><s>There are a number of parameters affecting the healing process including the severity of the initial insult as well as age and health of the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A compromised healing situation requires an intervention to reactivate and enhance natural bone formation.</s><s>The major aspects that need to be considered are osteogenic cells, osteoconductive scaffolds, osteoinductive stimulants (hormones and local growth factors) and the mechanical environment, summarized as the diamond concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> which was extended by the aspect of vascularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Interventions according to the diamond concept involve an assessment of all of these aspects for a given patient and the attempt to optimize the therapeutic measures resulting in an individualized therapy plan.</s><s>Treatment of non-unions following this concept proved to be a reasonable and successful strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>In early stage the therapeutic treatments in delayed union may include biophysical stimulation, e.g.</s><s>full weight bearing, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound, shockwave or electromagnetic field stimulation.</s><s>Biological enhancement of bone regeneration is the base in treatment of non-unions.</s><s>Autologous cancellous bone graft is considered the gold standard in the surgical treatment of non-unions, but the limited availability is problematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Amongst the locally applied biological enhancers are calcium phosphate or collagen sponges as osteoconductive material, growth factors like erythropoietin, fibroblast growth factors or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) as osteoinductive agents and synthetic polymers or autologous bone as osteogenic material <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>BMPs belong to the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily and are pleiotropic paracrine growth factors that are involved in the regulation of diverse biological processes such as proliferation, survival, apoptosis, differentiation and migration of cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>The different members of the TFGβ-superfamily perform specific tasks during development and homeostasis in various tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The groundwork of BMP research in bone was laid in the late 1960s by Marshal Urist when he showed that implanted demineralized bone induced ectopic bone formation in skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Later, the nature of these bone forming factors were identified and termed BMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The corresponding DNA was cloned and recombinant protein was expressed shortly after <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>These achievements paved the way for applying recombinant human BMP (rhBMP) to improve bone regeneration and fracture healing.</s><s>To this end, especially rhBMP2 and rhBMP7 have been tested and further developed to therapeutic biologicals as osteoinductive growth factors and work most efficient in combination with autologous bone material <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>BMP2 and BMP7 induce osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation thereby increasing intramembranous and endochondral ossification.</s><s>Both BMPs have been approved for use in humans by the FDA in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and have shown remarkable therapeutic effects in the last decade.</s><s>However, concerns regarding their safety and side-effects were raised, especially with respect to ectopic bone formation, osteolysis, induction of autoimmunity, cancer, or problems related to cost effectiveness, collectively limiting their use in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The potential induction of autoantibodies (aAB) against rhBMP (BMP-aAB) may be of clinical relevance for three major reasons.</s><s>First, BMP-aAB might interfere with the biological activity of the therapeutic rhBMP by neutralizing it.</s><s>Second, rhBMP-aAB complexes may cause unwanted immune reactions.</s><s>And third, treatment-induced BMP-aAB might cross-react with endogenous BMP thereby interfering with the regular signaling pathways.</s></p><p><s>In order to test for natural occurring and treatment-induced BMP-aAB, we developed two novel luminometric assays.</s><s>We determined the prevalence of BMP7-aAB and BMP2-aAB in healthy subjects and in patients with severe fractures treated or not with rhBMP7, and at time points before and after surgery.</s><s>Our data indicate that rhBMP7 treatment transiently induces BMP7-aAB in a subset of patients, and that these aAB are antagonists for BMP7 signaling in vitro.</s><s>However, fracture consolidation was successfully achieved in both BMP7-aAB-positive and BMP7-aAB-negative patients, indicating that these aAB do not preclude treatment success.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, two novel assays for the detection and quantification of aAB against BMP7 and BMP2 are described.</s><s>The assays are reproducible, the signals are linear upon dilution of control antibodies, and the assays have been validated by specific antibodies against BMP7 and BMP2, respectively.</s><s>Using a robust and prudent criterion for positivity, we have detected BMP7-and BMP2-aAB both in healthy controls and in fracture patients.</s><s>The general recommendations on how to develop aAB assays and test the functionality of aABs have been taken into account during the course of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The difference in prevalence of BMP7-aAB observed between patients treated or not with rhBMP7 further supports the notion that this novel assay is capable of measuring both naturally occurring and rhBMP7induced aAB against BMP7.</s><s>Final proof of the reliability of the novel assay is given by the functional characterization of IgG preparations from human serum samples, indicating that only BMP7-aAB positive preparations were capable of antagonizing BMP7-signaling, but not BMP7-aAB negative preparations.</s><s>Moreover, most of the IgG preparations Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. BMP7-aAB trend over time.</s><s>The patients that were tested positive for BMP7-aAB showed a transient occurrence of aAB.</s><s>In most cases BMP7-aAB positivity returned to undetectable levels within two months.</s><s>In one patient (Patient # 6) a decline was not observed in the samples available for analysis (green).</s><s>The negative control sera from the same study showed a steady signal at background level (black).</s><s>BMP7-aAB positive sera (Patients 1-7); BMP7-aAB negative sera (Patients 8-13).</s><s>(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. BMP7-aAB concentrations and fracture healing outcome.</s><s>Fracture patients were divided into those that had a positive healing outcome (consolidation) and those in whom the treatment failed (no consolidation).</s><s>At surgery both groups showed a prevalence of BMP7-aAB positive samples of 3%.</s><s>The prevalence of BMP7-aAB positive subjects was higher 4 weeks after surgery, especially in the group where no consolidation was diagnosed.</s><s>However, highest BMP7-aAB titers were detected in samples from successfully treated patients who developed fracture gap closure and complete consolidation.</s><s>from BMP7-aAB positive samples (two of three) were not capable of suppressing BMP2-stimulated reporter gene activity, verifying the specificity of these aAB.</s><s>These results highlight the quality of the novel BMP7-aAB assay, and indicate that the BMP7-aAB detected by the novel assay are capable of reacting with recombinant human BMP7 and interfering with BMP7 signaling.</s></p><p><s>The prevalence of 2.5% for BMP7-aAB in healthy adults is in line with a previous study that described a prevalence of 1.6% and 3% of naturally occurring aAB against BMP7 in subjects younger or older than 65 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Collectively, these data indicate that a small fraction of healthy adults are already positive for BMP7-aAB despite not having been exposed to rhBMP7 before in their life.</s><s>In contrast to our analysis, the former study reported a prevalence of up to 50% in BMP7-treated patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>This value is much higher than observed in our study, where up to 18% of patients proved positive for BMP7-aAB after rhBMP7 exposure.</s><s>The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, but might lie in the different treatment regimen applied, the different assays used or the criteria applied for defining positivity.</s></p><p><s>Both studies highlight that natural BMP7-aAB exist and that BMP7-aAB can be induced by rhBMP7 treatment.</s><s>This autoimmune response to the applied rhBMP7 does not develop in all of the treated patients, but in a subset.</s><s>The parameters predisposing some patients to BMP7-aAB are probably similar to those determining the risk of autoimmunity in the general population, including genetic predisposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, smoking status <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and other environmental factors.</s><s>Specifically, B-cells are primed to be activated upon a sudden increase in antigen along with inflammatory signals (cytokines) whereas constant antigen signals in absence of inflammation may rather be tolerated <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>The application of rhBMP7 in fracture patients provides an unprecedented antigen surge into an inflamed environment.</s><s>Patients that contain autoreactive B-cells which are in immunological tolerant form may become activated especially in the context of an ongoing inflammation.</s><s>These aspects as well as the genetic predisposition to develop autoimmunity vary between individuals and may account for the heterogeneous picture observed.</s><s>Further studies along this line are needed.</s></p><p><s>Comparing the aAB against BMP2, the former study reported a prevalence of 2.3% in subjects below 65 years of age, and 5.3% in subjects who are older <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Again, these data are well in agreement with our results in patients and controls.</s><s>Notably, the prevalence of BMP2-aAB positive patients was higher in samples collected after rhBMP7 treatment, however the titers of these aAB were relatively low and close to the cut-off level.</s><s>These data imply a high specificity of therapy-induced aAB to the actual biological agent used with little cross-reactivity to a related growth factor.</s></p><p><s>When reconsidering the three main concerns regarding anti-drug antibodies of biologicals, i.e., (1) neutralization of the drug, (2) immune reaction by the drug-aAB complexes, and (3) cross-reactivity of the aAB to the endogenous protein, the first issue seems to apply to therapyinduced BMP7-aAB as they neutralized the activity of the recombinant protein in vitro and prevented it from activating its signaling cascade.</s><s>However, whether the neutralizing effect has any strong and relevant clinical consequences could not fully be evaluated in this study, due to the heterogeneity and limited number of aAB-positive subjects.</s><s>Analyzing consolidation as the most relevant end-point of the treatments, our data indicate that indeed there was a higher number of BMP7-aAB positive patients who failed to reach successful fracture gap closure, however the subjects with the highest BMP7-aAB titers were found in the group of successfully treated patients.</s><s>These results are puzzling and do not allow a clear-cut statement on the clinical importance of the natural or therapy-induced BMP7-aAB, yet.</s><s>Cross-reactivity of the BMP7-aAB to the endogenous protein is likely to occur because the drug is a recombinant human protein variant with highest similarity to the endogenous form.</s><s>However, the short transient nature of the induced BMP7-aAB peaks argues against adverse long term consequences, except for situations in which the antigen is again provided, e.g.</s><s>upon repeated therapy with the biological in case that fracture healing failed.</s></p><p><s>Antibody formation against biologicals has long been known, e.g. during the course of interferon-β (IFN-β) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, erythropoietin (EPO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> or thrombopoietin (THPO) treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>In all of these applications, it was shown that aAB are capable of interfering with the efficacy of the drug.</s><s>EPO antibodies were associated with the severe consequence of pure red cell aplasia <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Antibody development against THPO was associated with thrombocytopenia due to crossreaction with the endogenous THPO.</s><s>The incidence of thrombocytopenia was higher in healthy volunteers than in immune compromised cancer patients, and similar to our study, also the antibodies against THPO disappeared over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Anti-IFN-β antibodies are extensively studied to better characterize their occurrence and effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>However, the mechanisms underlying the patient-specific responses to the biologicals are still far from being understood.</s><s>All of the treatments mentioned above are given systemically and over a longer period of time, in contrast to the rhBMP7, which is applied locally into the fracture gap usually only once.</s><s>Here, a relatively high amount of rhBMP7 is suddenly present initiating a fast biological response but its stability and the actual amount that is actively involved in bone regeneration is difficult to estimate.</s><s>Similarly, the aAB induced by the treatment are not characterized by a stable titer and are equally difficult to be assessed for their potentially interfering capacity and clinical importance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>Treatment with rhBMP7 triggers bone formation along with a transient autoimmune response in some patients.</s><s>The induced BMP7-aAB are neutralizing in nature, as seen in the in vitro analysis, and may therefore potentially affect the osteogenic differentiation.</s><s>This phenomenon may be of clinical importance as some patients fail to respond to the osteoinductive treatment for as yet unknown reasons.</s><s>However, the correlation of treatment success (consolidation) with the BMP7-aAB positivity and BMP7-aAB concentrations failed to provide a clearcut picture for a negative role in bone regeneration in our study.</s><s>Collectively, the transient nature of these therapy-induced BMP7-aAB, the lack of a general cross-reactivity to BMP2, and the lack of a clear correlation to treatment failure are re-assuring findings with respect to the safety of recombinant BMP in fracture healing.</s><s>It remains to be analyzed in future studies whether therapy-induced BMP7-aAB are a problematic predisposition for a repeated BMP7 treatment in cases of initial treatment failure.</s><s>We hope that our herein described analytical assays, which are straightforward, robust and easy to establish, are of help in further studies addressing this issue.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1.
