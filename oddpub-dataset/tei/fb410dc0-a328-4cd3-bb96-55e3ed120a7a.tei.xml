<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">| Study limitations and strengths</head><p><s>The present study had some limitations.</s></p><p><s>Firstly, the LRx prescription database lacked direct, clinical information such as the diagnostic methodology and the sensitisation status, but as per SmPCs of both tablets, SLIT tablets can be prescribed if grass pollen allergy is "confirmed by a positive cutaneous test and/ or a positive titer of the specific IgE to the grass pollen."</s><s>Furthermore, not reporting sensitization status in the database would not impact the results of the study as both tablets showed a similar treatment effect in mono-and polysensitised patients.</s><s>Some of the patients included in the control non-AIT group may have suffered from AR induced by an allergen other than grass pollen (ie, an allergen whose season overlapped with that of grass pollen).</s><s>However, given the predominance of grass pollen AR, this source of bias would have been minimized.</s><s>Besides, ATC drug class codes were used as proxies for the diagnosis and treatment of AR and asthma.</s><s>This approach can be a concern when drugs in the class have multiple indications (eg, in both COPD and asthma).</s><s>Secondly, the two-grass pollen SLIT tablet formulations analyzed here differ in their allergen composition and recommended regimen.</s></p><p><s>Oralairâ contains pollen extract from five species of grass, whereas Grazaxâ contains timothy pollen extract only.</s><s>A three-season preand co-seasonal regimen is recommended for Oralairâ, whereas 3 years of continuous treatment is recommended for Grazaxâ.</s></p><p><s>Future research in this field could compare the two tablets.</s></p><p><s>Thirdly, the SLIT tablet and non-AIT groups were only matched for the treatment index year and so differed in some important respects (reflecting real life).</s><s>The proportion of children and adolescents was markedly higher in the SLIT tablet group, as observed in an earlier German observational study; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> these observations suggest that physicians in Germany are more likely to prescribe SLIT tablets to younger patients.</s><s>Overall, specialist physicians accounted for a higher proportion of main prescribers in the SLIT tablet group than in the non-AIT group; this is not unexpected, as the prescription of SLIT requires experience in allergology.</s><s>In Germany, allergology is an additional medical qualification (gained typically by dermatologists, ENT specialists, and pulmonologists), rather than being a separate medical speciality per se.</s><s>The higher proportion of paediatricians as main prescribers in the SLIT tablet group reflected the age difference.</s><s>As part of the allergic march, allergic asthma tends to emerge more frequently in childhood and adolescence than in adulthood. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>nce, one would expect to see more asthma onset in a younger population.</s><s>However, patient age was one of the covariates controlled for in our analyses and did not influence asthma onset.</s><s>Furthermore, any bias due to patient age in the present study would tend to reduce the effect of SLIT and not increase it.</s><s>Accordingly, the significant differences in favour of SLIT observed here are likely to be genuine, and the true, underlying effect may be greater still.</s></p><p><s>Lastly, regarding asthma definition, as mentioned in the method section, depot formulations of systemic corticosteroids are used to measure asthma progression.</s><s>A sensitivity analysis excluding those was performed and did not impact the results.</s></p><p><s>The present study also had a number of strengths-the most important of which is its use of real-world data.</s><s>After a medication has been granted marketing authorization, the reimbursement authorities increasingly request evidence of real-world effective- for the AR progression, 42.5% of asthma occurrence, and 16.7% of asthma progression after treatment cessation, we consider the results as of clinical meaningful.</s><s>This result also showed economic impact.</s><s>The present results confirm and reinforce clinical outcomes and provided an assessment of additional benefits for asthma that had previously been investigated in specific populations in controlled environments (RCTs).</s><s>The present findings are also in line with the results of similar observational studies that (with one exception 30 )</s></p><p><s>were based only on a few hundred patients.</s></p></div>
