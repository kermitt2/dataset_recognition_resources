enables efficient identification of a metastatic phenotype in primary tumors and mainly prognosis prediction in ccRCC patients with localized disease.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we evaluated ccRCC tumor tissues by immunofluorescence staining of common EMT markers (CDH1, CK18, CK19, VIM, S100A4) and stratified patients to EMT positive and EMT negative groups.</s><s>Consequently, in the discovery phase of our study, we identified miRNAs and genes associated with EMT positive tumors.</s><s>The most significantly deregulated EMT-associated miRNAs were two well-known miRNA families, previously linked to the EMT process: miR-200 and miR-30 family, specifically miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-429,miR-30a-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30e and miR-30e-3p.</s><s>These miRNAs were also successfully validated in the training and validation phase of the study as deregulated in tumor tissue.</s><s>With the exception of miR-200c and miR-30e-3p, they also correlated with TNM stage, Fuhrman grade and overall survival of ccRCC patients.</s></p><p><s>Accordingly, the miRNA-200 family (miR-200s: miR-200a/b/c, miR-141, and miR-429), which is an important regulator of tumor invasion and metastasis through its targeting of ZEB1 and ZEB2, has been repeatedly found to be significantly downregulated in RCC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>In RCC, it has been previously shown that the miR-200 family plays an important role in EMT also through modulation of focal adhesion pathways and the ErbB signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>In addition, in vitro experiments showed that stable overexpression of miR-429, another member of miR-200 family, in RCC cell lines, strongly inhibited cell

evaluate the potential of miR-429, the least described member of the miR-200 family, to restore CDH1 levels in vitro, and we confirmed the ability of miR-429 to reverse CDH1 suppression induced by

feature of the EMT process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>In our study, CDH1 was one of seven EMT-associated genes (CDH1, SCD, PAPSS2, C3orf52,

(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>FREM1 is an extracellular matrix protein which is essential for the formation of the epithelial basement membrane during embryonic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> and is widely expressed in the developing embryo in regions of epithelial/mesenchymal interaction and epidermal remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> .</s><s>Functioning of SLC22A24 and SLC25A29 remains largely unknown not only in RCC.</s></p><p><s>To further evaluate the prognostic potential of EMT-related miRNAs/mRNAs, the association of biomarker candidates with patients' overall survival was examined, and models predicting patients' outcome were generated.</s><s>The best EMT-associated miRNA/mRNA signature for the prediction of 5-year overall survival, consisting of 5 candidate miRNAs (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR30a-3p, miR429) and 3 candidate genes (C3orf52, CDH1, PAPSS2), allowed accurate prediction of outcome of more than 70% of ccRCC patients.</s><s>Furthermore, the high-risk group according to this signature was shown to be a significant unfavorable prognostic factor independent of other clinical variables, such as stage and grade (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2B</ref>).</s><s>EMT-associated miRNA/mRNA signature was successfully validated also in independent cohort of 191 RCC patients from TCGA-KIRC dataset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</s><s>Finally, a large separation of predicted overall survival was observed for all stages suggesting an added value of EMT-based signature for outcome prediction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4E</ref>).</s><s>There are some potential limitations of this study and still some issues that must be addressed in order to establish our EMT-based system as a clinical prognostic tool.</s><s>The present study is a retrospective study, and the follow-up period is not yet sufficiently long to allow definitive conclusions to be made on the prognostic issues.</s><s>Based on the scientific evidence in the EMT field, we decided to analyze miRNA and gene expression, but there are other classes of non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, piRNAs, circRNAs) that may be also involved in the EMT process and reflect the postoperative prognosis in ccRCC patients.</s><s>All samples used in this study were obtained in a single center, and all patients were of the same ethnicity (European descent).</s><s>Therefore, these results need to be validated in a multicenter trial on independent cohorts.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the EMT-targeted approach enabled identification of novel miRNAs/mRNAs associated with metastasis and prognosis, and development of stage-independent prognostic model in ccRCC.</s><s>We believe that this finding has clinical utility in determining which ccRCC patients will have poor prognosis lesions (all stages) and in consequent adjustment of follow-up regimens enabling detection of recurrence or metastasis early and initiate treatment in hopes of having a positive impact on the long-term survival.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
