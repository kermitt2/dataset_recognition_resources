phosphate conditions, the expression of vascular CYP11B2 was investigated.</s><s>CYP11B2 expression was detectable in HAoSMCs albeit at lower levels than in human adrenocortical carcinoma H295 cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1), steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STARD1), hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta-and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (HSD3B1), hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta-and steroid delta-isomerase 2 (HSD3B2) and steroid 11-beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) were all expressed in HAoSMCs, but at lower levels as compared to H295 cells (Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3 and S4</ref>).</s><s>Phosphate treatment did not significantly modify CYP21A2, HSD3B2, STARD1 and CYP11B1 mRNA expression, but significantly increased CYP11A1, HSD3B1 and CYP11B2 mRNA levels in HAoSMCs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, phosphate treatment did not significantly modify the mRNA expression of renin-angiotensin system components pro-renin receptor (ATP6AP2), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and type 1 (AGTR1) and type 2 (AGTR2) angiotensin II receptors in HAoSMCs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure"

mice.</s><s>Similarly, phosphate stimulated Cyp11b2 protein expression in Cyp11b2 +/+ MAoSMCs, but no expression was observed in Cyp11b2 −/− MAoSMCs (Fig. <ref type="figure"

treatment.</s><s>CYP11B2 mRNA levels could not be further increased by additional phosphate treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Phosphate treatment did not modify MR (NR3C2) or glucocorticoid receptor (GR, NR3C1) expression in HAoSMCs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7</ref>).</s><s>Most importantly, according to luciferase reporter assay in HAoSMCs, phosphate triggered MR response element/GR response element (MRE/GRE)-dependent transcriptional activity in the absence of exogenous aldosterone (Fig. <ref type="figure"

confirmed by qRT-PCR using intron-spanning primers (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S8a</ref>).</s><s>However, aldosterone release into the cell culture medium was not detectable

silenced HAoSMCs, effects ameliorated following silencing of CYP11B2 gene (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11a</ref>).</s><s>Phosphate treatment significantly increased calcium deposition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a,b</ref>), alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>) and PiT1, CBFA1 and ALPL mRNA expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>) in negative control silenced HAoSMCs, effects ameliorated in HAoSMCs silenced with CYP11B2 siRNA.</s><s>The inhibitory effects of CYP11B2 silencing on

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present observations suggest a novel role of vascular CYP11B2.</s><s>CYP11B2 expression was up-regulated by elevated extracellular phosphate concentrations and CYP11B2 was required for the triggering of osteo-/chondrogenic reprogramming of VSMCs following phosphate treatment.</s><s>Vascular CYP11B2 was similarly up-regulated in hyperphosphatemic kl/kl mice, and in the subtotal nephrectomy renal failure mouse model.</s><s>Vascular CYP11B2 was further increased in patients with early stages of renal failure, but the results in brain dead multi organ donors should be interpreted with caution.</s><s>Together, these findings suggest that hyperphosphatemia increases vascular CYP11B2 transcription, which is a prerequisite for VSMC osteo-/chondrogenic transformation.</s><s>Expression of functional CYP11B2 in the vasculature has been reported earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>However, the significance of vascular aldosterone production remained controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>As observed in this study, VSMCs express enzymes involved in the generation of aldosterone precursors from cholesterol and therefore may be able to produce aldosterone de novo.</s><s>Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells express CYP11B2 and were described to synthesize aldosterone during hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>In these cells, hypoxia did not affect CYP11B2 expression, but increased vascular aldosterone synthesis by up-regulation of StAR (encoded by STARD1 gene) expression, which facilitates the first rate-limiting step in aldosterone biosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>In VSMCs, phosphate treatment did not affect StAR expression, but up-regulated CYP11B2, suggesting that hypoxia and phosphate exposure act via different mechanisms on the vascular aldosterone producing system.</s><s>Phosphate treatment increased production and release of glucocorticoids and androgens by VSMCs, but aldosterone could not be detected.</s><s>Aldosterone secreted by VSMCs may be at low levels not detectable by the employed method or remain and act intracellularly.</s><s>Low aldosterone levels within the VSMCs may be sufficient for MR activation.</s><s>Furthermore, vascular CYP11B2 may rather produce 18-hydroxycorticosterone, which was not included in our protocol.</s><s>A profound effect of vascular CYP11B2 on aldosterone levels may also require precursors from the circulation.</s><s>Nevertheless, CYP11B2 silencing blunted phosphate-induced MR-dependent transcriptional activity, suggesting that MR activation is, at least partly, dependent on CYP11B2 up-regulation.</s><s>In accordance, functional effects of CYP11B2 in the vasculature have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> and appear important especially during pathological conditions.</s></p><p><s>A potential significance of vascular auto/paracrine MR activation is underscored by the inhibitory effect of the MR blocker spironolactone on aortic osteo-/chondrogenic transformation in adrenalectomized kl/kl mice.</s><s>At least in those mice, local aldosterone synthesis rather than adrenal aldosterone release appears to be instrumental for VSMCs osteoinduction.</s><s>MR-independent effects of spironolactone cannot be ruled out <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> , but the effects of spironolactone and eplerenone were mimicked by MR silencing in vitro, an observation confirming a crucial role for MR activation in vascular calcification.</s><s>However, a ligand-independent transactivation or glucocorticoid-dependent activation of the MR could contribute to the observed effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>Glucocorticoids are able to activate MR and promote vascular calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>The effects of androgens on vascular calcification are still controversial.</s><s>Androgens may induce vascular calcification through androgen receptor (AR) activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> , but may also have anti-calcifying effects by AR-dependent up-regulation of Gas6 transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Up-regulation of vascular CYP11B2 has also been demonstrated in vascular tissue of diabetic rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref>

vascular CYP11B2 could also contribute to osteoinductive remodeling of vascular tissue during diabetes.</s></p><p><s>The present observations further shed light on the mechanism underlying the effect of extracellular phosphate on increased CYP11B2 expression.</s><s>Elevated phosphate triggered the nuclear export of the transcriptional repressor APEX1, which has been shown to repress CYP11B2 mRNA expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>The transcription factor ATF2, a positive regulator of CYP11B2 gene expression was apparently not involved in the up-regulation of CYP11B2 by phosphate <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>APEX1 silencing up-regulated CYP11B2 mRNA expression and mimicked the effects of phosphate in HAoSMCs.</s><s>Conversely, APEX1 overexpression ameliorated the phosphate-induced HAoSMCs osteo-/chondrogenic transformation.</s><s>APEX1 is thus a key factor in VSMCs CYP11B2 expression.</s><s>Nuclear export of APEX1 has previously been shown following nitrosative stress, which was also suggested to participate in the regulation of vascular calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> .</s><s>APEX1 exported from the nucleus is further triggered by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , which promotes VSMC calcification via up-regulation of alkaline phosphatase <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s></p><p><s>VSMCs have previously been shown to express the MR <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> and MR activation has been shown to augment vascular calcification via direct up-regulation of PiT1 gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> .</s><s>In view of the present and previous observations, the following sequence of events may lead to vascular calcification: Hyperphosphatemia leads to down-regulation of nuclear APEX1, which is in turn followed by up-regulation of CYP11B2, MR activation, MR-dependent up-regulation of PIT1 and subsequent triggering of osteogenic transformation.</s><s>According to the present observations, the protective effects of MR blockade on osteoinductive signaling in VSMCs may be, at least in part, independent of elevated circulating aldosterone levels.</s></p><p><s>First clinical trials indicate that spironolactone treatment reduces morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>MR inhibition may lead to transient reduction of renal function and hyperkalemia, but is in general well tolerated in CKD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> .</s><s>In CKD patients, elevated aldosterone levels were observed, increasing with advanced renal insufficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Vascular CYP11B2 expression is triggered by an increase of extracellular phosphate concentration via an APEX1-dependent mechanism and is decisive for the triggering of osteo-/chondrogenic reprogramming of VSMCs during elevated phosphate conditions.</s><s>The present observations therefore advocate the therapeutic use of MR blockade in conditions with hyperphosphatemia such as CKD even in the absence of hyperaldosteronism.</s></p></div>
