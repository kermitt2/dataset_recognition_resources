<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>A dominant histopathological feature in neuromuscular diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inclusion body myopathy is cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43.</s><s>Although rare protein-misfolding mutations in TDP-43 often cause protein aggregation, most patients do not have a TDP-43 mutation suggesting aggregates of wild-type TDP-43 arise by an unknown mechanism.</s><s>Here we show TDP-43 is an essential protein for normal skeletal muscle formation that unexpectedly forms cytoplasmic, amyloid-like oligomeric assemblies, termed myogranules, during skeletal muscle regeneration in mice and humans.</s><s>Myo-granules bind mRNAs encoding sarcomeric proteins and are cleared as myofibers mature.</s><s>Although myo-granules occur during normal skeletal muscle regeneration, myo-granules can seed TDP-43 amyloid fibrils in vitro, and are increased in a mouse model of inclusion body myopathy.</s><s>Therefore, heightened assembly or decreased clearance of functionally normal myo-granules could be the source of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates common to neuromuscular disease.</s></p><p><s>The function and aggregation of the RNA-binding protein, TAR DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP-43), in multinucleated skeletal muscle cells (myofibers) is of interest for two reasons.</s><s>First, TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in the skeletal muscle of patients with inclusion body myopathy (IBM), oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), and distal myopathies 1,2 .</s><s>These aggregates appear similar to the cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates found in the neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), suggesting a common mechanism in muscle and neurons leading to histopathological, cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation 2,3,4 .</s><s>Second, reducing TDP-43 levels leads to age-related muscle weakness in mice 5 , muscle degeneration and sarcomere disruption in zebrafish 6 , and age-related muscle weakness in Drosophila wing muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">8</ref> .</s><s>Given the requirement for TDP-43 in muscle function, and its potential to form cytoplasmic aggregates in muscle diseases, we examined TDP-43 function during normal mammalian skeletal muscle formation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>TDP-43 in uninjured muscle, at five days post-injury (dpi) TDP-43 was upregulated and in both the myonuclei and cytoplasm of newly forming myofibers identified by embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMHC) immunoreactivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>).</s><s>Super resolution microscopy reveals TDP-43 is predominately localized to myonuclei in uninjured myofibers, while in regenerating myofibers, cytoplasmic TDP-43 localizes to regions surrounding eMHC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>), which are sites of newly formed sarcomeres <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12</ref> .</s><s>By 10 dpi, cytosolic TDP-43 levels decline and localize around the centrally-located nuclei, while by 30 dpi, TDP-43 re-localizes to the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b, d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, cytosolic TDP-43 increases during skeletal muscle cell formation in culture and in mice.</s></p><p><s>Since cytoplasmic TDP-43 localization is associated with pathological aggregation, we asked if the cytoplasmic TDP-43 identified in skeletal muscle formation adopts a higher order, oligomeric state.</s><s>We detected an increase in UREA-insoluble TDP-43 in myotubes compared to myoblasts and observed higher molecular weight SDS-resistant TDP-43 assemblies unique to differentiating myotubes by SDD-AGE (Semi-Denaturing Detergent Agarose Gel Electrophoresis) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c, d</ref>).</s><s>Further, immunoprecipitation of TDP-43 from myotubes and from tibialis anterior mouse muscle at 5dpi, followed by electron microscopy (EM) reveals the presence of 50-250 nm assemblies that are not detected in undifferentiated myoblasts or in uninjured skeletal muscle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2e, f</ref>).</s><s>The EM structure is similar to previously characterized TDP-43 oligomers, albeit roughly two-fold larger in diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> .</s><s>To exclude the possibility that the TDP-43 assemblies in skeletal muscle are stress granules we assayed C2C12 myotubes for the stress granule markers G3BP1 and Pabp1.</s><s>Stress granules were not present during normal myotube formation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2g</ref>).</s><s>Thus, during muscle formation, TDP-43 exists as a component of an SDS-resistant oligomeric assembly distinct from stress granules, which we refer to as "myo-granules."</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Myo-granules are amyloid-like assemblies</head><p><s>Their SDS-resistance suggests myo-granules have amyloid-like properties, which is supported by two observations.</s><s>First, X-ray diffraction on lyophilized myo-granules revealed a diffraction pattern with a 4.8 Å reflection, indicating a beta-rich complex that is not observed in control samples.</s><s>Myo-granules lacked a 10 Å reflection implying a lack of mated cross beta-sheets, similar to previously described amyloid-like oligomers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>, b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref> .</s><s>Second, immunopurified myo-granules from C2C12 myotubes and regenerating mouse tibialis anterior muscle are also immunoreactive for A11, a conformation specific antibody that recognizes beta-rich structures including amyloid-like oligomers (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c-h</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Similar to TDP-43, A11 immunoreactivity increases in myotubes in culture and in regenerating mouse tibialis anterior muscle (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3i-k</ref>).</s><s>In developing myotubes in culture, A11 immunoreactivity is cytoplasmic and correlates with cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a-c</ref>).</s><s>During muscle regeneration, A11 immunoreactivity correlates with TDP-43 cytoplasmic immunoreactivity increasing in the cytoplasm at 5dpi but dissipating by 10dpi (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4d-g</ref>).</s><s>At 5dpi in mice, more than 80% of A11 immunoreactivity is co-localized with cytosolic TDP-43 immunoreactivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c, d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4h</ref>).</s><s>Further, cytoplasmic TDP-43 exists as a component of an A11-reactive complex revealed by proximity ligation assays in differentiating C2C12 myotubes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4i</ref>).</s><s>These observations argue cytoplasmic myo-granules contain TDP-43 in an amyloid-like oligomer conformation during skeletal muscle formation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Myo-granules contain sarcomeric mRNAs</head><p><s>As TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein, we examined if myo-granules include RNA.</s><s>Immunoprecipitation of myo-granules with TDP-43 or A11 antibodies followed by oligo-dT Northern blot analysis reveals that TDP-43 and A11 associate with mRNA in myotubes (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5a</ref>).</s><s>To identify the mRNAs bound by TDP-43 during muscle formation, we constructed transcriptome-wide maps of TDP-43 binding sites in undifferentiated myoblasts and in myotubes using eCLIP (enhanced UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5b-e</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> .</s><s>We identified a total of 556 binding sites across 174 genes for myoblasts and a total of 975 binding sites across 320 genes for myotubes as significantly enriched over size matched input (SMinput, which reflects all RNA-protein interactions in the input).</s><s>The binding sites were highly correlated between biological replicates, revealed enrichment for the TDP-43 UG-rich consensus sequence, exhibited thousands of reproducible CLIP clusters by irreproducible discovery rate analysis, and identified known TDP-43 mRNA targets including the 3' UTR of TDP-43 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5f</ref>-h) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> .</s><s>We also observed that the mRNAs bound to TDP-43 changed significantly during skeletal muscle differentiation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A majority of the TDP-43 binding sites in myoblasts and myotubes are in exons of protein coding transcripts, suggesting TDP-43 may be associating with mature mRNAs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6b, c</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, TDP-43 binding sites in neurons were predominantly mapped to introns <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> .</s><s>The difference may reflect cell state, where TDP-43 binds more processed cytoplasmic RNAs in newly forming tissue and more nuclear, intronic RNA in post-mitotic mature cells.</s><s>Connectome and gene ontology analysis of TDP-43 exonic target transcripts in myotubes, which are likely to constitute interactions with cytoplasmic mRNAs, revealed TDP-43 binds to a network of transcripts associated with the sarcomere (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>TDP-43 target RNAs identified by eCLIP in myotubes often have multiple TDP-43 exonic binding sites in close proximity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> .</s><s>For example, in the titin mRNA numerous TDP-43 exon binding sites are distributed across the transcript, and within single exons we observed multiple UG-rich stretches with several TDP-43 binding sites (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>).</s><s>These observations argue TDP-43 adopts new functionality during myogenesis by binding to structural mRNAs required for skeletal muscle formation, while retaining canonical nuclear functions such as splicing and nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling.</s></p><p><s>To validate that the sarcomeric mRNAs identified by eCLIP bind to cytoplasmic TDP-43 during muscle formation we used single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH).</s><s>We found that TDP-43 protein co-localizes with mRNAs for myosin-3 and troponin-c in the cytoplasm of myotubes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>).</s><s>In addition, smFISH for titin mRNA reveals co-localization of both TDP-43 and A11 immunoreactivity with titin mRNA in myotubes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>).</s><s>These observations demonstrate TDP-43 binds to sarcomeric mRNAs in the cytosol, and can form A11-positive myo-granules in association with those mRNAs, perhaps because of the high local concentration of TDP-43 proteins on a single mRNA molecule <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The association of TDP-43 myo-granules with sarcomeric mRNAs during muscle formation is analogous to the role of TDP-43 in forming cytoplasmic neuronal messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules for local translation of mRNAs in neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> .</s><s>Consistent with this similarity, mass spectrometry of purified myo-granules identified 356
