<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>One argument forwarded to explain apparent violations of rationality is that state-dependence effects must be considered, e.g., when an animal prefers a small immediate reward option when its current energy reserves are low and a large delayed option when its reserves are high <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>State dependence can lead to violations of economic rationality, especially when the value of an option depends on the context of all available options, including those not chosen <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref

and not E-rationality (utility maximization) should be labelled as irrational behaviours.</s><s>However, with one exception <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , violations of the principles of economic rationality have only been demonstrated when options vary in more than one dimension (e.g., delay and probability of reward), where interactions between dimensions can occur because of nonlinearities in the evaluation of each dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Such nonlinearities are described by Weber's law, which supports the general observation in perception that discrimination thresholds are a constant proportion of stimulus magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, it is consistent with Weber's law (or proportional processing) that, in most animal species, responses to differences in intensity between physical stimuli indicate that such intensity differences are represented proportionally rather than linearly <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>For instance, the addition of two peanuts to a bowl holding 15 peanuts will barely be noticed, whereas two extra peanuts in a bowl holding five peanuts will be readily perceived.</s><s>The proportional processing of sensory information can be demonstrated by fitting a psychometric function into the choice probabilities experimentally determined.</s><s>A psychometric function then describes how the probability to choose the better of two options increases as the difference between two value stimuli increases.</s><s>This function usually has a sigmoid shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>Importantly, knowing how the probability of choice changes as the difference between two stimuli increases allows for quantitative rather than simply qualitative predictions about expected performance in future choice experiments.</s></p><p><s>Rodents are notably absent from the list of animals in which the principles of economic rationality have been tested.</s><s>Rats and mice have long been used in the study of the diverse aspects of motor, sensory, affective and cognitive functions such as learning, memory and the processing of rewards and punishments <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref

based on (multi)sensory input <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> .</s><s>Thus, rodents hold promise for investigating how decision-making circuits function in healthy conditions and when disrupted by disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>In order to increase the ecological validity of laboratory studies, automated home cage setups have been introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> , in which operant testing modules are placed inside the home cages of group-living mice or rats.</s><s>With such setups, it is possible to screen cognitive and affective abilities in an environment in which rodents are undisturbed and follow their own cycle of activity and level of motivation for extended periods of time.</s></p><p><s>We investigated whether mice exhibit economic rationality by testing the principles of transitivity, IIA and regularity during choices made in an automated home cage experimental system.</s><s>Mice were given access to dispensers delivering rewards (drinking water) that differed in one of two dimensions, namely volume or probability.</s><s>We evaluated stochastic transitivity within sets of binary choice conditions for each reward dimension, volume or probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Mice could choose between four dispensers, two of which (binary) presented a medium or high-quality reward, whereas the other two presented only (irrelevant) small or zero rewards.</s><s>While mice kept visiting all dispensers even after long exposure to constant conditions, they still exhibited underlying preferences that could be statistically detected.</s></p><p><s>We evaluated the principle of IIA by comparing preferences in binary and trinary choice conditions.</s><s>Here, the difference between the binary and the trinary choice conditions was an additional irrelevant option that was objectively inferior in value to the other two options <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Over the course of all experiments, mice were required to choose between many pairs of volumes or probabilities, with differences within these pairs ranging from zero to small to large.</s><s>We used the recorded relative preferences of the mice in each choice condition to fit psychometric functions for the discriminative ability of volume and probability.</s><s>These functions then allowed us to estimate the probability that a mouse will choose the larger or better of the two options as a function of the difference in magnitude between these two options.</s><s>Finally, since our experimental setup allowed us to test animals' decisions in a social environment, we performed control tests that ascertained that the decisions were not influenced by social learning.</s><s>This was accomplished by reassigning dispensers to mice, so that twice as many animals were using same dispensers as used previously, and then evaluating whether this altered choice behaviour.</s></p></div>

libitum access to pellet food (V1535 chow pellet, maintenance food, ssniff, Germany), woodchip bedding (AB 6, AsBe-wood, Germany), and enriched with two grey PVC tubes and paper towels as nesting

cage.</s><s>Experiments were conducted consecutively with two groups of mice (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>These groups were: the 'volume first' group (exploratory phase: N = 10, main experiment: N = 8 successfully pre-trained mice) and the 'probability first' group (exploratory phase: N = 9, main experiment: N = 7 successfully pre-trained mice).</s><s>Exclusion criteria for the animals are described below.</s><s>In all phases of the experiment, if a mouse obtained less than 1,000 µL of water during a drinking session, two water bottles were placed in the automated home cage for 10-20 min during the light phase, mice were awakened and allowed to drink until they voluntarily stopped.</s><s>Usually only the individuals that failed to meet this criterion approached and drank from the bottles.</s></p><p><s>Exploratory phase.</s><s>Animals were transferred to their new home cage during the light phase, 1-2 hours before the initial drinking session of the exploratory phase.</s><s>During the exploratory phase, all dispensers gave constant rewards of 20 µL per nose poke.</s><s>If a mouse consumed more than 700 µL of water at the end of the first drinking session of the exploratory phase, it proceeded to the training phase; otherwise, it repeated this phase during the next drinking session.</s><s>The exploratory phase was required to ensure that mice learned where and how to obtain water within the cage.</s></p><p><s>Training phase.</s><s>In the 'volume first' group, the rewards began during the initial training phase as 33 µL of water, but were then reduced to 10 µL, in order to increase the number of choices each mouse was required to make.</s><s>The The dispensers in the four corners of the cage (rounded

criterion of consuming more than 1000 µL of water in one drinking session.</s><s>The training phase was required to habituate the mice to the background dimensions (volume or probability) that would be used in the following discrimination experiments.</s></p><p><s>Discrimination experiments.</s><s>Two types of discrimination experiments were performed: volume discrimination and probability discrimination.</s><s>The 'volume first' group was initially tested for volume discrimination and then for probability discrimination, whereas the 'probability first' group had the reverse order.</s><s>The general conditions were the same for both types of discrimination experiments: for each mouse, one of the dispensers had high profitability, another had medium profitability, and the remaining two dispensers had an identical low profitability.</s><s>There were five possible reward types.</s><s>These were, in order of decreasing profitability, A, B, C, D, and 0; with A = 22 µL, B = 19 µL, C = 14 µL, D = 6 µL, 0 = 0 µL in the volume discrimination experiments, and A = 80%, B = 70%, C = 50%, D = 20%, 0 = 0% in the probability discrimination experiments.</s><s>All possible combinations of low, medium and high profitability were tested, resulting in six 'binary choice' conditions: AB0, AC0, AD0, BC0, BD0, and CD0 (0 designating the non-rewarding dispensers), and four 'trinary choice' conditions: ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.</s><s>The three-symbol code gives the reward types in decreasing order of profitability.</s><s>For example, for the ACD condition in the volume discrimination experiment, one dispenser delivered 22 µL (high profitability), another dispenser delivered 14 µL (medium profitability), and the remaining two delivered 6 µL (low profitability).</s><s>Comparing the relative preference for the option with high profitability in the binary and trinary conditions was done as a test of regularity.</s></p><p><s>The reward probabilities were set to 30% for all dispensers in the volume discrimination experiments, in order to make return rates comparable for both dimensions.</s><s>The reward volumes were set to 10 µL in the probability discrimination experiments.</s><s>In the volume experiment involving the 'volume first' group, whether a reward was given to a mouse (upon nose poke) was decided by drawing samples with 30% probability.</s><s>In all subsequent experiments, rewards were drawn from fixed pseudo-random repeating sequences.</s><s>These sequences were: 11101111101101111110 for 80%, 11011101110101101110 for 70%, 10110101101001001010 for 50%, 10010100100001001000 for 30%, and 10001000010001000000 for 20%, where 1 is a rewarded nose poke and 0 is an unrewarded nose poke.</s></p><p><s>Mice were paired so that the mice in each pair shared the same high and medium profitability dispensers each night.</s><s>The pair shared these two dispensers with another pair of mice, for which the medium and high profitability dispensers were spatially inverted.</s><s>Thus, each night each dispenser had a high profitability for the mice in one pair, a medium profitability for the mice in another pair, and a low profitability for the mice in the remaining two pairs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>The pairs of mice remained the same throughout the experiment, until the social learning tests (see next section).</s><s>One mouse was unpaired in the 'probability first' group.</s></p><p><s>The sequence of conditions (binary and trinary) was randomized for each individual.</s><s>Thus, although the mice in a pair shared dispensers, they did not usually experience the same type of reward from this dispenser.</s><s>As a control for positional biases, each given condition was followed by a reversal on the following day, so that the high Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</s><s>An example of dispenser distribution among mice.</s><s>(A) In each condition of the main experiment, mice (color-coded 1 through 8) were given a reward profitability (indicated by rounded rectangle size) that encouraged their even distribution among dispensers.</s><s>For example, dispenser 1 had high profitability for mice 7 and 8 (pair 4, large green rectangles), medium profitability for mice 3 and 4 (pair 2, intermediate yellow rectangles), and low profitability for the remaining mice (pairs 1 and 3, small red and blue rectangles).</s><s>(B) Each condition was followed by a reversal session during the next night, in which the high and mediumprofitability dispensers were spatially inverted (dashed arrows), while the low-profitability dispensers remained the same.</s><s>(C) During the forced dispenser sharing condition (social learning test), all mice shared the same low-profitability dispensers.</s><s>The mice were split in two subgroups (mice 1-4 and mice 5-8), so that mice within each subgroup but not between subgroups shared the same high and medium-profitability dispensers, 1 and 3.</s><s>This condition was maintained for two days, with a reversal on the second day (not shown).</s><s>Numbers inside rectangles give either reward probabilities (A,B) or volume in microliters (C).</s><s>and medium-profitability dispensers were spatially inverted for each mouse, whereas the two low-profitability dispensers remained unchanged.</s><s>After reversal, the experiment continued with the next condition, with random distribution of the dispensers among the pairs of mice following the previously described constraints (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Over each 20-session discrimination experiment [(6 binary conditions + 4 trinary conditions) × 2 because of the reversal conditions], each mouse experienced each dispenser as a low-profitability dispenser between eight and 12 times.</s><s>If an electrical or mechanical malfunction occurred, the data from the failed condition and its reversal were discarded and mice proceeded with the next condition, until all conditions (including those that had originally failed) were completed.</s><s>A failure occurred twice in each of the two groups of mice.</s><s>After the first discrimination experiment, another four-day training phase (rewards with 10 µL volume and 30% probability) was given, followed by the second discrimination experiment.</s><s>Finally, several additional tests of social learning were performed (see below) and the mice were returned to the animal facility.</s></p><p><s>Social learning tests.</s><s>By using group housing, we provided a more natural environment for our mice, while simultaneously increasing the efficiency of experimentation.</s><s>As each mouse was designated an individual sequence of experimental conditions, the effect of the condition sequence was controlled within the main experiment.</s><s>However, as there were eight mice and four dispensers, it was necessary to pair mice to share their high and medium-profitability dispensers with three other mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A,B</ref>).</s><s>In order to assess potential social influences on discrimination, we increased the possibilities for social learning during additional volume discrimination sessions.</s><s>These sessions aimed to test whether extensive training had increased performance in volume discrimination to levels comparable to those seen in the probability discrimination.</s><s>In the 'volume first' group, after the end of the probability discrimination experiment, six binary volume discrimination conditions with corresponding reversals were repeated, including a final AD0 condition that was given for two sessions (the second session was a reversal).</s><s>In this forced dispenser sharing condition, all mice had the same two low-profitability dispensers (spatial positions 1 and 3), and for half of these mice dispenser 1 had a high profitability and dispenser 3 had a medium profitability, whereas for the other half the dispenser profitabilities were spatially inverted (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>Thus, in contrast to the main experiment, mice could potentially profit to an increased extent if they rely on the preferences of other mice when making choices.</s><s>There was simultaneously higher competition for access to the water dispensers.</s><s>In summary, the AD0 condition was experienced by the mice three times: 1) In the original volume discrimination experiment, 2) in the repeat experiment, and 3) in the forced dispenser-sharing condition.</s><s>This was done to control for a potential increase in discrimination performance due to experience.</s><s>Comparison of 1) and 2) shows whether time affected choice.</s><s>Comparison of 2) and 3) shows whether sharing the active dispensers with all mice and the most profitable dispenser with half of the mice affected choice.</s></p><p><s>In the 'probability first' group, mice also experienced these three AD0 conditions, although in a different order.</s><s>Immediately after the end of the second discrimination experiment, mice were given a
