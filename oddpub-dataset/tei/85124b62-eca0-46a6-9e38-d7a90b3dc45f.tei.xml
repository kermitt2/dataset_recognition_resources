<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>The process of successful aging and longevity is complex and far from being understood.</s><s>Lifestyle, environment, and a limited aging-related impairment of the immune system (termed immunosenescence) are among the most important factors contributing to the healthy aging phenotype.</s><s>The aged adaptive immune system is characterized by a decreased effectiveness due to decreased T-and B-cell responses and accumulation of functionally impaired memory lymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the aged adaptive immune system is characterized by a dysregulation of T-cell subtypes, with a relative increase of Th2 lymphocytes resulting in increased levels of Th2 cytokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The aged innate immune system is characterized by reduced functions of neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells, and dendritic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, an important feature of the aged immune system is a chronic low grade inflammatory state, also known as micro-inflammation or inflamm-aging, which has been suspected to trigger agingassociated diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT 2), metabolic syndrome, and neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The mechanisms inducing the process of inflamm-aging are multifactorial and not completely understood.</s><s>One reason may be the dysregulation of T lymphocyte subtypes.</s><s>An enhanced translocation of gut bacteria as well as an enhanced DNA-damage in the elderly, which both trigger the innate pro-inflammatory immune response, are also discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, epigenetic changes in innate immune cells are discussed to be involved in inflamm-aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, numerous genetic factors have also been proposed to influence aging.</s><s>Several studies show that healthy aging and particularly longevity are highly heritable.</s><s>For example, siblings of centenarians also have an enhanced probability for a longer healthy life <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Genetic variations associated with the onset of age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis resulting in CVD, DMT 2, Alzheimer's Disease, and cancer may play a pivotal role in determining successful aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Among aging-associated diseases, CVD plays a crucial role regarding mortality in the middle-aged population of the Western world <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, we have shown that the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-6 SNP P249S is associated with the risk for CVD with the homozygous S/S variant protecting from CVD.</s><s>We also speculated whether this SNP may influence successful aging in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It has been shown that aging is associated with the dysregulation of expression and signal transduction of a variety of innate immune receptors, among them TLRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>TLRs are important receptors of the innate immune system recognizing "pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)" followed by the activation of the innate immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Although the process of inflammation is fundamental for survival in terms of combating infections or coping with damaging agents, it is also an important cause of many aging-associated diseases such as atherosclerosis, DMT 2, cognitive decline, and cancer, since these diseases are all associated with chronic inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The inflammatory response is driven by a variety of signaling pathways, however, the transcription factor NFκB has been considered to be the master regulator of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and is also a central part of TLR signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since inflamm-aging seems to be one of the reasons for the development of aging-related diseases, we postulated previously that variations within the TLR-system that decrease the inflammatory response may lead to a decreased process of inflamm-aging and may be, therefore, beneficial in terms of healthy aging.</s><s>First evidence for this hypothesis was given by the finding that such variations are overrepresented in healthy elderly subjects in comparison to healthy younger subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Following this discovery, we here investigated a cohort of elderly Caucasians and show that in nonsmoking elderly subjects the TLR-6 SNP P249S is associated with healthy aging.</s><s>Analysis of certain aging related diseases revealed a significant protective effect on CVD and DMT 2.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association of common risk factors with age related diseases</head><p><s>First we analyzed whether common risk factors such as age, BMI, micro-inflammation (presented as IL-6 levels), smoking, and hypertension are associated with agingrelated diseases in our cohort of elderly Caucasians by comparison of healthy subjects without any aging-related disease (n = 517), and subjects suffering from one or more aging-related diseases (n = 1027), e.g.</s><s>CVD (n = 496), cancer (n = 93), lung disease (n = 254), DMT 2 (n = 122), and cognitive impairment (n = 406).</s><s>Baseline characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>As expected, increased age and BMI were strongly associated with the occurrence of aging-related diseases (P &lt; 0.001 for both).</s><s>Also inflamm-aging, determined by baseline IL-6 levels with levels ≤1 ng/L serving as reference and 1.1-2.0</s><s>ng/L as intermediate or &gt;2 ng/L as high levels, could be shown to be a strong risk factor (P = 0.016 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively).</s><s>Hypertension, interestingly, failed to be a significant risk factor in our cohort.</s><s>Surprisingly, current smoking revealed a significant "protective" effect (P = 0.003, OR: 0.586), whereas past smoking showed no association (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>However, further analysis of the distribution of age and BMI in nonsmokers, past smokers, and current smokers revealed current smokers to be significantly younger and having a significantly lower BMI, which might account for the "protective" effect of current smoking (data not shown).</s><s>Indeed, performing a multivariate analysis with inflamm-aging, age, BMI and smoking as risk factors revealed that micro-inflammation -presented as intermediate or high IL-6 levels -, age and BMI remained significant independent risk factors in our elderly cohort, with P-values of 0.034, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.008, respectively.</s><s>Past smoking and current smoking in a multivariate analysis failed to be significantly associated with agingrelated diseases (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The TLR-6 variant 249S/S is significantly associated with protection from aging-related diseases in non-smoking subjects Having shown that common risk factors (with the exception of smoking) exhibited the expected association with aging-related diseases in our cohort, we next analyzed whether the TLR-6 P249S variation is also associated with such diseases.</s><s>Analyzing the whole cohort by logistic regression, using the wild-type genotype as reference we failed to find any significant association.</s><s>Correction for age, BMI and inflamm-aging was done by adding these factors as co-factors in the regression analysis (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Since in this population smokers are significantly younger and exhibit a significantly lower BMI the pattern of association of smoking with diseases could not be analyzed in detail, and in order to avoid further statistical problems, only non-smokers were selected for   Comparing non-smoking healthy subjects (n = 278) with non-smoking diseased subjects (n = 571) we found a significant protective association of the TLR-6 P/S and TLR-6 S/S variants with aging-related diseases in general, P = 0.024, OR: 0.682 (95 % CI: 0.489-0.951)</s><s>and P = 0.018, OR: 0.566 (95 % CI: 0.353-0.909),</s><s>respectively.</s><s>The protective effect for mutated allele carriers was still in effect when heterozygous and homozygous genotypes were combined, P = 0.008, OR: 0.654 (95 % CI: 0.477-0.897)</s><s>(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), which is compatible with the dominant model.</s><s>No significant effects were found in formerly or currently smoking subjects, which, as stated above, may be due to the different age-distribution of these groups (data not shown).</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, a subgroup analysis of individual diseases revealed a significant protective effect of the TLR-6 S/S variant regarding CVD (n = 255), P = 0.018, OR: 0.483 (95 % CI: 0.265-0.882).</s><s>Correction for age, BMI and inflamm-aging was done by adding these factors as co-factors in the regression analysis.</s><s>Interestingly, the heterozygous P/S variant as well as the combined heterozygous and homozygous genotypes exhibited a significant protection regarding DMT 2 (n = 79), P = 0.007 OR: 0.443 (95 % CI: 0.244-0.804)</s><s>and P = 0.010 OR: 0.486 (95 % CI: 0.281-0.839),</s><s>respectively.</s><s>For cancer (n = 42), lung disease (n = 116), and cognitive impairment (n = 250), no significant associations were found.</s><s>Analysis of combined aging-related diseases with exclusion of CVD (n = 309) revealed significant protection for the TLR-6 P/S variant, P = 0.016 OR. 0.628 (95 % CI: 0.431-0.915)</s><s>and the combined heterozygous and homozygous genotypes, P = 0.012, OR: 0.635 (95 % CI: 0.445-0.906)</s><s>indicating a protective effect independent of the protection against CVD.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>No association of TLR-6 6 P249S variation with baseline IL-6 levels</head><p><s>Since we have speculated previously that a beneficial effect of TLR SNPs may rely on a decreased process of inflamm-aging due to a reduced sensitivity of the innate immune system, we analyzed whether the TLR-6 P249S variant was associated with baseline levels of IL-6.</s><s>To exclude current infections that could affect the level of IL-6, we excluded subjects with a white blood cell count above 10.000/μl.</s><s>As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>, baseline IL-6 levels are significantly higher in subjects suffering from one or more aging-related diseases in comparison to healthy subjects: 3.33 ng/L vs. 2.75 ng/ L, P &gt;0.000.</s><s>Although there is a trend for decreased IL-6 baseline levels in S allele carriers, P/P: 3.23 ng/ L, P/S: 3.08 ng/L and S/S: 3.05 ng/L, this association is not significant, P = 0.850.</s><s>P-values and OR were determined by logistic regression using the wild type genotype as reference, and micro-inflammation (IL-6 level), age and BMI as co-factors.</s><s>Subjects with a white blood cell count above 10.000/μl were excluded</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have recently shown that TLR-6 P249S is associated with coronary artery disease, one of the most important aging-related diseases, and have speculated that this genetic variation may be also associated with healthy aging in general by decreasing the process of inflamm-aging due to decreased sensitivity of the innate immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Healthy, or successful aging is affected by a variety of factors including environmental factors, life style, micro-inflammation, and genetic factors that determine the occurrence, onset and course of agingrelated diseases.</s><s>Since most age-related diseases are associated with chronic inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, a sensitive immune system may be an example of antagonistic pleiotropy with beneficial effects at early age but adverse effects in later life since evolution optimizes for fitness, not for longevity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>By analyzing a middle-aged population-based cohort, exhibiting the typical distribution of aging-related diseases, we here confirmed our previous finding of TLR-6 P249S being associated with CVD and showed that this SNP is associated with healthy aging in non-smoking subjects of the PolSenior cohort.</s><s>This positive association with healthy aging remains significant after exclusion of subjects suffering from CVD indicating a more general effect, not only restricted to CVD.</s><s>Furthermore we present first evidence of this SNP to be also involved in DMT-2 and the process of inflamm-aging in non-smoking subjects.</s></p><p><s>We have currently no conclusive explanation why this effect could not be shown in smoking subjects.</s><s>Although our study does not show smoking to be one of the strongest risk factors for aging-related diseases in individuals 65 years old and older, the effect of TLR-6 variants on healthy aging may nevertheless be masked by smoking.</s><s>Such modifying effect of smoking has recently been reported for several genetic associations in age-related macular degeneration which are largely restricted to non-smokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>One possible explanation could be that in our cohort smoking is associated with both, lower ager and lower BMI which in turn are associated with the absence of aging-related diseases.</s><s>The association of TLR-6 P249S with DMT 2 has not been shown before.</s><s>However, since the number of non-smoking subjects with DMT 2 was rather low in our cohort (n = 79), and TLR-6 has not been found by GWAs for DMT 2, these findings have to be confirmed in larger studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Analyzing the whole cohort for common risk factors by multivariate regression analysis showed, as expected, increased age, BMI, and inflamm-aging to be strongly associated with the occurrence of aging-related diseases.</s><s>Since we have previously speculated that less functional TLR variants decreasing the sensitivity of the innate immune system may dampen the process of inflammaging, we analyzed the association of TLR-6 P249S with baseline IL-6 levels.</s><s>Although the S allele at position 249 of TLR-6 has been shown to decrease TLR-6 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, we could not find a significant effect on inflammaging.</s><s>However, we could show a trend towards decreased IL-6 levels in S allele carriers.</s><s>The failure of finding significant changes may potentially be explained by the fact that other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, the serum-levels of which were not available to us, may be more involved in the process of inflamm-aging as compared to IL-6.</s><s>Recent data show that inflamm-aging is not simply the chronic increase of pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and CRP.</s><s>Inflamm-aging seem to be much more complex and is characterized by the simultaneous change in both proand anti-inflammatory markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, repeated measurements of IL-6 levels, which were not available to us in this cohort are known to be more accurate in determining inflamm-aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the SNPs investigated by us may lead to changes in cytokines in certain tissues, which cannot be monitored by measuring serum levels.</s></p><p><s>On the other hand, comparing healthy subjects with diseased subjects, a strong correlation of increased IL-6 baseline levels and aging-related diseases was shown.</s><s>This may be evidence for the fact that inflamm-aging is driven mainly by a dysregulated T lymphocyte subpopulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and chronic stimulation of the innate immune system via TLRs does not play the
