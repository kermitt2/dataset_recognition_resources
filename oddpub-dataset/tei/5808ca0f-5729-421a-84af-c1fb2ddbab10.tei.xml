<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to modulate cortical neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>During such modulation, the electric currents from excitable membranes of brain tissue superimpose at a given location in the extracellular medium and generate a potential, which is referred to as the electroencephalogram (EEG) when recorded from the scalp <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Respective neural activity has been shown to be closely related, spatially and temporally, to cerebral blood flow (CBF) that supplies glucose via neurovascular coupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>The hemodynamic response to neural activity can be captured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which enables continuous monitoring of cerebral oxygenation and blood volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our prior work, we have suggested that anodal tDCS enhances activity and excitability of the excitatory pyramidal neuron at a population level in a non-specific manner, and that µ-rhythm desynchronization is generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The excitation versus inhibition effects of acute tDCS on the population kinetics can produce a whole spectrum of EEG signals within the oscillatory regime of a neural mass model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>The effects on the population kinetics depends on the direction of cortical current flow determining the relative influence of acute tDCS on the cellular targets responsible for the modulation of synaptic efficacy, which are concurrently somata and axon terminals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, not all neural tissue will be equally affected by a given stimulation protocol which may distinctly affect neuronal populations/neuronal compartments.</s><s>Here, basal and apical dendrites can be concomitantly polarized in opposite directions, and Layer V pyramidal neurons exhibit the highest measured somatic sensitivities to subthreshold fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, somatic depolarization of Layer V pyramidal neurons with anodal tDCS may result in corresponding change in spontaneous firing rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> thereby causing rapid increase in extracellular potassium concentration due to outwardly directed potassium currents <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, Fricke and coworkers <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> hypothesized the role of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (L-VGCC) in short-term homeostatic plasticity since tDCS has been shown to induce a long-lasting disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref> and induce calcium-dependent plasticity <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, the influence of long-lasting disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis on the myogenic and the metabolic control of cerebral circulation cannot be excluded.</s><s>The glial network has an important role in regulating neural activity by distributing extracellular ions, i.e. spatial buffering, which can have a time course of seconds <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Due to this relatively long time course, some of these diffusing extracellular potassium and calcium ions can act as mediators of vasodilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> as well as can act as neurotransmitters, affecting other neuronal compartments including GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses as a homeostatic feedback mechanism.</s><s>Response to this homeostatic feedback might influence the aftereffects of anodal tDCS which have been shown to depend on the modulation of both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s>For example, depolarization of presynaptic glutamate terminals can increase the probability of glutamate release, and glutamate uptake into astrocytes may stimulate aerobic glycolysis -a mechanism coupling neuronal activity to glucose utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the action of GABA is primarily determined by the concentration of intracellular chloride.</s><s>Prior work has shown that both, increasing and decreasing the extracellular potassium ion concentration results in a concomitant change in intracellular chloride concentration via potassium-coupled chloride cotransport <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Due to vessel dilation, the rates of glucose flux transfer across the endothelium into the interstitium increases.</s><s>Consequently, astrocytes and neurons might uptake glucose (and lactate) from the interstitium to fuel recovery/maintenance of homeostasis during/following tDCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In accordance, our case series <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> showed detectable hemodynamic responses (0-60sec) to 0.526A/m 2 square-pulse (0-30sec) of anodal tDCS.</s><s>It was postulated that alterations of the vascular system may result in delayed secondary changes of the cortical excitability.</s><s>Indeed, recent work showed that lactate can modulate the activity of primary cortical neurons through a receptor-mediated pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> and vasomotion rhythms can influence neural firing patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Based on these preliminary studies, we recently proposed EEG-NIRS-based screening and monitoring of neurovascular coupling functionality under perturbation with tDCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The objective of this methodological study is to present a neurovascular coupling model, and to assess its feasibility based on simultaneous EEG-NIRS recordings (simultaneous recording technique presented in Barbour et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>) during anodal tDCS, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure"

EEG-NIRS based assessment of tDCS effects</head><p><s>Prior work has shown that tDCS induces changes in neuronal membrane potentials in a polarity-dependent manner and induces synaptically driven after-effects after a sufficient duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Basal and apical dendrites can be concomitantly polarized in opposite directions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently stimulation results in local excitatory (or inhibitory) postsynaptic current, which then results in an excitatory (or inhibitory) postsynaptic potential at the cell body causing respective membrane potential alterations.</s><s>The synaptic transmembrane currents are a major contributor of the extracellular signal that can be measured with current source density (CSD) analysis of the extracellular field potentials, viz., local field potentials (LFP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Here, EEG monitored the extracellular field potentials which can be used to estimate the EEG surface laplacian <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> -the magnitude of the radial (transcranial) current flow leaving (sinks) and entering (sources) the scalp.</s><s>These reference-free current source density (CSD) waveforms yield measures that closely represent underlying neuronal current generators <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, and therefore CSD waveforms at the site of stimulation, Cz, should represent underlying neuronal current generators.</s><s>Prior works show a strong coupling between LFP and regional vascular responses even in the absence of spikes (i.e., sub-threshold depolarization) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, our prior work showed an increase of fractional power in the Theta band (4-8Hz) and decrease around "individual alpha frequency" in the Alpha band (8-13Hz) following anodal tDCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, NIRS complemented the electrophysiological measures with measurements of the changes in (cortical) tissue oxy-( 2 HbO ), and deoxy-( Hb ) hemoglobin concentration roughly underlying Cz location.</s><s>Total hemoglobin concentration, Hbt , is considered as a good indicator of variations in regional cerebral blood volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> which was derived as the sum of 2 HbO and Hb concentrations.</s></p></div>

<ref type="figure">3a</ref>) and the IMF-8 of 2 HbO (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) during post-tDCS resting-state (i.e., no task and no tDCS), which was found to be positive ~0.6 with a lead of 5sec (95 percent confidence interval).</s><s>The results including the 0.5Hz-11.25H ) z ( EEG NIRS NVC → during anodal tDCS from all the trials (N=15) for all four cases are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</s><s>The results of this case series shows that anodal tDCS induces a local neurovascular response which may be used for assessing regional neurovascular coupling (NVC) functionality.</s><s>It was postulated that tDCS leads to rapid dynamic variations of the brain cell microenvironment <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> that perturbs hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses.</s><s>Indeed, we found immediate regional changes in tissue oxy-( 2 HbO ) and deoxy-( Hb ) haemoglobin concentration from 0-60sec due to application of 0.526A/m 2 anodal tDCS from 0-30sec (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Also, non-stationary effects of anodal tDCS on EEG (interpolated at Cz) were identified from the spectrogram, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>.</s><s>Here, the log-transformed mean-power within 0.5Hz-11.25Hz</s><s>frequency band was much higher at the beginning (0-10sec) of anodal tDCS when compared to post-tDCS (&gt;30 sec) values in Case-1 (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>This non-stationary logtransformed mean-power within the 0.5Hz-11.25Hz</s><s>frequency band was best captured by the 6th intrinsic mode function, IMF-6 (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>Also, it was found that the 8th intrinsic mode function (IMF-8) mostly captured the non-stationary effects of anodal tDCS on 2 HbO timeseries including the initial dip (12.13±3.81sec in Case-1), as shown in the bottom panel of Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, IMF-8 for 2 HbO and IMF-6 for interpolated EEG at Cz (virtual electrode) were selected for the assessment of neurovascular coupling (NVC) during anodal tDCS, which is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>.</s><s>During anodal tDCS, the negative cross-correlation coefficient was found to be comparable across cases and log-transformed mean-power of IMF-6 for interpolated EEG at Cz (virtual electrode) lagged IMF-8 for 2 HbO .</s><s>However, the lag for Case-1 (0.93±1.26sec) differed from the other cases.</s><s>Case-1, a 31 years old left hemiplegic male subject, also complained of headache with throbbing pain following 15 minutes of anodal tDCS in another study.</s><s>For post-tDCS, the cross-correlation coefficient was positive with a negative lag (i.e., IMF-8 for 2 HbO lagged log-transformed mean-power of IMF-6 for EEG), which were comparable across subjects.</s></p><p><s>We found log-transformed mean-power within 0.5Hz-11.25Hz</s><s>frequency band much higher at the beginning (~0-10sec) of anodal tDCS when compared to post-tDCS (&gt;30 sec) values in Case-1 (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>Since moderate rises in the extracellular potassium concentration has been shown to depress high-frequency synaptic transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> which may lead to an increase in power in the lower (0.5Hz-11.25Hz) frequency band so we postulate that anodal tDCS may cause a rapid increase in the extracellular potassium concentration due to outwardly directed potassium currents.</s><s>Here, diffusing extracellular potassium ions can act as mediators of vasodilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> as well as can act on the neuronal compartments, including GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses, which might contribute to the aftereffects of anodal tDCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Also, an immediate response towards the recovery of homeostasis can be triggered by the extracellular potassium (and, may be calcium [10]) ion movement during perturbation with anodal tDCS.</s><s>This recovery (and maintenance) of homeostasis in the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> during perturbation by anodal tDCS can be fuelled by glucose (and lactate) uptake by astrocytes and neurons from the interstitium.</s><s>Subsequent increase in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen due to aerobic energy metabolism might have led to a negative cross-correlation between the 2 HbO time-series and log-transformed mean-power time-course of EEG primarily within 0.5Hz-11.25Hz</s><s>frequency band (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Here, we postulate that the immediate need to fuel recovery of homeostasis was caused by astrocytes via the lactate shuttle <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> while blood glucose supply has a longer delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Although physiologically stimulated increases in glucose and lactate in the brain have been shown to be mediated by different mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, the functional role of potassium dynamics (in addition to calcium wave dynamics [10]) as a homeostatic feedback mechanism should not be discounted since an augmentation of extracellular potassium concentration can cause depolarization of astrocytes, where the glycogen in the brain is localized almost exclusively, leading to glycogen degradation to lactate and a portion transferred to axons as fuel <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, it was hypothesized for Case-1 that the initial (~0-10sec) dip in 2 HbO at the beginning of anodal tDCS (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) and corresponding increase in the log-transformed meanpower within the 0.5Hz-11.25Hz</s><s>frequency band (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) were related to the recovery of homeostasis.</s><s>Interestingly, these alterations lasted longer (12.13±3.81sec</s><s>dip-duration) for Case-1 than other three cases (6.04±3.82sec),</s><s>and only Case-1 complained about headache after tDCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Here, it is known that cerebral blood flow is increased in the brain regions with neural activity via metabolic coupling mechanisms whereas the autoregulation mechanisms ensure that the blood flow is maintained during changes in the perfusion pressure.</s><s>Therefore, this dipduration in 2 HbO at the beginning of anodal tDCS that was captured using Intrinsic Mode Function needs to be carefully investigated in a larger ischemic stroke patient group, for example, with small and large vessel disease to test the hypothesis that patients with small vessel disease are more impaired on neurovascular coupling associated with microcirculatory function than stroke patient with large intracranial artery stenosis.</s><s>Then, the backscattered NIR light can be collected (light collected is usually 7 to 9 orders smaller in magnitude than that emitted at the source <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>) and converted into electrical signal by photodiodes.</s><s>Due to low signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the output signal from the photodiodes, the signal can be band-pass filtered and amplified to increase the SNR.</s><s>A programmable gain amplifier (e.g.</s><s>PGA204, Texas Instruments Inc., USA) can be used to adapt the gain depending on source-detector distance, scalp thickness, and hair color and density <ref type="bibr">[45]</ref> to match the voltage range of the analog input channel of the DAQ device.</s><s>Moreover, integration of EEG to CW NIRS device should not increase the cost significantly since low-noise, 8-Channel, 24-Bit Analog Front-End for EEG measurements are available for $200 (ADS1299EEG-FE, Texas Instruments, USA).</s><s>Furthermore, a low-cost tDCS hardware can be based on a current regulator that sets and stabilizes the current at a fixed level.</s><s>The current can be controlled using a three terminal adjustable current source (LM334Z, Texas Instruments, USA) -featuring 10,000:1 range in operating current, excellent current regulation and a wide dynamic voltage range of 1V to 40V -where the current level was set with one external resistor, i.e., an analog potentiometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sood et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s>Using the EEG-NIRS signals evoked under tDCS, periodogram and autoregressive spectral analysis approaches can be applied for feature extraction <ref type="bibr">[47][48][49]</ref> towards knowledge-based diagnosis using fuzzy modeling and a knowledge based approach to classifier design
