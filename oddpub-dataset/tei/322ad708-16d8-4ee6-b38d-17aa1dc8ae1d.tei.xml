diseases associated with CKD.</s><s>Elevated plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus contribute to the induction of VSMC transdifferentiation which represents an underlying step in the development of vascular calcifications.</s></p><p><s>To screen potential inhibitors of vascular calcification, this transdifferentiation of VSMC can be mimicked or induced in vitro by elevated concentrations of calcium  and phosphorus <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In our experiments, the calcification medium-treated VSMC exhibited strong signs of calcification as demonstrated by enhanced alizarin red staining and elevated calcium contents in VSMC cultures and also elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase in VSMC supernatants.</s><s>All these effects were strongly reduced by cotreatment with LOE.</s><s>This clearly suggests protective effects of LOE on calcification of VSMC.</s><s>On a molecular level, an early step of VSMC transdifferentiation is the upregulation of bone differentiation markers which are commonly used as markers to indicate the phenotypic conversion of VSMC to osteoblast-like cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr"

calcification medium-induced upregulation of osterix and osteocalcin mRNA expression.</s><s>In conjunction with the here shown protective effects of LOE against Ca/P-induced loss of mRNA expressions of -SMA and of SM22, our data indicate that LOE prevents VSMC from calcium-/phosphate-induced transdifferentiation, thereby preventing VSMC calcifications.</s></p><p><s>As previously also shown in other cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, LOE decreased the mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in VSMC.</s><s>Both MMPs were shown to promote vascular calcifications associated with CKD <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>They are believed to induce proteolytic remodelling of the extracellular (vessel) matrix and thereby are supposed to generate biologically active matrix fragments which might amplify the process of VSMC calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>These effects of MMPs on vascular calcification could be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of MMPs <ref

regulation of MMP-production <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> and also VSMC calcification <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>We here show that LOE blocks the Ca/P-induced activation of NF-B in VSMC and also slightly reduces its basal activity.</s><s>On the one hand, this might explain the observed effects of LOE on MMP-mRNA expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and on the other hand might also directly contribute to attenuating effects of LOE on VSMC calcification.</s><s>The latter assumption could be deduced from experiments where the NF-B inhibitor 17-DMAG also directly attenuated Ca/P-induced calcifications of VSMC <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several studies deal with the isolation and structural

our group, we previously isolated and identified the lignan (+)-episesamin in LOE <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study suggests that (+)-episesamin exerts protective effects in VSMC associated cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and is therefore a suitable candidate for further studies in models of vascular calcification.</s></p><p><s>But irrespective of additional, potentially active, components contained in LOE, the extract itself should also be tested in animal models of vascular calcification.</s><s>Herbal extracts often contain several groups of biologically active compounds and it is not always possible to know which compound is responsible for the observed activities.</s><s>In addition, different groups of compounds in
