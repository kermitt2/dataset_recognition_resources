<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Water scarcity is becoming a global issue and severely hindering the development of rural areas.</s><s>Over the past decades, industrialization in developing countries has achieved huge advances, but introduced large amounts of wastewater at the same time, which conversely intensifies the global water scarcity.</s><s>Wastewater reclamation and reuse are thus essential to avoid water shortage and environment pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hou et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Bio-electrochemical systems (BES), such as microbial fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells, have emerged in recent years to directly degrade organic matters in wastewater and produce electricity or clean biofuel (e.g., CH 4 or H 2 ) at the cathode <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lovley, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Katuri et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Though BES could remove more than 80% Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in the synthetic wastewater, the reclaimed effluent still contains substantial amounts of biomass or suspended solids <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang and He, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>In order to reject the biomass/suspended solids and improve the effluent quality, membrane filtration was integrated with BES to jointly work as electrochemical membrane bioreactors (EMBRs), which keep the strengths of both sides and thus have great potential for wastewater treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ozgun et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yuan and He, 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Polymeric membranes, made from nylon <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wang et al., 2011)</ref>, PVDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Li and He, 2015)</ref>, or cellulose <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kim et al., 2015)</ref>, have been proposed as excellent ultra/micro filters for the wastewater treatment in EMBR systems.</s><s>However, due to the electrical insulation of these polymeric membranes, additional metal/carbon electrodes are required in these EMBR systems for electrogenic bacterial colonization and COD removal <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yuan and He, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>To further reduce the cost of materials and the footprint of bioreactors, novel conductive membrane materials, such as carbon-coated stainless-steel mesh <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akamatsu et al., 2010)</ref>, nickel hollow fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Katuri et al., 2014)</ref> and carbon felt <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Zhang et al., 2014)</ref>, have been recently reported and attracted lots of attention due to their dual functions as membranes and cathode electrodes in EMBRs.</s><s>Excellent effluent quality after filtration and COD removal via microbial electrochemical degradation were achieved simultaneously in these EMBR systems, with good amount of energy recovery into biofuels <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Katuri et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Katuri et al., , 2018;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yuan and He, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, long-term and sustainable operation of EMBRs with these dualfunction membrane cathodes remains a challenge, particularly due to membrane bio-fouling issues.</s><s>Both external fouling (i.e., the growth of biofilm) and internal fouling (i.e., adsorption of humic acids and deposition of salts) could prompt the membrane clogging in the long term, which are difficult to avoid in the wastewater treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ho et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Besides, severe biofouling in these EMBR systems will significantly reduce the water filtration flux, leading to the higher transmembrane pressure and energy demands for water filtration <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Katuri et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Werner et al., 2016)</ref>, and thus result in the instability of electrochemical performances <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Malaeb et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Myung et al., 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recently, several in-situ membrane cleaning strategies have been proposed to alleviate the membrane bio-fouling of the dualfunctional membrane cathodes in EMBR systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Huang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Katuri et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>Huang et al. utilized the carbon-based flat sheet as the membrane electrode and applied high electrical field (higher than 2 V/cm) in the EMBR system, which effectively mitigated the membrane bio-fouling problem by introducing H 2 O 2 oxidative compounds at the surface of conductive membrane cathodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Huang et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Werner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Werner et al., 2016</ref>) constructed the EMBR system with the graphenecoated nickel hollow fiber cathode and successfully reduced the bio-clogging via hydrogen bubbling produced at the cathode surface at an applied potential as low as 0.7 V.</s><s>Both approaches have effectively inhibited bio-clogging of the membrane pores and postponed the membrane cleaning cycles.</s><s>However, the follow-up chemical and physical cleaning is yet required for thick biofilm removal on the cathode after long-term EMBR operation.</s><s>To truly inhibit the excessive bacterial growth on the membrane, further modifications are needed for membrane electrode materials to obtain surface antibiotic properties, which may increase the cost for the electrode preparation.</s><s>One possible alternative for the membrane fouling control in EMBR systems is to use copper membranes as EMBR electrodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ho et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>This approach has been demonstrated to work efficiently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Myung et al. (Myung et al., 2018)</ref>, where copper mesh, serving as one kind of fouling-resistant cathodes in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), experienced far less bio-clogging than stainless steel mesh.</s><s>Besides, several studies have reported the excellent conductivity of copper electrodes in BES compared with carbon and other metal materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baudler et al., 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baudler et al., , 2017;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bian et al., 2018)</ref>, which could help enhance the current density and reduce the ohmic loss.</s><s>However, copper-based membrane electrodes and their anti-biofouling performances in the EMBR system were rarely discussed.</s><s>Hence, it's worthwhile to develop dualfunction and conductive copper membrane electrode to test their anti-fouling performance in EMBR systems.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the highly conductive Cu hollow fiber membranes (Cu-HFMs) were prepared by phase-inversion processes, followed by the oxidizing-reductive sintering.</s><s>The preparation conditions for Cu-HFMs with optimal pore size and filtration properties were extensively investigated.</s><s>Cu-HFMs were applied as conductive cathodes, as well as microfiltration (MF) membranes, in the EMBR system.</s><s>To characterize the performances of the Cu-HFM cathode in EMBR, COD removal efficiency, biomass rejection and effluent quality were studied.</s><s>Bio-fouling control and copper corrosion were analyzed to make sure no copper dissolved into the media and bacterial colonization was inhibited on the Cu-HFM surface.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The preparation of Cu-HFMs from discrete copper particles via the established phase-inversion process involves the spinning of hollow fiber precursors (HFPs) and high-temperature oxidizingreductive sintering.</s><s>The robust HFPs made from copper particles sufficiently bind by Polysulfone (PSF) could extend SCHEME 1 | Schematic diagram of the EMBR system used in this study.</s></p><p><s>up to 25 cm long without breaking as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1a</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, all the copper particles were evenly wrapped by the polymeric matrix (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1b</ref>), which served as uniform gaps between copper particles and was burnt to form porous surface during the sintering process.</s><s>In order to obtain the excellent conductivity and the optimal porous structures of Cu-HFMs for microfiltration, the oxidizing-reductive sintering process was extensively studied.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the oxidizing-reductive sintering condition of the Cu-HFM preparation, the TG curves of the Cu HFPs in air and N 2 atmosphere were measured, respectively, from 50 • C to 700 • C. No obvious weight loss was observed below 300 • C, while a sharp decline in sample weight started from 300 • to 550 • C in nitrogen, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.</s><s>The total weight loss was &lt;6 %, which was significantly lower than the polymer content in Cu-HFPs (∼11%).</s><s>This weight loss could be attributed to the pyrolysis of the polymer binder, which forms carbonaceous particles and blocks the pores of Cu-HFMs <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>To completely remove the polymer binders, air flow was selected for the TG combustion during the Cu-HFP sintering process (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>It's obvious to see the sharp weight loss of the samples starting from 300 • C, which illustrates the polymer decomposition in the precursors.</s><s>However, the sample weight notably rebounded at around 350 • C and kept increasing until the temperature reached 600 • C, exhibiting totally different weighttemperature trend in N 2 atmosphere.</s><s>This rebound commonly results from the oxidation of copper particles in air starting from 350 • C <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Zhu et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The weight of the HFPs finally remained constant from 600 • C to 700 • C, achieving a weight increase up to 13% after sintering in air.</s><s>The optimal temperature for complete oxidation of Cu HFPs is expected to reach at least 600 • C.</s></p><p><s>The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was used to detect the crystal structures of the synthesized Cu HFPs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), CuO HFs sintered at 600 • C in air (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) and final Cu HFs reduced at 400 • C with H 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>The Cu HFPs and Cu HFs have the same diffraction peak locations (43.3, 50.4,</s><s>and 74.0 • ), suggesting the same cubic structure of metal Cu (JCPDS: 04-0836).</s><s>However, the diffraction peaks at ca. 35.5, 38.7, and 48.6 • were indexed for CuO HFs, corresponding to the monoclinic structure of CuO (JCPDS: 80-1917).</s><s>When we further investigated the data, it clearly demonstrated that the Cu metal particles in the HFPs could be completely converted to copper oxide at 600 • C in air, which was subsequently reduced to Cu-HFMs with H 2 .</s></p><p><s>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1c,d</ref> illustrate the microstructures of the CuO-HF cross-section after 600 • C sintering in air for 3 h, suggesting the finger-like porous structures could be maintained even after burning out the polymer binders.</s><s>Li et al. <ref type="bibr">(Li et al.</ref>, 2015) reported that different reducing temperatures played a significant role in determining the microstructures of metal hollow fibers and thus affected the physical properties, such as pore sizes, conductivity and filtration performances.</s><s>To reduce CuO to Cu HFs and obtain excellent filtration and conductivity, the reducing temperatures were set at 400 • C, 500 • C, 625 • C and 700 • C, respectively, in H 2 atmosphere.</s><s>The reducing temperature was set higher than 400 • C to make sure the polymer binders were totally removed, and the copper particles were partially fused to form strong bonding between each other, which leads to relatively high mechanical strength.</s></p><p><s>Figures 2a-l display the cross-section and outer surface of the Cu-HFMs reduced at different temperatures, respectively.</s><s>Long finger-like structures are clearly presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e-h</ref> near the outer and inner walls of all the hollow fibers, while spongelike structures are observed in the middle of the hollow fiber walls.</s><s>The different appearance of the fiber structures across the HF wall could be attributed to the rapid solidification of the polymer binders at both inner and outer fiber walls with water coagulant flowing through in the phase-inversion process <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the surface micropores (∼3 µm) formed due to the removal of polymer binders and incomplete sintered Cu particles were well preserved on the hollow fiber outer surface after reduction sintering at 400 • C (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e,i</ref>).</s><s>However, the discrete copper particles reduced at 500 • C could hardly be recognized on the hollow fiber surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2j</ref>), even though the porous structures were still evident at the crosssection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>Since the copper particles on the surface usually undergo a softening and bonding process during the CuO-HF reduction period, increasing the reducing temperature prompts more aggressive fusion and bonding of copper particles, which results in the particle growth and the decrease of the Cu-HF porosity

Since the variation of porosity and sintering temperature always exhibit the opposite trends <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Michielsen et al., 2013)</ref>, it could be expected that the higher sintering temperature always leads to the denser hollow fibers (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2i-l</ref>).</s><s>In contrary to the porosity evolution trend, the bending strength of Cu-HFMs increases with the sintering temperature, from 52 MPa at 400 • C to 76 MPa at 500 • C and then climbing to 124 MPa at 625 • C. The different variation trends of the porosity and mechanical strength could be attributed to the loose structures within the highly porous fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Yang et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>However, it should be noted that the hollow fiber sample possessing high mechanical strength but no desirable porous structure is pointless to serve as MBR membranes, which rules out the possibility to utilize the copper hollow fibers reduced at 700 • C as the EMBR cathode.</s></p><p><s>The permeability of the Cu-HFMs was evaluated by measuring their N 2 gas permeance and water permeability at room temperature.</s><s>The N 2 permeance of the Cu-HFMs was plotted against the corresponding reductive-sintering temperature as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>.</s><s>The largest permeance value is still in the same order of magnitude as previously reported for the stainless steel hollow fiber (∼2 × 10 −4 mol/m 2 s p) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Michielsen et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>As can be seen, the N 2 permeance gradually changed from 1.23 × 10 −4 to 9.11 × 10 −5 mol/m 2 s pa when the sintering temperature increased from 400 • C to 500 • C, and continued to decrease to 1.56 × 10 −5 mol/m 2 s pa for the sample sintered at 625 • C, which is in line with the porosity variation of Cu-HFMs.</s><s>However, a drastic decline in N 2 permeance (1.19 × 10 −9 mol/m 2 s pa) was noticed for the hollow fibers sintered at 700 • C, which was about 14,000 times lower compared to Cu-HFMs sintered at 625 • C. Huge difference here could be mainly attributed to the rare porous structures on the surface of the Cu-HFM reduced at 700 • C in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2l</ref>.</s><s>The pure water permeability exhibited a similar trend to N 2 permeance as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>.</s><s>Cu-HFMs prepared at 400 • C obtained the highest pure water permeability (∼ 8913 LMH/bar) while a water flux of only 227 LMH/bar was achieved for the Cu-HFM sintered at 700 • C, which was a sharp decrease from 5812 LMH/bar for the sample reduced at 625 • C.</s><s>Although the Cu-HFM is not completely gas-tight or water-tight, the low water flux suggests that the Cu-HFMs prepared at 700 • C are not suitable for the water filtration application.</s><s>Considering the temperature required for the complete removal of polymer binders, better electrical conductivity, good permeation and pore size uniformity, we decided to use Cu-HFMs reduced at 625 • C for our EMBR studies.</s></p><p><s>In order to investigate their filtration and anti-biofouling performances, the Cu-HFMs were utilized in EMBR systems as cathode materials and microfiltration membranes.</s><s>The EMBR reactor setup for wastewater reclamation was illustrated in Schematic 1 and detailed information about reactor construction and operation could be found in SI S1.5 and previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Katuri et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Werner et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>After initial cycles of bacterial enrichment, the EMBR with the Cu-HFM cathode produced an average current density of 2.79 ± 0.15 A m −2 at an applied voltage of 0.9 V, which was comparable to the data reported with the similar EMBR configuration, nickel hollow fiber cathode and same applied potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Werner et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The current density stabilized after 20 days of bacterial enrichment as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>, indicating the adaptation of suspended bacterial cells to the copper cathode in EMBR and the possible bacterial colonization on the carbon brush anode.</s><s>After 57 days of the EMBR operation, the current density remained constant without any current leap or plunge, suggesting the stability of the whole system with the Cu-HFM cathode.</s><s>To further illustrate the impacts of copper corrosion on the EMBR performances, the copper ion concentration in the EMBR media was monitored every 4 days during operation.</s><s>From Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, quite clear that the copper concentration never exceeded 25 µg/L in the EMBR media, which exhibited the excellent anticorrosion properties of the Cu-HFM cathode in EMBR system and was far less than the amount required for killing bacterial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bian et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kimber et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s>One point we must mention is that the synthetic wastewater used in our experiment contains copper ions (25.6 µg/L), which served as one trace element for bacterial growth on the anode and in the suspension for COD removal.</s><s>The synthetic wastewater was chosen in this experiment because the same media has been demonstrated to be fine with bacterial growth in other EMBR systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Werner et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Also the copper concentration was much lower compared to the maximum copper concentration value (2 mg/L) for drinking water that the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends <ref type="bibr">(WHO,

microbial electrochemical systems when they set a relatively negative potential on the copper electrodes, which was in line with our experimental results.</s><s>The Cu-HFMs were thus proven to be capable of working normally in EMBR systems for wastewater treatment.</s></p><p><s>The COD concentration in the EMBR system was monitored after around 4 days in each fed-batch cycle and was found to decrease from 320 to 40.6 ± 6.81 mg L −1 , which represented an average of 86.5 ± 2.27% COD removal efficiency as shown in Fig 4a <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>As there were no oxidizing substances dosed in the media, the organic removal could be attributed to the organics-oxidizing bacteria or anodic oxidation.</s><s>However, in the abiotic study, we didn't notice too much changes regarding the COD concentration.</s><s>So the anodic oxidation couldn't be the reason for COD removal.</s><s>The carbon brush bio-anode was thus believed to efficiently remove the COD and exhibit the superior performances of the EMBR system for wastewater treatment similar to other BES systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cusick et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Escapa et al.,
