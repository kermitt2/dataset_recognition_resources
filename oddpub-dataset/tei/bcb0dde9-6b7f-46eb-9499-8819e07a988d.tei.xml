translate into patient benefits as assessed across a range of patient-reported outcomes.</s></p><p><s>The safety profiles of sarilumab and adalimumab monotherapy observed in MONARCH were generally comparable.</s><s>Numerically more patients discontinued with adalimumab because of AEs compared with the sarilumab group.</s><s>The most common AEs associated with sarilumab were neutropenia and injection site erythema (mostly mild to moderate), while headache and exacerbations of RA were more common in the adalimumab group.</s><s>Though neutropenia was more common in the sarilumab group, infection rates were similar between study arms.</s><s>ADA was monitored in the sarilumab group.</s><s>There was no relationship between ADA and discontinuations due to lack of efficacy or with hypersensitivity reactions and all instances were non-neutralising.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the safety and tolerability of sarilumab is consistent across studies <ref type="bibr">24 25</ref> and comparable with therapeutic targeting of the IL-6 pathway. <ref type="bibr">26 27</ref></s><s>In MONARCH, changes in laboratory values in the sarilumab group, including neutropenia, liver transaminases and total cholesterol, were expected class effects.</s><s>While the mechanism of neutropenia remains unclear, studies have shown that blockade of IL-6R does not affect neutrophil function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">34</ref></s><s>This is consistent with MONARCH and previous sarilumab studies, <ref type="bibr">24 25</ref> demonstrating that decreased neutrophil counts were not associated with a concurrent increase in infection rate.</s></p><p><s>In MONARCH, sarilumab monotherapy was associated with lower incidence of ALT elevations compared with previous studies in which sarilumab was administered in combination with csDMARDs. <ref type="bibr">24 25</ref></s><s>Because IL-6 aids in protecting the liver from hepatotoxic agents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">35</ref> IL-6 blockade in combination with MTX, a known hepatotoxicant, may exacerbate the MTX hepatotoxicity observed in some patients. <ref type="bibr">36 37</ref></s><s>ad-to-head trials comparing the efficacy and safety of two different bDMARD monotherapies in a clinically relevant patient population can aid in defining strategies for optimal patient care.</s><s>MONARCH expands on results from ADACTA (NCT01119859), <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">26</ref> showing that blockade of IL-6R is effective in MTX-intolerant patients and in patients with inadequate response to MTX, demonstrating that MTX history does not impact response to therapy.</s><s>While both MONARCH and ADACTA showed superior efficacy versus adalimumab, MONARCH additionally demonstrated improvement in functional outcomes for patients (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, the robust MONARCH results further demonstrate that targeting IL-6R may be a preferred treatment option for patients who use biologics as monotherapy.</s></p><p><s>MONARCH was not without limitations.</s><s>Although sarilumab plus MTX demonstrated superior radiographic results versus placebo plus MTX, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">24</ref> the present study did not evaluate radiographic outcomes after sarilumab monotherapy compared with adalimumab monotherapy.</s><s>Another limitation of this study is that it did not compare the efficacy of sarilumab monotherapy with sarilumab in combination with MTX.</s><s>However, as patients intolerant to MTX were the primary intended target population, it would not be feasible to evaluate the addition of sarilumab to MTX in the context of this study.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, these data demonstrate that sarilumab improves signs and symptoms and functional disability of RA and is an appropriate, effective and superior monotherapy compared with TNF-α inhibition for patients who are unsuitable candidates for continued treatment with MTX due to intolerance or inadequate response.</s></p></div>
