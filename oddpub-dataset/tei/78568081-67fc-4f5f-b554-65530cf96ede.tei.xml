<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Current phenotyping of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) into chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) might not adequately reflect the pathophysiologic diversity within patients with CRS.</s><s>Objective: We sought to identify inflammatory endotypes of CRS.</s><s>Therefore we aimed to cluster patients with CRS based solely on immune markers in a phenotype-free approach.</s><s>Secondarily, we aimed to match clusters to phenotypes.</s><s>Methods: In this multicenter case-control study patients with CRS and control subjects underwent surgery, and tissue was analyzed for IL-5, IFN-g, IL-17A, TNF-a, IL-22, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, eosinophilic cationic protein, myeloperoxidase, TGF-b1, IgE, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin-specific IgE, and albumin.</s><s>We used partition-based clustering.</s><s>Results: Clustering of 173 cases resulted in 10 clusters, of which 4 clusters with low or undetectable IL-5, eosinophilic cationic protein, IgE, and albumin concentrations, and 6 clusters with high concentrations of those markers.</s><s>The group of IL-5negative clusters, 3 clusters clinically resembled a predominant chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) phenotype without increased asthma prevalence, and 1 cluster had a T H 17 profile and had mixed CRSsNP/CRSwNP.</s><s>The IL-5-positive clusters were divided into a group with moderate IL-5 concentrations, a mixed CRSsNP/CRSwNP and increased asthma phenotype, and a group with high IL-5 levels, an almost exclusive nasal polyp phenotype with strongly increased asthma prevalence.</s><s>In the latter group, 2 clusters demonstrated the highest concentrations of IgE and asthma prevalence, with all samples expressing Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin-specific IgE.</s><s>Conclusion: Distinct CRS clusters with diverse inflammatory mechanisms largely correlated with phenotypes and further differentiated them and provided a more accurate description of the inflammatory mechanisms involved than phenotype information only.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient population</head><p><s>Patients with CRS (defined by EPOS criteria [European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps] based on symptoms and results of nasal endoscopy and computed tomography of the sinuses 3 ) were included as cases, and subjects undergoing inferior turbinate surgery with no signs of CRS were included as control subjects.</s><s>Excluded were subjects with an acute exacerbation of rhinosinusitis 2 weeks before inclusion, subjects with immunodeficiencies, subjects with cystic fibrosis, and subjects who used oral or nasal steroids in the 4 weeks preceding surgery or antileukotrienes in the 2 weeks before inclusion.</s><s>In total, 917 subjects were recruited, of whom there were 682 cases (65% with CRSwNP) and 187 control subjects.</s><s>Subjects underwent a standardized skin prick test <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and were registered as asthmatic based on a clinical diagnosis.</s><s>Patients were considered allergic on clinical grounds (positive skin prick test or provocation test results or specific IgE levels to inhalant allergens plus allergy symptoms present).</s></p><p><s>At a maximum of 12 months after inclusion, a portion of the subjects underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery, and control subjects underwent partial inferior turbinotomy during septal surgery (226 patients with CRS and 106 control subjects).</s><s>Control subjects with allergic rhinitis were not excluded.</s><s>The indications for surgery and its procedures were based on clinical decisions independent from participation in the study.</s><s>Tissue was collected from nasal polyps or sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and from the inferior turbinates in control subjects.</s><s>Tissue was separated from bone fragments, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 2808C.</s><s>Control tissues were not used in cluster analyses of the patients with CRS but solely served to determine normal values.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurement of inflammatory markers</head><p><s>For tissue analysis, we selected 14 markers (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>) based on earlier publications; those markers reflect the inflammatory patterns observed in patients with CRSsNP and patients with CRSwNP.</s><s>Only subjects for whom there was an adequate amount of tissue that was needed for these analyses (typically 0.15 g) were included.</s><s>Briefly, as described before, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> each 0.1 g of tissue was diluted in 1 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), homogenized at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, and centrifuged at 1500g for 10 minutes at 48C.</s><s>Concentrations of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), total IgE, and IgE specific to a mixture of S aureus enterotoxins (staphylococcal enterotoxins A and C and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1) were assayed by using the UniCAP system (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden).</s><s>Concentrations of IL-22, IFN-g, and TGF-b1 were assayed by using commercially available ELISA kits from R&amp;D systems (Minneapolis, Minn).</s><s>Myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentrations were measured with a commercially available ELISA from BioCheck (Foster City, Calif).</s><s>For albumin, we used kits from AssayPro (St Charles, Mo).</s><s>Concentrations of IL-1b, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, and TNF-a were assayed with the Luminex 100 system (Luminex, Austin, Tex).</s></p><p><s>Concentrations in tissue homogenates were expressed as mass versus volume after multiplication by a homogenization dilution factor of 11.</s><s>Values of less than the limit of detection were considered negative for categorical analysis and given a value equal to half of the detection limit for continuous analysis.</s></p></div>

clinical characteristics (phenotypes).</s><s>In this cohort of European subjects who underwent surgery for CRS, we observed considerable data variability, so that multiple homogeneous subgroups (clusters) could be differentiated.</s><s>This observation indicates that CRS is not a homogeneous inflammatory disease and that endotypes are present with a wide diversity of inflammatory profiles.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the existence of inflammatory endotypes within CRS unbiased by phenotype data.</s><s>Furthermore, we demonstrated that the newly defined endotypes mirror clinical phenotypes, supporting their clinical relevance.</s></p><p><s>To determine which parameters were relevant in the generation of this diversity, principal component analysis and clustering of variables showed that diversity in our samples was driven by 5 groups of related cytokines: (1) markers of eosinophilic, T H 2-driven inflammation and antibody production (ECP, IL-5, IgE, and SE-IgE) together with albumin; (2) neutrophilic and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and MPO);</s></p><p><s>(3) T H 17-or T H 22-related markers (IL-17A, IL-22, and TNF-a); and (4) the T H 1 marker IFN-g.</s><s>Moreover, TGF-b1 had a separate but small contribution to variability in our subjects.</s></p><p><s>These observations have previously been made, although in specific CRS subgroups.</s><s>The correlations of ECP, IL-5, and IgE levels confirm previous data in white patients with nasal polyps, in whom inflammation is dominated by activated  Concentration

in the CRSsNP and CRSwNP subgroups yielded similar principal components (data not shown), indicating that even in lower concentration ranges, concentration gradients of cytokines are present and meaningful.</s><s>These findings indicate that CRS is not a dichotomous or 1-dimensional linear spectrum of diseases but rather multidimensional, with different polarizations on the main inflammatory axes.</s></p><p><s>When patients were clustered into inflammatory endotypes, our analysis resulted in 10 clusters of which each cytokine pattern was interpreted, and accordingly, clusters could be grouped together (summarized in Fig 4).</s><s>To characterize each cluster's phenotype, we correlated clusters with selected phenotype parameters, such as nasal polyp prevalence and asthma comorbidity.</s><s>Importantly, this was a post hoc analysis, and the phenotype information was not used during cluster analysis.</s></p><p><s>We show a strong correlation with phenotype, with 3 clusters composed almost exclusively of patients with CRSsNP without asthma comorbidity and 3 clusters composed almost exclusively of patients with CRSwNP with strongly increased asthma prevalence.</s><s>The presence of IL-5 remains the paramount factor dictating the phenotype with nasal polyps and asthma, which is in line with previous evidence. <ref type="bibr"

moderately increased albumin levels, although each of these clusters had a distinct inflammatory profile.</s><s>Three of these clusters had moderate increase in IL-5 concentrations and an eosinophilic pattern but differed in terms of IFN-g and TNF-a expression.</s><s>This could indicate that IL-5 is not the only key to edema and polyp formation for some groups and that unmeasured factors might play a role in differentiation toward a polyp.</s><s>Our study was limited to the major cytokines, and the amount of tissue available precluded further analyses.</s><s>Also, subjects were allocated to a phenotype during office-based endoscopy before surgery, and the clinical differentiation might be unclear in some cases in which polyps were only observed during surgery.</s><s>In cases of middle turbinate-confined polypoid edema, the phenotype might not be clear cut during office-based endoscopy, as it has been shown that early-stage nasal polyps already show eosinophilic inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>Furthermore, this overlap might be inherent to the concept of phenotype, which, as has been shown in asthma phenotyping, does not provide adequate insight into the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>ithin the non-T H 2 group, inflammation is variable, from completely absent to broad and involves T H 1, T H 17, or T H 22. The role for T H 1 cells in only some of the IL-5-negative subjects contrasts with earlier findings showing increased levels of IFN-g protein and mRNA in patients with CRSsNP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>However, this could be explained by the averaging effect of former analytic approaches.</s><s>One of the overlapping clusters (cluster 4) had no eosinophils or IL-5 and, in contrast, had a T H 17 neutrophil-type inflammation.</s><s>It is possible that this endotype is the same as what has been observed before in Chinese patients with nasal polyps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Interestingly, it was recently shown that secondgeneration Asian patients with CRSwNP in the United States had a higher rate of noneosinophilic polyps than white patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>nfortunately, we had no ancestry information in our study to further analyze this relationship.</s></p><p><s>Production of the T H 17 family-derived cytokines IL-17A and IL-22 correlated modestly, as shown by using principal component analysis.</s><s>Reasons for this modest correlation are apparent when analyzing the cluster profiles; in clusters 4 and 8 IL-17A production was paired with increased IL-22 production, whereas in clusters 2 and 7 only increased IL-22 production was present, possibly indicating T H 22 involvement in these clusters.</s><s>Interestingly, in cluster 10, which was an SE-IgEpositive cluster, increased IL-22 production was paired with only marginal IL-17A production, indicating a T H 22 involvement that was also observed to be induced by staphylococcal enterotoxins in patients with atopic dermatitis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>Additionally, we observed increased TNF-a levels in all of these clusters, which is consistent with the observation that both T H 17 and T H 22 cells can induce TNF-a production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>However, IL-22 concentrations did not differ from those of control subjects, and this effect remained after excluding allergic control subjects (data not shown).</s><s>The reasons for this discrepancy with the coherent between-cluster differences as previously described are not clear, and the relevance of T H 22 cells in the pathology of CRS should be further elucidated.</s><s>Surprisingly, we found little contribution of TGF-b1 to the variability of our data; the TGF-b1 concentration had no significant between-cluster differences and did not differ between clusters and the control group.</s><s>Previously, expression of TGF-b signaling was found to be increased in white patients with CRSsNP, sharply contrasting to a decreased signaling in patients with CRSwNP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>These findings were later confirmed in Chinese patients with CRS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> although these are characterized by different T effector cell profiles than their white counterparts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>In our study patients with CRSsNP were confirmed to have increased TGF-b1 concentrations compared with patients with CRSwNP and control subjects (P &lt; .001,</s><s>data not shown).</s><s>However, we did not have adequate amounts of tissue to further analyze remodeling patterns and regulatory T-cell involvement.</s><s>Taken together, these findings might indicate that remodeling is strongly correlated with the phenotype (fibrosis vs edema formation), irrespective of the inflammatory endotype.</s><s>Some of the broad characteristics of this clustering are found in a previous cluster analysis by Nakayama et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> who proposed a clustering in which nasal polyp scores and tissue eosinophilia mainly determined the phenotype.</s><s>Interestingly, in a recent cluster analysis of patients with CRS focusing on symptoms and clinical information, rate of nasal polyposis did not differ between phenotypes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>However, these approaches are inherently different from our study because we based our cluster analysis solely on inflammatory mediators to obtain endotypes, and we compared these with selected phenotype parameters, such as nasal polyp prevalence and asthma comorbidity, only in a post hoc analysis.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some limitations.</s><s>Our definition of endotypes was entirely based on inflammatory biomarkers.</s><s>However, for asthma, it is proposed that more parameters, such as clinical characteristics, genetics, and treatment responses, should be included for the definition of an endotype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>We aimed to propose ''inflammatory endotypes,'' and further studies are needed that incorporate clinical characteristics, genetics, remodeling parameters, and treatment responses to further define these endotypes.</s><s>Some of these endotypes might eventually be merged or split with other endotypes given these additional studies.</s></p><p><s>The use of cluster analysis is potentially a limiting factor in this study.</s><s>Because cluster analysis is not an inferential statistical technique, there is no probability calculated.</s><s>The technique generates multiple possible solutions in terms of a number of clusters, from which the most relevant solution is selected by the examiner.</s><s>To scrutinize this process, the selection of the best number of clusters was based on objective criteria, such as the Hubert-Levine index as a measure of internal cluster validity and bootstrap resampling of the cluster analysis.</s><s>Even though all these measures resulted in a certain optimal number of clusters, it is not our aim to claim a final definite classification in which all patients with CRS should be categorized but instead illustrate the diversity in inflammatory profiles.</s></p><p><s>The inflammatory profiles of asthmatic patients have been found to evolve over time within subjects.</s><s>Because we only analyzed our subjects at 1 time point, possible variability of the inflammatory endotype over time limits our findings.</s><s>Indeed, when comparing the profiles of patients with nasal polyps undergoing 2 surgeries because of disease recurrence, it has been found that all nasal polyps remained IL-5 positive over an average period of 5 years; however, in some patients IL-17 was coexpressed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>To determine the clinical and therapeutic utility of the inflammatory endotypes, further longitudinal studies are needed, evaluating their stability over time in relation to possible treatment and environmental changes.</s></p><p><s>The applicability of our study, which was done in a European population, to other regions in the world remains at question as well.</s><s>For example, the high smoking prevalence in our study was comparable with the European average, but lower smoking prevalences in North America might affect the inflammatory endotype.</s><s>Other lifestyle and environmental factors might affect the endotype, and global studies are needed to address these.</s><s>Furthermore, our choice of biomarkers did not cover remodeling parameters, and we have not included cellular contents.</s><s>However, the current analysis enables appreciation of the possible target groups for various therapeutic mAbs currently under study.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have identified distinct inflammatory endotypes within patients with CRS, which largely correlated with phenotypes and further differentiated them.</s><s>Endotypes clearly provide a more accurate description of the inflammatory mechanisms involved than phenotype only, and inflammation in patients with CRS might be more diverse than previously assumed.</s><s>CRS-related inflammation should be considered multidimensionally heterogeneous on the T H 1, T H 2, T H 17, eosinophilic/neutrophilic, proinflammatory, superantigen, and possibly T H 22 axes.</s><s>Inflammatory endotypes might be of importance for the prognosis of comorbid asthma development or disease recurrence after surgery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Because recent mAb approaches, such as omalizumab, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> mepolizumab, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> or dupilumab, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> target specific cytokines or pathways, it is expected that an approach based on biomarker-defined clusters would identify responders to these drugs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>For example, nasal levels of IL-5 were found to predict responders to reslizumab, an anti-IL-5 mAb. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>However, the clinical applicability of inflammatory endotypes would be aided by the availability of noninvasive serum or nasal secretion markers;
