determined by flow cytometric analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref>.</s><s>In a proportion of biopsies of psoriatic lesions, PAI-1 was found to be present by immunohistochemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40]</ref>.</s><s>Plasma levels of PAI-1 were significantly elevated in psoriatic patients and effectively diminished by treatment with a TNF-a inhibitor, but they were not reduced by UVB treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42]</ref>.</s><s>Snail and Slug are transcription factors, and both are key mediators of EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44]</ref>.</s><s>To our knowledge, there are no data on the expression of N-cad, Snail and Slug in psoriasis.</s><s>Our study demonstrates the expression of Vim, FN, PAI-1, N-cad, Snail and Slug in psoriatic epidermal keratainocytes, determined by immunohistochemistry, RNAseq, qRT-PCR or Western blot at mRNA and protein levels.</s><s>Moreover, Vim, FN, PAI-1 and Slug were significantly increased.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, there are increased mesenchymal markers and few differences in the expression of epithelial markers in psoriatic keratinocytes.</s><s>Together with the morphological changes in psoriatic epidermis, such as spindle-like keratinocytes found in the upper stratum of spinous layer, remaining granular layer and stratum corneum, it is reasonable to conceive that psoriatic epidermal keratinocytes may experience a partial EMT.</s></p><p><s>There are three types of EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Type 1 EMT gives rise to the mesoderm and endoderm, and to mobile neural crest cells.</s><s>Type 2 EMT is associated with wound healing, tissue regeneration and organ fibrosis.</s><s>Type 3 EMT is secondary epithelialization associated with cancer cells, and enables invasion and metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Psoriasis resembles tissue regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref>, and therefore EMT in psoriatic keratinocytes may be defined as type 2 EMT.</s><s>Colocalization of these two sets of epithelial and mesenchymal markers defines an intermediate phenotype of EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Our study has shown that both epithelial markers and mesenchymal markers are detected in psoriatic keratinocytes, which indicates that psoriatic epidermal keratinocytes have passed only partly through an EMT, and this transition is incomplete.</s><s>Therefore, the EMT in psoriatic keratinocytes may be defined as an intermediate phenotype of type 2 EMT.</s></p><p><s>Next, we investigated the regulation of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in psoriatic keratinocytes.</s><s>It is well known that TGF-b has been characterized as a paradigm for analyses of EMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47]</ref>.</s><s>Previous reports have shown that IL-17A, TNF-a or IL-8 alone or synergized with TGF-b1 promotes EMT in different cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53]</ref>.</s><s>IL-13 promotes the expression of genes associated with cell invasion in HT29 intestinal epithelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the roles of these cytokines were conducted in psoriatic keratinocytes.</s><s>IL-17A strongly decreases expression of K10, Vim and FN.</s><s>TNF-a clearly downregulates K10 and Slug but upregulates K16 and FN.</s><s>Evidently, TGF-b1 promotes the production of N-cad, Vim, FN and PAI-1.</s><s>In addition, IL-13 decreases K10, Vim and especially FN.</s><s>No obvious effect of IL-8 was observed, except for the decrease of Snail.</s><s>Thus, one may conclude that IL-17A and IL-13 are negative regulators, whereas TGF-b1 is an enhancer for EMT in psoriatic keratinocytes.</s><s>The effect of TNF-a may be pluripotent; additional data should be obtained to establish its role.</s><s>These results are partly in accordance with the published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref>.</s><s>Herein, the role of cytokines in regulating EMT may be determined not only by their actions; the unique characteristics of the cells are also critical.</s></p><p><s>TGF-b induces EMT through its TGF-b receptors and the activation of the Smad signalling pathway, as well as non-Smad signalling cascades including MAPK/ERK, Rhofamily of GTPases and PI3 K/Akt <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">56]</ref>.</s><s>Our findings show that silencing of ERK partially increases E-cad and K16, but remarkably inhibits FN, Vim, b-catenin, Slug and a5 integrin.</s><s>Therefore, ERK plays an active role in the process of EMT.</s><s>In line with our observations, other authors have shown that the ERK pathway is required for EMT and contributes to the maintenance of an undifferentiated/ mesenchymal state in tumour cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Topical glucocorticoid is one of the most commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs in psoriasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Dex plays a protective role in preventing EMT in HK-2 cells and human peritoneal mesothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">61]</ref>, by inhibiting GSK-3b phosphorylation and by Snail upregulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[61]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway in Schlemm's canal endothelial cells contributes to the mechanism of Dex-induced changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[62]</ref>.</s><s>Dex may also play a protective role in EMT in psoriatic keratinocytes partly through inducing E-cad and inhibiting Slug protein.</s><s>On the other hand, suppression of Rho and GSK3 strongly increases E-cad, b-catenin and Slug.</s><s>It seems that there is an inverse correlation between the activity of Rho and GSK3, and expression of Slug and E-cad at the protein level in psoriatic keratinocytes.</s><s>The identical increase of epithelial and mesenchymal markers by the above-mentioned inhibitors is paradoxical, as Slug can repress E-cadherin transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[63]</ref>.</s><s>As previously reported, inhibition of Rho by Y27632 upregulated the E-cad expression in silica-stimulated rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org Open Biol.</s><s>5: 150032 bronchial epithelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, but decreased Slug promoter activity in human ovarian cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[64]</ref>.</s><s>The inverse correlation between the GSK3 activity and Slug protein levels was also observed in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (CL1 -5).</s><s>Activation of GSK3b made a conspicuous decrease in Slug protein levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[65]</ref>.</s><s>GSK3 may in turn regulate the expression of Slug <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[65]</ref>.</s><s>However, John et al. have reported that GSK3b inhibition is associated with the decreased expression of Slug and N-cadherin in melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[66]</ref>.</s><s>These discrepancies may lead to the possibility that Rho and GSK3 may act depending on the cell type.</s><s>Meanwhile, compared with the controls, Dex does not change Y27632-mediated enhancement of E-cad and Slug, but decreases Y27632-mediated increase of b-catenin and further suppresses Y27632mediated decrease of K14.</s><s>High dosage of Dex (2.0 mM) inhibits SB216763-regulated E-cad, b-catenin and Slug.</s><s>Therefore, Dex may regulate the levels of some proteins through the Rho and GSK3 pathways.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our investigations provide support for defining EMT in psoriatic epidermal keratinocytes as an intermediate phenotype of type 2 EMT characterized by upregulation of Vim, FN and PAI-1, with no changes in the expression of E-cad, K10 and K14.</s><s>In the EMT process in psoriatic keratinocytes, IL-17A, IL-13 and TGF-b1 are important regulators, and ERK, Rho and GSK3 play important roles.</s><s>Additionally, Dex plays a protective role.</s><s>Although the detailed mechanistic role remains largely unknown, the current study clearly highlights the potential target for clinical treatment of psoriasis.</s><s>For better
