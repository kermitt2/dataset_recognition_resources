[ 67 Ga]citrate, which showed a gradual accumulation into cage fluids during 12 h, was discriminative for infection from 48 to Introduction B acterial infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.</s><s>The accurate diagnosis of infection (or its exclusion) is the first crucial step in the management of these patients.</s><s>Imaging techniques constitute a non-invasive and attractive approach that, in the last decades, has gained on importance by combining visualization of radiopharmaceuticals and morphological imaging, with positron emission tomography/X-ray computed tomography (CT) and single photon emission computed tomography/CT imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>In various types of infections,

antimicrobial peptides (29-31 UBI, human beta-defensin-3), cytokines (IL-8), 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose, growth factors and bacteriophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref

bacteria or fungi.</s><s>In bacteria, Cbl catalyses transmethylation and rearrangement reactions by binding to Cbl-dependent enzyme isoforms, directly or indirectly responsible for the synthesis of ATP, amino acids and nucleotides <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Comparative genomic analysis revealed a wide distribution of genetic elements involved in the regulation or uptake of Cbl derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Cbl transport systems were studied mainly in enteric bacteria.</s><s>Especially, the Escherichia coli Cbl uptake is mediated by an external membrane transporter (BtuB, TonB-dependent), which transfer Cbl to a periplasmatic protein (BtuF) and finally across the inner membrane (BtuCD, ABC ATP-dependent) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Gram-positive bacteria, as Staphylococcus aureus, do not have an outer membrane, and thus completely lack the BtuB carrier.</s><s>However, element analogues to the E. coli BtuCD inner membrane transporter were reported in S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, and described as less specific carriers of Cbl, and closely related molecules as heme and siderophores <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The latter findings supported previous in vitro studies of [ 57 Co]Cbl uptake mechanism, which reported high avidity of binding to several pathogen bacteria in different culture conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The distinctive uptake mechanism in bacterial and animal cells may represent the basis for development of radiolabeled Cbl derivatives for specific targeting of bacterial infections and for reduced systemic accumulation in vivo.</s><s>Cbl distributes through the blood circulation upon binding to the transport protein transcobalamin II (TC II).</s><s>The Cbl-TC II complex is rapidly internalized through binding to the transcobalamin II receptor (RTC II) and megalin receptor, mainly expressed in humans in the kidneys, liver, intestine lumen, glands and absorptive epithelia <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>A second family of proteins, transcobalamin I (TC I or haptocorrins, or R-type Cbl binders), binds free Cbl and cobinamides in the blood.</s><s>The TC I protein family was mainly found in secondary granules of granulocytes and in salivary glands, and its release has a protective function of reducing pathogen colonization and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A [ 57 Co]Cbl oral formulation was initially developed and used in humans for diagnosis of vitamin B 12 malabsorption syndromes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>A similar intravenous formulation showed potential targeting of tumour cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>However, the long half-life of the isotope [ 57 Co]Cbl, together with its systemic non-specific accumulation and persistence in several organs, limited the maximal injectable dose to 1 μCi.</s><s>This dose limit prohibits the use of [ 57 Co]Cbl for imaging purposes.</s><s>Therefore, vitamin B 12 analogues were synthesized and labelled with isotopes such as In-111 and Tc-99m.</s><s>An In-111 labelled Cbl derivative, diethylenetriamine-pentaacetate adenosylcobalamin ([ 111 In]DAC), showed promising results for the diagnosis of various malignancies.</s><s>Interestingly, in the same study, [ 111 In]DAC derivative accumulated in the right wrist of one patient, who was diagnosed a staphylococcal septic arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>However, the high unspecific accumulation of the [ 111 In]DAC in non-target tissues made this radiopharmaceutical inappropriate for routine clinical application.</s></p><p><s>The Cbl derivative [ 99m Tc]PAMA(4)-Cbl has been recently developed and tested for imaging of malignancies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</s><s>This conjugate carries mono-anionic ligands with a NNO donor set and can be efficiently labelled with [[ 99m Tc](OH 2 ) 3 (CO) 3 ] + at yields 995 % under mild conditions (50 °C, 60 min) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, [ 99m Tc]PAMA (4)-Cbl has abolished binding to the major Cbl transport protein TC II.</s><s>As a consequence, significantly lower uptake in non-targeted tissue and organs was demonstrated in mice bearing different tumour types.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we evaluated the potential of [ 99m Tc] PAMA(4)-Cbl for specific targeting E. coli and S. aureus in vitro and in a cage model of foreign body infection in mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) <ref

investigating pathophysiology and treatment efficacy of implant-associated infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</s><s>The kinetics and histology of the infected cage closely resemble a human infection of prosthesis with bacteria adherent to the foreign body, infiltration of

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In vitro studies demonstrated that the binding of [ 57 Co]Cbl is specific and displaceable by excess of unlabelled Cbl.</s><s>Higher binding avidity was measured for the E. coli, rather than the S. aureus strain.</s><s>When E. coli and S. aureus cultures were pre-exposed to [ 57 Co]Cbl, only small fractions of the bound agent could be displaced by unlabeled Cbl, indicating fast internalization.</s><s>In agreement with an energy-dependent uptake mechanism, the internalized fractions were higher at 37 than at 4 °C, and they were exclusively measured in viable bacteria.</s></p><p><s>The in vitro binding of [ 99m Tc]PAMA(4)-Cbl derivative to E. coli was significantly lower for [ 57 Co]Cbl.</s><s>Indeed, the technetium chelator of [ 99m Tc]PAMA(4)-Cbl is linked to the bacid of the corrin ring A, a functional group involved in hydrogen bonds with the amine groups of Leucin and Alanin residues in the BtuB binding pocket, the E. coli outer membrane transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, binding of [ 99m Tc]PAMA(4)-Cbl to S. aureus was specific, and only slightly lower than [ 57 Co]Cbl.</s><s>The S. aureus receptor mediating Cbl uptake is evidently less affected by Cbl modifications than the E. coli outer membrane transporter BtuB.</s></p><p><s>In animal studies, [ 99m Tc]PAMA(4)-Cbl showed a fast penetration into all cages, followed by a slower release in infected cages than in sterile ones.</s><s>The retention of this radiopharmaceutical into infected fluids became significantly higher at 4 h p.i. for S. aureus-infected mice and at 8 h p.i. for E. coli-infected mice, which is in accordance with a lower receptor affinity of PAMA(4)-Cbl for E. coli BtuB receptors.</s><s>The uptake measured in cage fluid of infected animals was also significantly higher for [ 99m Tc]PAMA(4)-Cbl than for the non-specific radiopharmaceutical [ 99m Tc] DTPA.</s><s>This finding supports a specific interaction of [ 99m Tc]PAMA(4)-Cbl with the colonizing bacteria, rather than a non-specific retention due to the morphological differences between infected and sterile cage fluids.</s></p><p><s>Differently, [ 57 Co]Cbl and by [ 67 Ga]citrate had a slow kinetic of penetration into both infected and sterile cages, explained by their high plasma protein binding and long persistence in blood and organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38]</ref>.</s><s>[ 57 Co]Cbl was only partially cleared from sterile cages even after 72 h p.i. Significantly higher retention in sterile mice could be observed in cages infected with E. coli at 72 h.</s><s>The latter result is in accordance to the higher [ 57 Co]Cbl binding measured in vitro to E. coli than to S. aureus.</s></p><p><s>The mechanism of the [ 67 Ga]citrate accumulation at infection/inflammation site is associated to the Ga (III) binding to transferrin, lactoferrin and other inflammatory proteins in inflamed sites, internalization into the cells with active metabolic pathway as citrate for citric acid cycle and presumable binding to bacterial siderophores <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.</s><s>In our studies, [ 67 Ga]citrate discriminated between infected and sterile cages from 48 h after injection.</s><s>The retention of the radiopharmaceutical observed in the bone, kidneys, liver and spleen is in accordance with data from previous publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our cage infection studies, radiopharmaceutical accumulation was several times higher in the cage fluid than in the tissue surrounding explanted cages.</s><s>While explanted cages contain residues of clotted tissue and cage-adherent bacteria in a stationary growth phase, the cage fluid represents the active infection site with replicating bacteria in the planktonic growth phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, in the tissue cage mouse model of infection, cage fluids, rather than explanted cages, may represent a better sample for evaluation of radiopharmaceuticals targeting infection.</s></p></div>
