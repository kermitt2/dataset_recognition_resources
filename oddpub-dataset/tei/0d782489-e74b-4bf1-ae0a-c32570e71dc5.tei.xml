thus, the observed patterns should not have been affected greatly by this limitation.</s><s>In addition, reasons for STP or any other use were not solicited in a proactive, mandatory fashion, which precluded analysis of pnfC1-INH efficacy for STP for specific types of procedures or events or timing of administration relative to the prophylaxis event.</s><s>Despite these limitations, data from this large, international registry suggest that pnfC1-INH is effective and safe when used for STP in patients with HAE.</s><s>A possible dose-response phenomenon was observed with regard to the rate of HAE attacks after infusion of pnfC1-INH for STP.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>, according to weight-based dosing (Fig 1A) and absolute pnfC1-INH dose (Fig 1B).</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
