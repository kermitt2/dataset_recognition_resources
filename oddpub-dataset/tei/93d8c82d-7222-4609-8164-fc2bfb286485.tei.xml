<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Bleeding and platelet disorders (BPD) are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases caused by abnormalities of coagulation factors, platelets or blood vessel walls.</s><s>Although in most cases the major clinical feature is abnormal bleeding, BPD are frequently associated with phenotypes in other organ systems, particularly the immune system (for example, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS, ORPHA906)), skeleton (for example, Thrombocytopenia with Absent Radius syndrome (ORPHA3320)), eye (for example, Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS, ORPHA79430)) and kidney (for example, MYH9-related disorder (MYH9-RD, ORPHA182050)).</s><s>BPD may be inherited as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X-linked, or complex traits.</s><s>Collectively, BPD represent a significant diagnostic and management challenge to health care systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Diagnosis of BPD currently requires clinical evaluation, then tests such as coagulation factor activity and platelet function assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>However, for mild BPD, this enables diagnosis to the level of a defective coagulation factor or a platelet pathway in only 40% to 60% of cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>The proportion of cases with BPD that receive genetic diagnosis is even lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, partly because the genetic basis of most BPD remains unknown, particularly for prevalent sub-groups such as platelet secretion defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Even for BPD with a known genetic basis, diagnosis may not be possible if phenotype tests are insufficiently specific to point towards relevant genes.</s><s>Moreover, many BPD with causal variants in the same gene are clinically heterogeneous, as illustrated by MYH9-RD in which macrothrombocytopenia is a consistent feature, but neutrophil DÃ¶hle-like inclusions, renal impairment, deafness and cataracts are variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>High throughput sequencing (HTS) has the potential to circumvent these limitations by providing a diagnostic tool for genetic diagnosis and by enabling gene discovery to increase the repertoire of disorders for which genetic diagnosis is possible.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of large case collections recruited through consortia of investigators and technologies such as HTS assist discovery of rare BPD genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>However, gene discovery additionally requires analysis of shared data through systematic phenotype coding to identify similarities between unrelated cases.</s><s>Phenotype coding also facilitates creation of clinical registries, genotype-phenotype databases and biobanks.</s><s>Examples of coding systems include the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which provides a

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Heritable BPD are individually rare but collectively common diseases that have heterogeneous clinical characteristics.</s><s>This clinical complexity, genetic heterogeneity and the large number of candidate genes for BPD has previously hampered gene discovery.</s><s>In this exploratory Stage 1 of the BRIDGE-BPD study, we first enhanced HPO terminology to enable standardized annotation of the phenotypes of BPD cases.</s><s>After enrolling the largest collection of BPD cases reported to date, we demonstrated that HPO annotation enabled the characterisation of clusters of BPD cases with similar phenotypes, which we hypothesise have causal genetic variants in the same or related genes.</s><s>The use of HPO to facilitate research within neurogenetics by comparing standard database descriptions of diseases has been described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, this is the first report of the application of HPO to characterise individual case phenotypes and to aid gene discovery through statistical cluster analysis.</s></p><p><s>The complex clinical characteristics of the 648 index cases in the Stage 1 BRIDGE-BPD study reflect our desire to enrol a comprehensive collection of cases with different subgroups of disorders within BPD, including bleeding of unknown origin.</s><s>Previously reported collections have  comprised BPD cases without prior investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> and collections linked by similar phenotypes such as abnormal platelet number <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, platelet function <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> or von Willebrand disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the BRIDGE-BPD collection is unique in its size and diversity.</s><s>In common with previous collections, the BRIDGE-BPD cases were predominantly females, who experienced more bleeding symptoms than males because of obstetric and heavy menstrual bleeding.</s><s>There was marked heterogeneity in PLT, MPV, platelet morphology, and particularly in LTA platelet function test results, highlighting the diversity of heritable platelet function disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A striking finding from the Stage 1 BRIDGE-BPD study was that a median of 7.5 HPO terms were required to annotate the phenotype of each case.</s><s>These comprised at least one term from 'abnormality of blood and bloodforming tissue', reflecting the study inclusion criteria.</s><s>However, 60% of cases also had HPO terms reflecting abnormality in other organ systems, even after removing overlapping terms.</s><s>We also observed a statistically significant difference in the frequency of five haematological HPO terms in cases with a nervous system abnormality compared to other cases (P = 0.001) reflecting more frequent platelet function and morphology defects.</s><s>This is consistent with the existing literature indicating that neurological and platelet function disorders often coincide <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>The statistically significant difference in the frequency of the five haematological HPO terms between cases with abnormal growth and those without (P = 8.12 Ã 10 -6 ) arose because of enrolment of a group of cases with growth defects at a single centre.</s><s>One potential criticism of Stage 1 of the BRIDGE-BPD study is that cases were recruited from some centres with highly specialist interests, which may reduce the wider applicability of the study findings.</s><s>This effect is illustrated by our finding of phenotypic associations between haematological terms and both growth and neurological terms arising from the specialist practice at the University of Leuven.</s><s>However, this effect is partially offset by recruitment from the UK enrolment centres which are more typical tertiary referral centres, and will not occur in subsequent stages of the BRIDGE-BPD project which will recruit more widely.</s></p><p><s>A further unique attribute of the BRIDGE-BPD methodology is that it enables calculation of the closeness between groups of HPO terms annotated to different cases.</s><s>This provides a measure of phenotypic similarity between cases and enables the definition of case subgroups to assist the analysis of genotype data.</s><s>We have provided proof of principle of this approach by demonstrating low P values for phenotypic similarity between BPD cases from the same pedigrees and between unrelated cases with provisional clinical diagnoses of syndromic BPD, in which both groups are likely to share a causal genetic variant.</s><s>This included examples with known candidate genes (HPS and WAS) and with unknown genes (Gorham-Stout and Roifman syndromes, pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib).</s></p><p><s>We also evaluated phenotype similarity in groups of cases sharing a rare coding variant in the same gene.</s><s>The most significantly similar group corresponded to cases harbouring variants in ACTN1.</s><s>Although this particular association could be found through traditional regression-based approaches against platelet count, the HPO approach allows associations between genotypes and combinations of any kind of HPO-encoded phenotypes to be discerned.</s><s>Here, an association was found between the presence of a variant and two terms jointly -the 'Thrombocytopenia' and 'Increased Mean Platelet Volume' terms -while regression analysis is typically performed trait by trait in a univariate fashion.</s><s>Certainly, standard regression methods cannot be used to model heterogeneous combinations of data types (binary, quantitative, categorical), nor can they account for the hierarchical nature of ontologically encoded outcome data.</s><s>Furthermore, patient HPO data can be linked to data in online human databases such as OMIM, and to model system databases such as the Mouse Phenotype Ontology.</s><s>In future, this could be used to prioritise genes based on the similarity of groups of cases to ontological phenotype terms derived from the literature.</s></p><p><s>We assessed index cases harbouring variants in MHY9 who were not considered likely to have MYH9-RD by the enrolling clinicians based on clinical evaluation.</s><s>In this group, the cases with PV or LPV in MYH9 displayed a high degree of similarity whereas individuals with VUS in MYH9 were not similar.</s><s>Furthermore, the index cases with PV or LPV in MYH9 were phenotypically different from the index cases with VUS.</s><s>This illustrates that HPO-based clustering can reveal phenotype and genotype links that cannot be made by enrolling clinicians in isolation but only in combination with powerful methods for distinguishing variants by predicted pathogenicity.</s></p><p><s>We also demonstrated potential limitations of this approach arising from differences in phenotype coding between and within enrolling centres.</s><s>For example, two pedigrees showed poor clustering by phenotype, with phenotypic similarity P values of 0.42 and 0.33.</s><s>In one of these pedigrees, the lack of similarity between the two members was because the index case had detailed phenotypic evaluation but the pedigree case consented only to limited evaluation.</s><s>In the other pedigree, the lack of similarity was due to the marked difference in age at evaluation.</s><s>This illustrates how the age-dependence of HPO terms such as bleeding symptoms may result in paediatric cases clustering away from adult cases.</s><s>The potential confounding effect caused by gender-specific HPO terms was minimised by excluding these terms from calculation of similarity scores.</s><s>Despite these limitations, recruiting from a heterogeneous set of centres is crucial to obtain the sample sizes required to achieve power for gene discovery.</s></p><p><s>The approach we have presented for computing similarity scores relies on pre-selecting groups of cases based on the presence of rare variants fulfilling certain criteria, such as presumed mode of inheritance.</s><s>Sometimes, only a subset of the cases in a group will be explained by variants in the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>We have demonstrated that HPO annotation of the large and diverse BRIDGE-BPD collection enables the identification of clusters of individuals with phenotypic similarities who are likely to have causal genetic variants in the same or related genes.</s><s>Our international consortium has enabled comparison of standardised phenotypic descriptions among cases across the world, which improves statistical power by increasing the size of case groups.</s></p><p><s>We have validated the methodologies developed for the BRIDGE-BPD study, using BPD such as ACTN1-related disorder, which have been newly reported since the start of recruitment to our study collection.</s><s>However, these approaches are equally applicable to disorders of unknown genetic basis, in which cases are also expected to show similarity of HPO terms.</s><s>It is noteworthy that the cases in the stage 1 BRIDGE-BPD study with PV or LPV in established BPD genes together account for less than 10% of the study collection.</s><s>We anticipate that identification of further case subgroups based on similarity of HPO terms will be a powerful source of new gene discoveries in the remainder of the study collection and among cases in the ongoing enrolment programme.</s><s>This gene discovery approach, pioneered here in bleeding and platelet disorders, is broadly applicable to other rare disease groups.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 Figure 2</head><label>12</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Recruitment to the BRIDGE-BPD study by enrolment centre.</s><s>Gender stratified recruitment to the BRIDGE-BPD Consortium study is shown according to enrolment centre.</s><s>(A) University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; (B) Royal Free NHS Trust, London, UK; (C) Centre de RÃ©fÃ©rence des Pathologies Plaquettaires, Pessac, France; (D) Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK; (E) Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK; (F) University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol, UK; (G) Haematological Laboratory, Trousseau Children's Hospital and INsermU1009, Paris, France; (H) Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, USA; (I) Great Ormond Street Hospital For Children NHS Trust, London, UK; (J) CharitÃ© UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,66.16,455.13,214.99,149.39" type="bitmap" /></figure>
