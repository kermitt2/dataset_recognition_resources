<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p><s>Institutional Ethics Committee approval and written informed consent were obtained.</s><s>This study was supported by the Technologiestiftung Berlin (TSB) -Zukunftsfonds Berlin, Berlin, Germany, and the European Union -European Fund for Regional Development, Berlin, Germany.</s><s>The authors declare that there is no actual or potential conflict of interest in relation to this article.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>Twenty-six MR-guided biopsies (five liver, five bone, four muscle, four vertebral disc, one lung, one kidney, one suprarenal gland, and five soft and other tissue) were performed in 23 patients in a 1.0-T open magnetic resonance (MR) scanner (Panorama HFO, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands).</s><s>A total of 42 samples were obtained.</s><s>The MR system has a light-weight, vertical-field, superconducting magnet, and a built-in solenoid technology transmit/receive quadrature body coil.</s><s>Surface body coils were used according to the anatomic region whenever the interventional access route permitted it.</s><s>A gap of 45 cm between the tabletop and the upper cover of the MR system allows access to the patient from the sides.</s><s>The patient aperture (width) is 160 cm, and the maximum field of view (FOV) is 45 cm.</s></p><p><s>Complications were recorded according to the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) clinical practice guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Average patient age was 55 ± 21 years (min.</s><s>10, max.</s><s>80).</s><s>There were eight female and 15 male patients.</s><s>For interactive continuous navigation, different interventional sequences [T1-weighted (T1W), proton density (PD), and T2-weighted (T2W)] with different echo time (TE), repetition time (TR), and flip angle parameters were applied: balanced SSFP (balanced fast field echo: bFFE; gradient + spin echo), gradient echo (FFE; spoiled T1W FFE and nonspoiled), and TSE sequences (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As interventions were performed in different organs and tissues, the subjective peri-interventional appearance of needle artifact sensitivity (in terms of brightness, contrast, and delineation from the surrounding tissue) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed and related to the image acquisition rate for each of the interventional sequences used.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactive continuous navigation procedure</head><p><s>All MR-guided biopsies were performed using an MR-compatible inroom monitor and an MR-compatible wireless universal serial bus (USB) personal computer (PC) mouse, aseptically hand-operated by the interventional radiologist performing the intervention.</s><s>The inroom monitor is synchronized with the MR system's console in the technician's operating room outside the scanner room.</s><s>The interactive sequences were embedded in the scanner software (MR Systems Panorama HFO Release 2.6.5.0 2009-09-30, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands).</s><s>In interactive mode, a 2 × 2 image matrix is displayed and can be manually filled with single-shot images in different, interactively selected planes: (para-)transverse, (para-) sagittal, and (para-)coronal.</s><s>As usual for multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), intersections of the images are visualized by a line on the respective other imaging planes.</s><s>One of the four quadrants can be activated by a mouse click, and thereafter starts repetitive image acquisition of the very slice in the given (possible) short repetition rate.</s><s>During intervention, the interventionalist can effortlessly choose to activate another plane angulation for image reiteration by clicking on one of the other quadrants, or by modifying the angulation/intersection lines displayed in the respective other images with the PC mouse.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biopsy</head><p><s>Depending on lesion size and location, 14-18-gauge MR-compatible biopsy sets with a length of 100 or 200 mm (Somatex Medical, Teltow, Germany), 14-18-gauge MR-compatible semiautomatic biopsy guns with a length of 100 or 150 mm (Invivo, Schwerin, Germany), or 11-gauge MR-compatible bone marrow biopsy needles with a length of 100 mm (Somatex Medical, Teltow, Germany) were employed.</s><s>All MR interventions were performed by three physicians with respective 10, 5, and 4 years of experience, including profound experience in CT biopsy interventions.</s><s>If possible, present, and necessary, fluid was aspirated for microbiological analysis as well (e.g.</s><s>fluid in disc sign as a possible indicator of spondylodiscitis).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>All lesions were visible with continuous interactive imaging.</s><s>Depending on the organ harboring, the lesion to be approached and on the surrounding tissue, continuous image acquisition for biopsy was performed with bFFE, FFE, or TSE sequences.</s><s>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1-3</ref> illustrate MR-imageguided freehand tissue sampling from different organs with the use of different sequences.</s></p><p><s>Our initial results indicate that bFFE is particularly suitable for fast-moving organs (pulmonary, paracardial); moving organs are targeted better with T1W TSE, T1W FFE (liver), or T2W TSE (complicated cysts, adrenal glands), and static organs are successfully approached with PD (spine) or T1W TSE (peripheral bones, musculoskeletal system).</s><s>The TE, TR, and flip angle parameters are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Qualitative estimates of SNR and artifact sensitivity are also reported as they may affect the choice of the adequate sequence for a given MR-guided intervention.</s></p><p><s>We saw no adverse events related to the use of MRI.</s><s>No complications occurred according to the SIR clinical practice guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The average lesion size was 35 mm (range 15-65).</s><s>Out of the 26 MR-guided biopsies with 42 samples obtained in 23 patients, histopathology results were malignant in five patients (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, metastasis of colorectal carcinoma, atypical lipoma/liposarcoma,  Note that the needle artifact can be displayed in its entirety in both imaging planes because the angulation of the plane to be acquired can be chosen freely and easily.</s><s>Hence, 178 other degrees could also be chosen to display the needle's artifact in the tissue completely (unless, of course, the needle is bent, compare discussion).</s><s>The dashed arrows in A and 1 depict an initial needle position, before the needle is further advanced to finally reach the adrenal gland (continuous arrows in E and 5).</s><s>lymphomatoid granulomatosis), benign (including possibly false negative) in eight (cavernous hemangioma, cystic formations, inconspicuous skeletal muscle, tight connective tissue, regular target parenchyma), inflammatory in five (spondylodiscitis, spondylitis, abscess), and of other qualities in five patients (sarcoidosis, tumor-like calcinosis in hyperparathyroidism, scarred fibrotic lung parenchyma with mild chronic inflammation, inconclusive tissue).</s><s>According to our preliminary results, MRguided biopsies were performed with a high technical success rate.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>To perform interventions, imaging modalities like ultrasound, CT, and MRI are all used, which have their own pros and cons <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Many technical advances have improved the use of MRI for guiding interventions, and there are ongoing efforts to make MRI even more appealing for this purpose: an open MRI system not only allows imaging of excessively obese patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> but can also be used to perform interventions such as spinal injection procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, lumbosacral periradicular injection therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and facet joint injection therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Useful accessories for interventions have been developed, including the MR-compatible PC mouse for in-room use by the interventionalist <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>MRI enables retrieval of additional physical information during interventions such as MR thermometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, e.g. for intradiscal temperature monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>MR volumetry can be used to assess volumes and possible effects of fluid preinjection in ablation procedures such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Even experimental laparoscopic liver resection under MR guidance has been performed in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Most departments, however, continue to perform many or most interventions using CT guidance, as it is convenient, quick, successful, and readily available.</s><s>Rimondi et al. recently published a study of CT-guided biopsies of the musculosceletal system performed in their institution over an 18-year period.</s><s>Based on this analysis, which comprised no less than 2027 cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, they concluded that CT guidance should be considered the gold standard.</s><s>However, MRI undoubtedly offers benefits, especially a sound soft tissue contrast as well as no radiation exposure (neither for the patient nor possible scattered radiation exposure for the interventionalist).</s></p><p><s>Compared to CT-guided biopsies, the excellent soft tissue contrast of the MRI approach without radiation as well as the option of arbitrary slice selection with multiplanar near-real-time visualization for maneuvering even to delicate locations may increase future demand and use of MR-guided biopsies for some organs and regions.</s><s>Also, MRI can detect lesions that are not (yet) visible with other imaging modalities such as CT or ultrasound.</s><s>The possibility to perform steeply angulated needle maneuvers as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 (E and F</ref>) may furthermore be regarded as an advantage of MR-guided interventions.</s><s>In the case depicted, it was possible to safely access an extremely cranial subphrenic hepatic lesion in segment 7/8 without having to pass the costodiaphragmatic recess and, hence, to access the pleural cavity.</s><s>Due to technical restrictions in CT, arbitrary near-real-time slice selection is not possible, and only experienced interventional radiologists may accomplish similar results by maneuvering the needle in an out-of-plane fashion through the body.</s><s>Another appealing alternative for such cases may be to use fusion imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In MR-guided interventions, one may also take advantage of maneuvering arcuated needles through tissue while still having complete near-real-time visualization of the needle artifact in a freely selectable imaging plane as demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>: in this case, the L5/S1 intervertebral disc was targeted.</s><s>In order to keep the distance to the nerve root as long as possible, the needle was bent and maneuvered into the disc from as far caudally as possible.</s></p><p><s>Applying tailored interactive dynamic imaging sequences for continuous navigation to liver, bone, muscle, vertebral disc, soft tissue, and other lesions can improve the feasibility, image quality, and interventional accuracy of freehand MR-guided biopsies and may, hence, reduce the risk of complications.</s><s>Even though there may still be a long way to go on the way to tailoring interactive sequences to the specific needs for targeting different lesions and locations, it will ultimately contribute to a wider acceptance of MR-guided interventions.</s><s>The technique of continuous MR-guided freehand biopsies may be especially useful when devices have to be maneuvered to delicate target locations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Our study has several limitations.</s><s>We report our initial, single-centre experience in a small number of patients.</s><s>Also, we used the interventional near-real-time MR sequences available to us, which are by no means claimed to be concluding, especially as the number of sequences is continuously increasing.</s><s>Generalizations or simply transferring our results to other MR systems may not be adequate, as sequences may perform differently and needle artifacts may be visualized differently in different scanners (e.g.</s><s>open vs. tunnel systems) and field strengths.</s></p><p><s>Funding: European Union -European Fund for Regional Development, Berlin, Germany, TSB Technologiestiftung Berlin -Zukunftsfonds Berlin, Berlin, Germany.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1: Progress of an adrenal gland biopsy in para-sagittal (A-E) and para-transversal (1-5) image acquisitions, applying a T2W TSE sequence.Note that the needle artifact can be displayed in its entirety in both imaging planes because the angulation of the plane to be acquired can be chosen freely and easily.</s><s>Hence, 178 other degrees could also be chosen to display the needle's artifact in the tissue completely (unless, of course, the needle is bent, compare discussion).</s><s>The dashed arrows in A and 1 depict an initial needle position, before the needle is further advanced to finally reach the adrenal gland (continuous arrows in E and 5).</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,62.36,65.20,481.78,181.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
