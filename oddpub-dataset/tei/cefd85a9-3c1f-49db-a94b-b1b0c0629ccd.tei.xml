to extracellular signalling stimulus by triggering diverse intracellular pathways of high relevance for human biology.</s><s>Despite tremendous advances in characterizing GPCR structure and activation mechanisms, relatively little is known about the role of the membrane environment or of specific membrane lipid composition in receptor function.</s></p><p><s>Recent work shows that membrane phospholipids can allosterically modulate the activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and oligomerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> of GPCRs.</s><s>In addition, membrane cholesterol significantly modulates the stability, ligand-binding properties and function of several GPCRs (reviewed in refs 3-6).</s><s>Specifically, the presence of cholesterol in cell membranes can either

type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> (that is, negative modulation) ligand binding and/or functional properties of different GPCRs (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref> for a comprehensive summary).</s><s>A well-known example of this modulation is observed in rod outer segments for the prototypical receptor rhodopsin, where higher cholesterol concentrations in newly formed basal disks are used by these cells to stabilize the structure of metarhodopsin I (MI), thus hampering the formation of the active intermediate metarhodopsin II (MII) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Whether this modulation is exerted

been a matter of intense debate (see ref. 6  for a recent review on this topic).</s><s>Specific cholesterol-binding sites have been identified at the surface of different GPCRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , suggesting a potential allosteric role of cholesterol in modulating GPCR function.</s><s>Intriguingly, other studies postulate that closely related cholesterol derivatives can even modulate the function of certain class-A GPCRs from the orthosteric binding pocket thus acting like conventional class-A GPCR ligands.</s><s>For instance, oxysterol is thought to follow this binding mode at the Epstein-Barr virus-induced G-protein coupled receptor 2 (GPR183) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> or the chemokine receptor CXCR2 (ref.</s><s>28).</s><s>Similarly, oxysterol derivatives are known allosteric modulators of the oncoprotein Smoothened <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> (SMO), a class F GPCR.</s><s>A very recent crystal structure of SMO shows one cholesterol molecule in the binding site of the extracellular domain of this receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The adenosine A 2A R receptor (A 2A R) is a class-A GPCR that plays a major role in the heart and brain by regulating oxygen consumption and blood flow <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In fact, in the central nervous system (CNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , the A 2A R constitutes a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Cholesterol binding to the A 2A R at allosteric sites has been previously demonstrated by a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID 3EML) <ref

target="#b35">36</ref> and suggested a stabilizing effect on the apo-form of the A 2A R <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>However, the ability of cholesterol to impact ligand-binding properties at the A 2A R remains unclear.</s></p><p><s>For this purpose, in the present study we analysed the influence of cholesterol depletion on ligand binding and studied the dynamics of cholesterol-A 2A R interaction by extensive long-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</s><s>Our simulation data reveals an unexpected mechanism of cholesterol action on ligand binding consisting on the entry of a cholesterol molecule into the receptor transmembrane bundle.</s><s>Different lipophilic ligands that bind to the orthosteric site of class A GPCRs are suggested to access the protein from the membrane milieu (reviewed in ref. 6).</s><s>Interestingly, in recent crystal structures of rhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , a molecule of a commonly used detergent (that is, n-octyl b-D-glucopyranoside) replaced retinal from the ligand-binding pocket.</s><s>Therefore, as recently discussed by <ref type="bibr">Gimpl 6</ref> , it would seem plausible that cholesterol can access the interior of class A GPCRs like the A 2A R. To validate this mechanism of action, we used a specifically tailored experimental approach to assess cholesterol impact on chemical modification of the A 2A R interior.</s><s>Taken together, our combined long-scale MD simulation and experimental results show that cholesterol can compete with orthosteric ligands by entering the receptor interior from the membrane side.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of cholesterol depletion on A 2A R ligand binding.</head><p><s>To investigate the effect of membrane cholesterol on A 2A R-binding properties, we removed cholesterol from the membrane and monitored the specific binding of the radioligand [ 3 H]ZM241385 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), a selective antagonist of this receptor.</s><s>We depleted membrane cholesterol by treating C6 glioma cells with methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD), a specific cholesterolsequestering agent, for time lengths between 0 and 50 min (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Our data indicate that MbCD is able to deplete around 70-80% of membrane cholesterol after 30 min.</s><s>To accurately assess the level of cholesterol depletion, we carried out targeted lipidomics in plasma membranes.</s><s>Remarkably, 40 min treatment with 5 mM MbCD according to the described protocol in the method section depletes up to 61% of cholesterol from the membrane (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition, further radioligand binding assays using the former membrane preparations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) confirm the effect we describe in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> using intact cells.</s></p><p><s>To rule out any cytotoxic effect of MbCD or WSC treatment, cell viability was determined at 20, 40 and 60 min after MbCD or WSC treatments using the XTT method (see Methods).</s><s>As shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>, neither MbCD nor WSC treatments affected cell viability.</s><s>Here it is worth to highlight that cells remain viable despite the depletion of more than 60% of their membrane cholesterol using the MbCD treatment   detailed in the Methods.</s><s>Likewise, protein content did not significantly change after 20, 40 and 60 min incubation with either MbCD or WSC (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, cells did not display any significant change in number (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5a</ref>), morphology (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5b</ref> and Supplementary Movie 1), or division processes.</s><s>Remarkably, the lack of cholesterol increases the specific binding of [ 3 H]ZM241385 to the A 2A R by more than 100% (30 min) when compared to non-treated cells (0 min) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>Longer incubation times with MbCD (that is, 240 min) did not result in higher levels of A 2A R specific binding (469.7 ± 13.7 fmol per mg protein, n ¼ 2), likely due to a compensatory mechanism to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in treated cells.</s><s>Saturation binding experiments using a wide range of radioligand concentrations confirm this inhibitory effect (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>To validate the reversibility of this effect, we replenished membranes with cholesterol using water-soluble cholesterol (WSC) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Adequate cholesterol depletion and insertion into the membrane was monitored in intact cells and plasma membrane fractions by filipin fluorescence staining (Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6  and 7</ref>) and targeted lipidomic analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, addition of cholesterol significantly decreases [ 3 H]ZM241385 binding in cell membranes either untreated (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, columns 1, 3 and 4) or previously depleted from cholesterol using MbCD (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, columns 2, 5 and 6).</s><s>This clearly suggests that cholesterol has an inhibitory effect on [ 3 H]ZM241385 binding to the A 2A R.</s><s>This effect was confirmed in membranes from control cells by competitive binding experiments in the presence of increasing WSC concentrations (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and Supplementary Note 1).</s><s>To rule out that the former effect is the result of a higher number of A 2A Rs available due to an inhibition of receptor internalization by MbCD, we performed new binding assays in the presence of different inhibitors of endocytosis (see details in Supplementary Note 2).</s><s>As shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, inhibiting endocytosis does not significantly modulate A 2A R specific binding, hence demonstrating that receptor internalization is not involved in the cholesterol-mediated modulation of A 2A R-specific binding.</s><s>While cholesteryl hemisuccinate,  a cholesterol derivative, enhances the stability and activity of detergent-solubilized A 2A Rs 39 , our data clearly shows that naturally occurring cholesterol has an inhibitory effect on [ 3 H]ZM241385 binding to the A 2A R in more physiological environments (that is, intact cells and cell membrane preparations).</s><s>Our findings go along with previous experimental evidence in several class A GPCRs reporting a negative cholesterol-mediated modulation of ligand binding (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>All-atom MD simulations of cholesterol interaction sites.</s></p><p><s>To shed light on the structural basis of the observed cholesterol modulation, we carried out a complete set of atomistic MD simulations of the A 2A R (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As described in the Methods section, we used a comprehensive set of lipids of different chains, nature and length to model a native-like lipid bilayer rich in cholesterol (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>The crystal structure of the A 2A R <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> was embedded in the former membrane and the system was solvated, neutralized, adjusted to an ionic strength of 150 mM Na þ Cl À and equilibrated following standard protocols (see Methods).</s><s>First, we simulated a set of 4 Â 1 ms replicas to study the frequency and stability of the interaction between cholesterol and the A 2A R. The analysis of the accumulated 4 ms shows that in average 12 cholesterol molecules are in contact (below 2.9 Å) with the A 2A R throughout the simulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>).</s><s>This value is in agreement with the number of cholesterol molecules required for an ideal conformational stability of the A 2A R experimentally observed in cholesterol-rich micelles <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>While our simulations show several transient cholesterol-A 2A R interactions (light grey bars, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> right), certain cholesterol molecules establish permanent binding interactions to the receptor over nearly 100% of the simulation time (dark grey bars, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> right).</s><s>To spot preferred cholesterol interaction sites at the A 2A R surface, we used a 3D volumetric map to depict the density of cholesterol molecules in the simulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> left and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10</ref>).</s><s>In agreement with Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> our data show that transmembrane helices 2 and 3 (TM2-3), TM3-4-5 and TM7-1 are preferred interaction areas of cholesterol at the A 2A R surface.</s><s>Notably, one of the predicted interaction sites, namely TM2-3, overlaps with one of the cholesterol binding sites shown in the experimental high-resolution structure of A 2A R in complex with ZM241385 (ref.</s><s>24; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5 left</ref>).</s><s>However, as described in ref. 36, cholesterol does not seem to significantly occupy the upper TM5-6 region, where another binding site was observed in the crystal structure.</s></p><p><s>Cholesterol accesses the A 2A R interior in MD simulations.</s><s>Strikingly, the volumetric analysis also shows high cholesterol density inside the transmembrane bundle of the A 2A R (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>, left) indicating that cholesterol entered the A 2A R from the membrane milieu.</s><s>A visual inspection of the individual trajectories shows that one cholesterol molecule spontaneously accesses the interior of the protein from the extracellular leaflet through helices TM5-6 occupying a key area of the orthosteric binding pocket (see replica 1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> and Supplementary Movies 2 and 4).</s><s>Although cholesterol has been shown to occupy deeply buried sites in other membrane proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , this is the first dynamic view of membrane cholesterol spontaneously invading the orthosteric binding pocket of a GPCR.</s></p><p><s>To exclude simulation artefacts and better explore the cholesterol entry pathway, we performed new simulations and studied the tendency of cholesterol to access the A 2A R. First, we selected four representative snapshots from the original cholesterol entrance trajectory (that is, replica 1) prior to the complete invasion of the receptor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>).</s><s>Then, each starting point was used to re-spawn 10 new trajectories of 100 ns each (that is, 10 Â 4 Â 100).</s><s>To quantify cholesterol progression towards the interior of the protein, we monitored the distance between cholesterol and residue E1.39 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>).</s><s>In most of these short trajectories, cholesterol does not back away from the receptor but it stays bound or progresses towards the interior of the receptor.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, cholesterol progression is much faster once cholesterol slightly tilts down (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6a,b</ref>) adopting a favored position to enter the receptor.</s><s>Inclusion of intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) do not have a significant effect (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).</s><s>These data clearly suggest that cholesterol can spontaneously access the A 2A R through a portal gate between TM5 and 6.</s></p><p><s>The nature of the membrane environment could be one of the driving forces behind the spontaneous cholesterol entrance into the A 2A R. As shown in Supplementary Movie 3, an unsaturated phospholipid (in yellow) along with a cluster of four cholesterol molecules seem to influence cholesterol entrance by preventing it from diffusing back to the membrane bulk.</s></p><p><s>To study the impact of membrane composition, we substituted the compact membrane environment used so far by a pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer (see Methods) leaving intact both the target cholesterol and the A 2A R (see Methods).</s><s>Interestingly, in the absence of a more compact and thicker membrane (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12</ref>), cholesterol progression towards the interior of the protein is significantly diminished after 100 ns (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">13</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, our simulations suggest that the ability of cholesterol to access the interior of the A 2A R can be modulated by the nature of the membrane environment.</s></p><p><s>The sequence of events during cholesterol entrance is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Initially, cholesterol is interacting with other membrane lipids (not shown) and water molecules (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>) until it leaves this preferred position plunging its polar head into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a,b</ref>).</s><s>Next, cholesterol descends along TM5-6 guided by the formation of a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Y5.411 side chain (Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</s><s>At this point, TM5 and TM6 are tightly packed involving an aromatic cluster of staggered residues F5.45, F4.44, H6.52 and W6.48 (red arrows, Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>).</s><s>Thereafter, cholesterol tilts 90°and pushes aside the aromatic side chains of residues F5.45 and F5.44 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7c,d</ref>) attracted by water molecules and residue E169 at the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>).</s><s>This creates a protein gateway between TM5 and TM6 that cholesterol uses to make its way into the A 2A R to interact with E169 both directly and indirectly through contact with water molecules (dashed red lines in Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>).</s><s>Finally, cholesterol completely enters the receptor attracted by E1.39 at TM1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7d</ref>).</s><s>At this stage, the polar head engages into a hydrogen bonding network formed by Y7.36, E1.39 and water molecules.</s><s>During the entrance of cholesterol, the communication between protein residues in the aromatic network is partially disrupted (F5.45-F4.44 and F4.44-H6.52,</s><s>see red crosses in Fig. <ref type="figure">7c,d</ref>), thus likely hampering the reverse progression of cholesterol towards the membrane bulk.</s><s>However, cholesterol intercalation between helices TM5 and 6 does not involve marked protein rearrangements (Supplementary Movies 2-4).</s></p><p><s>To better characterize the behaviour of cholesterol inside the receptor, we extended three of the original 100 ns replicas (namely replicas 1, 35 and 38 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>) up to 10 ms (3 Â 10 ms).</s><s>Once inside the receptor, cholesterol molecules explore the interior of the protein by establishing transient interactions rather than adopting a stable binding pose.</s><s>Interestingly, our simulations show that cholesterol highly populates a specific area of the A 2A R binding pocket (yellow surface, Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref> and Supplementary Movie 4) that highly overlaps with the classical orthosteric binding site and the position of the ZM241385 ligand  <ref type="table">4</ref>.

the dopamine D 2 receptor.</s><s>This assay takes advantage of the fact that thiol groups of cysteine residues facing the binding-site crevice of a GPCR will selectively react with hydrophilic and

target="#b23">24</ref> (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">14</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>), water-accessible cysteine residues with a free sulfhydryl

(MTSEA-B), a positively charged MTS derivative similar in size and molecular weight to the ZM241385 ligand (see Methods).</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">8c</ref> illustrates that biotinylation of residue C3.30 (green sticks) results in a modified side chain that occupies a large region of the orthosteric binding site that overlaps with the preferred binding site of cholesterol as well as of ZM241385 (yellow and red sticks, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>).</s><s>As shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">15</ref>, chemically modified cysteine residues C5.46 and C6.56 yield a similar overlap with the ZM241385 ligand.</s><s>Accordingly, if cholesterol is able to invade the A 2A R-binding pocket as proposed by our simulations, cysteine biotinylation should be hindered in cholesterol-rich membranes compared to cholesterol-depleted membranes.</s></p><p><s>Based on this conceptual framework, we designed a new set of radioligand binding experiments using MTSEA-B to covalently modify cysteine residues in the A 2A R interior and MbCD to deplete membrane cholesterol (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>).</s><s>Experiments are schematically depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9b</ref>.</s><s>First, we used two control experiments where we measured [ 3 H]ZM241385 in untreated (Bar 1) and cholesterol-depleted cells (Bar 2).</s><s>These control experiments corroborated that cholesterol depletion by MbCD favours specific binding of [ 3 H]ZM241385 (Bar 2) by three fold when compared with untreated conditions (Bar 1).</s><s>Then, we assessed if cysteine residues in the A 2A R interior are susceptible to MTSEA-B biotinylation in cholesterol-depleted conditions, where no competition between cholesterol and [ 3 H]ZM241385 is expected.</s><s>We observe that after cholesterol depletion, biotinylation reduces [ 3 H]ZM241385 binding by B40% (Bar 3) when compared with treatment with MbCD alone (Bar 2).</s></p><p><s>This marked reduction in specific binding strongly indicates that at least one of the cysteine residue in the A 2A R interior (Supplementary Note 3) is susceptible to biotinylation and confirms that its chemically modified side chain occupies the orthosteric-binding site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9c</ref>).</s><s>In the next measurement, we tested the influence of cholesterol binding in cysteine biotinylation (Bar 4).</s><s>Remarkably, [ 3 H]ZM241385 binding increases by about 25% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">9</ref>, Bars 3-4) when receptors are treated with MTSEA-B prior to cholesterol depletion.</s><s>This suggests that cholesterol has a shielding effect by protecting cysteine residues from biotinylation inside the receptor.</s><s>Thus, this observation supports the presence of a cholesterol molecule inside the A 2A R transmembrane bundle with the ability to block access of MTSEA-B to water-accessible cysteine residues.</s><s>Finally, we observe that if the system is biotinylated in the presence of cholesterol and cholesterol is not removed afterwards (Bar 5), there is an additive effect of cholesterol and biotinylation that hampers binding of [ 3 H]ZM241385, yielding less specific binding than in control conditions (Bar 1).</s><s>Cholesterol entry/exit pathways.</s><s>Our data strongly suggest that a cholesterol molecule can penetrate the A 2A R from the membrane side.</s><s>In fact, membrane access of molecules to class-A GPCRs has been reported for few other cases such as the lipid receptor S1P1 (ref.</s><s>43), the cannabinoid CB2 receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> and the opsin receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Among them, retinal uptake into the opsin receptor is probably the best-studied case where two potential gateways for ligand uptake or release have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>The larger opening (gateway 1) between helices 5 and 6 has initially been proposed to allow for retinal loading, whereas a smaller gate between helices 1 and 7 (gateway 2) allows for ligand exit <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, more recent studies point to a retinal entrance/exit in the opposite sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>The complete tunnel pathway for retinal into the binding pocket of opsin including gateways 1 and 2 can be detected using the Caver software <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> (red surface, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In comparison, Caver computation for the simulated A 2A R (150 ns) reveals three gateways 1 to 3 (yellow surface, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10b</ref>).</s><s>The last largest gateway 3 is the classical channel for ligand entrance from the extracellular side into the receptor.</s><s>The smallest gateway 2 is directed towards helices 1 and 7 whereas the intermediate gateway 1 is located between helices 5 and 6 (yellow surface, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10b</ref>).</s><s>Remarkably, we find that gateway 1 is flanked by two residues, namely V5.40 and F5.44, which are conserved between the A 2A R and opsin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10a,b</ref>).</s><s>Hence, our data indicate that the opening that cholesterol uses to penetrate into the A 2A R is identical to the opening that retinal takes to enter/exit the opsin receptor.</s></p><p><s>Unveiling the putative exit pathway of cholesterol from the A 2A R is currently beyond the reach of all-atom unbiased simulations.</s><s>If cholesterol behaved in a similar way to classical GPCR ligands, this entry/exit pathway could occur via the extracellular domain, as suggested elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>However, due to the large hydrophobic moiety of the cholesterol molecule, it is not likely that cholesterol abandoning the A 2A R-binding pocket via the extracellular aqueous phase is energetically favoured.</s><s>To determine the energetic cost of such exit route, we carried out a set of biased simulations (see Methods) where we computed the free energy profile (PMF) of extracting cholesterol from the binding site into the extracellular water phase.</s><s>These simulations confirm that the energetic cost of a complete cholesterol exit from its observed binding site to the water phase is as high as 120 kJ Á mol À 1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">16</ref>).</s><s>Hence, it is more likely that cholesterol leaves the A 2A R via the transmembrane helices.</s><s>In this context, we find that TM2-TM1 or TM7-TM1 could be possible cholesterol exit ways, as detailed in Supplementary Note 4. Notably, TM7-TM1 exit is in line with A 2A R channels that have been computed using the Caver software (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10b</ref>) as well as with the described gateway 2 in the crystallized structure of opsin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">10a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s></p></div>

Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that cholesterol significantly decreases the binding of the antagonist [ 3 H]ZM241385 to the A 2A R. Molecular insights obtained in this and other studies point to numerous allosteric binding sites at the A 2A R surface that could potentially be involved in reducing ZM241385 binding.</s><s>However, our work reveals an additional and unexpected mode of cholesterol action.</s><s>We have observed that cholesterol modulates orthosteric ligand binding at the A 2A R after entering from the membrane side.</s><s>These results have been validated combining both computational and specifically tailored experimental approaches.</s><s>Our study suggests that the gateway that cholesterol uses to enter the A 2A R is evolutionarily conserved and identical to the retinal gateway present in the opsin receptor.</s><s>Since molecules of a similar size and amphipathic nature have been shown to access the retinal-binding pocket <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , it is reasonable to speculate that the negative modulation exerted by cholesterol on rhodopsin function <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> could be partly mediated by the new mechanism proposed here.</s><s>Taken all together, cholesterol is likely to modulate A 2A R ligand-binding properties through a mixed mode of action, namely both orthosteric-and allosterically.</s><s>Nevertheless, further research shall be aimed to unveil the exact contribution of each mode of cholesterol-mediated modulation at this or other GPCRs.</s></p><p><s>All in all, our results provide an important advance in the understanding of the interplay between cholesterol and the A 2A R.

specific brain post-mortem studies relevant for the adenosine A 2A R receptor (A 2A R) biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> .</s><s>The CHARMM-GUI membrane builder <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> was used to build a multicomponent membrane by using key representative lipids (that is, polyunsaturated phospholipids, cholesterol or sphingomyelin) while keeping an adequate balance between all components.</s><s>Thus, our membrane was made of cholesterol, saturated phospholipids, mono-and polyunsaturated phospholipids and sphingomyelin (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>As described in the main manuscript, one A 2A R receptor was then embedded into this membrane using VMD 1.9 (ref.</s><s>62) and the system was then solvated, neutralized and the ionic strength was adjusted using the CHARMM-GUI membrane builder <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> .</s><s>Thereafter, a VMD script was used to re-hydrate the membrane patch using B30 water molecules (TIP3P model) per lipid.</s><s>The exact composition of the simulation systems is detailed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>The lipid composition used yielded a proteinto-lipid ratio of 1:337.</s><s>Simulation protocol.</s><s>As described in the Methods section of the main manuscript, simulation sets 1 and 2 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) share a common building phase, whereas the set-up of simulation sets 3 and 4 involved a complete substitution of the membrane environment or the inclusion of the ICL3, respectively.</s><s>At the beginning of the equilibration phase for simulations sets 1 and 2 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), harmonic positional restraints were applied to the C a atoms of the protein and the system was simulated for 10 ns.</s><s>Such constraints were gradually released from the receptor over 5 ns and the system was further equilibrated for 100 ns.</s><s>In simulations set 3 (that is, POPC), harmonic positional restraints were applied to all atoms of both protein and cholesterol and the system was equilibrated for 20 ns in the NPT ensemble.</s><s>In simulation set 4 (that is, ICL3 included), after 10,000 steps of minimization, a gradual release of different applied harmonic constraints was used during 40 ns phase in the NPT ensemble.</s><s>Harmonic restraints were first applied during 10 ns to all atoms of the system except for the intracellular polar head region of all membrane lipids.</s><s>Constraints were then released for all water and ion atoms and the system was simulated for another 10 ns.</s><s>Subsequently, the ICL3 region was released and the system (that is, only protein and target cholesterol restrained) was further equilibrated for 20 ns.</s><s>NPT simulations were carried out at 310 K and 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> with a relaxation time of 400 and 2 fs integration time step.</s><s>NVT simulations were run at 310 K, using the Langevin thermostat <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> with a damping coefficient of 5 ps À 1 and 4 fs integration time step.</s><s>All along the simulations, van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions were cut off at 9 Å and the particle mesh Ewald method <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> was used to compute the long-range electrostatic interactions.</s></p><p><s>Inclusion of ICL3.</s><s>The ICL3 structure was taken from PDB:3PWH and included in the A 2A R structure using MODELLERv9.10 (ref.</s><s>72) and VMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> .</s><s>The system was first minimized and the ICL3 subsequently equilibrated and relaxed for 50 ns in the NPT ensemble (see simulation protocol above).</s></p><p><s>In silico model and conformational analysis for MTSEA-B chemical modification.</s><s>In a first step, the side chain of cysteines (C3.30,</s><s>C5.46 and C6.56) of the A 2A R (PDB:3EML) was chemically modified by attaching MTSEA-B using the builder tool of the MOE package (version 2016.08).</s><s>In a second step, the conformational space of such chemical modification was explored using the LowModeMD method in the MOE package with: Rejection Limit 100, Iteration Limit 100, RMS Gradient 0.1, MM Iteration Limit 500, RMSD Limit 0.5, Energy Window 100, Conformation Limit 1000 and applying the Amber10:EHT force field.</s><s>As a result of this search, we obtained 98 different conformers for the chemically modified residues C3.30 and C5.46 and 96 conformers for the chemically modified residue C6.56, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">15</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Umbrella sampling simulations and free-energy calculations.</s><s>Biased simulations were used to compute the free energy of cholesterol extraction from the inside of the A 2A R. To this end, we used the simulation engine Gromacs v5 (ref.</s><s>73) in combination with the CHARMM36 force field <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> .</s><s>The recommended settings including the usage of Verlet lists, PME with 1.2 nm cutoff for electrostatics and a cutoff function for the Van de Waals at 1.2 nm with a force-switch starting at 1.0 nm were used <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> .</s><s>The composition of the system is detailed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</s><s>The potential of mean force was computed along the direction perpendicular to the membrane (that is, z axis).</s><s>No bias was introduced at the xy axis, that is, molecules could freely diffuse in the membrane plane (xy).</s><s>The biased reaction coordinate was defined as the distance along the z axis between the centre of mass of the A 2A R backbone and the oxygen atom of cholesterol.</s><s>In total, 35 different windows were probed.</s><s>Harmonic restraints with a force constant of 2,000 kJ Á mol À 1 Á nm 2 were imposed along the reaction coordinate.</s><s>To ensure an adequate overlap between neighbouring windows, each window is separated by 0.1 nm along the reaction coordinate.</s><s>Based on the quality of the data and the presence of large energy barriers, each window was simulated within 200-600 ns.</s><s>The accumulated simulation exceeds 8 ms.</s><s>The reaction coordinate was monitored every 10 fs within each window.</s><s>The last frame of the 200 ns simulation of the previous window was used as the starting configuration of the next one.</s><s>Although this protocol cannot be used to simulate all windows in parallel, it drastically improves the equilibration time for each window.</s><s>The first window corresponds to the cholesterol deeply buried in the ligand cavity.</s><s>In the last windows, cholesterol moves freely in the water solution.</s><s>We used the g_wham tool distributed with gromacs v5 (ref.</s><s>73) to compute the PMF (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">16</ref>) disregarding the first 50 ns of each trajectory to avoid sampling potential non-equilibrium configurations.</s><s>Autocorrelation time of the data was used to minimize correlation effects and to select the appropriated gathering frequency in the PMF curves.</s><s>Bootstrapping of 1,000 samples was used to estimate the standard deviation of the PMF results.</s></p><p><s>Tunnel pathway calculations.</s><s>Tunnel pathways were computed using the Caver software <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s><s>The starting point coordinates were set to centre of the binding pocket of opsin and A 2A R. Computations were carried out using a shell radius 3 Å, shell depth 4 Å, a probe radius of 1.1 Å for the opsin receptor and 1.4 Å for the A 2A R.
