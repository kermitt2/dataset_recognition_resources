<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IL-10 overexpression predisposes to invasive aspergillosis by suppressing antifungal immunity</head><p><s>To the Editor:</s></p><p><s>Proinflammatory immune responses are critically required for antimicrobial host defenses; however, excessive inflammation has the potential to damage host tissues thereby paradoxically contributing to the progression of infection.</s><s>A central negative regulator of inflammatory responses is IL-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine with a wide variety of functions across multiple cell types. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Although the role of IL-10 during infection appears to vary for different microorganisms, a largely detrimental role has been attributed to this cytokine during fungal disease. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> Given the variable risk of infection and its outcome among patients with comparable predisposing factors, susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis (IA) is thought to rely largely on genetic predisposition. <ref type="bibr">3</ref></s><s>he initial investigation of genetic variability at the IL10 locus led to the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing its transcriptional activity; thus, IL-10 may be a reasonable candidate for the genetic regulation of susceptibility to IA in high-risk patients.</s></p><p><s>In a 2-stage, multicenter study involving 413 hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) donor-recipient pairs, we confirmed that SNPs in IL10 are critical regulators of susceptibility to IA.</s><s>Using a discovery cohort of donor-recipient pairs (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">E1</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.</s><s>org), we analyzed 5 haplotype-tagging SNPs in IL10 (see Table <ref type="table">E2</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org)</s><s>and found that the donor, but not recipient, rs1800896 SNP was associated with an increased risk of IA (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1,</ref> A and see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">E3</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).</s><s>The contribution of the GG genotype to the risk of infection was further illustrated on modeling a recessive mode of inheritance (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, B</ref>).</s><s>In a multivariate model, the donor GG genotype conferred a 2.6-fold increased risk of developing IA after transplantation, and the association test results were further validated in a confirmation case-control study involving patients with similar demographic and clinical characteristics and by a meta-analysis including all enrolled patients (see Table <ref type="table">E4</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).</s><s>Furthermore, although no significant differences were observed, the probability of infection-free survival in the discovery set decreased from 88% among patients with the AA genotype to 79% and 75% among subjects carrying the AG or GG genotypes, respectively (Fig 1 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Using sequence data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we identified all SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1800896 (see Table <ref type="table">E5</ref> in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org),</s><s>but none of these were exonic.</s><s>LD around this SNP was limited to the IL10 locus (see Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org),</s><s>implying that noncoding variation is likely to drive the association with IA.</s><s>To ascertain whether rs1800896, or a variant in strong LD with it, influenced gene transcription, we monitored IL-10 mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs from healthy blood donors subjected to in vitro infection with Aspergillus fumigatus.</s><s>We observed striking genotype-specific differences, with PBMCs carrying the GG genotype expressing higher transcript and protein levels than those from AA or AG carriers (Fig <ref type="figure">2, A</ref>).</s><s>A similarly enhanced IL-10 production was observed in monocyte-derived macrophages from GG carriers (Fig <ref type="figure">2, B</ref>), and the overexpression phenotype was independent of specific pattern recognition receptor activation (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, C</ref>).</s><s>Although the ability of macrophages to ingest the conidia remained intact regardless of the genotype (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, D</ref>), cells carrying the IL-10 high-producing genotype displayed a 25% decrease in their ability to clear the fungus, as compared to AA carriers (Fig <ref type="figure">2,  E</ref>).</s><s>This defect was dependent on IL-10, because inhibiting IL-10-mediated signals with a neutralizing antibody restored the fungicidal ability.</s><s>Importantly, the donor GG genotype also differentially regulated the levels of IL-10 in hematological patients, with higher levels present in bronchoalveolar lavages from cases of IA carrying the GG genotype than AA carriers (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In contrast to IL-10, PBMCs carrying the GG genotype at rs1800896 secreted lower amounts of TNF-a than those from AA or AG carriers after infection (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, G</ref>), a finding implying that, under these conditions, GG homozygotes generate lesser inflammatory responses.</s><s>The dichotomy between IL-10 and TNF-a production according to rs1800896 genotypes was confirmed in human macrophages, in which the same genotypespecific alterations were observed (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, H</ref>) and extended to other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-8 (Fig <ref type="figure">2,  I</ref>).</s><s>Strikingly, we observed that the defect in TNF-a production by macrophages from GG carriers was abolished when IL-10 was neutralized (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, J</ref>).</s><s>In support of this, the addition of IL-10 to cells carrying low-producing genotypes restrained the production of TNF-a in response to infection (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, K</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, the median concentrations of TNF-a were also decreased among hematological patients carrying the IL-10 high-producing genotype (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">, L</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We have identified rs1800896 (or a variant in strong LD with it) as the underlying causal variant within the IL10 locus and disclosed the suppression of immune responses to A fumigatus as the primary mechanism explaining the increased susceptibility to infection.</s><s>The rs1800896
