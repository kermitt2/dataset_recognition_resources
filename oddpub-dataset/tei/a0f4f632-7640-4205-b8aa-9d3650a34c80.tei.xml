<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Antigen-specific PCs are present in the LP and bone marrow for at least 3 months after oral immunization</head><p><s>To monitor the presence of antigen-specific PCs in the LP over time and analyze the relationship between PC compartments of the gut and bone marrow, we immunized mice orally with cholera toxin (CT).</s><s>The oral administration of CT has been shown previously to elicit a strong T-cell-dependent PC response in the LP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>After neutralization of gastric acid using sodium bicarbonate, mice were immunized via oral gavage with 10 mg of CT and 3 weeks later the mice received a boost immunization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Six days after boost, at a time point when the PC response was predicted to peak at the induction site based on kinetics generated in systemic immune responses, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> one cohort of mice was killed and the LP of the small intestine was analyzed by ELISPOT for the presence of CT-specific PCs.</s><s>Non-immunized mice served as controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>As expected, CT-specific IgA-ASCs were not detected at all in naive mice.</s><s>In contrast, on average 410 5 specific IgA þ ASCs were detected in the LP at day 6 after boost immunization.</s><s>We also detected CT-specific ASCs of other isotypes, namely IgG and IgM at that time point; however, their total numbers were B10 times lower than the number of IgA-ASCs.</s><s>Ninety days after immunization, we could still detect B2.9 Â 10 3 CT-specific IgA-ASCs in the LP, whereas IgG-and IgM-ASCs specific for the antigen, in contrast, were undetectable.</s><s>To compare the persistence of CT-specific ASCs in the LP with those in other lymphoid tissues, we performed ELISPOT analyses of the bone marrow.</s><s>At day 6 after oral boost, an average of 2.6 Â 10 4 total CT-specific IgA-ASCs and 2.3 Â 10 4 of specific IgG-ASCs were present in the bone marrow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Although we noticed a reduction of each of the two isotypes after day 6, similar to previously published data on ASC accumulation in the bone marrow, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> we could still detect 7.7 Â 10 3 specific IgG-ASCs (1/3 of the value at day 6) and 5 Â 10 3 (1/5 of the value at day 6) IgA-ASCs 90 days after boost.</s><s>CT-specific IgM-ASCs were also present in the bone marrow, albeit in lower numbers as the other isotypes tested (on average: 6.7 Â 10 3 and 6.4 Â 10 2 6 and 90 days after oral boost, respectively).</s></p><p><s>Oral administration of CT with co-administered ovalbumin (OVA) induces long-term persistence of CT-and OVAspecific PCs in the LP as well as the bone marrow CT has been described to function as a potent adjuvant for mucosal immune reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Furthermore, its adjuvant functions have been shown to promote long-term immunological memory in the gut to other immunogens that are applied orally together at the same time as CT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>This led us to test whether CT could promote long-term humoral immunity in the LP against co-administered antigens.</s><s>Indeed, when we gavaged mice with a mix of CT and OVA we could detect similar numbers of IgA-secreting cells by ELISPOT against both antigens in the LP even at late time points, 9 months after immunization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, left panel).</s><s>At the same time, we could also detect CT-specific as well as OVA-specific IgA-ASCs in the bone marrow at numbers similar to the ones present in the LP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, right panel).</s><s>In contrast, both CT-and OVAspecific IgG-secreting ASCs were present in the bone marrow.</s><s>To further confirm the data generated by ELISPOT, we also monitored the numbers of OVA-specific ASCs in the LP at different time points after boost by flow cytometry.</s><s>OVAspecific ASCs were identified by staining intracellularly against the Ig kappa light chain in combination with fluorescently labeled OVA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed that virtually all OVA-specific PCs in the LP and in the bone marrow were expressing the kappa light chain (see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> online).</s><s>Using this strategy, we were able to detect OVAspecific PCs in the LP up to 9 months after boost immunization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,c</ref>), thereby confirming the data generated by ELISPOT assay.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ASCs induced after oral immunization can become longlived and persist in the LP</head><p><s>The antigen-specific ASCs that we detected at 9 months after immunization might represent long-lived PCs.</s><s>Alternatively, they could be short-lived plasma blasts generated continuously by ongoing immune responses in the gut.</s><s>To test this, we immunized mice with OVA and CT and fed them during the first 12 days of the boost response with the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2 0 -deoxyuridine (EdU) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), which gets stably incorporated in the DNA of proliferating cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>roliferating plasma blasts in the LP were efficiently labeled with EdU: at day 12, directly after termination of the EdU feeding, 490% of OVA-specific plasma blasts had incorporated EdU (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>The nuclear localization of EdU in plasma blasts was confirmed by immunofluorescence histology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>Microscopic examination also clearly showed EdU uptake by OVA-specific PCs in the LP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next we analyzed PCs from the LP at later time points in order to determine their lifetime (Figure <ref

the PC survival factor APRIL By immunofluorescence histology, we confirmed the presence of EdU þ kappa þ cells in the small intestine 4 months (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>) and even up to 9 months after oral immunization, although at low abundance (data not shown).</s><s>In line with the results obtained by flow cytometry, the majority of PCs at 4 months after boost were EdU-negative.</s><s>However, we were able to detect scattered EdU þ IgA þ PCs in the diffuse LP.</s></p><p><s>Those long-lived intestinal PCs were localized in the villi as well as in the areas around the crypts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the bone marrow, eosinophils have been shown to localize within the PC survival niche, where they are a source of APRIL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> The detection of long-lived PCs in the LP prompted us to investigate whether a similar survival niche exists in the small intestine.</s><s>The gut has a substantial population of eosinophils. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>n line with this, we could detect cells, which stained positive for the eosinophil marker major basic protein (MBP) in the diffuse LP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>A fraction of IgA þ PCs was found to localize in contact with those MBP þ cells in the gut by histology.</s><s>However, the majority of PCs (B70%) were not found to contact eosinophils.</s><s>Interestingly, this percentage did not differ between EdU þ and EdU À PCs in EdU pulse-chase experiments 4 months after immunization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c,d</ref>).</s><s>These results suggested that-unlike in the bone marrow-colocalization with eosinophils was not required for the survival of PCs in the LP.</s><s>As shown by histology, eosinophils in the bone marrow are a major source of APRIL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> We stained for this cytokine in the LP in order to evaluate its distribution in this tissue.</s><s>The strongest signal for APRIL was detected in the gut epithelial cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref>), in line with a recent publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>MBP þ eosinophils as well as some other, yet unidentified cells in the LP were APRIL þ , albeit the signal seemed less bright than in the epithelium.</s><s>Taken together, our data indicate that in the gut-unlike in the bone marrow-colocalization with eosinophils within a survival niche has a minor role in the survival of long-lived PCs.</s><s>Of note, eosinophils were reported to have a role for PC generation in the LP, and PC numbers in the gut have been shown to be reduced by about 50% in eosinophildeficient mice compared with wild-type mice, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> indicative of other sources of APRIL contributing to the presence of PCs at this location.</s><s>Our findings indicate that the gut epithelium acts as the main provider of APRIL in the gut.</s></p><p><s>PCs induced after oral immunization contribute to the longlived PC pool in the bone marrow Plasma blasts have been shown to migrate from secondary lymphoid organs to the bone marrow in mice 1,2 and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> during systemic immune responses.</s><s>The bone marrow is the physiological site for the accumulation of long-lived PCs.</s><s>It is thought to contain micro-environmental niches defined by a combination of stromal as well as hematopoietic cells, which supply the PCs with survival factors, thereby promoting their longevity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>However, previous studies on long-lived PCs in the bone marrow were done using systemic challenges, and the mucosal and systemic PC pools have been considered to be compartmentalized.</s><s>As we had found CT-specific ASCs in the bone marrow by ELISPOT in our previous experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), we next sought to confirm the presence of OVAspecific ASCs by flow cytometry up to 9 months after boost in the bone marrow (Figure <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>To investigate whether mucosal immune reactions can elicit bona fide long-lived PCs in the bone marrow, we also analyzed EdU incorporation in bone marrow PCs in pulse-chase experiments.</s><s>EdU þ kappa þ PCs were detected up to 9 months after oral boost in the bone marrow (Figure <ref type="figure">6b,c</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed the presence of EdU þ PCs in the bone marrow at 9 months after immunization by histology (Figure <ref type="figure">6d</ref>).</s><s>Notably, EdU was detected in OVAspecific PCs at this time point (Figure <ref type="figure">6e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The majority of antibodies secreted by PCs in the LP are shuttled into the gut lumen. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>In contrast, bone marrow PCs are responsible for the production of serum IgG and a fraction of serum IgA antibodies in mice.</s><s>We could detect OVA-specific IgA as well as IgG in the serum of orally immunized mice up to 9 months after oral immunization, supporting the hypothesis that long-lived bone marrow PCs induced in mucosal immune responses contribute to the maintenance of long-term serum antibody titers (Figure <ref type="figure">6f</ref>).</s><s>We also examined the distribution of Ig isotypes within the EdU þ and OVA-specific PC compartment by flow cytometry.</s><s>Whereas, as expected, IgA was the dominant isotype of OVA-specific PCs in the LP, (median: 93.2%: data not shown), there were almost equal fractions of OVA-specific IgA þ and IgG1 þ PCs present in the bone marrow at both day 12 and day 35 (see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that IgG1 þ OVA-specific plasma blasts from mucosal immune responses preferentially home to the bone marrow compared with their IgA þ counterparts and suggests that various isotypes generated in responses to different antigens vary in their capacity to migrate to the bone marrow.</s></p></div>

these conditions as others.</s></p><p><s>In the bone marrow, eosinophils have been described as a crucial cellular component of the PC survival niche. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>They produce APRIL, which is known to promote PC survival by binding to B-cell maturation protein.</s><s>This results in the production of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1, <ref

in the depletion of about 70% of long-lived bone marrow PC in vivo, underlining the role of eosinophils in promoting bone marrow PC survival. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>In our experiments, one-third of the ASCs localize in the vicinity of eosinophils in the LP.</s><s>This percentage did not differ between long-lived and short-lived PC populations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>However, APRIL acts as a soluble survival factor, and we have recently shown that in the bone marrow eosinophils are not required to make prolonged contact with PCs to promote their survival. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>In contrast to PCs and stromal cells, which are static components of the PC survival niche, eosinophils are dynamic elements of this niche, and are exchanged frequently, thereby explaining a low rate of direct contact counts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>oreover, the major sources of APRIL relevant for PC survival may differ between various tissues.</s><s>Although APRIL þ eosinophils were detected in the LP by histology, the strongest signal intensity was detected in the epithelium, consistent with published data from humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Consistent with the concept that eosinophils are not the sole source of APRIL in the LP, a total absence of PCs in the LP of either eosinophildeficient or eosinophil-depleted mice was not observed but rather a B50% reduction in PC numbers, concurrent with a similar reduction in luminal and fecal IgA titers.</s><s>Notably, in addition to the effect on PCs, Chu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> also found that eosinophils were able to promote the generation of IgA þ B cells in the Peyer's Patches.</s><s>As PCs were obviously already affected at the point of their generation, a conclusion about the role of eosinophil-derived APRIL regarding their maintenance could not be drawn in vivo.</s><s>The authors describe a crucial effect of eosinophils for the survival of LP-derived PCs as demonstrated by in vitro co-cultures, but the contribution of epithelial cells was not investigated.</s><s>Taken together, these data show that eosinophils are not the only source of APRIL in the intestine.</s><s>They suggest a role for the intestinal epithelium in contributing to the PC survival niche in the LP by producing APRIL and thus a different structure of the PC survival niche in various organs.</s></p><p><s>In addition to APRIL, other molecules have been shown to promote PC survival in the bone marrow.</s><s>These include interactions via CD28 on the PCs with CD80 on dendritic cells in the bone marrow as well as interleukin-6 and the chemokine CXCL12, which are derived from stromal cells.</s><s>In the future, it will be important to investigate which types of cellular interactions have a role for sustaining PC survival in the gut and whether there are intrinsic molecular similarities and differences in the long-lived PC compartments of both organs.</s></p><p><s>Our experiments further show that long-lived PCs generated in an immune response against orally delivered antigens are not only restricted to the mucosal tissue but can also be found in the bone marrow, thereby contributing to the long-lived PC pool at this site.</s><s>We show here that a fraction of long-lived PCs generated after a mucosal challenge persist over comparable time spans as PCs generated in systemic immune responses and that these cells produce antibodies but do not proliferate extensively.</s></p><p><s>Whether PCs generated in mucosal immune responses occupy bone marrow niches distinct from the ones originating in systemic responses was not investigated here.</s><s>In our preliminary histological analysis, we could not detect obvious differences in the location between IgA þ and IgG þ bone marrow PCs.</s><s>However, at least in humans, circulating IgA þ plasma blasts are equipped with chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules that are typical for cells generated in mucosal immune responses (the gut-homing integrin a 4 b 7 as well as chemokine receptors CCR9 and CCR10) and therefore differ from their counterparts in systemic immune responses, which mainly express integrin a 4 b 2 , CXCR3, and CXCR4. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref></s><s>It will be crucial to investigate whether they keep this mucosal adhesion molecule/chemokine receptor signature once they have reached their niche in the bone marrow, as this would suggest different requirements of mucosal and systemic PCs with respect to the signals that are available to the PCs in the niches.</s></p><p><s>It is believed that the mucosal and the systemic PC compartment in mice are compartmentalized; IgA production to orally administered antigens is thereby largely restricted to the intestine.</s><s>However, as our data show, at least under certain conditions, the compartmentalization between mucosal and systemic compartments may be less strict than previously thought.</s><s>In this context, it is notable that seminal work from the early 1970s has shown monomeric serum IgA to be derived from the bone marrow in humans (reviewed in <ref type="bibr">Heremans 39</ref> ).</s><s>Considerable differences between species exist in this context, as in mice the largest fraction of total serum IgA is thought to predominantly originate from the gut.</s><s>However, even if the fraction of IgA produced in the gut outnumbers the bone marrow-derived serum IgA, our experiments clearly show that long-lived PCs of IgA as well as IgG isotypes specific for intestinal antigens can be deposited in the bone marrow and contribute to serum Ig levels and therefore form a part of humoral memory.</s><s>The protective potential of these antibodies against gut-derived and systemic antigens, and thus their impact on vaccinology, will be the subject of further studies.</s><s>The migration of plasma blasts originating from mucosal immune responses to the bone marrow has been reported previously in murine immune responses against bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> and viruses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Importantly, to our knowledge the data presented here demonstrate for the first time that splenic B-cell activation (which has been implied in systemic B-cell responses against commensal bacteria 27 ), is not necessary for the generation of long-lived bone marrow PCs specific for orally administered antigens.</s><s>These long lived PCs in the bone marrow contribute to systemic humoral memory, as reflected in the presence and persistence of OVA-specific antibody titers in the serum (Figure <ref type="figure">6f</ref>) and OVA-specific PCs in the bone marrow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</s><s>We also found PCs specific for components of commensal bacteria in the bone marrow.</s><s>As a significant fraction of these cells were actually class-switched, including IgG (see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A,B</ref>), we can exclude that these antibodies have a preimmune origin.</s><s>The presence of class-switched serum antibodies against commensals has been described in humans, and these antibody levels remained stable over several years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>In contrast, classswitched serum antibodies against colonizing bacteria in the intestine were not detected in mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s>Notably, the levels of serum antibodies against various bacteria differed significantly between human individuals, and increased levels were detected in inflammatory bowel disease patients compared with healthy individuals, suggesting a role for the gastrointestinal barrier function in determining the titer of anticommensal antibodies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>This suggested the systemic dissemination of commensal microbes due to a disturbed barrier as cause of the systemic response.</s><s>A similar effect was postulated in a mouse model of intestinal barrier dysfunction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>In contrast, we could not find isotype differences in CT-immunized vs. untreated cohorts (see Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4B</ref>); however, we did not perform a detailed comparison of the microbiome in mice of both cohorts.</s><s>The potential of a bacterial strain to elicit a systemic response may not only depend on the ability of the bacterium to translocate via the gastrointestinal barrier but also on the signal strength that a B-cell receives upon activation.</s><s>Various commensal strains may thus differ in their capacity to activate B cells in the mucosa, depending on whether they are strict commensals or have capacities of pathobionts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref></s><s>Although the mice used in our studies were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions, the commensal microbiota of the mice in our facility are likely to differ from the microbiota of mice used in the previous studies, which could account for the observed differences, as recent studies have shown that the commensal microbiota in different specific pathogen-free facilities can critically influence systemic immune reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>Future studies will be required to determine the specificity of these antibodies, as currently we cannot exclude that they are directed against conserved bacterial structures.</s><s>Importantly, we had to culture the bacteria derived from the gut in order to have a sufficient amount for the preparation of lysates for ELISPOT detection.</s><s>This very likely caused a reduction in bacterial diversity, which may have actually led to an underestimation of the number of PCs specific for bacterial components in our experiments, a question which also needs to be addressed in further experiments.</s></p><p><s>We observed a decrease in the EdU þ fraction among OVA-specific PCs in the bone marrow over time (Figure <ref type="figure">6e</ref>).</s><s>This might reflect an ongoing proliferation in OVA-specific B cells that could, on the one hand, be caused by persistence of antigen, on the other hand, their activation could be triggered by Toll-like receptors as has been suggested before, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> in particular in memory B cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s>In this context, it should be noted that we have actually observed EdU þ B220 þ cells localized within Peyer's Patches up to at least 72 days after immunization (data not shown), which could represent memory B cells in this tissue.</s><s>Further investigations to characterize this population are underway.</s><s>Notably, a recent publication by Pabst and co-workers demonstrated that, after Bortezomibinduced PC depletion, the repertoire of the repopulating LP PCs remained remarkably stable in individual mice, indicating a recall of already existing specificities among these individuals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s>This may reflect the activation of memory B cells in the LP, which are not sensitive to Bortezomib-induced depletion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>n this report, we did not investigate which signals actually trigger the proliferation of OVA-specific B cells at late time points after immunization.</s><s>However, our point is that longlived PCs are in principle able to persist in the LP and that mucosally induced PCs contribute to the long-lived compartment in the bone marrow.</s><s>The possibility of residual antigen leading to the de novo generation of OVA-specific PCs by residual antigen does not change this interpretation, as longlived PCs are unequivocally identified in our experiments by EdU pulse labeling, but it might lead to an underestimation of the fraction of long-lived cells among the OVA-specific PCs in our experiments.</s></p><p><s>Our findings also underline the potential of CT as a mucosal adjuvant, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> as not only CT-specific but also OVA-specific ASCs persisted in both LP as well as bone marrow when CT was co-administered as adjuvant.</s><s>The potential of CT to elicit longlived systemic PC responses may have an impact for the development of vaccines.</s><s>A fusion protein comprising the CTA1 moiety of CT and a dimer of the S. aureus protein D-fragment has been shown to promote long-term humoral memory development in mice compared with other adjuvants by promoting germinal center responses, with an effect on both memory B-cell and PC numbers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref></s><s>Certain differences exist between the murine and human mucosal immune systems, which, with respect to humoral immunity, include IgA subclass differences (one single IgA subclass in mice vs. two in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> ), the presence of a specific Fc receptor solely for IgA (FcaR1) in humans, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> as well as the dominance of polymeric IgA in the body fluids and transport of polymeric IgA from the circulation into the gut via the hepatobiliary route in mice, whereas in humans IgA is not transported from the circulation into external secretions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref></s><s>These differences have to be taken into account with respect to the effect of bone marrow-derived antibodies on the intestinal immune system.</s><s>However, the finding that plasma blasts generated in mucosal immune responses can have an extended lifetime under certain conditions and can contribute to systemic Ig production by joining the long-lived bone marrow PC pool has to be considered for protective as well as for pathogenic humoral immune responses.</s><s>METHODS Mice and immunizations.</s><s>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River
