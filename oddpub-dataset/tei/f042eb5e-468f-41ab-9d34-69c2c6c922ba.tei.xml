<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CVRC</head><p><s>Visual interpretation confirmed "no evidence of impaired CVRC" in 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT in any cases.</s><s>Visual interpretation of 15 O-water PET revealed CVRC reduction in 8 patients (44%) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Hemisphere-based evaluation of 15 O-water PET showed CVRC reduction in 10 of 30 hemispheres with stenoocclusion.</s><s>All the patients and 80% of the hemispheres with reduced CVRC were primary symptomatic, suggesting the PET finding to be truepositive (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The volume of the CVRC lesions ranged from 79 to 696 mL (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), with a mean rCVRC in the defect ranging from 22.1% to 12.7%.</s></p><p><s>Visual evaluation of the resting 15 O-water PET images of the 8 patients with CVRC reduction (first column in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) revealed normal resting rCBF in the CVRC defect (i.e., stage I impairment of cerebral hemodynamics according to Powers' classification (3), so-called autoregulatory vasodilatation) in 3 of the 8 patients (37.5%), mildly reduced resting rCBF (early stage II impairment, autoregulatory failure) in 4 patients (50%), and moderately reduced resting rCBF (advanced stage II) in one patient (12.5%).</s></p><p><s>For quantitative comparison of SPECT and PET CVRC, the outer contour of the defect (delineated in the PET rCVRC map) was copied to the SPECT rCVRC map (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>SPECT rCVRC in PET lesions ranged from 23.9% to 34.6% (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>SPECT rCVRC was significantly larger than PET rCVRC (P , 0.0005).</s><s>SPECT rCVRC in the PET rCVRC lesions was not significantly different from the normal value of 30% (P 5 0.802).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The main finding of the present study was that brain PET with 15 O-water enables detection of impaired CVRC in a considerable fraction of symptomatic MMV and ACVD patients in whom 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT is negative, that is, does not show impairment of CVRC.</s></p><p><s>PET provides better spatial resolution and better count sensitivity than SPECT, the latter allowing for better statistical image quality in PET after administration of standard tracer doses.</s><s>Mislocalization of scattered photons also contributes to the underestimation of rCBF contrast between high and low rCBF in SPECT (without scatter correction) compared with PET (with scatter correction).</s><s>Furthermore, the kinetics of 15 O-water (freely diffusible and inert) makes 15 O-water PET a better marker of rCBF than 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT (4,5).</s><s>99m Tc-HMPAO is based on the principle of "chemical microspheres," according to which the tracer is fully extracted from arterial blood to tissue during a single capillary passage and then is locally retained in the tissue.</s><s>In case of 99m Tc-HMPAO, fixation in tissue is due to glutathionedependent metabolism to hydrophilic forms and binding to nondiffusible cell components (6,7).</s><s>However, the kinetics of 99m Tc-HMPAO shows considerable violation of the microsphere principle.</s><s>First, glutathione-dependent metabolism is not fast enough to avoid clearance of unmetabolized 99m Tc-HMPAO from tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Second, in resting conditions, only about 70% of 99m Tc-HMPAO in blood is extracted to tissue during a single capillary passage <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>The extraction fraction further decreases with increasing rCBF.</s><s>As a consequence, the acetazolamide-induced increase of local 99m Tc-HMPAO uptake underestimates the actual increase of rCBF.</s><s>The fraction of unmetabolized 99m Tc-HMPAO cleared from tissue before fixation will also increase with increasing rCBF <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>This adds to the deficit by which the percentage increase of 99m Tc-HMPAO retained in tissue lags behind the acetazolamide-induced increase of rCBF.</s><s>These limiting effects are smaller for 15 O-water because of its generally higher extraction fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>This, together with improved image quality of PET compared with SPECT, most likely results in improved sensitivity for the detection of impaired CVRC by acetazolamide challenge, which would explain the findings of this study.</s></p><p><s>A major limitation of the study is its restriction to patients with negative 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT results, which prevents estimation of diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.</s><s>It particularly eliminates the potential to discover cases in which 15 O-water PET is negative and 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT is positive.</s></p><p><s>The strength of the present study is that it is the first head-tohead comparison of 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT and 15 O-water PET for assessment of CVRC in patients with cerebral stenoocclusive diseases.</s><s>Kuwabara et al. compared 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT and 15 O-water PET in patients with cerebral infarction and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) with respect to acetazolamide response in the cerebellum (CVRC in the cerebrum, the measure of interest in presurgical evaluation of MMV or ACVD patients, was not assessed in this study) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>The acetazolamide-induced increase of cerebellar blood flow as measured by 15 O-water PET did not differ between the CCD and the non-CCD side, whereas the percentage increase of cerebellar counts in 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT was significantly smaller in the non-CCD side <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>This obscuring of CCD after acetazolamide challenge in 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT most likely was caused by more pronounced underestimation of acetazolamide-induced rCBF increase in the non-CCD side of the cerebellum because of its higher resting rCBF, in line with the present study.</s></p><p><s>Matsumoto et al. evaluated SPECT with 99m Tc-labeled ethyl cysteinate dimer ( 99m Tc-ECD) for detection of misery perfusion in patients with unilateral chronic occlusive disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>Increased oxygen extraction fraction as measured by PET with 15 O gas was used as the gold standard.</s><s>The area under the receiveroperating-characteristic curve for detection of misery perfusion by the ipsilateral-to-contralateral 99m Tc-ECD uptake in the supply territory of the middle cerebral artery increased from 0.780 to 0.974 (P 5 0.0001) when the 99m Tc-ECD uptake ratio in the middle cerebral artery territory was scaled to the contralateralto-ipsilateral ratio of 99m Tc-ECD uptake in the cerebellum <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>This was due to crossed cerebellar hypoperfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>These findings suggest that the accuracy of brain perfusion SPECT with chemical microspheres such as 99m Tc-ECD and 99m Tc-HMPAO for detection of hemodynamic impairment can be considerably improved  CVRC reduction in left temporooccipital cortex in patient 14 did not reach threshold for automatic delineation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>by combining supratentorial tracer uptake with cerebellar tracer uptake, at least in patients with unilateral chronic occlusive disease.</s></p><p><s>CONCLUSION 15 O-water brain PET under acetazolamide challenge enables detection of impaired CVRC in a considerable fraction of symptomatic patients with stenoocclusive cerebral disease and negative 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT results. 15</s><s>O-water PET is limited in availability to facilities with an on-site cyclotron and radiochemistry support.</s><s>Symptomatic patients with stenoocclusive cerebral disease and 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT suspected to be false negative (;10% of all patients) might be referred to a specialized PET center for 15 O-water PET.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1.
