<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p><s>Enrichment of putative flippases in vital gene candidates.</s><s>For three of the 39 P. falciparum orphan MTPs there is no rodent malaria parasite orthologue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition, GAP40 encodes a member of the glideosome motor complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>As predicted, PbGAP40 is refractory to constitutive gene deletion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Of the remaining 35 P. berghei orphan MTPs, only six (17%) were refractory to repeated gene deletion attempts, using two complementary strategies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>,b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , strongly indicating essential roles during asexual blood-stage growth (Figs 1b,c and 3).</s><s>Corresponding gene deletion lines (mtp À ) could not be generated, but we readily selected endogenously labelled mtp::tag lines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Live fluorescent imaging of intraerythrocytic parasites revealed localization at the parasite-host interface (ATP2 and ATP8) or to intraparasitic structures and the surrounding membranes (ABCI3, ATP7, GCa and DMT2).</s><s>Intriguingly, four essential genes encode signatures of aminophospholipid-transporting P 4 -type ATPases.</s><s>These ATPases are restricted to eukaryotes and facilitate inward translocation of aminophospholipids thereby maintaining their asymmetrical enrichment at the membrane inner leaflet <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>As lipid asymmetry is critical to normal cell functions, our data are consistent with a vital dependence of blood-stage malaria parasites on maintenance of lipid asymmetry.</s><s>This potential vulnerability was previously unrecognized and might inform drug discovery programs.</s></p><p><s>Streamlined phenotyping of viable mtp À lines.</s><s>For 29 target genes (81%), transfection, selection and isolation of isogenic mtplines were successful (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1-3</ref>).</s><s>We established a streamlined and standardized phenotypic screen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), monitoring life cycle progression at four clearly defined checkpoints in the definitive host, female Anopheles mosquitoes, and the intermediate murine host.</s><s>Following intravenous infection of outbred (NMRI) mice with 10 7 infected erythrocytes, parasitaemia (i) and male gamete exflagellation (ii) were quantified three days later.</s><s>Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were allowed to feed on these mice and salivary gland-associated sporozoites (iii) were enumerated at least three weeks later.</s><s>Natural transmission (iv) was monitored after exposure of C57BL/6 mice to 25 mtp À -infected mosquitoes.</s></p><p><s>This screen identified only seven gene deletions with no apparent deficiency at any checkpoint, indicative of dispensable and/or redundant roles for parasite propagation and host switch (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c and 3</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Ablation of nine MTP genes resulted in defects at a single stage or at multiple checkpoints.</s><s>Despite the observed deficiencies, these mtp À lines completed the life cycle, illustrating that life cycle bottlenecks can be readily compensated by subsequent propagation phases in partly attenuated parasites.</s><s>A selection of seven mutants exemplified how such an initial defect does not need to preclude subsequent normal development.</s><s>Sporozoite numbers for the mfs6 À and mfr2 À strains are within the wild-type (WT) range despite severely reduced exflagellation rates, while five mutant lines that show reduced sporozoite numbers transmit normally.</s><s>The remaining thirteen mtp À lines (36%) demonstrated a complete life cycle arrest abrogating transmission between mice.</s></p><p><s>Defects during asexual or sexual blood-stage development.</s><s>We next determined the parasite multiplication rates (PMR) of the four parasite lines that showed the lowest mean parasitaemias in the phenotyping screen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>Thus, we could rule out a growth defect for mfr2 À but uncovered replication defects for zip1 À (68% PMR), mfs6 À (55% PMR) and mfr5 À (36% PMR) parasites, resulting in swift out-competition by WT parasites.</s><s>Growing at a third of the rate of WT blood-stage parasites, MFR5-deficient parasites are the slowest replicating mutants isolated to date and we independently confirmed this outcome (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We detected substantial reductions in male gamete exflagellation and ookinete formation for pat À and cdf À (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b,c</ref>).</s><s>As cdf À , but not pat À , parasites were capable of completing transmission (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) PAT likely exerts additional roles following ookinete formation.</s><s>Remarkably, zip1 À was the only mutant that completely failed to form flagella and, thus, ookinetes and oocysts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b-d</ref>).</s><s>In this mutant, gametocyte numbers were reduced by 80% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>) but most strikingly the male:female ratio was strongly skewed towards female production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>).</s><s>CDF and ZIP1 might participate in the transport of heavy metal ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Our phenotyping, and the known role of a copper-transporting P 1B1 -type ATPase (CuTP) in gamete fertility <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , underscore a possible central role for heavy metal homeostasis in malaria parasites fertility and, perhaps, the germ line of other eukaryotes.</s></p><p><s>Defects during mosquito-stage development.</s><s>Over one third of the targeted MTP genes displayed a first defect in sporozoite colonization of the salivary glands (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c and 3</ref>, and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>These included four of six predicted channels (CTR1, MIT1, MIT2 and MSCS), highlighting their importance for the extracellular growth stage of the parasite.</s><s>Five mtp À lines did not produce any salivary gland-associated sporozoites and two mutants failed to transmit following strongly reduced sporozoite production.</s><s>In-depth phenotyping of three representative mutants (ctr1 À , nt4 À and mfr4 À ) showed normal midgut colonization but attenuation of oocyst development, resulting in either no sporozoites (mfr4 À ) or severely reduced sporozoite colonization of salivary glands (ctr1 À and nt4 À ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Defects during liver-stage development.</s><s>Only two mutants with normal sporozoite production, ctr2 À and mfs6 À , had a distinct defect during natural transmission (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3 and 5b</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>The observed defect in natural transmission of ctr2 À parasites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>) was alleviated by intravenous, but not subcutaneous, syringe delivery of sporozoites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>), and was largely independent of gliding motility (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref>) or liver-stage maturation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d,g</ref>).</s><s>These findings indicate an important role for CTR2 in sporozoite transmission in vivo.</s><s>The critical roles of an alternative zinc-iron permease (ZIPCO) during liver-stage development <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , and of CTR1 and CTR2 described herein, support a link between heavy metal homeostasis and parasite-host switch.</s><s>Furthermore, iron deprivation via hepcidin inhibits liver-stage growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Taken together, the growing evidence indicates that heavy metal homeostasis might become a useful molecular target for causal prophylactic strategies.</s></p><p><s>Genetically modified Plasmodium parasites that are unable to undergo liver-to-blood-stage conversion can be used to experimentally immunize mice resulting in sterile protection against future sporozoite challenge infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Broadly, these genetically arrested parasites fall into two distinct classes: (1) early arrested liver stages that fail to grow in cultured hepatoma cells and show a reduced liver load in vivo, and (2) late arrested parasites that initially grow normally but have a defect in liverstage merozoite formation, correlating with a high liver load in infected mice.</s><s>Only one of the mutant strains, mfs6 À , fulfilled criteria for testing in a preclinical immunization/challenge protocol as a genetically arrested parasite vaccine.</s><s>Fine analysis of the observed defect of mfs6 À parasites in natural transmission revealed occasional (2 out of 9) delayed breakthrough blood infections only after high-dose inoculations with 10,000 mfs6 À sporozoites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</s><s>Numbers and sizes of liver-stage parasites in cultured hepatoma cells were not different from WT parasites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d,e</ref>), though a trend towards slightly reduced sizes in maturing stages was observed.</s><s>Furthermore, we did not detect liver-stage merozoites in mfs6 À -infected cell cultures.</s><s>In contrast with late arresting liver-stage mutants, mfs6 À liver load was largely reduced in vivo (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6f</ref>).</s><s>Intriguingly, DNA staining revealed distorted nuclei displaying weak signals only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6g</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), lending support to an apparent replication deficit.</s><s>Therefore, infections with mfs6 À parasites display defining signatures of late arrest (numbers and morphology) and early arrest (DNA content).</s></p><p><s>Immunizations with late arrested parasites elicit particularly potent and lasting protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>To test the vaccine potential of mfs6 À parasites, we immunized C57BL/6 mice with two low doses of 1,000 mfs6 À sporozoites.</s><s>The immunized mice displayed an average delay to blood infection of 1-2 days upon high-dose sporozoite challenge and one mouse was sterily protected from re-infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6h</ref>).</s><s>Despite this promising result, additional bioengineering efforts, including generation of multiple gene deletions, are required before a late arresting genetically attenuated whole-parasite vaccine can be translated to P. falciparum parasites and potential clinical trials.</s></p><p><s>Concluding remarks.</s><s>Classical reverse genetics and postgenomic approaches continue to provide increasing insights in the functioning of membrane transport proteins in the model yeast S. cerevisiae <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In the present study, we have presented a relatively rapid experimental system to uncover phenotypes and assign in vivo functions to a significant proportion (30%) of the Plasmodium transporters, which could not be inferred on the basis of motifs and sequence similarities with established unicellular model organisms.</s><s>Such insights contribute to a better understanding of Plasmodium metabolism and host cell adaptation, which forms the basis for the rational development of innovative malaria intervention strategies.</s><s>Our data show that MTPs, with the notable exception of ATP-dependent pumps, play a less prominent role than anticipated.</s><s>Systematic target validation is a critical component of the anti-malarial drug and vaccine discovery process.</s><s>This is exemplified herein by the prophylactic and transmission-blocking potential of targeting an MTP putatively involved in heavy metal homeostasis during malaria parasite-host switches; the vaccine potential of genetically arrested parasites that lack a parasite-specific MTP of the major facilitator superfamily; and the possibility for  therapeutic intervention targeting putative aminophospholipid translocases.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ABCI3 PBANKA_121880 ATP2 PBANKA_143480 ATP7 PBANKA_080630 ATP8 PBANKA_143830 GC PBANKA_091030 DMT2 PBANKA_061460 ZIP1 PBANKA_010770 MFR5 PBANKA_091830 MFS6 PBANKA_130470 MFR2 PBANKA_020840 NPT1 PBANKA_020830 PAT PBANKA_030390 CDF PBANKA_142220 GC PBANKA_113670 MFS2 PBANKA_081700 NT4 PBANKA_020990 MFR4 PBANKA_081570 MIT2 PBANKA_140270 CTR1 PBANKA_130290 MFS1 PBANKA_123130 MSCS PBANKA_093900 MIT1 PBANKA_092790 MFR3 PBANKA_041050 MFS3 PBANKA_082040 MATE PBANKA_030970 CTR2 PBANKA_102150 MDR2 PBANKA_131170 DMT1 PBANKA_142210 ABCG2 PBANKA_101810 MFS5 PBANKA_101640 MIT3 PBANKA_101700 NT2 PBANKA_070620 MFS4 PBANKA_060240<label>TPT3</label></formula></div>
