results of our study are similar to the results of the above-mentioned studies in terms of study method.</s><s>As a result of our study, it can be said that farmers are not well informed of and/or insensitive to the environmental and human health hazards of empty pesticide containers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion and Recommendations</head><p><s>(1) Inadequate information on safe application of pesticides and deficiencies in the use of personal protective equipment can seriously weaken the ability of farmers to protect themselves against potential risks of pesticides.</s><s>Education of farmers can be considered as one of the most important methods of eliminating unsafe use of pesticides.</s><s>Education programs should target areas where farmers' knowledge is weak.</s></p><p><s>(2) The main objectives of the education that will be provided to farmers can include ensuring that they understand health hazards associated with pesticides and that they use the most appropriate protective equipment, implement personal hygiene precautions, and become aware of early symptoms of exposure.</s></p><p><s>(3) The rate of storing pesticides at home was found to be high, and this reveals that children and adolescents are at risk.</s><s>In addition, it can be said that the general population is also at risk due to throwing empty pesticide containers into rubbish bin or leaving them on the field at a certain rate.</s></p><p><s>In order to protect health of people, it is necessary to make health education programs to improve attitudes and behaviors.</s><s>In addition, unsafe disposal of pesticide containers by the farmers in our study indicates that in addition to solid waste collection systems it is also necessary for local administrations to work through healthy and safe collection of pesticide wastes, especially during agricultural spraying seasons.</s></p><p><s>(4) The use of protective equipment and personal hygiene habits are important in protection from pesticide exposure.</s><s>In this respect, it should be ensured that farmers are provided with personal protective equipment along with pesticides and clear guidelines on protective measures must be available in the pesticide boxes, and farmers should receive health education on safe use of pesticides.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1: Study area: (a) Turkey, (b) Adana Province, and (c) Karatas ¸District.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="2,348.60,297.80,138.07,198.46" type="bitmap" /></figure>
