The reversibility of cancer cell growth inhibition after drug removal has clinical implications.</s><s>In this study, we further evaluated the effects of meridianin C withdrawal on cell survival and macropinocytosis in YD-10B cells.</s><s>We found that meridianin C's anti-survival and macropinocytosis inducing effects on YD-10B cells were reversible.</s><s>Several reports have recently described that hyper-stimulation of macropinocytosis and/or disruption of normal macropinosome maturation associated with abnormal/massive accumulation of intracellular vacuoles leads to the cytotoxicity and/or nonapoptotic cell death of cancer cells. 45-47</s><s>We would similarly speculate that the anti-survival effect of meridianin C on YD-10B cells is closely linked to this druginduced rapid and sustained accumulation of macropinosomes in the cells.</s><s>We have similarly found that meridianin C can induce macropinocytosis (macropinosomes) in HSC-3 cells, another human tongue cancer cell line, indicating that the meridianin C's macropinocytosis effects are not limited to YD-10B cells.</s><s>Further characterization of meridianin C's responses in YD-10B cells compared to YD-8 and F I G U R E 8 Reversibility of the meridianin C's actions on macropinocytosis and cell survival in YD-10B cells.</s><s>(A) Schematic outline of the experimental setup: The double-headed arrows indicate the length of meridianin C (1 μM) treatment.</s><s>(B) YD-10B cells were treated with meridianin C (1 μM) or vehicle control (DMSO) for the indicated time periods.</s><s>At each time-point, images were obtained by phase contrast microscopy, 400 X.</s><s>Each image is representative of three independent experiments.</s><s>(C) YD-10B cells were treated with meridianin C (1 μM) or vehicle control (DMSO) for the indicated time periods, and the cell count assay performed in triplicate.</s><s>Data are mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.</s><s>*P &lt; 0.05 compared to the control at the indicated time.</s><s>#P &lt; 0.05 compared to the value of meridianin C at the indicated time-point YD-38 cells, which are unresponsive to meridianin C, may further help to elucidate its mechanism of action.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
