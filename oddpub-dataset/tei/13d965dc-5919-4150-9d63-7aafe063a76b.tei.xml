<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Global deregulation of DNA methylation is one of the crucial causes of hepato cellular carcinoma (HCC).</s><s>It has been reported that the anti-cancer drug 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) mediates the activation of tumor suppressor genes through passive demethylation by inhibiting DNMT1.</s><s>Recent evidence suggests that active demethylation which is mediated by ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins may also be an important step to control global methylation.</s><s>However, there exists a controversial discussion in which TET proteins are involved in the demethylation process in HCC.</s><s>Therefore, we firstly wanted to identify which of the TETs are involved in demethylation and later to study whether or not 5-AZA could trigger the TET-dependent active demethylation process in HCC.</s><s>HCC cell lines (Huh-7, HLE, HLF), primary human hepatocytes (hHeps), and tissues from both healthy (55 patients) and HCC patients (55 patients) were included in this study; mRNA levels of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1, 2) and TETs (TET1-3) were studied via qPCR and confirmed by Western blot.</s><s>The expression of 5hmC/5mC was determined by immunohistochemistry in human HCC tissues and the corresponding adjacent healthy liver.</s><s>HCC cell lines were stimulated with 5-AZA (0-20 μM) and viability (Resazurin conversion), toxicity (LDH release), proliferation (PCNA), and 5hmC/5mC distribution were assessed.</s><s>In addition, knockdown experiments on TET proteins in HCC cell lines using short interference RNAs (siRNAs), in the presence and absence of 5-AZA, were performed.</s></p><p><s>Results: Our data applying qPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting clearly show that TET2 and TET3 but not TET1 were significantly decreased in HCC tissue and different HCC cell lines compared to non-tumor liver tissues and hHeps.</s><s>In addition, we show here for the first time applying knockdown experiments that 5-AZA is able to trigger an active TET2-dependent demethylation process with concomitant significant changes in 5hmC/5mC in HCC cell lines and hHeps.</s><s>Conclusions: Our data clearly show that the expression and activity of TET2 and TET3 proteins but not TET1 are impaired in hepatocellular carcinoma leading to the reduction of 5hmC in HCCs.</s><s>Furthermore, this study identified a novel function of 5-azacytidine in promoting a TET-mediated generation of 5hmC suggesting that the availability of 5-AZA in cancer cells will have various effects on different epigenetic targets.</s><s>These findings may open new therapeutic strategies for epigenetic drugs to treat HCC.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>In the past years, epigenetic studies have focused on DNA methylation in mammals.</s><s>DNA methylation plays an important role in genomic imprinting, especially in the inactivation pattern of X-chromosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, the silencing of retrotransposon, and activation of tissue-specific genes.</s><s>Recently, it has been demonstrated that these epigenetic changes have an influence in various pathologies and gene therapies, for instance, in cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, viral infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and the activity of mobile elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Methylation at the C-5 position of cytosine (C) has long been considered to be the only biologically functional epigenetic modification of the animal genomic DNA.</s><s>In mammalians, 5-methylcytosines (5mC) established by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), mainly at CpG dinucleotides, is associated with gene repression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Loss of methylation was observed during the development processes.</s><s>Therefore, it was suggested that DNA methylation is reversible either through passive demethylation via DNA replication or by active demethylation via DNA repair followed by base excision repair of modified nucleotides or DNA glycosidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, it has been shown in many studies that active demethylation does occur in many mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>The most well-known example is the rapid loss of 5mC immunoreactivity of the paternal pronucleus in the zygote after fertilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The active DNA demethylation pathway is enabled by the ten-eleven translocation proteins (TETs), named after the ten-eleven translocation (q22, q23) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref> occurring in rare cases of acute myeloid and lymphocytic leukemia, which all belong to the family of Fe(II)/2-oxyglutarate-dependent dioxygenases <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>5mC is oxidized by TET proteins and thereby converted to 5hmC, 5fC, and 5CaC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>TET proteins mediate the DNA demethylation process and increase the diversity of the epigenetic state of genomic DNA.</s><s>It was suggested that 5hmC represents an intermediate product in the active DNA demethylation process possibly following a demethylation mechanism through the thymidine salvage pathway to repair DNA alkylation damages <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The loss of 5hmC, together with a downregulation or mutation of TET proteins, have been reported in numerous types of cancer, e.g., melanoma, breast, prostate, myeloid, brain, and liver cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>For example, mutations of TET2 protein have been recorded in patients with different myeloid malignancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>A number of studies have provided an important link between TET2 dysfunction, an oncogenic metabolite 2hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), myeloid differentiation, and malignancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is frequently caused by a hepatitis virus B and C infection or alcohol abuse, is the most common type of primary liver cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>The mechanisms that lead to HCC development are still unclear.</s><s>Beside many possibilities that may lead to HCC development, it has been shown that accumulation of genetic abnormalities such as chromosomal alterations and gene amplifications, mutations along epigenetic alterations can trigger HCC development <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, a particular focus has been directed towards abnormal DNA methylation at the fifth position of cytosine (5mC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the detection of DNA methylation may provide a potential application for the clinical diagnosis of HCC.</s><s>Liu and colleagues have reported that a reduction of 5hmC is associated with progression of liver cancer through downregulation of TET1 protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, Gao et al. have studied nine samples and reported not only the downregulation of TET1 but also of TET2 mRNA levels with a concomitant decrease of 5hmC.</s><s>The researchers, however, found no change in TET3 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma compared to normal liver samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, in another study by <ref type="bibr">Yang et al.</ref>, the decrease of all three TET genes was shown in three pairs of frozen human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue compared to matched normal liver tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Despite accumulating evidence for the correlation between loss and decrease of 5hmC and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, it remains totally unclear, which of the TET proteins seems to be responsible for the loss of active demethylation pattern in HCC.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to conventional or molecularly targeted therapies for inhibiting dysregulated genes or signaling pathways in HCC, epigenetic drugs may provide an alternative approach by reversing the methylation status.</s><s>5-Azacytidine is known as a DNA methyltranferase inhibitor (DNMTi), which is clinically approved for the treatment of myelodysplasia syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>However, the role of 5-azacytidine in active demethylation pathway is not clear.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, because of the apparent debate, which TET proteins are involved in 5hmC/5mC regulation in HCC, our primary aim of this study was to identify which TET protein play a crucial role in the regulation of 5hmC and 5mC in HCC.</s><s>Furthermore, we wanted to know whether or not 5-AZA triggers a TET-dependent active demethylation process in HCC controlling 5hmC/5mC regulation.</s></p></div>
