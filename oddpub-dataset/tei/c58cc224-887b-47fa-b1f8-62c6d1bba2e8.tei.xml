<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists are widely used to treat diabetes.</s><s>However, their function is dependent on adequate GLP1R expression, which is downregulated in diabetes.</s><s>GLP1R is highly expressed on pancreatic b-cells, and activation by endogenous incretin or GLP1R agonists increases cAMP generation, which stimulates glucose-induced b-cell insulin secretion and helps maintain glucose homeostasis.</s><s>We now have discovered that the highly b-cell-enriched microRNA, miR-204, directly targets the 39 UTR of GLP1R and thereby downregulates its expression in the b-cell-derived rat INS-1 cell line and primary mouse and human islets.</s><s>Furthermore, in vivo deletion of miR-204 promoted islet GLP1R expression and enhanced responsiveness to GLP1R agonists, resulting in improved glucose tolerance, cAMP production, and insulin secretion as well as protection against diabetes.</s><s>Since we recently identified thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) as an upstream regulator of miR-204, we also assessed whether in vivo deletion of TXNIP could mimic that of miR-204.</s><s>Indeed, it also enhanced islet GLP1R expression and GLP1R agonist-induced insulin secretion and glucose tolerance.</s><s>Thus, the present studies show for the first time that GLP1R is under the control of a microRNA, miR-204, and uncover a previously unappreciated link between TXNIP and incretin action.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>miR-204 Regulates GLP1R Expression in Rat INS-1 Cells and Primary Mouse and Human Islets</head><p><s>Next, we analyzed the effects of miR-204 on endogenous GLP1R in primary human and mouse islets and in rat INS-1 cells.</s><s>Consistent with the results of our 39 UTR luciferase assays, we found that miR-204 overexpression led to a decrease in GLP1R mRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref>) and protein expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), whereas knockdown of miR-204 with anti-miR-204 resulted in a significant increase in GLP1R expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>These results demonstrate that miR-204 indeed regulates endogenous GLP1R and that this effect is not restricted to a cell line or a particular species.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Taken together, our work provides the first demonstration that GLP1R is under the control of an miRNA.</s><s>Moreover, our findings in rat INS-1 cells and primary mouse and human islets as well as in vivo in miR-204-and TXNIPdeficient mouse models reveal that TXNIP-induced miR-204 regulates islet GLP1R expression and that lack of miR-204 or TXNIP promotes the b-cell response to GLP1R agonists, enhances insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis, and has protective effects in the context of diabetes.</s></p><p><s>The sequence of miR-204 is well conserved between human, rat, and mouse, and it initially was just described to be expressed in kidney, retina, and insulinomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(42)</ref>, but it has now been identified as the most highly enriched miRNA in human b-cells as opposed to a-cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(6)</ref>, suggesting that miR-204 may play a particularly important role in b-cell biology.</s><s>In fact, our current discovery of miR-204 downregulating islet GLP1R, which is critical  diabetes.diabetesjournals.org</s><s>incretin-mediated insulin secretion, is in line with this notion, as are our previous observations of miR-204 targeting the major insulin transcription factor MafA and downregulating insulin production <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>It is also interesting to note that by doing so, miR-204 can inhibit both insulin synthesis and GLP1R-mediated insulin secretion.</s><s>Together with our recent finding that miR-204 also regulates b-cell ER stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7)</ref>, these results indeed suggest that this miRNA may act as a linchpin in the control of b-cell function and stress response.</s><s>Moreover, deletion of miR-204 also had protective effects in the context of diabetes and, like deletion of TXNIP, resulted in improved glucose control and increased insulin levels, suggesting that at least some of the previously described beneficial effects of TXNIP inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref> might be mediated by miR-204 downregulation.</s><s>Furthermore, the fact that the protective effects of miR-204 deletion were dependent on intact GLP1R signaling and blunted by a GLP1R antagonist underlines the important role that GLP1R regulation plays in mediating the miR-204 effects.</s></p><p><s>We have previously shown that TXNIP is upregulated by glucose and diabetes and induces b-cell apoptosis <ref type="bibr">(21-23, 37,39)</ref> and have established TXNIP inhibition as a novel approach to protect against b-cell death, promote b-cell mass, and prevent diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">37)</ref>, and this was validated by us and others in different models <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(45)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, we further found that TXNIP regulates b-cell miRNA expression and in particular induces expression of miR-204 and thereby inhibits insulin transcription (4).</s><s>Our current results now indicate for the first time that by controlling GLP1R, TXNIP can also regulate GLP1R agonist-mediated insulin secretion, revealing a novel link between TXNIP and incretin action.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with this notion, the effects of TXNIP or miR-204 deletion on glucose tolerance were primarily observed in response to Ex-4 and therefore seem to be dependent on the upregulation of GLP1R.</s><s>In fact, the results of regular glucose tolerance tests in the absence of Ex-4 were not significantly altered in our bTKO or 204KO mice showing no significant improvement in blood glucose, glucose AUC, insulin secretion, or cAMP production as compared with control mice.</s><s>Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional targets of miR-204, such as MafA (4) or PERK <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7)</ref>, might contribute to the overall improvement in b-cell function in response to miR-204 deletion.</s><s>In future studies, it therefore will be interesting to further explore the effects this miRNA may have on the dynamics of intracellular cAMP production, as it has previously been linked to granular priming and exocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(46)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, it is also conceivable that the higher expression level of GLP1R in the bTKO mice as compared with controls may facilitate endogenous GLP-1 function and thereby may have contributed to the improved glucose homeostasis observed in these TXNIP-deficient mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Also, we have previously shown that GLP1R agonist treatment results in decreased islet TXNIP expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(47)</ref>.</s><s>Now our data indicate that TXNIP inhibits GLP1R expression, suggesting that by doing so, it may diminish the effects of GLP-1, which theoretically would promote TXNIP expression.</s><s>Interestingly, we have recently described a TXNIP-positive feed-forward loop that would be consistent with such an idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(48)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Type 2 diabetes is a growing public health problem, and inadequate b-cell function and insulin secretion are key factors in its pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(49)</ref>.</s><s>Many new diabetes drugs have therefore been developed over the last several decades that attempt to address these issues.</s><s>However, many have significant side effects, and aside from metformin, incretin mimetics are the only class of antidiabetes drugs that is unlikely to cause hypoglycemia and that is not associated with any weight gain.</s><s>GLP-1 analogs and DPP-4 inhibitors have therefore become widely used in patients with type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25)</ref>.</s><s>Obviously, a prerequisite for their function is an adequate expression level of GLP1R, and this is also true for some newly developed synthetic small molecule stimulators of GLP-1 release (50).</s><s>However, GLP1R expression has been shown to be downregulated in response to hyperglycemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15)</ref>, and less GLP1R staining was observed in islets of patients with type 2 diabetes as compared with control subjects without diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Given this challenge, it is not surprising that mechanisms that might enhance GLP1R activity and lead to targets that could help overcome this hurdle have received significant attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">52)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the meantime though, incretin mimetic drugs are just used at high enough doses to elicit the desired effects on b-cell insulin secretion and glucose control.</s><s>Although incretin mimetics have many advantages, they are also associated with dose-dependent adverse effects, most commonly nausea and delayed gastric emptying <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31)</ref>, as well as some rare and still controversial side effects, including the elevated risk for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, even though the latter seems now to have been effectively rebutted <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref>.</s><s>These side effects are not necessarily surprising given the fact that GLP1R is expressed not only in pancreatic b-cells but also in in the exocrine pancreas, stomach, and brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, being able to selectively promote b-cell GLP1R activity would be highly beneficial in terms of avoiding some of these adverse effects.</s></p><p><s>Intriguingly, like GLP1R, miR-204 is also highly expressed in pancreatic b-cells (2,4,6); however, we found very little miR-204 expression in other GLP1R-expressing tissues, such as stomach or exocrine pancreas, and consistent with that, deletion of miR-204 did not affect GLP1R expression in these tissues, even though it effectively increased b-cell GLP1R expression.</s><s>This raises the attractive possibility that by inhibiting miR-204, for example with an RNA therapeutic, one could confer b-cell-specific induction of GLP1R expression and, when combined with an incretin mimetic, safely enhance the effectiveness of this diabetes treatment.</s><s>Moreover, this novel concept of inhibiting an miRNA in a nontargeted manner, but taking advantage of its restricted tissue distribution, and thereby selectively upregulating its target genes in that tissue may have far reaching implications for miRNA biology and tissue-specific gene targeting in general.</s></p></div>
