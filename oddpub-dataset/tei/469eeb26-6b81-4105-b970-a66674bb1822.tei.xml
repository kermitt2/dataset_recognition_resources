<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Tungiasis, a zoonotic parasitic dermatosis of humans and a wide range of domestic and wild mammals, is caused by the female penetrating sand flea, Tunga penetrans.</s><s>Currently, it is endemic in Latin America, the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa with a patchy distribution; mostly occurring in poor communities and often causing severe morbidity in both human and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The disease is largely neglected in tropical human and veterinary medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Pigs have been identified as the most important animal reservoirs of T. penetrans in sub-Saharan Africa.</s><s>Frequently, they suffer from high parasite loads and severe morbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Most sand fleas localize on the coronary band and bulbs of the digits <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> but other body parts which contact or are close to the ground such as mammary glands, snout, legs, perineum and the tail may also be affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Proper and early diagnosis of tungiasis is essential for timely and appropriate treatment as well as control in order to abate its effects on animal health.</s><s>Studies focusing on the clinical presentations of tungiasis and its significance to animal wellbeing and health are very limited.</s><s>Consequently, many animal health workers, at least in the highly endemic areas in Uganda, are not aware of the clinical significance of tungiasis and often consider it an insignificant nuisance which hardly requires veterinary medical care <ref type="bibr">(Mutebi, unpublished findings)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, many cases go unattended despite detrimental effects on public and animal health.</s><s>The accruing losses may hamper economic development of impoverished communities located in endemic areas.</s></p><p><s>Clinical tungiasis in pigs has barely been described.</s><s>We have recently described and analyzed the general manifestations of tungiasis in pigs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The study identified a wide range of associated clinical presentations such as hoof wall erosion, necrosis, pain, edema and skin fissures in a population of pigs with 1-246 lesions per animal (median 8) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The aim of this case report series is to describe in detail severe pig tungiasis detected during the same survey and a later treatment study on animal tungiasis in Busoga sub region, Uganda, which were conducted during the dry seasons of January to March in 2014 and 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>The findings indicate that during periods of high transmission, pigs may harbor very high intensities of embedded sand fleas leading to severe clinical and pathological manifestations.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study villages and pig population</head><p><s>Severely infected pigs were identified in two endemic villages (Busindha and Masolya, Bulidha Sub County, Bugiri District) during a survey and a treatment study <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>Since the intensity of embedded sand fleas strongly correlates with the severity of clinical tungiasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, only pigs with over 100 embedded sand fleas are presented here to demonstrate the occurrence and clinical features of severe pig tungiasis caused by T. penetrans.</s><s>All pigs were of mixed breeds (unknown parentage due to random mating) whose management system was rather homogeneous in the two villages.</s><s>In all cases, pigs had no formal housing but were occasionally confined under tree/shrub shades close to human compounds (0-10 m) with minimal attention to hygiene.</s><s>Thus, the grounds of the pig dwellings were heavily contaminated with wasted pig feeds and feces.</s><s>During the crop harvesting periods, which are the dry seasons, the pigs were allowed to roam on compounds and the neighborhood with minimal restrictions.</s><s>Parasite control was not routinely undertaken and farmer animal husbandry advisory services were generally lacking.</s><s>Pigs and goats were the major livestock but other domestic mammalian and avian species were also being raised.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diagnosis of tungiasis</head><p><s>A systematic clinical examination was performed after thorough washing of the digits with soap, water and a scrubbing brush to aid lesion detection.</s><s>Diagnosis of tungiasis was based on clinical features of tungiasis which included: a dark brown to black spot surrounded by a zone of hyperemia or edema (stage II), a 2-13 mm circular raised yellow to white nodule with a dark center (stage III), a circular and raised brown to black patch in the middle of a necrotic area with or without erosions or ulcers (stage IV) and an epidermal circular shallow crater with necrotic edges (stage V) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In a detailed clinical examination, lesions were assigned to a particular stage (I-V) according to the Fortaleza classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> as briefly described above, counted and their location noted as infection sites.</s><s>Since most lesions occurred on the distal limb, each limb was divided into four topographic sites each representing a principal or an accessory digit up to the distal metacarpal or metatarsal joints.</s><s>This results in 16 digits for the four limbs of a pig.</s><s>Embedded sand fleas which were localized on other additional sites of the body such as the scrotum, tail, snout and the skin along the metacarpals or metatarsals were also recorded and considered ectopic.</s><s>The clinical and pathological features which were associated with the embedded sand fleas were also described in detail and reported.</s><s>The penetrated fleas were identified as T. penetrans <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> based on the morphological features of the neosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>The 10 pig cases selected and described here were those with the highest number of embedded sand fleas among a total of 183 infected pigs identified during the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and the field treatment trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment of pigs with embedded sand fleas</head><p><s>All cases were treated with the Supona® aerosol (chlorfenvinphos, dichlorvos and gentian violet; previously Pfizer Laboratories (Pty) Ltd., now Zoetis, South Africa), a formulation licensed in Uganda to treat tick infestations, myiasis and wound sepsis in animals.</s><s>The aerosol was applied on all the 16 digits of affected pigs after washing them with water and a brush.</s><s>The aerosol was only applied to other ectopic sites when they had embedded sand fleas.</s><s>Pigs were treated weekly for three consecutive times.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Data were entered into Microsoft Excel 2007 sheets, double checked against written data collection forms and then transferred to Stata® Software package, Version 13 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas 77,845 USA, stata@stata.com)</s><s>for analysis.</s><s>Descriptive statistics were generated.</s></p></div>

manifestations of tungiasis in pigs and dogs, some of which with significant effects to animal health were described <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, tungiasis mainly occurs in impoverished communities with limited veterinary services.</s><s>Also there is limited awareness of animal health workers on the impact of tungiasis on animal health.</s><s>These circumstances may contribute to the wrong impression that tungiasis is a mere nuisance to animals.</s><s>Consequently, many cases go undetected and are therefore not treated <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The ten clinical cases described had more than 100 lesions per pig.</s><s>This data shows that high intensity of infection causes a severe morbidity, a finding very similar to the human situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>This further highlights the animal health significance of T. penetrans infections in pigs.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, the parasite loads reported here in some pigs constitute the highest intensity of T. penetrans ever reported among pigs or any other susceptible mammalian species <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There was an extremely high number of sand fleas per individual animal of which most of the lesions were condensed on a limited skin surface area.</s><s>Whether this observation represents a high infection pressure from the environment or even an aggregation by the sand fleas themselves needs to be subjected to further investigations.</s></p><p><s>Once a sand flea penetrates the skin, it increases in size, evoking severe inflammation and itching <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The later predisposes the host to self-mutilation through scratching of affected sites or rubbing them against other objects or hard surfaces.</s><s>The resulting erosions, ulcers, necrosis and skin cracks create entry points of pathogenic bacteria and facilitate penetration by free living sand fleas.</s><s>This, together with the lack of regular onhost ectoparasite control among the pig owners, may have contributed to the high infection intensities and severe morbidity observed among the pigs.</s></p><p><s>A high rate of bacterial super infections through sand flea infected parts of the skin among pigs with high sand flea burden probably contributed to the significant clinical and morpho-pathological findings.</s><s>Furthermore, repeated infections and the associated sequelae contributed to the deformities, loss of claws and lameness as seen in the cases presented here.</s><s>Lameness accruing from painful lesions on the digits may limit pig movement.</s><s>Considering the scavenging management system in the study area, reduced pig movement is likely to lower the pigs' ability to search for food, an outcome which may contribute to stunted growth.</s><s>Also, tungiasis may contribute to reduced market value of affected pigs.</s><s>Persistence of animal tungiasis in endemic communities may deter their economic development.</s><s>In order to arouse more interest of stakeholders on animal tungiasis, studies appraising the economic significance of pig tungiasis should be carried out in endemic areas.</s><s>An ancillary finding is the observation that 9/10 severely infected pigs were co-infested with at least one other ectoparasite (ticks, mites and/or lice).</s><s>Again, the situation is very similar to that in human tungiasis, where affected individuals showed co-infection with Sarcoptes scabiei, head lice or zoonotic hookworm larvae migrating in the skin <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Fortunately, diagnosis of tungiasis is easy and cheap since it is based on visual detection of characteristic T. penetrans lesions in the skin usually of the digits.</s><s>Early detection and treatment are critical for quick recovery.</s><s>After treatment with an insecticidal aerosol, healing occurred with re-epithelialization of the skin in uncomplicated cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>However, severe cases require two or three weekly applications as demonstrated here.</s><s>Nevertheless, this treatment protocol enables farmers in endemic areas to manage any cases as soon as they are detected.</s><s>This has the potential to prevent tungiasis-induced lameness and other complications in the absence of veterinary services.</s><s>Furthermore, such a treatment schedule is expected to reduce the contamination of the environment with T. penetrans eggs and thereby contribute to improved human health in endemic communities.</s><s>Besides the treatment of clinical cases, efforts should also be geared towards farmer education on the diagnosis, prevention and control of tungiasis among animals as well as humans.</s></p></div>
