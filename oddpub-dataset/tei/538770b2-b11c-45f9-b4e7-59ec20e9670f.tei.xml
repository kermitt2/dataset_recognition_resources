<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Cohort</head><p><s>The study was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and approved by the Institutional Review Board.</s><s>This two-center study consisted of patients with liver metastases from RCC treated with TACE or Y-90 procedures at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore and the Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago from 2000 to 2014.</s><s>A review of the prospectively collected imaging databases at both institutions identified 24 patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Patients that were included into the final survival analysis fulfilled the following criteria: 1) diagnosis of RCC liver metastases confirmed by pathological criteria; 2) patients were IAT naive; and 3) patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR or CT imaging before and after the first IAT.</s><s>Seven patients were excluded for the following reasons: previous IAT (n= 3) and absence of baseline and/or follow-up MRI (n= 7).</s><s>On the basis of these criteria, the final study population included 14 patients.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MR and CT Imaging Protocol</head><p><s>All patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR or CT imaging at baseline and approximately 3 to 4 weeks after IAT.</s><s>MRIs were obtained on a 1.5-T MRI scanner (Magnetom Avanto; Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany) using a phased array torso coil.</s><s>Standard MR liver protocol included the following: axial T2-weighted fast spin-echo images, axial single-shot breath-hold gradient-echo diffusion-weighted echo-planar images, and axial breath-hold unenhanced and contrast-enhanced (0.1 mmol/kg of intravenous gadodiamide [Omniscan; Amersham, Princeton, NJ]) T1-weighted 3D fat-suppressed spoiled gradient-echo.</s><s>CT scans were obtained on a Lightspeed scanner (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ).</s><s>A triphasic contrast-enhanced CT liver protocol was employed that used a standard power injector (Medrad, Indianola, PA) connected to an intravenous catheter to inject 125 ml of Omnipaque 350 (GE Healthcare) at a rate of 4 to 5 ml/sec.</s><s>All contrast-enhanced images were acquired in the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases (20, 70, and 180 seconds after intravenous contrast administration, respectively).</s></p></div>

response and predicts survival in patients with metastatic RCC early after the first IAT procedure.</s></p><p><s>Metastatic RCC is one of the most treatment-resistant malignancies, and the prognosis is highly dependent on tumor progression in the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is crucial to assess tumor response early after treatment to guide the course of therapy and prevent loss of time.</s></p><p><s>This study showed that conventional anatomical response assessment methods (RECIST and WHO) fail to differentiate between responders and nonresponders.</s><s>Although mRECIST and EASL are able to identify response to treatment in some patients, both fail to reach statistical significance.</s><s>qEASL is the only set of criteria that reliably predicts patient survival and can therefore be seen as the ideal assessment method to evaluate early tumor response to IAT.</s></p><p><s>One reason uni-and bidimensional tumor response criteria fail to predict survival might be the wrong assumption that tumor diameter (RECIST and WHO) and enhancing tumor diameter (mRECIST and EASL) are directly correlated with the volume of viable tumor.</s><s>In fact, most tumors show asymmetrical growth and heterogeneous patterns of necrosis after treatment, resulting in misleading findings when using diameter-and enhancing diameter-based methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Taking these tumor characteristics into account, the intellectual approach behind qEASL is a 3D quantitative technique that allows to accurately assess viable tumor volume.</s><s>Time efficiency and feasibility in a clinical setting as well as histopathological correlation could be shown in recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>.</s><s>Although not uncommon, literature on liver metastases from RCC and especially on response to IAT is scarce.</s><s>The largest prospective study included 22 patients that were treated repeatedly with TACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Treatment response was evaluated with the RECIST criteria 4 weeks after treatment.</s><s>Partial response was achieved in 13.7%.</s><s>However, RECIST failed to predict patient survival, which corresponds with our findings.</s><s>In contrast, when tumor response is evaluated with qEASL, our study is able to reliably identify responders and nonresponders after IAT and predict survival.</s></p><p><s>Another retrospective study looked at safety and efficacy of Y-90 radioembolization in six patients with metastatic RCC to the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Tumor response of these patients was evaluated using the mRECIST and EASL criteria.</s><s>The authors only reported the best response on any of the follow-up images acquired 2 to 3 months after IAT and every 3 months thereafter.</s><s>Three patients showed CR and one patient PR.</s><s>However, in terms of survival prediction, a major drawback of this study is the long time frame needed until treatment success or failure was reliably evaluated.</s><s>The advantage of qEASL is not only the reliable prediction of patient survival but also to do so at an early time point, approximately 3 to 4 weeks after treatment.</s></p><p><s>There were several limitations to this study.</s><s>First, the study cohort is relatively small.</s><s>However, patients with liver-dominant metastatic RCC are rare, and it is very unlikely to find a bigger cohort of patients without endangering the consistency of treatment protocols.</s><s>Our study is a two-center study that includes patients that were treated with TACE and Y-90.</s><s>Both techniques form a mainstay of interventional oncology.</s><s>The fact that qEASL works regardless of the used treatment technique is clearly a strength of this study.</s><s>Second, for all TACE treatments, only patients with pre-and posttreatment MRI were included.</s><s>This might have caused a bias.</s><s>However, the measurement of enhancement on CT scans after TACE is limited by the accumulation of iodized oil in the target region.</s><s>For patients with Y-90 treatments, this limitation does not apply, and response to treatment was measured on MRI as well as on CT scans, respectively.</s><s>This is another big advantage of qEASL because it can be used with both MRI as well as CT scans as long as baseline imaging and follow-up imaging are consistent.</s><s>Third, the study lacks histopathological validation of radiological measurements.</s><s>Yet, it is quite unrealistic to acquire this validation because patients not considered amendable for resection are referred to IAT treatment.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the presented results show that quantitative volumetric tumor enhancement (qEASL) is an early surrogate biomarker of survival in patients with RCC metastatic to the liver after one session of IAT.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
