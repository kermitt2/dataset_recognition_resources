<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We here investigated the effect of a pharmacological ketamine challenge on resting state connectivity and NBRs during emotional processing in anterior and posterior DMN regions and its modulation by response style (rumination and distraction).</s></p><p><s>In previous studies, high resting state neural activity in anterior DMN regions has been suggested as a marker for high degrees of self-relatedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Schneider et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In accordance with that finding, deactivation (i.e.</s><s>NBRs) in the pACC has been found to be decreased in MDD patients during emotional stimulation, which was positively correlated with elevated self-focus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Grimm et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Grimm et al., , 2011))</ref>.</s><s>Here, we report as our key finding a significant increase in NBRs to negative and aversive stimuli in the same brain region in healthy subjects 24 h after ketamine administration compared with placebo.</s><s>Considering that the antidepressant effect of ketamine is most pronounced within that time range as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Zarate et al., 2006)</ref>, our finding suggests that ketamine enhances NBRs during emotional processing.</s><s>The finding that increased NBRs were only observable during the presentation of negative and not positive stimuli emphasizes the involvement of the pACC in the processing of negative stimuli.</s><s>Moreover, by applying the same analysis to the dPCC, a region belonging to the DMN but to a lesser extent involved in affective processing, we controlled for the specificity of the pACC.</s><s>However, the NBRs in the dPCC were unchanged over the four measurements, suggesting a local region specific effect of ketamine and a general effect on cerebral blood flow seems less likely.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, we were able to reveal that the increased NBRs in the pACC from pre to 24 h post ketamine administration were   particularly pronounced for subjects with low levels on the distraction scale.</s><s>Distraction is considered an adaptive and effective coping mechanism during the experience of unpleasant situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nolen-Hoeksema et al., 2008)</ref> and is often insufficiently applied by depressive patients, while its integration in therapeutic learning reduces depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fennell and Teasdale, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fennell et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>On a continuous scale, subjects with an inability to apply distraction appropriately might be more prone to develop depressed mood.</s><s>Reacting with distraction during an unpleasant situation reduces chances to internalize negative feelings related to the experience, while an inability to use distraction results in an increased affective load and self-focus.</s><s>The attenuation of NBRs after ketamine, particularly in subjects with an impaired ability to use distraction, might therefore reflect a reduction of involvement and selffocus during negative emotional experiences.</s><s>Following this reasoning, it is conceivable that participants who apply distraction to a lesser extent benefit more from ketamine's effect, whereby the pACC's ability to respond variably during disturbing experiences is restored.</s></p><p><s>However, to address this issue more comprehensively, future studies should also assess the individual self-relatedness of the stimuli.</s><s>Moreover, the above reasoning can be linked to our resting state connectivity findings.</s><s>We were able to show that the resting-state functional connectivity between pACC and dPCC was reduced 24 h after ketamine administration.</s><s>It is conceivable that a disentanglement of pACC from the DMN allows for a more varied response to external stimulation e.g.</s><s>negative vs positive pictures.</s><s>Additionally, a reduction of an increased DMN activity during external stimulation might permit processing without an elevated self-focus, which could be of particular importance during confrontation with negative experiences.</s><s>The unchanged valence ratings suggest that negative stimuli are still perceived as aversive but the self-referential aspect might be attenuated.</s><s>This is a crucial difference and can decisively alter everyday experiences by creating a sufficient distance to unpleasant situations.</s><s>We did not observe a baseline difference in resting state connectivity between pACC and dPCC modulated by different response styles.</s><s>This might be due to the drawback that only the comparison between particularly pronounced distracting or ruminative response styles reveals significant differences in connectivity measures and the between-subject variance was simply too low.</s><s>While small differences in behavior are not detectable under normal circumstances with neurophysiological measures, the ketamine administration challenges the neurochemical system and accentuates them.</s><s>This clearly underscores the necessity to investigate the effects of ketamine in a population of MDD patients displaying a greater behavioral variety when handling unpleasant experiences.</s><s>Our findings suggest that particularly in patients with an elevated self-focus, ketamine might reduce resting state functional connectivity in affective compartments of the DMN and NBRs in the pACC during emotional stimulation, allowing for emotional processing while shifting the attention away from the self.</s><s>If the antidepressant effect of ketamine is indeed closely related to an attenuated self-focus during negative experiences, its administration might open a plasticity window for psychotherapeutic learning, in which the attributions of memories and perceptions are disentangled from the self and reviewed under a new light.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, our data also revealed a strong positive correlation between changes in connectivity and the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine.</s><s>A recent study has shown that the reduction of depressive symptoms following the ketamine infusion was positively correlated with acute dissociative side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Luckenbaugh et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>It has been suggested that pathologically restricted network dynamics, as e.g.</s><s>hyper-connectivity within the DMN in MDD, need to be directly disrupted and that acute psychotomimetic effects may reflect the amount of network disruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Walter et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Based on recent findings from clinical trials that ketamine's antidepressant effects peak $24 h after infusion before it slowly decays across the following 3-7 days, we investigated particularly the effects after 1 day.</s><s>However, it is conceivable that scanning the effects in a higher temporal resolution across this 24 h time window would reveal the mechanisms leading to changes reported here.</s><s>Especially in depressed patients, it would be of great interest to investigate how the effects of ketamine on the neurobiology and behavior evolve, when they reach a climax and how resting state and task related changes are intertwined over time.</s><s>For research investigating the effect of psychedelic substances on neuronal activity, as with e.g.</s><s>ketamine, the choice of an adequate placebo control is an unresolved issue.</s><s>The administration of saline does not provoke similar psychotomimetic effects as ketamine.</s><s>Therefore-even though the study was conducted in a double-blind fashion-it is possible that the symptoms were an indicator for the experimental condition.</s><s>However, the subjects experienced the exact same setting and thus the placebo condition allows controlling for effects of the infusion procedure and general setting effects.</s><s>Furthermore, the time lag between administration and measurement of 24 h should have minimized drug effects on task and ratings that could be attributed to reduced attention.</s></p><p><s>To conclude, the current study indicates for the first time that ketamine increases NBRs in the pACC during processing of negative stimuli.</s><s>This alteration was neither observed in a control region nor during positive picture viewing, a finding that underscores the specific involvement of the pACC in negative affective processing.</s><s>For subjects with a low ability to apply distraction during unpleasant experiences, the increase of NBRs was more pronounced.</s><s>Moreover, the extent of reduction in resting state functional connectivity between pACC and dPCC after ketamine administration was predicted by the psychotomimetic effects during the ketamine infusion.</s><s>Taken together, these results suggest that ketamine helps the pACC, a region that is over-activated and hyper-connected in depressed patients, to regain a variable responsiveness to negative stimuli and this effect seems critically depend on inter-individual differences in the ability to distract and psychotomimetic effects during drug administration.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
