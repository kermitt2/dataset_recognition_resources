extended time course in our model.</s><s>In addition, the present study did not examine tetrodotoxin (TTX) in muscle strips to evaluate neural activity.</s><s>While there is possibility that neurons could be involved in the muscle strip contraction results presented here, the majority of the studies used smooth muscle cells, indicating that any potential neuronal activity does not play a major role.</s></p><p><s>While vascular smooth muscle contraction is similar to gastrointestinal smooth muscle contraction, in that actin polymerization requires FAK, PYK2, and Paxillin signaling pathways, vascular smooth muscle additionally activates the Src and CAS pathways, which have not been examined in gastrointestinal smooth muscle actin polymerization.</s><s>For example, increased force generation by actin polymerization is activated by PKC mediated phosphorylation of paxillin, cofilin, and HSP27 and Rho kinase mediated phosphorylation of cofilin and HSP27 in rat cerebral artery <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, actin polymerization and blood pressure regulation in mouse arterial smooth muscle is mediated by the expression of vinculin and paxillin, which modulates p130 Crk associated substrate (CAS) activation through the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson tyrosine kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, a future direction may be to examine the importance of Src, CAS, CrkII, and vinculin pathway.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our studies suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of smooth muscle contraction by Ca 2+ dependent and Ca 2+ independent pathways via actin polymerization.</s><s>In gastric smooth muscle cells, IP 3 -induced Ca 2+ release and activation of RhoA by the muscarinic M3 receptor regulates Pyk2, FAK, and paxillin.</s><s>IP 3 -induced Ca 2+ release during the initial phase activates Pyk2 and stimulates Pyk2 phosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr 118 .</s><s>For the sustained phase, FAK binds to paxillin and phosphorylates it at Tyr 118 by Ca 2+ independent activation of RhoA.</s><s>Phosphorylated paxillin associates with α-pix, β-pix and DOCK 180 signaling molecules.</s><s>These GEF proteins commit to the activation of Cdc42 leading to the activation of N-WASP, the association of N-WASP with Arp2/3, actin polymerization, and muscle contraction that is independent of MLC 20 phosphorylation.</s><s>Our studies suggest a novel signaling pathway for gastric smooth muscle contraction via Ca 2+ dependent phosphorylation of Pyk2 and Ca 2+ independent phosphorylation of FAK.</s><s>In this way, the phosphorylation of Pyk2, FAK, and paxillin plus the activation of downstream effectors, mediate actin polymerization in gastric smooth muscle (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">16</ref>).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
