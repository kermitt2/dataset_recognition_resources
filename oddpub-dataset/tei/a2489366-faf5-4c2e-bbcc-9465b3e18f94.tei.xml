<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Potassium channel openers (KCOs) have been described as a group of synthetic chemicals activating different classes of potassium channels.</s><s>Originally, KCOs were identified as activators of two types of plasma membrane K + channels: ATP-regulated potassium (K ATP ) channels and large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK Ca ) channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A variety of different small synthetic molecules have been described as BK Ca channel openers.</s><s>Many of them are benzoimidazolone derivatives (e.g., NS1619 and NS004).</s><s>Electrophysiological studies revealed that NS1619 activates plasma membrane BK Ca channels and that this effect is suppressed by BK Ca channel inhibitors such as iberiotoxin (IbTx) and paxilline (Pax) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Another group of BK Ca channel openers comprises the indole carboxylate compound CGS7181 and its analogues, such as CGS7184 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Studies using the patch-clamp technique revealed that these chemicals induce a concentration-dependent stimulation of whole-cell BK Ca currents in smooth muscle cells from several animal species <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, other molecules such as 1,4-benzothiazine derivatives and NS11021 have been described as potent and specific activators of this channel <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>Reports have also described a group of natural BK Ca channel openers, such as terpene derivatives (e.g., pimaric acid and maxikdiol), flavonoids (e.g., apigenine, naringenin), and phenolic derivatives (e.g., magnolol) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>KCOs have recently attracted attention as potent therapeutic agents.</s><s>It was found that pretreatment with certain potassium channel activators has cytoprotective effects against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury of cardiac and neuronal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>The detailed mechanism underlying these effects remains unknown.</s><s>It was suggested that the cytoprotection phenomenon induced by KCOs might be mediated by potassium channels located in the inner mitochondrial membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>The mitoBK Ca channel was first described in glioma cells using patch-clamp recordings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Later on, the presence of the channel was confirmed in other tissues such as cardiac muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The basic pharmacological properties of mitoBK Ca channels have been found to be similar to those of BK Ca channels present in the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>It has been suggested that activation of the mitoBK Ca by NS1619 leads to the cytoprotection of cardiomyocytes insulted during ischemia/reperfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or treated with ouabain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, it has been reported that the activation of mitoBK Ca channels with KCOs influences mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and this mechanism was postulated to be important for cytoprotection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Apart from studies showing the direct activation of mitochondrial BK Ca channels by KCOs, a number of reports described alternative sites of action for these compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>It has even been suggested that the observed neuroprotective effect of NS1619 may be due to off-target interactions rather than the modulation of mitochondrial potassium channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Alternative targets for NS1619 have also been previously reported in glioma cell mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, it has been shown that CGS7184 induces calcium release from intracellular stores in endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and initiates glial cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>These observations clearly show that KCOs have multiple targets within the cell.</s></p><p><s>Here, we report that CGS7181 and CGS7184 activate the mitoBK Ca channel.</s><s>Activation of the channel was observed directly on the level of single channels and indirectly by measuring the respiration rate in isolated mitochondria and brain homogenates.</s><s>However, when used in neuronal cell cultures, these compounds show a strong cytotoxic effect, most likely due to the deregulation of calcium homeostasis and calpain activation.</s></p></div>
