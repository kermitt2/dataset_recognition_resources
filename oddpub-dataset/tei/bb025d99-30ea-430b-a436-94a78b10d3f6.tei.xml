<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Stroke is the second leading cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide.</s><s>Following a sudden interruption of the blood supply, there are two major regions of injury within the brain: the ischemic core, where severe hypoperfusion causes rapid cell death and the comparatively less hypoperfused ischemic penumbra, where cells may be stressed and dysfunctional but viable <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</s><s>Within the ischemic penumbra, the fate of individual neurons results from a complex interplay of numerous biochemical and cellular events, which may lead to irreversible cell death or survival and tissue repair.</s><s>Among those, activation of microglia, the primary immune effector cells of the brain, or recruited macrophages is a key feature of the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia.</s><s>Apart from their potential to release a number of pro-and anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic molecules, activated microglia demonstrate many characteristics of macrophages, including amoeboid-like morphology, capacity to migrate, antigen presentation, and phagocytic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, one of the main effector functions of microglia is the phagocytic removal of cell debris or dying cells.</s><s>In these cases phagocytosis is beneficial, because it prevents the disintegration of apoptotic cells and induces an anti-inflammatory response in microglia, thereby contributing to tissue homeostasis and repair (for review see Brown &amp; Neher, 2014) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Microglial phagocytosis is closely controlled by the expression of specific cell surface ligands.</s><s>For the phagocytic removal of host cells, specific ligands, so-called 'eat-me' signals, need to be displayed on their surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Among a wide variety of ligands, exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) is the best-described and most commonly observed eat-me signal.</s><s>Importantly, PS externalization of neurons can occur reversibly in response to cellular stress that is not sufficient to induce cell death.</s><s>In particular, stressed but viable neurons can reversibly externalize PS when exposed to non-toxic levels of oxidative or nitrosative metabolites (as may be released by microglia during inflammation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> , low levels of glutamate <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> , or growth-factor withdrawal 10 .</s><s>In the presence of microglia this PS exposure leads to neuronal engulfment and death, whereas in the absence of microglia, these stressed neurons are able to re-internalise PS and survive <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> .</s><s>Neuronal PS can be recognised by different microglial receptors, leading to a cascade of intracellular events that eventually results in the uptake of the 'eat-me' signal-exposing neuron <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>PS can be recognised directly through microglial transmembrane receptors or indirectly through binding of soluble opsonins, such as milk fat globule EGF-like factor 8 protein (MFG-E8, also known as lactadherin or SED1) <ref type="bibr">12</ref> .</s><s>MFG-E8, a glycoprotein produced by microglia and astrocytes during inflammation, simultaneously engages exposed PS and the microglial vitronectin receptor (the heterodimeric integrin α ν β 3/5 ), thereby activating phagocytosis <ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> .</s><s>Similar to MFG-E8, two other opsonins, growth arrest specific gene 6 (Gas6), and Protein S, which also bind to exposed PS on neurons, are in turn recognized by the membrane protein Mer receptor tyrosine kinase (MerTK) <ref type="bibr">14</ref> .</s><s>Of note, MerTK can also be activated downstream of the vitronectin receptor, indicating convergence of the MFG-E8 and MerTK pathways.</s></p><p><s>Traditionally, phagocytosis has been regarded to occur secondary to a target cell being dead or dying.</s><s>However, accumulating evidence suggests, that during neuroinflammation or cerebral ischemia phagocytes can also eat viable neurons, and thereby induce cell death (for review see Brown &amp; Neher, 2014) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref> .</s><s>This form of cell death resulting from the cell being phagocytosed has been termed 'phagoptosis' 15 , with the defining characteristic that inhibition of phagocytosis prevents cell death (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Using a rodent model of focal cerebral ischaemia induced by stereotactic microinjection of the vasoconstrictive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) into the striatum or sensorimotor cortex of rats or mice, respectively, we previously found that the phagocytic proteins MFG-E8 and MerTK were transiently upregulated by microglia within the ischaemic area peaking at 3-7 days after insult.</s><s>Animals deficient for MFG-E8 or the microglial phagocytic receptor MerTK had reduced brain atrophy and improved neurological function.</s><s>While the number of microglial cells and the levels of inflammatory mediators were indistinguishable between genotypes, microglia from Mfge8 and Mertk knockout animals showed reduced phagocytosis of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> .</s><s>In conclusion, these results suggest that deficiency of MerTK or MFG-E8 blocks phagocytosis of neurons by microglia and thereby prevents engulfment-induced neuronal death.</s><s>However, the observed behavioural benefits among phagocytosis-deficient animals were moderate at best and the ET-1 ischemia model may have confounding effects on neuroinflammation and neuronal survival as ET-1 receptors are also expressed by neurons, astrocytes, and microglia <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We therefore propose to investigate how phagocytosis and specific phagocytic signalling pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke, by using an established model of focal cerebral ischemia.</s><s>We will perform histological, biochemical, and behavioural analyses of phagocytosis-deficient wildtype mice and homozygous Mfge8 and Mertk knockout mice, and use pharmacological inhibition of the MFG-E8 receptor to assess whether phagocytosis is beneficial or detrimental for neuronal survival and neurological function following temporary (45min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo).</s><s>In these animals, we will test: 1) Whether phagocytic deficiency is beneficial or detrimental for neurological function; and</s></p><p><s>2) Whether phagocytic microglia and recruited macrophages contribute to neuronal and/or synaptic loss following cerebral ischemia and if this is beneficial or detrimental for tissue recovery.</s></p><p><s>By pre-registering this study we strive to foster transparency about our aims, study design, and analysis plan, thereby strengthening the robustness and accountability of our data.</s></p></div>
