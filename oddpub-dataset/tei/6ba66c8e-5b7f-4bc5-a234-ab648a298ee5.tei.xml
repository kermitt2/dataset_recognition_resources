<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Multiple pathways in multicellular organisms have evolved to induce and execute cell death in defective, infected, or extraneous cells, and dysregulation of numerous steps in each pathway contribute to diseases and tissue damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Necroptosis is a caspaseindependent form of programmed necrosis that mediates defense against viral pathogen infection, particularly when caspase activation is blocked, by directly lysing infected cells and releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to initiate an inflammatory response <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>While clinical biomarkers of necroptosis have not yet been widely employed in human studies, necroptosis is pathologically activated in certain mouse models of a variety of diseases and disorders involving tissue injury, degeneration, and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Notably, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of the necroptosis mediators RIPK1 kinase activity, RIPK3, or MLKL demonstrates therapeutic benefit in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury, drug-induced liver injury, acute kidney injury, retinal detachment, chronic dermatitis, atherosclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>However, RIPK1 enzymatic activity and Ripk3 can also mediate apoptosis in certain contexts, and Mlkl deficiency is less protective than Ripk3 deficiency or catalytically inactive RIPK1 in some tissue injury and inflammation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Necroptosis is induced when caspase-8 is inhibited and either a TNF family death-domain receptor, Toll-like receptor TLR3 or TLR4, or the virus sensing adaptor protein ZBP1 is triggered.</s><s>RIPK1 (recruited to death receptors), TRIF (recruited to TLR3 and TLR4), and ZBP1 are RHIM domain-containing proteins that activate the kinase RIPK3 through homotypic interaction with its RHIM domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Autophosphorylated RIPK3 in turn phosphorylates the pseudokinase MLKL to induce a conformational change, homo-oligomerization, and translocation to the plasma membrane to promote membrane permeabilization and cell lysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</s><s>However, necroptosis is actively suppressed during development and in many adult tissues, such that in most cell types TNFR1 activation does not result in cell death.</s><s>In a context-dependent manner, RIPK1 function is regulated at multiple checkpoints by association of RIPK1 with different binding partners in alternative complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>In the most completely characterized example of pathway activation, engagement of TNFR1 by the cytokine TNFα assembles complex-I at the cell membrane by recruiting RIPK1, TRADD, TRAF2/5, and the E3 ubiquitin ligases cIAP1/2 and LUBAC that ubiquitylate RIPK1 and other components of complex-I 9, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</s><s>In a kinase-independent manner, ubiquitylated RIPK1 recruits and activates IKK and TAK1-TAB2/3 complexes, stimulating NF-κB, JNK, p38, and ERK pathways to transcriptionally activate antiapoptotic and pro-inflammatory genes, including CFLAR (cFLIP) encoding the catalytically inactive homolog of caspase-8.</s><s>Under conditions where RIPK1 is not efficiently ubiquitylated, complex-I is unstable, and RIPK1 dissociates to form cytoplasmic complex-II with FADD and caspase-8 in a RIPK1 kinase-dependent manner.</s><s>RIPK1 ubiquitylation can be restricted by cIAP inhibition or by the deubiquitylase activity of CYLD, which is recruited to the complex-I through the LUBAC-binding protein SPATA2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref

.</s><s>Activated caspase-8 within complex-II triggers apoptosis by cleaving executioner caspases.</s><s>However, if caspase-8 expression is limited or its activity is blocked by pan-caspase inhibitors such as zVAD-fmk, then complex-II can further develop to form the necrosome complex as RIPK1 recruits and activates RIPK3, leading to MLKL-dependent necroptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Despite current knowledge of the RIPK1 and necroptosis signaling pathways, many aspects of their regulatory mechanisms remain to be elucidated, including ubiquitin editing dynamics, protein complex intracellular trafficking, and membrane channel interactions.</s><s>Expression levels of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL correlate with sensitivity to necrosis in some mouse models and human disease tissues 2 , and defining their transcriptional and post-transcriptional control could help verify a primary causal relationship.</s><s>To discover new pathway components that might ultimately reveal new therapeutic intervention strategies or predictive biomarkers for inhibitors in preclinical development, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen selecting for necroptosis resistance.</s><s>This screen successfully identified 59 new candidate regulatory genes previously implicated in diverse cellular functions that, similar to RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, display minimal or no requirement for normal cell proliferation.</s><s>We further defined the screen hit Ptbp1 as a determinant of RIPK1 protein expression levels by demonstrating that it represses alternative splicing to a cryptic exon that induces a frame shift in the Ripk1 transcript.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies new necroptosis pathway regulators</head><p><s>We developed a screen in L929 mouse fibroblast cells to discover new genes whose products mediate or modulate the induction and execution of necroptosis stimulated by recombinant TNFα protein in the presence of the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>To do so, we generated a transgenic cell line stably expressing Cas9 and validated that co-expression of a sgRNA targeting Mlkl reduced MLKL protein to undetectable levels and conferred nearly complete resistance to necroptosis within 8 days (Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>We used this cell line to screen a novel whole-genome sgRNA library evenly partitioned in nine pools targeting an average of 2203 genes, with 93% of genes targeted by eight sgRNAs (Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</s><s>sgRNA sequences were selected using an algorithm that designs sgRNAs and prioritizes them at the gene level on the basis of the number of splice isoforms targeted, proximity to the 5′ end of the coding region, and the number of predicted off-target sites (see Materials and methods).</s><s>Three of the library pools were screened individually at 1000-fold sgRNA representation with a target multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3-0.6.</s><s>The remaining six libraries were screened as three combinations of two pools at 500-fold sgRNA representation and MOI 0.6, after determining that these parameters did not significantly reduce the screen hit detection power (Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>).</s><s>Each library contained at least one sgRNA targeting Mlkl as a positive control, as well as containing a common set of 47 non-targeting control (NTC) sgRNAs.</s><s>For each of the six screens, three replicate samples were transduced and independently maintained at the indicated sgRNA representation through three passages over 10 days to allow for gene knockout.</s><s>A cell number that maintained 500-1000-fold sgRNA representation was collected for a reference time point 2 days after transduction, and puromycin was added to an equivalent number of cells to select for sgRNA integrations starting 3 days after transduction.</s><s>Ten days after transduction, ~1.5 × 10 8 cells per replicate were treated with TNFα and zVAD-fmk to achieve 99.0-99.9%</s><s>cell killing by necroptosis, and resistant cells were harvested 5 days later.</s><s>In parallel, untreated cultures were maintained at the indicated sgRNA representation through an additional passage and collected at the same time as the treated samples.</s></p><p><s>Genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from the reference, treated, and untreated cell collections was used in an amount that maintained the sgRNA representation for PCR amplification of the sgRNA sequences.</s><s>Read counts for the individual sgRNAs were determined by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) of the PCR amplicons, after correcting for library sequencing depth and scaling the median sgRNA read count number across libraries (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>; see Materials and methods).</s><s>The very strong level of positive selection achieved in the screens with TNFα and zVAD-fmk provides a large assay window of over 1000-fold sgRNA enrichment, although it also produces a relatively high level of sgRNA read count variation between some replicates of only the treated samples, presumably due to stochastic differences in survival of small numbers of cells with sgRNAs that do not confer resistance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 and S3</ref>).</s><s>The gCrisprTools software <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> was used to summarize sgRNA-level signals into genelevel estimates (Rho scores) of the significance of sgRNA enrichment in the treated samples compared to the timematched untreated controls, or of sgRNA depletion in the untreated controls compared to the early reference time point samples.</s><s>This analysis effectively prioritizes genes targeted by sgRNAs that are consistently enriched across replicate treated samples relative to their paired untreated controls.</s><s>A total of 112 genes in the genome-wide screens show Rho scores less than 10 −9 and are considered further here (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Among the samples treated with TNFα and zVAD-fmk, we observe the highest level of sgRNA enrichment (up to 1260-fold) among sgRNAs targeting the gene that encodes TNF receptor Tnfrsf1a (Tnfr1) and the three canonical components of the necrosome, Ripk1, Ripk3, and Mlkl (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Almost all sgRNAs targeting the genes encoding the deubiquitylase CYLD and its recently identified binding partner, SPATA2, are also strongly enrichment, consistent with the reported roles of CYLD and SPATA2 in deubiquitylating RIPK1 and enhancing its kinase activity in complex-I and the necrosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> .</s><s>sgRNAs targeting Tnfrsf1a, Mlkl, Ripk3, Cyld, and Spata2 were not significantly depleted in the time-matched untreated samples in their respective screens, whereas most sgRNAs targeting Ripk1 were weakly depleted, suggesting that RIPK1 may also function independent of TNFα signaling to promote cell proliferation or survival.</s><s>This RIPK1 pro-survival function may be related to the perinatal lethality of Ripk1-deficient mice caused by induction of apoptosis and necrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> .</s><s>Many of the 112 screen hit genes show even greater levels of sgRNA depletion in the absence of necroptosis induction, including known essential genes such as components of the ribosome (Rpl8, Rpl13a) and chaperonin containing TCP1 complex (Cct2), possibly indicating that some mechanisms of generally slowing cell growth can delay necroptosis.</s><s>In an attempt to distinguish screen hits more specifically regulating necroptosis, we classified genes based on arbitrary minimum Rho scores for depletion in untreated cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4b</ref>).</s><s>Twenty-five genes, including Tnfrsf1a, Mlkl, Ripk3, Cyld, and Spata2, have a depletion Rho score greater than 0.05, suggesting no effect on cell viability or proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>This group includes N4bp1, which has a level of sgRNA enrichment after necroptosis induction similar to Cyld and Spata2, but has not previously been reported to function in necroptosis.</s></p><p><s>An additional 23 hits have Rho scores between 0.05 and 10 −6 for sgRNA depletion in untreated cells, and this class includes Ripk1 and Ptbp1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>A third tier of 17 hits possess Rho scores between 10 −6 and 10 −8 (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PTBP1 regulates Ripk1 splicing and expression</head><p><s>To confirm screen hits, we developed a 96-well format assay for arrayed synthetic crRNAs.</s><s>crRNAs containing the same targeting sequence as those in the pooled sgRNA libraries were synthesized, annealed with synthetic tracrRNA, and transfected into the L929 Cas9 stable cell line.</s><s>After 7 days of cell growth to allow for gene knockout, we induced necroptosis with TNFα and zVADfmk before measuring cell viability.</s><s>crRNAs targeting Mlkl and Ripk3 conferred nearly complete resistance to necroptosis, whereas ~60-65% of cells transfected with crRNAs targeting Ripk1 were rendered insensitive to the treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a, b</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the screen results, crRNAs against all seven of the novel hit genes tested conferred significant but lower levels of necroptosis resistance, ~25-40% for Spata2 and N4bp1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a, b</ref>).</s><s>None of the crRNAs targeting these novel hits reduced cell viability in the absence of necroptosis induction by more than ~15%, although we note that in principle some of these genes might influence cell viability in a manner that is undetectable in a short-term assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We investigated whether any of these seven new regulators of necroptosis acted by altering expression of necrosome components.</s><s>crRNA-mediated knockout of Ptbp1 specifically reduced protein levels of RIPK1, but not RIPK3 or MLKL, and this activity is not dependent on stimulation of necroptosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b,

(Figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>Using qRT-PCR primers that span the splice junctions of exon 4, exon 5, and the alternative exon, we found that Ptbp1 knockout enhances splicing of exons 4

internal to exon 5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5b</ref>) or exon 11(data not shown) demonstrate that total levels of Ripk1 mRNAs are potently diminished by Ptbp1 crRNAs, suggesting that the enhanced alternative splicing leads to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of transcripts that contain the premature termination codon.</s><s>We conclude that PTBP1 acts as a repressor of a Ripk1 cryptic exon that is deleterious to RIPK1 protein expression.</s></p><p><s>The cryptic exon and polypyrimidine tract are conserved in human RIPK1, and transcript variant 2 (RefSeq Accession

in mouse L929 cells with Ptbp1 knockout (Figures <ref type="figure">S7c and S7d</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, we observe minimal or no reduction in RIPK1 canonical splicing of exon 4 to exon 5 (Figure
