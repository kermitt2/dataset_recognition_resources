<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Targeting Arch3 onto synaptic vesicles</head><p><s>In order to functionally express a light-activated proton pump in the synaptic vesicle membrane, we incorporated Arch3 between helix three and four of the vesicular protein synaptophysin, together with the fluorescent proteins mKate2 on the cytosolic and pHluorin on the luminal side to indicate protein expression and localization as well as luminal acidification.</s><s>As the C-terminus of Arch3 is located on the cytosolic side13, while the fourth synaptophysin helix originates in the vesicle lumen, we added the transmembrane helix of the rat gastric H + /K + ATPase beta-subunit (βHK) to maintain the transmembrane topology15 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We expressed the resulting fusion protein, pHoenix, in mouse hippocampal neurons using lentivirus.</s><s>After two weeks in culture, pHoenix was enriched at presynaptic terminals and colocalized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which was not the case for untargeted Arch3-eGFP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>).</s><s>During whole-cell patch clamp recordings, 1 s light pulses evoked 250 times smaller somatic outward currents in pHoenix-expressing neurons compared to neurons expressing Arch3-eGFP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>), indicating that pHoenix is mostly retained intracellularly.</s><s>Indeed, optical quantification of surface-resident pHluorin molecules (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c,d</ref>) revealed that only 15% of the pHoenix proteins reside in the plasma membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>), similarly to synaptophysin-pHluorin (sypHy), a wellestablished indicator of vesicular pH and synaptic transmission14.</s><s>Furthermore, bursts of 60 action potentials (APs) at 20 Hz triggered an increase of pHluorin fluorescence due to exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in pHoenix-expressing neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>), demonstrating proper integration of the construct into synaptic vesicles.</s><s>Notably, expression of pHoenix did not interfere with basic neuronal release parameters (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-driven acidification of synaptic vesicles by pHoenix</head><p><s>V-ATPases acidify newly formed synaptic vesicles after their endocytosis from the presynaptic plasma membrane, providing the proton-motive force that drives the neurotransmitter uptake by specialized antiporters such as the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1-316.</s><s>In order test whether pHoenix can functionally substitute for the activity of the endogenous proton pumps, we blocked vesicular acidification and transmitter uptake by incubating cultured hippocampal neurons grown on microislands with the V-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf).</s><s>We then monitored pHluorin signals in glutamatergic neurons to follow vesicle acidification and, in parallel, recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), which indicated the level of vesicular transmitter filling.</s><s>Preincubation with 1 μM Baf for 2-5 h depleted the proton gradient over vesicular membranes and resulted in strong pHluorin fluorescence at synaptic terminals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), with no or very small EPSCs evoked by APs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>pHoenix activation with 580 nm light for 2 minutes resulted in a biphasic fluorescence decrease, with an immediate drop to 70% within the first 5 s, reflecting fast vesicle acidification, followed by a slower decay to 60% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a,c</ref>).</s><s>Simultaneously recorded EPSCs recovered with a time constant τ = 58 s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b,c</ref>).</s><s>Control experiments in neurons expressing sypHy showed that bleaching of pHluorinmolecules could not account for the rapid decrease of fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, pHoenix activity is sufficient to rapidly acidify synaptic vesicles, allowing the control of vesicular transmitter uptake with light.</s></p><p><s>We further tested the applicability of pHoenix in organotypic brain slices.</s><s>Adeno-associated virus encoding pHoenix was injected into area CA3 after three to five days in vitro (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>At &gt;14 days post-infection, we incubated slices with 1 µM Baf overnight, which caused strong pHluorin signals (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>), and effectively abolished EPSCs.</s><s>pHoenix activation for 2 min recovered synaptic transmission at associational-commissural fiber synapses (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c,d</ref>), illustrating that the use of pHoenix can also be extended to brain slice preparations and possibly in vivo applications.</s></p><p><s>Refilling of synaptic vesicles by pHoenix should create a finite pool of vesicles that could be subsequently depleted by AP-triggered exocytosis.</s><s>Indeed, following 2 min of illumination and pHoenix-mediated recovery of transmission, repetitive stimulation with trains of APs (600 APs over 300 s), but not sparse stimulation (30 APs in 300 s), rapidly reduced EPSC amplitudes in autaptic cultures of glutamatergic neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, pHluorin signals strongly increased under the train stimulation due to exhaustive exocytosis and failure of re-acidification.</s><s>A second illumination period caused requenching of pHluorin signals, while synaptic transmission recovered, illustrating that optogenetic vesicle acidification and transmitter uptake is fully reversible by AP-driven exocytosis.</s></p><p><s>The observed rescue of transmission in Baf-treated neurons was pHoenix-specific: While light-induced EPSC recovery in pHoenix-expressing cells yielded EPSCs of 3.1 ± 0.6 nA, illumination failed to rescue EPSCs in control cells expressing Arch3-eGFP (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</s><s>Rescued EPSCs of Baf-treated neurons reached amplitudes comparable to those of EPSCs of untreated cells from the same culture (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs), which reflect the stochastic fusion of single vesicles, did not differ between the two groups (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the light-driven pHoenix activity can achieve vesicular transmitter filling comparable to endogenous V-ATPases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Superfilling of synaptic vesicles by pHoenix activity</head><p><s>EPSCs of untreated neurons expressing pHoenix slightly increased during illumination (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6b</ref>).</s><s>We characterized this effect in detail by comparing pHoenixexpressing neurons with control neurons (uninfected or sypHy-infected).</s><s>Activation of pHoenix increased EPSC amplitudes by 13 ± 2%, an effect not seen in controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>).</s><s>We directly assessed the release probability in these cells by using a 40 ms paired pulse stimulation paradigm, where a low ratio of the second to first EPSC amplitude indicates a high release probability17.</s><s>The light-induced change in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was not significantly different between the two groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>), thus the increase of EPSC amplitudes was probably not due to a higher release probability.</s><s>Likewise, illumination did not have a differential effect on the mEPSC frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>).</s><s>However, illumination caused a significant increase of mEPSCs amplitudes by 11 ± 2% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>) in pHoenixexpressing cells.</s><s>Our experiments suggest that light-activated proton pumping by pHoenix provides an additional driving force for vesicular transmitter accumulation, reflected by larger postsynaptic responses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>), but the relatively small effect on both EPSC and mEPSC amplitudes implies that vesicles are nearly filled to maximal storage capacity under physiological conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Partially filled vesicles have a lower release probability</head><p><s>Reliable synaptic transmission requires exocytosis of synaptic vesicles loaded with sufficient levels of neurotransmitter molecules.</s><s>However, whether incomplete vesicular filling affects vesicle release probability is still under debate.</s><s>In fact, some experimental findings showed that the vesicular fill state influences vesicle release probability18,19, while others demonstrated equally efficient release of empty vesicles20,21.</s><s>The ability to control transmitter uptake into vesicles by light-driven proton pumping allowed us to directly assess the relation of vesicular transmitter content and vesicular release probability.</s><s>We investigated transmitter release of autaptic neurons that still exhibited small, residual EPSCs after &gt;2 h incubation in Baf and compared it to the restored release after pHoenix activation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>).</s><s>pHoenix-driven transmitter uptake increased mEPSC amplitudes by 70%, while mEPSC frequency increased more than tenfold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</s><s>The small initial mEPSC amplitudes imply that residual EPSCs rely on vesicles only partially filled with glutamate.</s><s>Notably, the PPR decreased by 40% during the pHoenix-mediated EPSC recovery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>), indicating that vesicular release probability increases with vesicular filling.</s><s>The incrementing release of glutamate could lead to a progressive desensitization of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, which might contribute to changes in the PPR22.</s><s>However, in the presence of cyclothiazide, an antagonist of AMPA receptor desensitization, we observed a comparable decrease in PPR (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), ruling out that in our experimental conditions the increased vesicular content enhances receptor desensitization.</s></p><p><s>The high PPR of residual EPSCs might result from the release of a pool of "releasereluctant" vesicles that were not discharged during the incubation with Baf because of their intrinsically low release probability.</s><s>As pHoenix activity promotes gradual filling of synaptic vesicles, we were able to titrate the vesicular glutamate content more accurately using a twostep recovery protocol: In cells devoid of transmission after Baf treatment, we applied a 30 s non-saturating light pulse that caused only partial recovery of the evoked response, followed by a dark phase of 60 s and a second saturating light pulse for 90 s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>).</s><s>This protocol allowed us to compare an intermediate fill state with reduced postsynaptic responses to the condition with full vesicles after final EPSC recovery.</s><s>In the intermediate fill state, EPSCs remained stable, at 37% of the final amplitude, while pHluorin signals increased slightly due to AP-triggered exocytosis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>This illustrates that VGLUTs require constant proton pumping for transmitter uptake.</s><s>Using two independent approaches we verified that the non-saturating light pulse created partially filled vesicles: First, analysis of spontaneous release revealed that mEPSC amplitudes were 25% smaller and occurred at a 42% lower frequency compared to the full recovery state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>).</s><s>Second, we tested the effectiveness of the low-affinity, competitive AMPAR antagonist γ-D-glutamylglycine (γ-DGG) on attenuating EPSCs, which has been established as an indicator for the amount of vesicular glutamate released by exocytosis23: A strong reduction of EPSCs by γ-DGG reflects a low vesicular glutamate content, while the γ-DGG effect decreases with increasing amounts of glutamate released.</s><s>We found that after the non-saturating light interval, γ-DGG decreased EPSCs to 31%, while EPSCs were reduced to only 40% after the second, saturating light interval (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>).</s><s>Both observations support the idea that the reduced postsynaptic responses in the intermediate recovery are based on a partial vesicular fill state.</s><s>How does partial transmitter filling affect the release probability?</s><s>Paired-pulse measurements showed a 10% higher PPR in the intermediate recovery state compared to the full state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref>), indicating a lower release probability of partially filled vesicles.</s><s>We also assessed the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles by brief applications of hypertonic sucrose solutions during the intermediate and the final recovery state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5e,f</ref>), which allowed us to directly calculate the vesicular release probability (P vr )24.</s><s>During the intermediate recovery state the RRP was 60% smaller compared to the final recovery state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5g,i</ref>).</s><s>The P vr of partially filled vesicles was 14% lower compared to vesicles after complete filling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5h,i</ref>), and the vesicular fill state correlated with the pool size and P vr (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5j</ref>).</s><s>Thus, insufficient vesicular filling reduces the vesicular release probability.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Light-driven acidification of lysosomes</head><p><s>The modular pHoenix design provides a blueprint for specific intracellular trafficking of both Arch3 and fluorescent indicators.</s><s>Consequently, we modified pHoenix to target lysosomes by insertion of the pHluorin-Arch3-mKate-βHK construct between helix 1 and 2 of the tetraspanin CD63, a lysosomal marker protein25 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</s><s>The resulting "lyso-pHoenix" showed strong co-labeling with the lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), but not with markers for the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, endosome, or mitochondria, demonstrating specific expression on lysosomal membranes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>In Baf-treated HEK 293 cells, activation of lyso-pHoenix by 580 nm light caused a rapid decrease of pHluorin signals, indicating a drop in pH, which was not seen in control cells expressing CD63-pHluorin.</s><s>Remarkably, lysosomal acidification required constant proton pumping, as pHluorin signals quickly recovered after termination of lyso-pHoenix activation, suggesting a strong proton leak in lysosomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6d</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Light-driven proton pumps are powerful tools for silencing neuronal activity, as they hyperpolarize the plasma membrane by exporting protons from the cytosol to the extracellular side of the membrane26.</s><s>Interestingly, only few studies have exploited their potential to alter the pH of intracellular organelles.</s><s>In yeast, the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin from Halobacterium salinarium has been successfully targeted to the inner mitochondrial membrane27.</s><s>In cell-free assays, bacteriorhodopsin from Halobacterium halobium has been employed to acidify proteoliposomes in order to study the protondependence of VGLUT-driven glutamate uptake28, but similar experiments have not yet been feasible in living neurons.</s><s>Our new tool, pHoenix, now allows precise temporal control of the acidification process of synaptic vesicles, and will enable studies on synaptic vesicle biogenesis and neurotransmitter uptake in living neurons.</s></p><p><s>Two parameters affect the vesicular transmitter filling: the proton gradient and the number and activity of vesicular transmitter transporters.</s><s>Experimentally, the vesicular transmitter content can be manipulated in two ways -either by altering the number of active vesicular transmitter transporters19,29-31, or by alteration of the proton electrochemical gradient20,21.</s><s>To our knowledge, pHoenix is the first tool enabling acute increase of the vesicular proton-gradient.</s><s>In cells with intact V-ATPase function, additional optogenetic acidification increased both EPSC and mEPSC amplitudes by more than 10%.</s><s>The ability of pHoenix to increase the vesicular glutamate filling beyond the filling capacity provided by V-ATPases demonstrates that Arch3 generates a proton motive force that exceeds the driving force provided by endogenous V-ATPases, indicating that the proton transport properties of V-ATPases limit the amount of glutamate uptake.</s><s>The EPSC and mEPSC amplitude increase by pHoenix activation in untreated neurons also implies that activation of surface resident pHoenix does not cause significant synaptic cleft acidification, which would impair synaptic transmission by inhibiting presynaptic calcium influx through voltage gated calcium channels32.</s></p><p><s>In Baf-treated neurons, refilling of vesicles by interval illumination revealed that glutamate uptake requires constant proton pumping (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>While pH remained low, glutamate uptake stopped immediately after light off and cessation of pHoenix activity.</s><s>This is strong evidence for the notion that membrane voltage and not the pH gradient is the driving-force for VGLUT-mediated transmitter uptake2.</s><s>The absence of proton leakage and stable synaptic transmission during low-frequency stimulation indicates that both low luminal pH and transmitter content of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles are preserved even in the absence of V-ATPase function, arguing against a steady-state model of transmitter uptake and leak in synaptic vesicles33.</s><s>This is not the case for lysosomes, where the pH increased again within seconds after terminating the lyso-pHoenix-mediated acidification, demonstrating constant lysosomal proton leakage.</s></p><p><s>Our experiments further revealed that partially filled neurotransmitter vesicles can be released, proving that exocytosis is not guarded by a rigid fill-state control mechanism.</s><s>However, incompletely filled vesicles do have a lower release probability.</s><s>The underlying mechanism for this observation is not clear, but it seems likely that proton pumping and transmitter accumulation increase intravesicular osmolarity, which leads to a higher vesicle membrane tension and increases fusion probability with the plasma membrane.</s><s>Electron microscopy studies revealed that synaptic vesicles of VGLUT1 deficient neurons were deformed in contrast to vesicles from wildtype neurons, suggesting that failure of transmitter uptake (but not failure of acidification) renders them more labile19,34.</s><s>Moreover, filled vesicles were found to exhibit a larger diameter than empty vesicles35,36.</s><s>Interestingly, the PPR changed faster than EPSCs increased, both at high (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) and low illumination intensity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), indicating that the threshold for a high P vr defined by intravesicular osmolarity and membrane tension is reached before the maximal vesicular transmitter storage capacity.</s><s>In line with this, we observed no further increase of the release probability when we used pHoenix in untreated cells to further increase vesicular filling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>The preferential release of completely filled vesicles could be of relevance for synaptic information processing: During sustained neuronal firing and high turnover of vesicles, this mechanism might assure efficient postsynaptic receptor activation and reliable synaptic transmission.</s></p><p><s>As pHoenix can functionally replace V-ATPases, it can be applied to rescue the cellular degeneration observed in V-ATPase KO models in yeast37, Drosophila38, and mice39.</s><s>Recent studies suggested that V-ATPases have acidification-independent functions as vesicular pH-sensors40, interaction partners of SNARE proteins41, and may participate directly in synaptic vesicle fusion42.</s><s>In combination with pump activity-deficient V-ATPase mutants43, pHoenix will facilitate structure-function analyses of V-ATPases and help to elucidate their non-canonical roles.</s></p><p><s>Optogenetic organelle acidification allows to investigate quantitative aspects of protondependent transport and to study the properties of organelles as a function of their intraluminal pH.</s><s>To further pursue this goal we aimed to develop a variant with opposing function to pHoenix by replacing Arch3 by a channelrhodopsin with high proton conductance in order to deplete proton gradients using light.</s><s>Unfortunately, all tested channelrhodopsin-derived pHoenix variants were ineffective (data not shown), probably because the multimerization properties of channelrhodopsins and microbial pumps differ44-46.</s><s>In line with this, a pHoenix-based actuator that allows manipulation of circuit activity will require further developments of the construct.</s></p><p><s>Whereas the transfer of the pHoenix concept to other microbial-type rhodopsins has proven unsuccessful to date, we were able to target a pHoenix variant to a different subcellular compartment by replacing the synaptophysin parts in pHoenix with the lysosomal CD63 protein.</s><s>The resulting lyso-pHoenix can be applied to specifically investigate the pHdependency of the catabolic processes confined to lysosomes, e.g. the acid-dependent activity of lysosomal proteases47.</s><s>Notably, alterations in organelle pH-homeostasis due to defects in proton translocation or counterion conductances are associated with many different pathophysiological conditions48, ranging from cancer49 to neurodegeneration50.</s><s>The here presented pHoenix-constructs may provide a new approach for directly assessing the role of acidification in these disorders.</s></p></div>
