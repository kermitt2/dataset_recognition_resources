<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Alternative approach for plant growth promotion and pest management is being explored for sustainable agriculture worldwide.</s><s>Application of synthetic chemical inputs (fertilizer and pesticides) in crop production has created both environmental and health hazards <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>This is more relevant and significant for fruit crops such as strawberry    that are used for fresh consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>This study explored an environment-friendly option for boosting strawberry plant growth, fruit yield and functional properties of fruits through the application of two plant growth promoting probiotic bacteria and compared the results with that of non-treated control.</s><s>Results showed significant improvement in plant growth, yield, various antioxidant contents and total antioxidant activities of strawberry fruits by the application of both Bacillus amylolequifaciens BChi1 and Paraburkholderia fungorum BRRh-4 treatment compared to non-treated control.</s><s>Although plant growth promotion by the application of various species of Bacillus and Paraburkholderia has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , this study for the first time demonstrated that two plant probiotic bacteria, B. amylolequifaciens BChi1 and Paraburkholderia fungorum BRRh-4 significantly increased both yield and functional properties of strawberry fruits.</s><s>This study is one of the few of this kind to evaluate the effects of plant probiotics on both yield and quality of strawberry fruits.</s><s>Significant increase in vitamin C contents in strawberry fruits by the application of a strain of genus Phyllobacterium has recently been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s></p><p><s>One of the interesting findings of this study is that both plant probiotic bacteria significantly improved growth and yield of strawberry almost at the same level with some minor differences although they belong to different bacterial genera.</s><s>Probiotic bacterium, BRRh-4 provided the highest fruit yield increase (48%) in plants of 'Strawberry Festival' compared to non-treated control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Generally, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria facilitate plant growth directly by either assisting in resource acquisition (nitrogen, phosphorus and essential minerals) or modulating plant hormone levels, or indirectly by inhibiting various pathogens as biocontrol agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Early colonization of root system has the potential to preclude pathogen colonization and infection in addition with induction of disease resistance or a range of beneficial secondary metabolites.</s><s>However, a large-scale field study with multiple cultivars is needed for testing this hypothesis.</s><s>Although suppression of fungal pathogens that cause black root rot complex of strawberries was not the focus of this study, it is possible that due to pre-colonization of strawberry root system by beneficial bacteria, treated plants had lower root disease.</s><s>Future studies should evaluate roots of treated and non-treated plants for the extent of black root rot complex/crown rot.</s><s>Probiotic bacteria also promote plant growth by a number of similar mechanisms regardless of their taxonomic groupings.</s><s>These include phosphate solubilization activity <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , indole acetic acid production <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and production of siderophore <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, a number of other beneficial effects on plant growth have been attributed to plant probiotic bacteria that include modification of root morphology, enhanced uptake of minerals and alteration of nitrogen accumulation and metabolism and/or induction of gene expression in host plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In the current study, inoculation of strawberry plants separately with two bacterial isolates significantly increased vegetative growth (leaf length, leaf number, shoot and root dry weights) of the strawberry plants (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>Similar growth enhancement effects by bacteria on growth and yield of crop plant were reported in several earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s><s>Due to the documented growth promoting effect by two plant probiotic bacteria on strawberry in this study, it is logical to get these included in the PGPR group.</s><s>The growth-promoting activities of PGPR on plants can be explained in various ways, including biocontrol and induction of disease resistance in the inoculated plant, biological N 2 fixation, phosphorus solubilization, and/or production of phytohormone such as IAA <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>The objective and extent of work in this study did not allow us to determine if phytohormones or nutrient uptake were also enhanced by probiotic bacteria, but we have undertaken a separate study to assess those beneficial effects, which is highly likely to occur.</s><s>We recently demonstrated a significant increase in growth and yield of rice by Paraburkholderia fungorum BRRh-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and B. amylolequifaciens BChi1 under nutrient deficient soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Application of these probiotic bacteria through root colonization and spray application on strawberry plants enhanced growth, yield and functional properties of fruits and the improvement was modest that may benefit strawberry growers and consumers if adopted in their production practice.</s></p><p><s>Strawberry is particularly a good source of antioxidants with 10-fold greater capacity of scavenging free radicals than that of many other fruits, including oranges, kiwis, grapefruits, grapes and mangoes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Anthocyanins are in part responsible for the antioxidant property of strawberry fruits, together with ascorbic acid and a wide variety of phenolics, including hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acid derivates, flavanols, proanthocyanidins and hydrolysable tannins <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In the current study, application of plant probiotic bacteria significantly increased total antioxidants, carotenoids, flavonoids, phenolics and total anthocyanin contents in fresh strawberry fruits compared to non-treated control (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 and 5</ref>), making these very interesting and important findings.</s><s>Treatments of strawberry plants with bacteria strains BRRh-4 and BChi1 consistently produced higher antioxidants, carotenoids, flavonoids, phenolics and total anthocyanins compared to non-treated control.</s><s>Previous study showed that the members of the genus Phyllobacterium were good plant probiotics with the capacity of increasing fruit yield as well as quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>However, this study for the first time demonstrated that both B. amyloliquefaciens and Paraburkholderia fungorum not only increased yield but also significantly improved contents of several antioxidants and total antioxidant activities of fruits.</s><s>Functional properties of fruits are dependent on bioactive compounds that may be increased when plants are biofertilized with Rhizobium 33 by impacting plant's secondary metabolism.</s><s>Chamam et al. showed that Azospirillum sp. was able to modulate the phenolic compounds in rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>The effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization on the concentration of

.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, there are no data available on the positive effects of plant probiotic bacteria B. amyloliquefaciens and Paraburkholderia fungorum on enhancement of total antioxidants, carotenoids, flavonoids, phenolics and total anthocyanins in strawberry.</s><s>In the current study, vitamin C content in strawberry fruits also increased by both of these probiotic bacteria (data not shown).</s><s>In an earlier study, increased induction of transcriptional profile of phenylpropanoid pathway genes and increased contents of flavonoid and lignin in Arabidopsis

amyloliquefaciens and Paraburkholderia fungorum not only can significantly increase growth and fruit yield but also enhance functional properties of strawberry by inducing enhanced production of total

Rahman Agricultural University during the period of November 30, 2014 to March 25, 2015.</s><s>Soil of the experimental field was shallow red brown terrace under Salna Series <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> in Madhupur Tract (Agroecological zone 28) having a pH 6.71.</s><s>soil contained 1.70% organic matter, 0.115% nitrogen (N), 21.35 ppm phosphorus (P) and 0.24 meq. 100 g −1 soil exchangeable potassium (K).</s><s>Runner grown seedlings of cv.</s><s>Strawberry Festival were collected from the Akafuji Agrotechnology, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.</s><s>All intercultural operations and fertility management were performed following commercial recommendations.</s></p><p><s>Experimental design and layout.</s><s>The field experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications.</s><s>The unit plot size was 75 cm × 150 cm and the plants were spaced 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm on the beds.</s><s>Beds were raised 30.5 cm above main field with 34 inches aisles in between 2 beds.</s><s>Each plot contained 8 plants in two adjacent rows 30.5 cm apart.</s><s>Thirty days old strawberry plug plants were transplanted on November 30, 2014.</s><s>Data on vegetative growth and fruit yield were collected from each plant of each replicated plot.</s></p><p><s>Bacterial isolates used in the experiment.</s><s>The bacterial strains BChi1 and BRRh-4 used in this study were isolated as endophytes from the surface sterilized roots of chili plant and rhizosphere soil of rice cv.</s><s>BINAdhan-7, respectively.</s><s>They were tentatively identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BChi1 (GenBank accession No. KT306960) and Burkholderia sp.</s><s>BRRh-4 (GenBank accession No. KF921290) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>However, a recent comparative molecular signature and phylogenomic analyses of a large number of Burkholderia spp.</s><s>from diverse origins suggest that non-pathogenic environmental Burkholderia should be considered as a new genus Paraburkholderia <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Reexamination of 16S rRNA sequence data of BRRh-4 revealed 99% similarity to the sequence data of the Paraburkholderia fungorum (AF215705).</s><s>Therefore, we renamed BRRh-4 as Paraburkholderia fungorum BRRh-4 (NCBI Genbank accession No. KF921290).</s><s>We constructed a neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>All the sequences utilized in the study were obtained from GenBank of NCBI.</s><s>Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using the CLUSTAL W Multiple Alignment program in BioEdit version 7.2.3, and a NJ tree based upon 1000 bootstrap replicates of this alignment was constructed using the Kimura 2-parameter model in MEGA 6.0.</s></p><p><s>Both of these plants-associated bacteria (BChi1 and BRRh-4) were confirmed to possess antagonistic activities towards major phytopathogenic microorganisms, produced indole-3-acetic acid and displayed high phosphate solubilizing activities.</s><s>They were preserved in 20% glycerol at −20 °C until used in this study.</s></p><p><s>Preparation and application of bacterial suspension.</s><s>Bacterial isolates (BRRh-4 and BChi1) were cultured separately in 500 mL nutrient broth (Merck, Germany) in conical flasks taking a single colony from actively growing bacterial culture plates that were maintained on lab bench at ambient temperature (25° ± 2 °C).</s><s>Then each flask was placed on a shaking incubator adjusted at 120 rpm and 25 °C for 72 h for bacterial growth in nutrient broth.</s><s>The broth was centrifuged at 12,000 g and the pellet was washed thrice with sterilized distilled water to remove nutrients.</s><s>The bacterial pellet was suspended in water and diluted to a concentration of approx. 1 × 10 9 CFU mL −1 .</s><s>Roots of strawberry plug plants were dipped overnight in the suspension to facilitate bacterial root colonization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>For foliar application, nutrient-free bacterial suspension containing ca. 1 × 10 9 CFU mL −1 of bacteria was sprayed until run-off in five different times with 10-d intervals starting (at flower initiation stage) from December 20, 2014 to February 22, 2015.</s><s>Plants in the non-inoculated control plots were sprayed with equal volume of sterile water without any bacterial cells.</s></p><p><s>Assessment of probiotic bacterial effect on vegetative growth of strawberry plants.</s><s>A total of three treatments, plant inoculation with strain BChi1, BRRh-4 and non-inoculated control (8 plants/treatment) were assessed from three replicated plots.</s><s>Effect of probiotic bacteria on strawberry vegetative growth was determined by measuring plant height (cm), number of leaves per plant, leaf length (cm) leaf width (cm), and canopy diameter (cm) with a ruler.</s><s>The appearance of new flowers and fruits was recorded weekly.</s><s>Runners generated from the growing plants were removed immediately as noticed on any plant.</s><s>Fruits were harvested when most of the fruit surfaces had turned red.</s><s>Sepals were discarded and only fruit flesh was used for biochemical analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>The length and diameter of the fruits were recorded; then fruits were weighed and immediately stored at −20 °C for analyses.</s><s>After 20 weeks of growth, plants were dug out of the ground, root systems and shoots were separated, washed under running water, and weighed.</s><s>Length of roots (cm) was recorded with a ruler.</s><s>Shoots and roots were dried at 60 °C for one week to assess dry weight.</s></p><p><s>Determination of total anthocyanins, carotenoids, flavonoids, and phenolics.</s><s>Sample matrix, particle size and binding of phenolics with other biochemical substances such as carbohydrate and proteins strongly influence phenolic extraction from plant materials <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>In our assays, we chose the protocols that have been widely used due to their reproducibility.</s><s>For the determination of total anthocyanins, carotenoids, flavonoids, phenolics and total antioxidant activities, 100 g preserved fruits were thawed and homogenized in a standard food homogenizer.</s><s>Sub-samples were used to determine bioactive contents for each of the above listed compounds.</s></p><p><s>Anthocyanin was extracted by placing 1g of homogenized fruit sample in 5 mL 6M HCl: H 2 O: MeOH (7: 23: 70) in the dark at 4 °C for 24 h.</s><s>To separate chlorophylls from anthocyanins, 2 mL of chloroform and 1 mL of water was added to 2 mL of fruit extracts and then centrifuged for 15 min at 5,000 g.</s><s>Three mL of the supernatant was used for determination of total anthocyanins <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Anthocyanins concentration was determined as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside equivalent using the absorbance A530 (CT60, UV-visible spectrophotometer, PG INSTRUMENTS) and a molar extinction coefficient of 30000 l mol −1 cm −1 43 .</s><s>To determine carotenoid content, 5 mL acetone was added to 2 g homogenized fruit sample in a glass vial followed by incubation for 24 h in dark at 4 °C.</s><s>Three mL supernatant was taken in a glass cuvette and the absorbance of the acetone extract was measured at 444 nm using acetone as blank in the spectrophotometer mentioned above in triplicate.</s><s>Total carotenoid content was measured in mg g −1 of sample as lutein equivalent according to the protocol described earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Total flavonoid was determined spectrophotometrically according to aluminium chloride colorimetric assay method.</s><s>Briefly, 0.4 mL 5% sodium nitrate was added to 1 mL methanol extract of strawberry fruit in a test tube.</s><s>For blank reaction, 1 mL methanol was taken instead of methanol extract of strawberry.</s><s>After 5 minutes, 0.6 mL of 10% AlCl 3 .6H 2 O was added to the mixture.</s><s>At 6 th minute, 2 mL of 1M NaOH was added to the mixture, followed by shaking thoroughly and measuring the absorbance of the solution at 510 nm against the blank sample 45 .</s><s>The measurements were compared to a standard curve of quercetin solutions and total flavonoids content was expressed as (µg/g FW) quercetin equivalent.</s><s>Total phenolic compounds were also determined spectrophotometrically following Folin-Ciocalteau method.</s><s>Briefly, 0.5 mL 10% (0.2 N) Folin-Ciocalteau reagent was added to each test tube containing 1 mL methanol extract of fruit sample and 1 mL methanol alone as blank.</s><s>The test tubes were shaken for 10 s, covered and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.</s><s>Aqueous 700 mM sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) solution (2.5 mL) was added to each reaction mixture and then vortexed, covered and incubated at room temperature for 2 h.</s><s>The absorbance of the solution was measured at 765 nm against the blank sample 46 .</s><s>The measurements were compared to a standard curve of gallic acid solutions and total phenolics were expressed as (µg/g FW) gallic acid equivalent.</s></p></div>
