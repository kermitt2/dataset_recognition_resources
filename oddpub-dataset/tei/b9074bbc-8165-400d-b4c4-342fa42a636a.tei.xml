<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Purpose: Colorectal cancer is highly preventable by detecting and removing polyps, which are the precursors.</s><s>Currently, the most accurate test is colonoscopy, but still misses 22% of polyps due to visualization limitations.</s><s>In this paper, we preliminary assess the potential of microwave imaging and dielectric properties (e.g., complex permittivity) as a complementary method for detecting polyps and cancer tissue in the colon.</s><s>The dielectric properties of biological tissues have been used in a wide variety of applications, including safety assessment of wireless technologies and design of medical diagnostic or therapeutic techniques (microwave imaging, hyperthermia, and ablation).</s><s>The main purpose of this work is to measure the complex permittivity of different types of colon polyps, cancer, and normal mucosa in ex vivo human samples to study if the dielectric properties are appropriate for classification purposes.</s><s>Methods: The complex permittivity of freshly excised healthy colon tissue, cancer, and histological samples of different types of polyps from 23 patients was characterized using an open-ended coaxial probe between 0.5 and 20 GHz.</s><s>The obtained measurements were classified into five tissue groups before applying a data reduction step with a frequency dispersive single-pole Debye model.</s><s>The classification was finally compared with pathological analysis of tissue samples, which is the gold standard.</s><s>Results: The complex permittivity progressively increases as the tissue degenerates from normal to cancer.</s><s>When comparing to the gold-standard histological tissue analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method is the following: 100% and 95% for cancer diagnosis; 91% and 62% for adenomas with high-grade dysplasia; 100% and 61% for adenomas with low-grade dysplasia; and 100% and 74% for hyperplastic polyps, respectively.</s><s>In addition, complex permittivity measurements were independent of the lesion shape and size, which is also an interesting property comparing to current colonoscopy techniques.</s><s>Conclusions: The contrast in complex permittivities between normal and abnormal colon tissues presented here for the first time demonstrate the potential of these measurements for tissue classification.</s><s>It also opens the door to the development of a microwave endoscopic device to complement the outcomes of colonoscopy with functional tissue information.</s></p></div>

electronic chromoendoscopy narrow band imaging may also enhance the visualization of the vascularization abnormalities related to cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>However, all these techniques exploit the same contrast mechanism based on the optical image, thus being restricted to information visualized with the camera at the tip of the endoscope.</s><s>To overcome this limitation a different contrast mechanism is needed.</s><s>Some methods such as near infrared Raman <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> or terahertz spectroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> have also been proposed for cancer diagnosis purposes.</s><s>However, there is not a technique yet that can distinguish between benign and malignant lesions during the study.</s></p><p><s>Microwave imaging has the potential to complement conventional colonoscopy to improve both polyp detection rate and in situ tissue classification.</s><s>Microwaves can generate images without restriction of the field of view (360°) and offer a fair trade-off between resolution and light opaque tissue penetration, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> therefore, potentially reducing visualization problems of conventional colonoscopy.</s><s>In addition, microwaves can provide a quantitative differentiation of normal and abnormal tissues based in their dielectric properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>inally, the technology is safe (low power and nonionizing radiation) and portable.</s><s>For these reasons microwave imaging is a promising method for population screening, diagnosis and monitoring of cancer patients.</s></p><p><s>Microwave imaging tries to evaluate objects hidden or embedded in a structure (or medium) using electromagnetic (EM) waves in the regime of the microwaves.</s><s>In the field of medicine, microwaves have been established as a good solution for treatment of cancer (hyperthermia and ablation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and for monitoring of vital signs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>Furthermore, there is ongoing research studying microwave imaging for imagebased diagnosis in an extensive number of applications: acute ischemia or cerebral hemorrhage, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> pulmonary edema, urinary incontinence, osteoporosis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and breast cancer detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> ;

The complex permittivity measurements of the samples were recorded at room temperature using a linear frequency range between 0.5 and 20 GHz.</s><s>The number of measured frequency points was 101.</s><s>The samples were placed on a stand with a scissor lift controlled manually using a leadscrew.</s><s>The probe was fixed on the axis of a manual positioner and connected to the VNA with a cable.</s><s>The cable was attached to the same axis with a zip tie to reduce sagging and remained untouched during the entire measurement.</s><s>The stand was manually lifted until the entire probe aperture made firm contact with the sample.</s><s>In this way, the coaxial probe was perfectly firm, being easier to avoid air gaps and control the pressure.</s><s>The VNA was calibrated before each measurement using the common three standard loads (open, short, and load).</s><s>Deionized water was used as the load in the calibration process.</s><s>The dimensions of the probe head imposed size and homogeneity restrictions to the sample.</s><s>As a reference, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref> shows the probe range of usability provided by the manufacturer.</s></p><p><s>Before starting measurements on human samples, the appropriateness of the coaxial probe method for colon tissue measurement was verified.</s><s>We performed several experiments with different materials with known complex permittivity to determine the accuracy, minimum size of the sample (lateral dimensions and thickness), and repeatability.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.B.2. Minimum sample size</head><p><s>The minimum thickness of the sample required to obtain reliable measurements was evaluated using a mixture of deionized water and methanol in a certain proportion to obtain a similar complex permittivity as the average of colon tissues.</s><s>We poured the mixture in a beaker placed on a metal surface and we measured the complex permittivity for different levels of mixture to assess the minimum thickness of the sample.</s><s>The minimum lateral size of the sample was assessed directly with the measured complex permittivity data of the excised tissues (between 5 and 30 mm in diameter).</s><s>The minimum lateral size is largely dictated by the probe's geometry.</s><s>Since the interrogating field is mostly confined between the outer and the inner conductor of the probe, the sample must cover completely this area to provide accurate measurements.</s><s>The effects of different sample sizes at 10 GHz were statistically analyzed using the tissues classified as adenoma with LGD because it was the most populated group.</s></p></div>

angulations and folds, poor cleaning, and movements of the colon, among others, are some of the main challenges of colon imaging when performed in vivo.</s></p><p><s>We did not find statistical significant differences in dielectric properties due to the shape of the polyps.</s><s>This may suggest that the complex permittivity could help to detect subtle (slightly elevated, sessile, or flat) polyps, which are the most difficult lesions to detect endoscopically.</s><s>A study that tracked the performance of endoscopists in the detection of flat polyps reported low detection rates

early cancer) compared to pedunculated or sessile lesions irrespective of the size.</s><s>Therefore, detection and subsequent removal of these lesions is of paramount importance for improving the efficacy of colonoscopy in preventing the development of CRC.</s></p><p><s>Aside from the detection itself, the proposed method adds in situ diagnosis capacity.</s><s>With conventional colonoscopy, when a polyp is found, clinicians have to make decisions about resecting or not depending on the type of polyp and its risk to degenerate.</s><s>This information is not available during colonoscopy and endoscopists only rely on subjective observations based on different surface or vascular patterns.</s><s>The accurate diagnosis is only confirmed after excision with the pathology analysis.</s><s>For this reason, the current protocol establishes to resect and analyze all lesions found during the exploration, which is time consuming and costly.</s><s>The measurements presented in this paper, show the possibility to distinguish malignant tissues from healthy mucosa and benign colon tissues, since there is not overlapping between their complex permittivity below 10 GHz.</s><s>Moreover, the grade of dysplasia can be inferred from the complex permittivity as it increases with dysplasia.</s><s>Accordingly, polyps with LGD present a complex permittivity very close to that of the benign tissues and polyps with HGD occupy the intermediate region between healthy tissues and cancer.</s></p></div>
