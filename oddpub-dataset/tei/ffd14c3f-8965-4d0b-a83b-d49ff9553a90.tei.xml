<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Single-blinded study</head><p><s>In grouped analysis of the 18 patients who received 54 weeks of M+I treatment, NO bioavailability increased compared with baseline ( p&lt;0.01).</s><s>Furthermore, a reduction in SO ( p&lt;0.01) and an increase of PON-1 (both p=0.03) was seen (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>No change in cholesterol efflux capacity was noted.</s><s>Lipid levels were increased and inflammatory and RA disease activity scores were significantly reduced (data not shown).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study shows that anti-inflammatory treatments can improve the antioxidant and endothelial protective properties of HDL in  patients with erosive RA.</s><s>These effects were not accompanied by changes in cholesterol efflux and tracked improvements in RA disease activity.</s><s>Treatment with infliximab in addition to MTX for 2 years showed a benefit for a broad range of HDL functional properties including NO bioavailability, SO production and PON-1 activity.</s><s>These findings suggest that there is a role for anti-inflammatory treatments, particularly those targeting the TNF-α pathway, for improving not only RA disease activity but also potentially CV risk factors in patients with RA.</s></p><p><s>The threefold increased risk of CV disease in patients with RA is not accounted for by traditional risk factors and is related to increased levels of inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>This influences a range of CV risk factors and causes quantitative and qualitative changes to lipoproteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref></s><s>Substantial evidence has now accumulated, suggesting that inflammation can convert the normally protective HDL into a 'particle with adverse effects on endothelial function'. <ref type="bibr">4 14</ref></s><s>e showed that HDL has several dysfunctional properties in patients with RA, which may contribute to their increased CV risk.</s><s>Our findings are in agreement with previous evidence describing a pro-inflammatory HDL particle with reduced PON-1 activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref></s><s>We have now demonstrated an impairment of the beneficial effects of HDL on endothelium with a marked decrease in the stimulation of endothelial NO and increase in SO production compared with healthy controls.</s><s>Diminished production of NO may reflect endothelial dysfunction, an early step in atherogenesis, and represents a novel pathway by which HDL dysfunction can promote arterial disease in patients with RA.</s></p><p><s>We evaluated the potential for HDL function to be restored following treatment with RA anti-inflammatory therapies.</s><s>MTX is commonly used as a first-line treatment in early RA.</s><s>Observational studies have demonstrated reduced rates of myocardial infarction and stroke with MTX therapy and the ongoing CIRT trial is evaluating the drug in secondary CV prevention. <ref type="bibr">16 17</ref></s><s>Its exact anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain uncertain, although it has been shown to mediate increased extracellular accumulation of adenosine around connective tissue and reduce levels of CRP and interleukin-6. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref></s><s>Biological inhibition of TNF-α with infliximab in addition to MTX is a more effective approach for reducing RA disease activity.</s><s>TNF-α is a proximal cytokine and its blockade has well-established antiinflammatory actions and effects on lipid metabolism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref></s><s>At 54 weeks, NO bioavailability was significantly improved in patients who received infliximab, but not with MTX.</s><s>Infliximab has previously been associated with increased AKT/eNOS phosphorylation and improved endothelial function. <ref type="bibr">19 20</ref></s><s>Our study provides a novel mechanism by which infliximab can improve endothelial function and contribute to vascular protection by TNF-α inhibition.</s></p><p><s>After 1 year of our double-blinded randomised trial, SO production was significantly reduced in both arms.</s><s>MTX is known to inhibit several inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators, associated with increased lipid peroxidation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref></s><s>Oxidative modification of the HDL particle alters its protective phenotype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref></s><s>ombination therapy with infliximab caused an additional reduction of SO production compared with MTX alone.</s><s>Previous studies of infliximab in humans suggest that TNF-α inhibition protects against oxidative DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, and this may explain its additional efficacy in reducing SO production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref></s><s>Despite a trend towards an increased benefit of infliximab therapy at 1 year, between-treatment comparisons did not reach statistical significance.</s></p><p><s>Assay of PON-1 provided an additional measure of the antioxidative function of HDL but no significant difference was found in the double-blinded randomised study in either arm at 1 year possibly due to the small sample size.</s><s>However, PON-1 activity was improved in the single-blinded study at 1 and 2 years treatment of infliximab.</s><s>While the effect of MTX on PON-1 activity has not previously been reported, infliximab is known to improve PON-1 activity through the reduction of lipid peroxidation including myeloperoxidase (MPO) pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref></s><s>Site-specific oxidative modification of PON-1 by MPO impairs the enzymes ability to bind with APOA-1 and reduced MPO could explain the increased PON-1 activity in our patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref></s><s>e did not demonstrate any differences in cholesterol efflux with either treatment regimen.</s><s>This suggests that antiinflammatory therapies have a more pronounced impact on the vascular properties of HDL than on its efflux capacity.</s><s>These findings support previous reports from our group and indicate that the endothelial function of HDL may be more sensitive to modification than cholesterol efflux. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>However, antiinflammatory treatments including MTX and infliximab have recently been associated with improved cholesterol efflux in patients with RA, and associated with CV disease in both healthy and at-risk populations. <ref type="bibr">10 26-28</ref></s><s>These differences may be due to methodological issues in the efflux measurement and their interpretation, and require further investigation.</s></p><p><s>Our study was not powered to assess the quantitative relationship between HDL function, inflammation and disease activity.</s><s>This also limited our ability to test for between-treatment differences in the randomised study design, although combination therapy demonstrated a clear benefit in the single-blinded study.</s><s>However, we have demonstrated that a range of vascular properties of HDL can be improved with anti-inflammatory drug therapy.</s><s>HDL function did not return to normal levels following treatment, and this is likely to be as a result of the residual levels of inflammation even after 2 years treatment (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>The ability of anti-inflammatory treatments to modify CV risk remains an intense area of clinical research.</s><s>Currently, three anti-inflammatory agents are the subject of phase III trials; MTX (CIRT), Darapladib (SOLID-TMI and STABILITY) and canakinumab (CANTOS).</s><s>Recently, both the STABILITY and SOLID-TMI trials reported that darapladib failed to reduce the risk of CV death and myocardial infarction in primary and secondary prevention. <ref type="bibr">29 30</ref></s><s>The CIRT and CANTOS trials are due to report shortly, but our data suggest that monotherapy with MTX alone may not be sufficient.</s><s>Inhibition of TNF-α, a broad immune effector, is more likely to suppress inflammation and may be a better strategy for CV benefit.</s></p><p><s>This study underlines the need to measure and better understand HDL function.</s><s>It provides evidence for the use of antiinflammatory treatments, particularly those modulating the TNF-α pathway, to restore the beneficial effects of HDL on the vasculature.</s><s>Our findings are of relevance to many recent clinical trials evaluating both HDL elevation and anti-inflammatory therapies with the aim of reducing CV risk.</s></p></div><figure
