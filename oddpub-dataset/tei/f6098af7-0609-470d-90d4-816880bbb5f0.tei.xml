<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction of translation attenuation sites renders insoluble EHs soluble</head><p><s>Based on the EH-Ar example, we hypothesized that synchronization of the translation profiles of other insoluble EHs with that of EH-Ar will facilitate their soluble expression in E. coli.</s><s>We took two different EHs, M5bG7 and M9dH11 of metagenomic origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref>, which partition mostly in the insoluble fraction when expressed in E. coli.</s><s>Their translation profiles in E. coli were predominantly smooth (Figs 2A and 3A, original profiles).</s><s>EHs display highly conserved three-dimensional structures with a common α/β hydrolase fold <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref>.</s><s>To determine the structural domains in M5bG7 and M9dH11, we aligned their predicted secondary structures to the EH-Ar secondary structure (Figs 2A and 3A, alignments).</s><s>Notably, the secondary structure of the three EHs revealed a conserved pattern which aligned to the domain structure of EH-Ar was used to delineate the single domains of M5bG7 and M9dH11.</s><s>In EH-Ar the slow-translated regions are located approximately 30 amino acids downstream of the domain boundaries (Fig 1A <ref type="figure">)</ref>, hence for introducing the slow-translating regions in M5bG7 and M9dH11 we selected regions at a similar distance from the C-termini of their putative domains.</s><s>Thus, the pausing sites were positioned downstream of the domains boundaries including a stretch of the peptide chain that will be covered in the ribosomal tunnel.</s><s>M5bG7 possesses an additional N-terminal domain <ref type="bibr">(Fig 3A)</ref> which is absent in the other EHs; this difference was considered by the positioning of the translational attenuation sites.</s><s>Interestingly, in all regions we selected for introducing the slow-translating codons Leu residues are present, although those Leu residues in M5bG7 and M9dH11 they are encoded by fast-translating Leu codons as compared to the slow-translating CUA codon in EH-Ar.</s><s>Since for EH-Ar even a single CUA codon was sufficient to confer a transient pause (Fig 1A, EH-Ar-LL mutant), to create variants with slowtranslating patches in each selected region downstream of the putative domains in M5bG7 and M9dH11 we substituted only one Leu-encoding triplet with the CUA codon (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A and 3A</ref>,  doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0127039.g003</s><s>adopted profiles).</s><s>In M5bG7 the introduction of the first attenuation site (M5-L1 mutant) did not alter its solubility, while the second attenuation site (M5-L2 mutant) enhanced the solubility of M5bG7 to approximately 40% (Fig 2B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">and 2C</ref>).</s><s>Since no activity test is available for these enzymes to probe their physiologically active, folded structure, we used solubility in the cytosol of the expression host as a proxy of folded structure.</s><s>None of the synonymous mutations altered the mRNA level compared to the wild-type M5bG7 (Fig 2D <ref type="figure">)</ref>, thus the observed effect in the solubility was solely a result of changes in the translation speed.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the high expression levels of wild-type M5bG7 in the insoluble fraction, wildtype M9dH11 was expressed at very low levels at the detection limit of immunoblot.</s><s>Thus, we first sought to enhance the total yield of M9dH11 to be somewhat comparable to M5bG7.</s><s>For the M9dH11 expression, we used the same expression vector as for EH-Ar and M5bG7 so that their expression is controlled by identical promoter and translation initiation-controlling elements (e.g., Shine-Dalgarno-sequence and 5' UTR region).</s><s>We hypothesized that the low expression of M9dH11 could be due to initiation interference by mRNA structure in the vicinity of the start codon <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The 5' coding region of M9dH11 showed lower (more stable) folding energy that that of M5bG7 and EH-Ar and consequently higher propensity to partition to secondary structures (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</s><s>To increase the folding energy in this initial region and disrupt secondary structures, the third base of five codons downstream of the start codon was exchanged to A which resulted in M9dH11_opt construct rendering the secondary structure propensity of this region (3 rd to 7 th codon, Fig 3B, shadowed area) in a range similar as for M5bG7 and EH-Ar; further downstream in the sequence the folding energies of the mRNA sequences of the EH variants differed but those are irrelevant for translation initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>.</s><s>All exchanges were synonymous and did not alter the amino acid sequence, but notably, they boosted the expression yield of the M9dH11_opt, and like wild-type M5bG7, a large fraction of it partitioned to the insoluble fraction (Fig 3C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">and 3D</ref>).</s><s>However, at one hour induction the expression of M9H11_opt remained lower than those of M5bG7; comparable expression levels with M5bG7 were achieved when expressing M9dH11_opt for 2 h.</s><s>Introduction of slow-translating regions at the domain boundaries (M9-LL_opt) increased the solubility to nearly 90% (Fig 3C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">and 3D</ref>).</s><s>Notably, each attenuation sites alone (M9-L1_opt and M9-L2_opt) resulted in similar enhancement of the solubility (Fig 3C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">and 3D</ref>).</s><s>The effect was not due to any increase in the mRNA expression level; the amount of mRNA for all M9dH11_opt variants remained the same (Fig 3E <ref type="figure">)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, these results clearly evidence that the solubility of heterologously expressed protein can be enhanced by adapting its translation profile to the tRNA pool of the expression host.</s><s>Introducing slow-translating regions downstream of the domain boundaries greatly increased the solubility of a multi-domain protein.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Despite its importance in research (e.g. in structural analysis) and industrial applications, producing a protein in microbial hosts can be a challenging task and often needs individual optimization for each gene.</s><s>Here, we suggest a rational, structure-guided design to modulate translation profiles that enhance solubility of a target protein in the bacterial host.</s><s>By considering the co-translational hierarchical folding of the single domains in a heterologous expression system, we introduce slow-translating regions downstream of the putative domain boundaries to enhance the solubility of two EHs with metagenomc origin in E. coli.</s><s>We used a protein family member (here EH-Ar) with solved crystal structure to delineate domain boundaries in EH homologs of unknown structure based on conserved secondary structure pattern.</s><s>In the case of multidomain EH enzymes, our results clearly show that this strategy enhances the solubility of EHs of metagenomic origin up to 90%.</s><s>The positions of slow-translating patches are chosen to allow a whole domain to be completely outside of the ribosome following a stretch that will be covered in the ribosomal tunnel.</s><s>For the EHs this stretch is approximately 30 aa, but the length of the stretch protected in the ribosomal tunnel may vary (20-70 aa), and depends on the propensity of the nascent chain in this part to form extended or compact, α-helical, conformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Comparison of EHs from different organisms, expressed in a soluble form in their hosts <ref type="bibr">[54]</ref>, revealed that based on the corresponding codon usage rare codons are present in the regions down-stream (20-70 aa) of the domain boundaries (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Even though the tRNA concentration of those organisms is unknown, for the majority of these codons the genomic tRNA copy number is low suggesting that those regions are most likely translated slower than the neighboring sequences within the domains.</s><s>The common shape of the attenuation signature for many EHs in their natural hosts might be an additional selective force to preserve high fidelity of co-translational folding of conserved domains across species <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our approach of synchronizing the conserved natural translation profiles to the tRNAome household, or at least to the codon usage, of the expression host proves to be a successful strategy to enhance the yields of soluble protein.</s></p><p><s>Strikingly, the mere exchange of a single Leu to the synonymous CUA codon is sufficient to slow down nascent chain elongation in this region and enhance solubility of the protein product.</s><s>The CUA codon is read by the rarest tRNA in E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref> and is particularly useful due to this unique feature; even a single Leu codon might be sufficient to transiently attenuate the ribosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>.</s><s>If there is no Leu for synonymous variation in the region to be rendered slowtranslating, substitutions of a few codons with their slow-translating counterparts should be considered.</s><s>Usually groups of slow-translating codons, rarely consecutive but rather within a short sequence window of the mRNA elicit transient attenuation of the ribosome traffic <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>.</s><s>However, changes in the coding sequence, even also of a single codon, may alter mRNA stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56]</ref>.</s><s>In our case, the synonymous exchanges to convert Leu codons to slow-translating ones in both M5bG7 and M9dH11 caused none or subtle changes in the local mRNA folding energy which is mirrored by the equal mRNA levels between the M5bG7 and M9dH11 and their variants with synonymous exchanges.</s><s>The efficiency of a nucleotide to modulate the local secondary structure propensity depends on the local sequence.</s><s>Thus, while some single nucleotide substitutions may alter the local secondary structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56]</ref>, others may remain indifferent for the secondary structure.</s><s>In turn, to significantly influence the local folding energy, if this is desired, more than one nucleotide substitutions might be needed; to lower the folding energy in the vicinity of the start codon of M9dH11 we have undertaken five substitutions.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, for proteins expressed at a very low level, as in the case of M9dH11, it might be necessary to first optimize the efficiency of translation initiation before modulating solubility.</s><s>Very low expression yields even with inefficient translation pattern may still result in soluble proteins as the concentration of a misfolded aggregation-prone species may remain under the critical concentration for initiating aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>.</s><s>In line with this is the observation that expression at low induction regimes can result in functional folded proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The structure of the initial 5'-coding sequence heavily influences initiation, i.e. ribosome loading, and consequently gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">5]</ref>.</s><s>Decreasing the propensity of M9dH11 to form secondary structure in the initial region by synonymous substitution of some codons in the 5'-coding region with their A-rich counterparts increases its total expression which in combination with translational pauses along the mRNA dramatically enhances soluble yields of the protein.</s><s>Thus, various parameters in mRNA structure and sequence should be simultaneously optimized to enhance the production of active folded protein.</s></p><p><s>Variations in tRNA abundances among different organisms affect the translation pattern which consequently alters the expression of heterologous proteins.</s><s>A rational design of synonymous substitutions to harmonize translation profiles is possible for only a handful of organisms; so far concentration of the full tRNA set has been determined for very few organisms, including E. coli, B. subtilis and L. lactis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>.</s><s>As a close proxy to harmonize translation profiles in the expression host, the codon usage <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">58]</ref> or tRNA gene copies <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[59]</ref> can be used, although they do not precisely mirror the tRNA concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Our structure-based approach is independent of the information on the tRNAome of the parental strain, but it requires at least one 3D structure of a homolog to identify the structural domains.</s><s>Introduction of translational attenuation sites that delineate structural domains in otherwise smooth translation profiles remarkably increases the soluble expression.</s><s>This adaptation of the translation profile to the tRNA abundances of the new host proves to be a successful strategy to enhance the yields of soluble, folded and active protein.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.</s><s>Translation attenuation sites delineate domain boundaries and impact protein solubility.</s><s>(A) Translation profile of EH-Ar predicted with RiboTempo.</s><s>Vertical gray bars represent the rate of translation of each single codon which is averaged (red line) along the whole ORF with a window of 19 codons [42].</s><s>Translation minima below the genome-wide threshold (blue horizontal line) denote the putative slow-translating attenuation sites.</s><s>AA denotes amino acid number, kDa marks the corresponding molecular weight and SS denotes the predicted secondary structure (β-sheets-blue bars, α-helicesdark red bars, uncolored empty space-linking structural elements).</s><s>The rainbow-colored bar visualizes the putative structural domains, colored in the same way in the 3D-structure (PDB 1EHY).</s><s>(B) Summary of the exchanged codons in EH-Ar.</s><s>The position of the exchanged amino acids for each variant is indicated.</s><s>(C) Translation profiles of EH-Ar variants with exchanged slow translating patches (B) predicted with RiboTempo.</s><s>(D, E).</s><s>Removal of the translational attenuation sites reduces the solubility of EH-Ar.</s><s>(D) Representative immunoblot of EH-Ar variants (summarized in C).</s><s>The total (T) protein content was fractionated into soluble (S) and insoluble (I) fractions and 0.05 OD 600 of cells were applied per lane.</s><s>GAPDH served as a loading control;
