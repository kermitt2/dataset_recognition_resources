<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The role and effects of mutations in the RNase H domain in contributing to NRTI failure have not been fully elucidated, particularly in non-B subtypes, with most available data describing subtype B sequences from developed countries.</s><s>Here, treatment-related mutations were identified by comparing mutation frequencies in subtype C NRTI treatment-experienced sequences to those in subtype C ART naive sequences.</s><s>Our findings indicate that several previously identified NRTI drug resistance mutations (435, 483, 491, 519, 530, and 554) of subtype B <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> represent the wild-type in subtype C, thereby warranting further characterization of their role.</s><s>In our cohort, the E529D mutation was significantly more prevalent in sequences from NRTI treated patients, suggesting that it is a treatment related mutation in South African subtype C viruses.</s></p><p><s>As expected, most of the amino acids in the active site and primer grip site were conserved, as mutations in these regions impact on the functioning of RNase H <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. Previous reports demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that mutations (N474, Q475 and Y501) in or near the primer binding site reduced RNase H cleavage specificity and modified the enzyme's ability to remove the polypurine tract primer.</s><s>Furthermore, mutations in the RNase H sites overlapping the protease cleavage site caused defects in the virus and malfunctioning of the HIV-1 integrase enzyme <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, these findings suggest that any changes in positions closer to these functionally important sites may lead to RNase H and RT enzyme inefficiency.</s></p><p><s>None of the resistance-associated mutations in RNase H (L469F, K527N, Q509L and K558E/R) identified for subtype B <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> were found to be significant among treated compared to naive participants in this cohort.</s><s>Codons L469 and K527 were highly polymorphic in both ART-naive and treatment-experienced sequences, with the exception of position K558 that showed a low degree of variability in both treated and treatment naive sequences.</s><s>Additionally, this study did not observe any association between K558 and thymidine analog mutations (TAMs) and this in contrast with previous studies that showed combination of K558 and TAMs conferring resistance to thymidine analog drugs.</s><s>Furthermore, mutations at RNase H positions 435, 483, 491, 519, 530, and 554 previously reported to be associated with NRTI drug resistance in subtype B studies were found in both naive and treated sequences at high prevalence, indicating that these are naturally occurring polymorphisms in subtype C. Previous studies have reported that position 469, 470 and 554 are near the RNase H primer grip and active site, suggesting that any changes in these positions could reduce the RNase H activity by indirectly modifying the interaction between the C-terminal of RT and its nucleic acid substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>In combination with TAMs and A371V, Q509L mutation reduced AZT susceptibility about 10-to 50-fold in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Overall, our study demonstrated similar subtype difference between subtype B and C in protease and polymerase domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, suggesting that these differences could affect replication capacity and cytopathogenicity of subtype C sequences compared to subtype B sequences, or result from a confounding effect of shared history.</s></p><p><s>Resistance pathways to NRTI treatment were further investigated using Bayesian Network Learning.</s><s>The presence of RNase H mutation E529D was directly dependent on whether or not the patient received an NRTI, supporting its role in the development of NRTI resistance.</s><s>Recent work by <ref type="bibr">Barral et al. (2016)</ref> also observed a prevalence increase of E529D following treatment administration in subtype C patients in Brazil <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, further supporting our findings.</s><s>Other RNase H mutations were also connected to treatment experience, although the support for these connections was low.</s><s>Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the emergence of E529D patients did not result from a shared ancestry but rather from multiple independent selection events.</s><s>Unfortunately, this study was unable to directly link the presence of E529D with a specific antiretroviral drug since we could not differentiate d4T from AZT users within the treated group.</s><s>However, the exact role of E529D needs to be further investigated using site-directed mutagenesis as this mutation can either increase phenotypic resistance or restore enzymatic activity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p><s>This study identified differences in the mutational response of RT to NRTI treatment between subtype B and South African subtype C, with novel mutation E529D, in particular, strongly associated with treatment experience.</s><s>Results obtained from this study strongly support the need for additional research on the role of the RNase H region in the development of HIV-1 drug resistance, using larger association studies and drug susceptibility assays.</s><s>Findings from subtype B studies should be re-evaluated to exclude a confounding effect of epidemiology on the identification of mutations.</s></p></div>
