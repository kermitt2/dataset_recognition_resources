<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data Collection.</head><p><s>Data were collected from the electronic patient files.</s><s>Neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count of &lt;500/mm 3 or a leukocyte count of &lt;1000/mm 3 in the first 96 hours after ICU admission.</s><s>Neutropenia had to last for at least 24 hours confirmed by two independent blood samples.</s><s>Patients had to be treated for at least 24 hours on the intensive care unit to be included in the study.</s><s>Sepsis was defined in accordance to the consensus definition by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Number of blood transfusions, length of mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal renal support were also documented.</s><s>Focus of infection as diagnosed by the intensivist in charge and results of microbiological cultures were registered.</s><s>Coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci were only classified as infecting organism if present in more than one blood culture.</s><s>Culture results were regarded as relevant for the initial sepsis when they were acquired up to 7 days before or after ICU admission.</s><s>Fungal infection was classified following the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Results of virology examinations were also documented.</s><s>Respiratory failure was defined as intubation in the ICU, tracheotomy, or noninvasive ventilation for at least 3 h per day.</s><s>Circulatory failure was defined by the need of vasopressors as prescribed by the intensivist in charge.</s><s>Liver failure was defined by bilirubin levels &gt; 2 mg/dL or an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 2 or a prothrombin time &lt; 50.</s><s>Kidney failure was defined according to the RIFLE classification or requirement of renal replacement therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score II (APACHE II) were documented at admission and at the time point of overcoming the sepsis as were the different parameters for organ dysfunction.</s></p><p><s>The ICU stay was divided into two phases.</s><s>The initial septic crisis and, if it was survived, a second phase until discharge from the ICU.</s><s>The initial sepsis was considered resolved when the patient was free of vasopressors, extubated, or required less than 3 h of noninvasive ventilation per day, had a decrease of C-reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin of more than 50% for more than 48 h, or no systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for more than 24 h.</s></p><p><s>Our intention was to identify factors that predicted ICU mortality if the initial crisis was overcome.</s><s>558 patients with neutropenia were screened and 102 meeting the aforementioned sepsis criteria were included.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">General Patient</head><p><s>Characteristics.</s><s>Among the 12.352 patients admitted to our ICU ward between 2006 and 2011, 558 neutropenic patients were identified and 102 patients fulfilling the criteria for neutropenic sepsis were included in our analysis.</s><s>Leukopenia was attributable to chemotherapy ( = 79), underlying hematologic disease ( = 12), infection ( = 4), side effect of nonchemotherapeutic drugs ( = 1), autologous bone marrow transplantation ( = 2), and allogenic stem cell transplantation ( = 4).</s><s>The six patients after stem cell transplantation all had a recent transplantation, 8-28 days (median 10, 5 d) prior to referral to the ICU.</s><s>One further patient after allogenic stem cell transplantation was included in the study; however, the transplantation was not recent and the leucopenia was attributable to infection.</s><s>Overall ICU mortality was 54.9% and 28 day mortality was 52.0%; all patients with stem cell transplantation ( = 6) deceased during their ICU stay (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Model of Two Phases of the ICU Stay.</head><p><s>In the first days after admission to the ICU, we observed a particularly high mortality burden, with 22.5% of all admitted patients deceasing in the first 6 days.</s><s>The other fatalities occurred over a more prolonged period of time (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>In order to analyze which patient characteristics are predictive of overcoming the initial sepsis and which characteristics determine whether the patient survives the entire ICU stay, we divided all ICU stays in potentially two phases: First the initial septic episode, followed by a recovery phase if the patient survived the initial crisis.</s><s>As defined by our criteria for overcoming the initial sepsis, out of the total 102 patients 63 survived the initial septic crisis, while 39 patients failed to overcome the initial sepsis and deceased during that phase.</s><s>Of the 63 patients that were Critical Care Research and Practice successfully treated for the initial sepsis, 17 patients consecutively died during the recovery phase, while 46 patients were discharged alive from the ICU (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Severity of Sepsis and Organ Failure Predicts Overcoming</head><p><s>or Not of the Initial Sepsis.</s><s>The patient group that did not overcome the initial sepsis episode was admitted to the ICU with a significantly higher respiratory rate, higher first documented serum lactate value and higher APACHE II and SOFA scores as compared to the group that survived the initial sepsis.</s><s>Patients that failed to overcome the initial crisis were more likely to be intubated and had a lower oxygenation index.</s><s>A similar proportion of both groups received vasopressors on admission, and there was no significant difference in the mean arterial pressure (MAP), but the patients who did not overcome the first sepsis episode received significantly more fluids in the first 24 h and had a higher maximal noradrenaline dose.</s><s>They more often presented liver and renal failure, and the group with persistent sepsis received more transfusions of erythrocytes, platelets, and fresh frozen plasma.</s><s>There was no difference in the highest CRP as a marker for inflammation; however, the patients who overcame the sepsis achieved lower CRP values.</s><s>Furthermore, longer duration of leukopenia prior to ICU admission was associated with worse outcome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Persistent Organ Damage and High Initial CRP Predicts</head><p><s>Poor Outcome after Overcoming the First Sepsis.</s><s>There was no significant difference in the disease severity on admission to the ICU between those patients who survived the initial sepsis phase and those who died later on despite overcoming the initial sepsis.</s><s>Both groups had similar respiratory rates, first documented serum lactate values, APACHE II and SOFA scores when admitted to the ICU.</s><s>There was no difference in the MAP, fluids administered, or need for vasopressors in the first 24 h.</s><s>The group of nonsurvivors had a higher frequency of circulatory failure after overcoming the initial sepsis and a higher maximal noradrenaline dose in their total ICU stay.</s></p><p><s>The nonsurvivors where more often intubated, underwent tracheotomy more frequently, and showed persistent lung failure after the first sepsis episode.</s><s>Likewise, renal and liver failure was more frequent in the group with the unfavorable outcome.</s><s>The nonsurvivors received more erythrocyte, platelet, and fresh frozen plasma transfusions per ICU day.</s><s>Furthermore the nonsurvivors had a significantly higher CRP in the first 10 days, which persisted in the course of their ICU stay, indicating a higher initial and maintained extent of inflammation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Impact of Microbiologic Findings on the ICU Outcome.</head><p><s>In 65 patients, the microbiological testing identified bacteria and/or fungus associated with the initial sepsis.</s><s>The identified species were Gram-negative bacteria in 31, Gram-positive bacteria in 27 patients, and in 12 patients, microbiology findings indicated a fungal infection.</s><s>Since coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci are frequent contamination of blood cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, positive cultures with these bacteria were only considered indicative of an infection if present in at least two cultures; single positive cultures were regarded as suspicious of contamination instead of infection and are displayed separately (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>The most common Gram-negative microorganism was E. coli, and the most frequent Gram-positive were coagulase-negative staphylococci.</s><s>Aspergillus and other molds were the most frequently observed fungal infections.</s><s>Interestingly, among the six most frequently identified bacteria, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium were associated with a higher mortality (significantly higher mortality compared to all other patients with positive microbiologic culture results,  = 0.039) (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, patients who deceased in the ICU had significantly longer indwelling central venous lines than patients who survived ( = 0.009) (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>In 37 patients, no causative agent for the initial sepsis was identified.</s><s>Overall, culture-positive patients had a worse prognosis than patients without successful identification (46.2% versus 24.3% failed to overcome the initial sepsis, with 66% versus 35.1% total ICU mortality).</s><s>Patients with noneffective antibiotic therapy had an increased ICU mortality of 81.8% ( = 11).</s><s>All patients with evidence of a fungal infection (4x Aspergillus antigen positive, 1x detection of aspergillus in airways, 1x aspergillus in tissue biopsy,   39 patients, 6 had active CMV replication, and all 6 patients deceased during their ICU treatment (data not shown).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In this retrospective cohort study, we examined patients with neutropenic sepsis admitted to a medical ICU.</s><s>We report here total mortality and survival times at the ICU and assessed different predictors of ICU mortality in the different phases of the ICU stay.</s><s>Additionally, we analyzed microbiologic findings and their association with the clinical course.</s><s>The overall ICU-mortality in our cohort was 54.9%.</s><s>While significantly higher mortality rates were reported for neutropenic patients in former decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, Legrand et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> recently presented a comparable mortality rate of 49.8% in their cohort of patients with neutropenic sepsis.</s><s>A group of cancer patients with various diagnoses examined by Pené et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> showed an ICU-mortality of 52.7%, which is also in the same range as ours, although not only septic patients were examined.</s><s>Mokart et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> found a surprisingly low ICUmortality of 23% comparable to the numbers reported for infected patients without neutropenia, for example, in a large multicenter trial by Vincent in 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Potential differences in the study populations may account for the reported variability in survival, since factors such as the reason for neutropenia may exert a strong impact on outcome.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we chose to adopt a two-phase model to analyze our cohort of patients.</s><s>While many patients died during the initial septic shock episode, a significant number of patients succumbed later after they had overcome the primary sepsis phase.</s><s>We believe that it is more useful to assess these patient groups separately instead of analyzing them together, since the factors predicting outcome in the initial sepsis and the recovery phase may differ substantially.</s></p><p><s>Once the first sepsis is overcome, persistent organ failure is associated with poor survival, regardless of whether it was respiratory, circulatory, renal, or hepatic failure.</s><s>Additionally, a high initial CRP and higher persistent CRP levels indicated poor outcome, stressing the importance of successful source control and adequate antibiotic therapy in early in the course by prescribing adequate antibiotic regimens and choosing adequate doses and taking other actions aiming at source control like replacement of central lines or removing them if possible.</s><s>Another possible explanation might be that an elevated immune response in the patients with higher markers of inflammation may contribute to worse prognosis.</s><s>Unlike the patients that were lost during the initial sepsis, the illness severity scores at admission had no impact on survival once the first sepsis episode was resolved.</s><s>One might suggest that any organ failure remaining after successful therapy of the initial insult leaves the patient more susceptible to a second hit, most often secondary infection.</s><s>A state of immune paralysis related to any failing organ system may be causally accused as well as prolonged immobilization or a state of persisting catabolic metabolism.</s><s>Our data do not allow drawing a safe conclusion regarding a definite cause.</s></p><p><s>Duration of neutropenia is often considered a main factor determining the prognosis of patients with neutropenic sepsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s>While duration of prior neutropenia was associated with an unfavorable outcome in our study, the persistence of neutropenia was not detected as a predictive factor once the initial sepsis was overcome.</s><s>Possibly our study was underpowered to detect the impact of resolving neutropenia or the impact of leukocyte recovery is overplayed by other factors such as persistent need for organ support.</s></p><p><s>Unexpectedly, patients with a positive microbiological culture result showed a significantly higher mortality than those patients with negative results.</s><s>To us the most reasonable explanation is that negative cultures point to an adequate selection of antibiotics prior to ICU-admission on the ward, since all patients were already under antibiotic treatment when admitted to the ICU.</s><s>Another possible explanation is that culture-negative patients may have suffered from a SIRS of noninfectious origin, which might carry a better prognosis depending on etiology.</s><s>Furthermore, it may be reasonable to assume that the likelihood of identifying a causative microorganism increases with extent and severity of the infection.</s><s>Additionally, negative cultures after admission to the ICU may reflect successful coverage of the culprit organism by the antimicrobial treatment given prior to ICU admission.</s><s>As expected, patients with an inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy had a significantly higher mortality, which is consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, infections with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and Enterococcus spp.</s><s>showed a higher degree of systemic inflammation mirrored in a significantly higher CRP level and a higher ICU mortality.</s><s>In comparison, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated only in a minority of four patients.</s><s>Our data would thus suggest calculated treatment with glycopeptides or other antibiotics with activity against CNS and Enterococcus species.</s></p><p><s>Most of the isolated bacterial pathogens are part of the flora of gut and skin.</s><s>This suggests a potentially crucial role of translocation through gastrointestinal mucosa due to mucositis on one hand and catheter-related infections on the other hand.</s><s>In patients who succumbed to the initial sepsis, the time elapsed since the last replacement of central venous lines was significantly longer.</s><s>Consistent with this observation, indwelling central line removal has previously been associated with better outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, strategies for preventing bacterial translocation and strict removal or replacement of central venous lines after ICU admission should be advocated.</s></p><p><s>Notably, all patients who tested positive for active CMV infection deceased during their ICU stay.</s><s>It remains unclear whether this active replication is only a marker of disease severity or plays a causative role in worsening prognosis either due to immunomodulation by or virulence of the virus itself.</s><s>Controlled studies are needed to determine whether consequent prophylaxis or treatment may improve the course of illness in this subset of patients.</s></p><p><s>Two subgroups of patients had a particularly poor outcome: all patients after stem cell transplantation and all patients with a fungal infection on admission died in the course of their ICU stay.</s><s>These observations are in line with previous publications that reported a very poor prognosis of patients after stem cell transplantation or neutropenic fungal infection in the ICU <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our cohort, patients who survived the sepsis received fewer blood transfusions.</s><s>It is impossible to differentiate whether the higher number of transfusions is an indicator of a more severe disease, or if transfusions account for a worse prognosis.</s><s>Problems with transfusion-associated lung injury and transfusion-associated inflammation are well known, and recent studies showed the benefit of restrictive transfusion strategies in different populations of ICU-patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The main limitations of this study are its retrospective character and the fact that it is a single center study.</s><s>Therefore, it is only hypothesis-generating and underscores the urgent need for prospective studies to further identify successful interventions in this subset of patients.</s></p></div>
