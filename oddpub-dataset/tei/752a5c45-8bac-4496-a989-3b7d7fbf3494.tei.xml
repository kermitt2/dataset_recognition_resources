<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Angiography core laboratory evaluation</head><p><s>The HERMES angiography dataset was analyzed by an independent core laboratory with extensive experience in adjudication of imaging and angiography from numerous multicenter stroke trials and registries.</s><s>The angiography images were provided to the core laboratory without any additional information other than the site of the initial target occlusion determined by non-invasive imaging in the original trial.</s><s>As technical differences in imaging technique or dynamic changes in occlusion due to recanalization or distal thrombus migration may occur between baseline non-invasive imaging and conventional angiography, reperfusion was graded based on location of the conventional angiography procedure start.</s></p><p><s>The HERMES angiography core laboratory performed a quality assessment of the angiography data, denoting availability, adequacy, and limiting factors associated with each subject's data.</s><s>As TICI reperfusion in the downstream territory is critically contingent on the specific location of the arterial occlusion, it was imperative that a diagnostic run or contrast injection of the occlusion was available at the procedure start to determine the conventional angiography target occlusion location.</s><s>Similarly, a final run or diagnostic injection of the same arterial territory was required to determine TICI reperfusion.</s><s>In addition, the angiography core laboratory noted when limited data were available, such as the lack of biplane angiography or failure to acquire adequate runs that precluded evaluation of reperfusion.</s><s>A battery of various TICI scores in this study population (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) was used to define reperfusion of the initial target occlusion on non-invasive imaging and conventional angiography.</s><s>This 7-point compilation of TICI grades, termed the expanded TICI (eTICI), reflects all previously reported thresholds used to define reperfusion after endovascular stroke therapy.</s><s>In brief, eTICI grade 0 is equivalent to no reperfusion or 0% filling of the downstream territory; eTICI 1 reflects thrombus reduction without any reperfusion of distal arteries; eTICI 2a is reperfusion in less than half or 1-49% of the territory; eTICI 2b50 is 50-66% reperfusion, exceeding the modified TICI (mTICI) 2B threshold but below the original TICI 2B cut-off point; eTICI 2b67 is 67-89% reperfusion, exceeding TICI but below TICI 2C; eTICI 2c is equivalent to TICI 2C or 90-99% reperfusion; and eTICI 3 is complete or 100% reperfusion, tantamount to TICI 3.
