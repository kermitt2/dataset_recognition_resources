<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cdk1 and CCNB1 are highly expressed in neuroblastoma cell lines</head><p><s>Expression of both cell cycle regulators, cdk1 and CCNB1, were analyzed on mRNA and protein level in a panel of NB cell lines presenting either with low MYCN levels (NB69, SK-N-FI, SHEP) or with MYCN amplification/overexpression (IMR-32, NGP, NLF, WAC2).</s><s>Both mRNA and protein levels of cdk1 and CCNB1 were elevated in all NB cell lines and the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, RH-41, when compared to a human fibroblast cell line (NHDF, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>No significant correlation between the MYCN status and Cdk1/CCNB1 expression could be detected (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>Of note, in SHEP cells engineered to activate MYCN upon addition of 4-OHT (SHEP MYCN-ER), CCNB1 mRNA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>) but not protein levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>) were elevated compared to controls.</s><s>Induction of shRNA-mediated down-regulation of MYCN in a MYCN-amplified cell line, IMR5, resulted in concomitant down-regulation of both Cdk1 and CCNB1 (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, MYCN is a sufficient but not necessary regulator of CCNB1/cdk1 expression, and upregulaton of CCNB1 and cdk1 is a common feature of neuroblastoma cell lines irrespective of their MYCN status.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Knock-down of CCNB1 or cdk1 by specific siRNAs causes a decrease in NB cell proliferation</head><p><s>Transient downregulation of CCNB1 or cdk1 was achieved by sequence-specific siRNAs in a panel of five neuroblastoma cell lines.</s><s>Both mRNA and protein levels of CCNB1 and cdk1 were significantly and specifically decreased 48 h after transfection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A-3C</ref>).</s><s>Cell viability after knock-down of CCNB1 was significantly reduced in SHEP and WAC2 cells, while reduction of cell viability upon knock-down of cdk1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>) was only significant in NB69 cells.</s><s>A trend for reduced viability was present in all other cell lines, with the exception of the p53-mutated cell line, SK-N-FI, in which cdk1 or CCNB1 downregulation had no effect (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The cdk1 inhibitor, RO-3306, causes a significant reduction of cell viability in neuroblastoma cell lines</head><p><s>To further characterize the impact of the cdk1/ CCNB1 axis on NB cell survival, we used a previously described cdk1 inhibitor, RO-3306 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The effect of RO-3306 on cell viability was analyzed in the same cell line panel as described above.</s><s>Additionally, a human fibroblast cell line (NHDF) as well as a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, RH-41, were included for evaluation of tumor cell specific effects.</s><s>All cell lines responded to RO-3306 treatment by decreased cell viability in a concentration dependent manner (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, both the rhabdomyosarcoma cells as well as the non-tumorigenic NHDF cells were more resistant to RO-3306 than the NB cells in our panel.</s><s>IC50-values in NB cells ranged between 1.3 μM and 4 μM, while RH-41 cells had an IC50-value &gt; 8 μM.</s><s>In isogenic NB cells with low (SHEP) or high levels of MYCN (WAC2) response to RO-3306 was comparable (IC50 48 h :1.3 μM and 1.8 μM, respectively).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Uncontrolled proliferation plays a major role in cancer development and progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Under normal physiological conditions, cell cycle control is executed by a delicate interplay of cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and their corresponding cyclins, whereas overexpression or amplification of cyclins and cdks is observed in various cancer types.</s><s>Therefore, several cdk inhibitors were developed and entered early clinical phases, but those investigational drugs, including the pan cdk inhibitors flavopiridol and roscovitine, showed moderate effects and dose-limiting toxicities.</s><s>Finding a therapeutic window was reported as a major difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In recent years, more specific inhibitors became available, which might have preferable anti-tumor characteristics compared to the broad spectrum inhibitors used before.</s><s>Of note, a combined cdk4/ cdk6 inhibitor, palbociclib, recently received "breakthrough therapy" status for the treatment of ER+/HER2-breast cancer.</s><s>However, identification of the best suited inhibitor will depend on the tumor type and still is a challenge.</s></p><p><s>In neuroblastoma (NB), genomic amplifications of CCND1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> and cdk4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref> were observed in primary tumors, albeit at low frequency.</s><s>Nevertheless, cdk4 and CCND1 levels are found to be generally expressed at higher levels in NB than in other tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Inhibition of cdk4 and cdk6 has also been shown promising activity in preclinical NB models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, inactivation of cdk2 is synthetic lethal in MYCN-amplified tumor cells and cdk2 was also proposed as a potential target for NB therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we confirm high expression of cdks as a feature of NB with unfavorable prognosis and additionally identify CCNB1/cdk1 expression as an MYCN-independent risk factor (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>Both CCNB1 and cdk1 mRNAs are highly expressed in primary NB and this was correlated with reduced overall survival (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>NB cell lines derived from high-stage, aggressive tumors as well as the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RH-41 all presented with high cdk1/CCNB1 expression independent of the MYCN amplification status (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Induction of MYCN in a MYCN-normal cell line caused upregulation of cdk1/CCNB1 expression, while decreased MYCN expression in a MYCN-amplified cell line resulted in reduced cdk1/CCNB1 expression (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3B</ref>).</s><s>However, the high expression levels of cdk1/CCNB1 in cell lines with normal MYCN (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), which are also found in primary tumors in the absence of MYCN amplification, left us to conclude that MYCN is a sufficient but not a necessary driver of cdk1/CCNB1 in neuroblastoma cells.</s></p><p><s>A prominent downstream target of the CCNB1/ cdk1 complex is the tumor suppressor p53, which restricts uncontrolled cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, mainly in G1, or apoptosis.</s><s>Inhibition of CCNB1/cdk1 reactivated and stabilized p53 in cells with functional loss of p53 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Using sequence-specific siRNAs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) or the quinolinyl thiazolinone derivative, , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), to inhibit CCNB1/cdk1, we observed decreased cell viability and an increased number of apoptotic cells in all NB cell lines investigated.</s><s>Interestingly, inhibitor efficiency depended on the p53 status, as cells with p53 mutation were more resistant to treatment with RO-3306.</s><s>The impact of the p53 status on inhibitor efficiency could be confirmed in p53 knock down cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, higher inhibitor concentrations were required to decrease viability in a cell line (NGP) with functional inactivation of p53 due to MDM2 amplification.</s><s>Increased resistance to cdk inhibition in the absence of functional p53 was not confined to neuroblastoma cells as shown in HDMB3 medulloblastoma cells expressing a dominant negative variant of p53 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s><s>In all cell lines analyzed, p53 status did not affect CCNB1 or cdk1 expression mRNA level or protein levels.</s><s>Thus, sensitivity to CCNB1 or cdk1 inhibition was modulated by functional p53, but was not dependent on the MYCN status.</s></p><p><s>The most prominent function of CCNB1 and cdk1 is to form a complex activating the serine/threonine kinase function of cdk1 thus regulating the transition from G2phase to M-phase.</s><s>As cdk1 is also sufficient to drive the entire cell cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, we checked for specific changes in cell cycle distribution upon cdk1 inhibition.</s><s>In cells with intact p53 signaling, apoptosis was the predominant response to cdk1 inhibition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</s><s>Our results add further evidence to the hypothesis that p53 status rather than MYCN expression governs the sensitivity to cdk inhibition (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3-5</ref>) and, moreover, indicate that the cdk1/CCNB1 axis is important for the resistance to cdk inhibition by loss of functional p53 in neuroblastoma cells (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Accumulation of p53 protein after cdk1 inhibition coincided with transcriptional upregulation of p53 targets, p21, BAX and MDM2 (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s><s>These results confirm earlier reports obtained upon RO-3306 treatment of AML cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</s><s>It is also known that p53 can be phosphorylated by cdk1 at Ser315 and that this phosphorylation destabilizes p53 (ref.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, earlier reports that cdk1 inhibition might function independently of the cellular p53 status, could possibly be attributed to unspecific inhibitors used <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s><s>In cells without functional p53 a significant increase in G2 phase was the major response to RO-3306 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>, 5B), and this could be confirmed in cells expressing either a shRNA targeting p53 or a dominant negative form of p53.</s><s>Mechanistically, this difference in the apoptotic response could not be attributed to differential activation of effector caspases, as caspase 8 and 9 were activated after 48 h.</s><s>Caspase-9 phosphorylation by cdk1 has been described to protect cells from apoptosis during mitosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>, while caspase-8 cleavage and thus activation is regulated by concerted action of cdk1 and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1, ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, a pan-caspase inhibitor could block activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation observed upon RO-3306 treatment and could significantly rescue cells from RO-3306-induced apoptosis independent of the p53 status (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</s><s>Thus, by a combination of lossof-function and rescue experiments we could confirm p53 as well as caspase-8 and caspase-9 as important modulators of the response to cdk1-inhibition by RO-3306.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we here demonstrate that cdk1 inhibition by RO-3306 causes apoptosis in a panel of preclinical embryonal tumor models with wild-type 53 and that inhibitor efficiency was determined by p53 mutational status.</s><s>Induction of apoptosis by cdk1inhibition depended on functional p53 signaling, while in cells with p53 inactivation or in cells harboring TP53 mutations a significant G2 phase arrest was observed.</s><s>Further investigation of these effects in in vivo models is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of targeting cdk1 as a novel tool in tumor therapy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>stage 1: n = 23; stage 2: n = 7; stage 3: n = 11; stage
