<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Psychological Diagnosis and Hearing Deficiencies</head><p><s>In Germany, approximately 32.1% of the population aged 18-65 is affected by psychological disturbances.</s><s>Figures from the Federal German Retirement Insurance system state that in the year 2014, 43% of the population reported having been affected by such problems at least once in their lives; the results are a reduction in performance and a retreat from social life.</s><s>These disturbances are the most common reason for workrelated disabilities in Germany, which is a key motivation to develop effective diagnoses and treatment.</s><s>In our survey of 47 deaf patients, 31 had a psychological diagnosis before the implantation, a figure which is significantly higher than the average in the general population.</s><s>Following the intervention, 25 patients (over half of the measured group) had such a diagnosis, which is still much higher than the standard reference.</s><s>We regard this as relevant despite methodological criticisms which have been raised concerning the form of the interview that was used.</s></p><p><s>It is impossible to say how reliable and valid the results of the diagnoses captured with CIDI are in relation to clinical diagnoses.</s><s>Becker et al. regard the use of CIDI as insufficient; in a study of the degree of consistency between clinical diagnoses and the use of CIDIs, they found Kappa values between 0.0 and 0.33 for all diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Becker et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Such unsatisfactory values for the validity and reliability of the CIDI are partially confirmed by the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Semler et al., 1987)</ref>.</s><s>The important coping disturbances in deaf patients are not covered in these estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hund et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Kessler et al. reported</ref> good rates of correspondence between clinical diagnoses and standard interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kessler et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Knappe et al. consider the use of standardized interviews such as CIDI the "gold standard" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Knappe et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>In spite of these methodological issues, in agreement with data, we believe that the higher level of psychological diagnoses in our sample is an accurate representation of the patients' situation.</s><s>In this context, we do not consider the burden of biopsychological and social factors related to deafness and potential side effects of the treatment to be the only causes of the higher level of psychological diagnoses.</s><s>Some of the problems may be neurological; animal experiments have shown that there are direct connections between the acoustic cortex and the limbic system, and these also may play a role <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kraus and Canlon, 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results are in agreement with data from the literature.</s><s>In the current patient cohort, CIDI diagnoses could be broken down into three major groups: affective, anxiety-related, and psychosomatic disturbances.</s><s>The diagnoses were commonly the following: for affective disturbance, dysthymia (coping disturbances); in anxiety: agoraphobia and other phobias of an indistinct nature; psychosomatic disturbances: pain and undefined psychosomatic conditions (possibly including tinnitus).</s><s>Using CIDIs, we diagnosed frequent affective, psychosomatic and anxiety disorders in patients with chronic tinnitus <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Zirke et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>This is in agreement with high prevalence of psychological disorders diagnosed in patients with other chronic somatic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baumeister and Harter, 2011)</ref> or kidney dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(McClellan et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Limitations</head><p><s>The major limitations of this study are small size and lack of homogeneity in our sample.</s><s>Of 47 patients, 36 were bilaterally deaf.</s><s>The remaining 11 patients had a significant hearing loss on the non-CI ear that could not be classified as deafness.</s><s>This might have affected some of our results, for instance it could have lowered the average scores of anxiety postimplantation.</s><s>In addition, there may be differences between the bilaterally-and single sided deafened patients with significant hearing loss on non-CI ear, in terms of CIDI psychological diagnoses.</s><s>Future focus on homogenous groups and increasing the sample number will clarify this issue.</s><s>The next limitation of our study is the heterogeneity of our sample regarding the duration of hearing loss.</s><s>The last limitation is the known hypersensitivity of disease detection by CIDI, when compared to classical diagnostic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Becker et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Terber et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Despite this fact, this is the first work when CIDI is used to diagnose the patients undergoing cochlear implantation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Significance</head><p><s>Since deaf patients have been shown to suffer from a higher psychological stress than the normal-hearing people, psychometric diagnosis and a patient history extended by psychosomatic aspects are indispensable when planning CI.</s><s>In the presence of manifest psychological disorder (depression, anxiety, somatization disorder) appropriate therapeutic co-operation should be initiated even before the implantation.</s><s>Apart from establishing the psychological status of a patient before the CI, psychosomatic monitoring should also be carried out after the implantation because of possible occurrence of psychological disorders after the CI, which could make the auditory rehabilitation process more difficult.</s><s>Over the entire course of treatment, close cooperation of the ORL, head and neck surgeons and audiologists with therapists specialized in psychosomatic medicine is indispensable in order to achieve an optimal result of cochlear rehabilitation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SUMMARY</head><p><s>In general, patients suffering from deafness have higher levels of psychological burden than the population as a whole.</s><s>The standardized tools of psychiatric diagnosis reveal that they are particularly subject to affective disorders and anxiety, as well as psychosomatic illnesses, which are strongly associated with tinnitus.</s><s>Conditions diagnosed before the surgery do not directly change through the implantationthis can only occur through targeted therapies.</s><s>According to the sample description (age, sex, and other social variables) none of these factors significantly correlated with the significant improvement in all aspects of hearing abilities measured during this study.</s><s>However, duration of deafness correlated significantly with the hearing quality (measured by Ol) pre-and post-CI.</s><s>In addition, CI did have positive influence extending beyond hearing, particularly in many psychosocial aspects of their lives, including self-evaluations of their levels of depression and anxiety, tinnitus, quality of life, and coping strategies, as measured through the questionnaires.</s></p><p><s>Our results align with current models of the mechanisms that underlie neuronal plasticity, which at least partially account for post-CI improvements in the auditory processing of patients, including reductions in the symptoms of tinnitus, independent of a person's degree of psychological burden.</s><s>While here the influence of concurrent psychological illnesses and various aspects of a patient's quality of life seem to have a rather indirect effect, it will be crucial to collect further data, such as the degree of hearing loss in the contralateral ear, to capture a better picture of how these factors, which vary highly between individuals, should be integrated into predictions about the potential effectiveness of therapies.</s><s>This strongly suggests that through the entire process of cochlear implantation, from the original diagnosis through rehabilitation and follow-up care, there is a particular need to provide comprehensive psychosomatic care for patients, especially considering the negative effects that anxiety and other psychosomatic conditions have on the ultimate value of the therapy in their lives.</s></p></div>
