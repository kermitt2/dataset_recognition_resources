<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Medical students from all semesters were included in the study, as long as they were enrolled for medical undergraduate studies at the Charité.</s><s>Participation was voluntary and anonymous.</s><s>Formal and ethical approval was obtained from the institutional data protection office and ethic committee (Ethikkommission, Ethikaussschuss 1 am Campus Charité-Mitte; No. EA1/081/12).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size and sampling procedures</head><p><s>Participants were asked for participation via email announcements.</s><s>In the period from June to September 2012, 505 students voluntarily responded to the email announcement and followed an included link to the survey provided online.</s><s>The response rate was 11%.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Provision of e-learning elements via learning management systems (LMS) is one of the key factors for a successful introduction and both effective and persistent usage of digitally supported learning concepts in medical education. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>This single-center survey enlightened some aspects of interest in a comprehensive approach concentrating on students´ use of a LMS and its e-learning tools as well as assessing their needs concerning those offerings on a medical school level.</s><s>To our knowledge it is the first approach to address those topics in medicine without being connected to any single specific course or discipline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>oncerning online knowledge sources in general, the medical school´s own teaching offers such as lecture notes were well liked, but were placed as being used at almost the same level as Wikipedia -far ahead of e.g.</s><s>professional online journals.</s><s>Also in other studies, Wikipedia was considered to be a relevant source of knowledge by students. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref></s><s>Despite such encouraging data, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33</ref> there are also reasonable doubts among professionals concerning the actual reliability of Wikipedia's contents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35</ref></s><s>The results presented here underline the necessity to foster studies about students' media competencies and their learning behaviors.</s><s>However, the findings also seem to recommend e.g. for national associations of individual medical disciplines that one should check articles in Wikipedia which deal with their area of expertise, and to correct or even edit them in a proven and certified manner.</s><s>Future studies will have to address the question how students´ use of such internet sources can be positively influenced by offering instructive and well-approved digital learning tools.</s></p><p><s>As a central headline of students´ preferences for the LMS and its e-learning contents, the term "efficacy" could be stated.</s><s>Offers should be clearly structured, easy to operate, time saving, praxis-oriented and focused on curricular lessons.</s><s>Additionally, a good communication about where to find certain offers seems to be needed.</s><s>Interestingly, fun with any offers or an especially attractive layout was seen by the majority of participants to be less important.</s><s>This might be quite important for clinical teachers who will mostly be rather short of time 36 and could thus invest more effort on the provision of factoriented contents than on a sophisticated design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37</ref></s><s>At the same time it can be stated that most students regarded only few e-learning tools to be relevant for study preparation.</s><s>Knowledge was apparently expected to be taught in as compact a manner as possible, resulting in a preference of those tools which seemed to lead quickly to a learning success, e.g.</s><s>texts or videos rather than discussion forums or wiki-blogs.</s><s>However, such a view on the results has to be seen critically, as still at least one-third of the participants supported forums and online tutoring.</s><s>Along with this, there are examples of successful embedding among students using tools as discussion forums. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39</ref></s><s>Others showed that their local populations appreciated discussion forums most, whereby downloadable data were only seen to be in the midfield and a use of emails even at the end. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>It can be postulated that the ranking of different tools within a LMS will always depend on an individual course's structure -e.g. when a close tutor contact is ensured and there is a steady encouragement of using the tools. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38</ref></s><s>egarding the above-mentioned students´ needs and concluded demands for teachers, faculty development approaches to support teachers´ familiarity with the LMS used and its established e-learning tools and services do seem to be recommendable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37</ref></s><s>When asking for students´ priorities of electronic tools provided by the medical school, a uniform study portal was regarded as most important.</s><s>This can be based on the practical log-in use and easy handling of e-learning materials; students would then not have to switch between individual platforms.</s><s>This issue was also supported by the free-text answers, where students requested an easy access to the LMS and its contents.</s><s>Thus, it seems to be recommendable that medical schools offer one single LMS to offer all digital learning components. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>he "number one" purpose for the LMS usage was the acquisition of information about curricular contents, followed by learning for exams and the preparation and post-processing of seminars.</s><s>Communication tools of the LMS were used less, whereas students' answers had indicated that communication itself was a relevant aspect.</s><s>In this context, it was interesting that emails were still the main line of communication in the evaluated population.</s><s>That could be explained together with a well-established email service of the university.</s><s>Just as other authors have already suggested an embedding of libraries into LMS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40</ref> there could be a potential in connecting universities´ email accounts of students with a firmly established LMS into one passwordprotected platform. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>tudents´ statements showed a strong desire for an active involvement in learning.</s><s>Thus, e-learning offerings should include the possibility of interaction to promote the acquisition of knowledge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>However, this aspect should be discussed critically.</s><s>On the one hand, new features of the Web 2.0 and other means of teaching might be suitable to attract students´ attention, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">39</ref> and these are also demanded by some authors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41</ref></s><s>This might also be a new and promising approach for the population evaluated here, whereby Facebook was not apparently considered to be especially important as source of learning, but rather secondary concerning online communication about study-related aspects.</s><s>On the other hand, it should also be taken into careful consideration that concentrating on proven tools might be more effective for a medical school and its teachers in aiming to provide a good and satisfying education than to follow too much of any current hype. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37</ref></s><s>Another interesting aspect taken from the free-text answers was the wish for retention of access to earlier learning materials.</s><s>This could be important in the context of evidence-based medicine approaches with spiral learning concepts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42</ref> where a LMS could connect different learning levels by linking related contents.</s></p><p><s>Some limitations have to be recognized for this study.</s><s>As the answers had to be given online, this could have led to a non-response bias, attracting only participants interested in the internet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43</ref></s><s>In addition, this was a single-center survey, and that limits its generalizability.</s><s>There might be a bias that it was mostly those things addressed or answered which were also represented at our medical school.</s><s>To learn more about this issue, this survey should be repeated in a multicenter approach on a national or international level.</s><s>Either way, students´ answers will be influenced by the experiences they made at their medical school only.</s><s>As that could give additional objective information about the using behavior of tools provided in a LMS, analyses of students´ behavior and preferences when using the LMS should be included and addressed in future studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>By providing organizational information and learning materials, a LMS can serve as a decisive component of a medical school to support the use of e-learning materials.</s><s>In our study, the leading purpose to use the LMS was the acquisition of information about curricular contents, followed by learning for exams and the preparation and post-processing of seminars.</s><s>Students wanted the LMS to support an efficient learning, with clear, practice-oriented contents, which are easy to use.</s><s>Thus, we conclude that teachers should put more effort on the provision of factoriented contents than on a sophisticated design.</s><s>However, interactivity and integration into face-to-face teaching are important aspects in the perception of e-learning tools and should be supported.</s><s>Teachers should be aware that free online sources as Wikipedia enjoy a high approval as source of knowledge acquisition.</s><s>As this is a serious issue for medical education, national associations of individual medical disciplines should consider editing online texts in an approved manner.</s><s>Finally, students´ demand for</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Students' opinions on how e-learning should be designed * (N = 323)</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Topic</cell><cell>Description of the desired contents</cell></row><row><cell>Interactive knowledge tests</cell><cell>Possibility for training and self-tests, for applying and checking knowledge (e.g. interactive exercises, quizzes,</cell></row><row><cell>(n = 123)</cell><cell>multiple-choice questions, training tests) preferably with direct feedback in any case of wrong answers</cell></row><row><cell>Completeness</cell><cell>Availability of all relevant contents (lecture notes, podcasts/videos), links and information for an intensive preparation</cell></row><row><cell>(n = 97)</cell><cell>and post-processing.
