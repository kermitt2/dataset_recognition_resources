<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>the reduced number of Ca 2+ -binding sites (i.e., they bind two calcium ions per molecule instead of four) and the smaller molecular size of the indicator (i.e., they are composed of one FP instead of two FPs).</s><s>The reduced number of Ca 2+ -binding sites in NTnC-like GECIs is thought to provide a more linear response to Ca 2+ transients, thus facilitating the quantification of changes in the Ca 2+ concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The NTnC-like design has additional advantages compared with other designs.</s><s>For example, GCaMP6s and G-GECO1.2, representatives of the second type GECIs with green fluorescence, demonstrated reduced fluorescence recovered after photobleaching-(FRAP-) mobility in mammalian cells at both low and high Ca 2+ concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>The restricted mobility may be caused by undesired interactions of the calmodulin (CaM) and M13-peptide pair of these GECIs with intracellular environments.</s><s>The CaM-based GCaMP6 indicator interferes with L-type calcium channels (Ca v 1)/CaM-mediated excitation-transcription coupling in neurons and disrupts Ca 2+ dynamics and gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>Expression of GCaMP6 causes aberrant cortical activity in transgenic mouse lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>The truncated version of TnC in NTnC-like GECIs has a smaller chance of having interacting partners in neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the NTnC-like type of GECIs is preferable among other types because it may be potentially inert to the neuronal environment and intermolecular interactions.</s></p><p><s>The recently published NTnC calcium indicator, a first representative of a novel NTnC-like design, consists of TnC from the swim bladder and white muscle of O. tau (tsTnC) as the Ca 2+ -binding moiety, inserted in the mNe-onGreen FP <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>NTnC has a size of 311 amino acids, which is less than the size of cpFP-and FRET-based indicators by 105 and 245 a.a., respectively.</s><s>In addition to the advantages of the NTnC-like design previously discussed, NTnC has a high fluorescence brightness and pH stability.</s><s>Because of its inverted fluorescence response to calcium ions, NTnC makes non-active neurons or cells with low resting calcium concentrations visible, thus eliminating the need for the co-expression of a bright fluorescent cell marker.</s><s>NTnC was successfully utilized for in vivo imaging of neuronal activity in awake mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Despite the listed benefits, NTnC has disadvantages, which are attributed to its low fluorescence change of 100% between its Ca 2+ -free and Ca 2+ -saturated states and slow Ca 2+ -dissociation kinetics.</s></p><p><s>As another green fluorescent GECI with the insertion of the Ca 2+ -binding domain, Camgaroo1, has a high 8-fold fluorescence contrast and utilizes enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) as the fluorescent moiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , we assumed that the replacement of the mNeonGreen fluorescent part in NTnC with EYFP may result in an indicator with an enhanced fluorescence response and faster kinetics.</s><s>The previously reported NTnC indicator has an inverted phenotype, and GECIs with a positive fluorescence response to calcium are not currently available for the NTnC-like design, although GECIs with a positive phenotype have two major advantages over GECIs with an inverted phenotype.</s><s>First, GECIs that have a positive Ca 2+ response potentially enable three dimensional (3D) calcium imaging of the large-scale neuronal circuitry with high precision because neurons remain inactive most of the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Second, GECIs that have a positive phenotype should undergo less photobleaching during prolonged calcium imaging because their photobleaching rate in the Ca 2+ -unbound state is significantly reduced and they are not fully saturated with Ca 2+ even during neuronal calcium activity (their ΔF/F response continues to increase at least up to 160 action potentials (APs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>Herein, we developed a single-fluorophore-based GECI that contains two Ca 2+ -binding sites, which is similar to the NTnC GECI but with the positive fluorescence response to Ca 2+ and substantially improved fluorescence contrast and kinetics.</s><s>This indicator, named YTnC, has TnC as the Ca 2+ -binding domain, which is inserted in the EYFP protein.</s><s>We validated the main characteristics of the YTnC indicator in vitro.</s><s>YTnC demonstrated an 11-and 3-fold higher fluorescence ΔF/F in vitro in the absence and presence of 1 mM Mg 2+ ions, respectively, compared with the respective characteristics of NTnC in vitro.</s><s>However, it had a 13.6-and 3.6-fold lower brightness and photostability, respectively, compared with NTnC in vitro.</s><s>According to stopped-flow fluorimetry data, the Ca 2+ -dissociation kinetics for YTnC were 4-fold faster than for NTnC and 2-fold slower than for GCaMP6f.</s><s>However, the kinetics of the Ca 2+ -association in the case of YTnC was up to 8-fold faster than that for GCaMP6f.</s><s>During Ca 2+ transients in HeLa mammalian cells, YTnC demonstrated a 4.9-fold higher ΔF/F than identified for the NTnC indicator.</s><s>Using YTnC, we visualized Ca 2+ dynamics during spontaneous activity in primary neuronal cultures with a 3.6-fold improvement in the ΔF/F values over NTnC.</s><s>We also assessed the YTnC characteristics in neurons using patch clamp recordings and determined that YTnC robustly and linearly responded to the stimuli in the range of 2-100 APs; however, it had lower ΔF/F values than GCaMP6s.</s><s>We successfully applied YTnC for the in vivo visualization of Ca 2+ neuronal activity in the V1 cortical area of anesthetized mice and the hippocampus of freely moving mice using two-photon microscopy and an nVista miniscope, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p><s>Development of a novel green fluorescent calcium indicator with the NTnC-like design.</s><s>To enhance the contrast and kinetics of NTnC GECI, we swapped its mNeonGreen fluorescent part with the EYFP protein and performed several rounds of further optimization using directed molecular evolution in a bacterial system <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>We selected the EYFP protein as the fluorescent moiety for the new GECI because it was successfully used in the Camgaroo1 GECI and demonstrated high fluorescence contrast upon interaction with Ca 2+ ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>As a Ca 2+ -binding motif, we used the point mutated derivative of tsTnC excised from the NTnC GECI.</s><s>We started with the generation of three libraries with the insertion of the TnC part between residues 144 and 146 (L1), 144 and 145 (L2), or 147 and 149 (L3) of EYFP (according to EGFP enumeration) and randomized both the 3-and 2-amino-acid-long linkers between the fluorescent EYFP and TnC components (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2  and 3</ref>).</s><s>The generated libraries were assessed using a two-step screening strategy.</s><s>First, we performed imaging of the indicator's libraries targeted to the E. coli periplasm on Petri dishes before and after treatment with a buffer that contained ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to select clones with the highest fluorescence ratio.</s><s>Second, the selected clones were analyzed in a bacterial suspension in a 96-well plate format.</s><s>After the second step of screening, we confirmed that all three libraries have clones with a positive fluorescence response to elevation of the calcium concentration.</s><s>In the L1 library, there were two clones with the maximal fluorescence contrast of 2.8-fold.</s><s>This response was superior to the response observed for NTnC, thus demonstrating that our design strategy was valid.</s><s>Therefore, for further GECI development, we focused on the clones identified in the L1 library.</s><s>We subjected two clones with the highest contrast to five sequential rounds of random mutagenesis followed by screening.</s><s>During each round, we screened approximately 30,000 colonies to identify variants with the largest Ca 2+ -dependent changes in green fluorescence, according to the previously described protocol.</s><s>After 5 rounds of random mutagenesis and selection, we chose a variant with the best performance in terms of contrast and brightness, named YTnC (EYFP derived TnC-based calcium indicator), which had 19 mutations relative to the original template (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Among these mutations, 14 and 5 mutations were located in the fluorescent part and linkers, respectively.</s><s>In the

6.3-fold lower than the published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>This discrepancy may be explained by the significant variation of the fractions of specifically responding cells depending on the imaging region in the visual cortex (in our study for YTnC and GCaMP6s, it varied from 0 to 22% and 0 to 13%, respectively) and the different types of anesthesia (in our study, it was urethane).</s><s>YTnC showed a 1.9-fold lower (p &lt; 0.0001) averaged ΔF/F response of 0.62 ± 0.23 compared with the ΔF/F value of 1.17 ± 0.53 for the GCaMP6s indicator.</s><s>The decreased response of YTnC during stimulus-evoked neuronal activity correlates with its 2.6-fold lower ΔF/F values than GCaMP6s on patched cultured neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the YTnC indicator exhibits stimulus-evoked neuronal activity with a 1.9-fold lower ΔF/F response than GCaMP6s.</s></p><p><s>Because the YTnC indicator has a smaller size than GCaMP6s, the YTnC indicator may have better sensitivity in spines than GCaMP6s.</s><s>From another perspective, the poor one-photon photostability of the purified YTnC protein in vitro may prevent its two-photon imaging in spines, which prompted us to compare the sensitivity and photostability of the YTnC and GCaMP6s indicators in neuronal spines.</s><s>During spontaneous neuronal activity in the L2/3 of the visual cortex, the averaged ΔF/F responses of the YTnC and GCaMP6s indicators in spines were similar, i.e., 0.80 ± 0.30 and 0.78 ± 0.30 (n.s., p = 0.1014), respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Compared with the ΔF/F responses of the YTnC indicator relative to GCaMP6s during spontaneous activity in the soma, there was no improvement in the YTnC response over GCaMP6s in the neuronal spines.</s><s>The fluorescence of the YTnC indicator was photobleached by 24% after a 200 sec imaging session of the spines, which was 16-fold higher than the 1.5% photobleaching of the GCaMP6s indicator (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, using two-photon microscopy in vivo, YTnC visualizes spontaneous calcium activity in spines with a similar response as GCaMP6s but with a lower photostability.</s></p><p><s>Overall, these data show that the YTnC indicator is appropriate for at least 3-month long in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse brain and enables the detections of spontaneous and stimulus-evoked calcium transients in neurons with similar and 1.9-fold lower ΔF/F responses than the GCaMP6s indicator,

YTnC had substantially increased the fluorescence ΔF/F response and had faster kinetics than NTnC.</s></p><p><s>We first characterized the main properties of the newly developed YTnC indicator as a purified protein in vitro.</s><s>YTnC had a positive Ca 2+ response, i.e., its green fluorescence increased following the binding of Ca 2+ ions, in contrast to the NTnC progenitor.</s><s>Compared with other commonly used indicators, its size was ~100 amino acids smaller and it had half the number of Ca 2+ -binding sites, similar to the NTnC indicator (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>In the presence of Mg 2+ ions in vitro, the YTnC indicator had a fluorescence ΔF/F response that was 3-fold higher than that of the NTnC indicator.</s><s>YTnC had a significantly lower brightness and photostability (13.6-and 3.6-fold, respectively) and a faster maturation rate than NTnC in vitro.</s><s>The limited brightness of YTnC as a purified protein in vitro correlated with its relative brightness in mammalian cells.</s><s>Moreover, in HeLa cells, the YTnC indicator in fusion with P2A-mCherry had a 1.6-and 3.3-fold lower brightness than EGFP and NTnC in the same fusion, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>Under the same conditions, NES-YTnC sat had a 4.7-fold lower brightness than non-fused GCaMP6s sat (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s><s>We assume that this relative improvement in the YTnC brightness in mammalian cells may be connected with its better folding and maturation inside mammalian cells, as well as its higher resistance to degradability by the machinery of mammalian cells.</s><s>Notably, the low brightness and photostability of YTnC as a pure protein did not constrain its application for short-term confocal imaging of neuronal cultures and one-and two-photon in vivo experiments with YTnC calcium imaging in the mouse brain.</s></p><p><s>According to stopped-flow experiments in vitro, YTnC had Ca 2+ -dissociation kinetics that were 3.8-fold faster and 2.2-fold slower than those of NTnC and GCaMP6f, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Depending on the Ca 2+ concentration, which was in the range of 300-1300 nM, the Ca 2+ -association kinetics of YTnC were 8.4-1.3-fold</s><s>faster or 1.09-1.3-fold</s><s>slower than those of GCaMP6f and NTnC, respectively.</s><s>Moreover, the fast in vitro kinetics of YTnC enabled it to serve as an indicator to reveal spontaneous neuronal calcium activity with a resolution of spikes similar to that of the R-GECO1 indicator (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We expressed the YTnC indicator and characterized its response in cultured mammalian and neuronal cells.</s><s>YTnC reliably responded to the variations in the Ca 2+ ion concentration induced by ionomycin in mammalian cells, and according to the ΔF/F values, YTnC outperformed the NTnC indicator by 4.9-fold and approximately reached the ΔF/F values of R-GECO1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b,c</ref>).</s><s>YTnC visualized the spontaneous activity of neurons in dissociated neuronal cultures with approximately the same spike rise/decay kinetics as R-GECO1, but with a 3.6-fold higher or similar ΔF/F dynamic range compared to that of NTnC or R-GECO1 and GCaMP6s GECIs, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>,f and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).</s><s>Improvements in the ΔF/F values for YTnC were closer to the same parameters for the purified YTnC and NTnC proteins in vitro in the presence of 1 mM Mg 2+ ions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>).</s><s>The ΔF/F response of YTnC in fusion with R-GECO1-P2A during the stimulation of neuronal cultures with an external electric field was 1.9-fold higher or 5.6-and 4.5-fold lower than that of GCaMP6s in the same fusion with R-GECO1-P2A or non-fused GCaMP6s and R-GECO1 indicators, respectively.</s><s>These data assume that the performance of calcium indicators in neurons may be affected by the N-terminal fusion even through a P2A-cleavable peptide.</s></p><p><s>Using patch-clamp recording, we showed that YTnC linearly responded to 2-100 APs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>); however, the NTnC and GCaMP6s indicators showed saturations above 10 and 50 APs, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>This linearity border correlated well with the in vitro K d values for these indicators, which were in the order of NTnC &lt; GCaMP6s &lt; YTnC.</s><s>Because of this non-linearity, in the range of 2-10 APs, YTnC showed slightly larger ΔF/F values, 1.1-1.3-fold,</s><s>than NTnC, and in the range of 15-20 APs, this difference increased to 2.2-2.9-fold 2 .</s><s>Thus, YTnC is undoubtedly preferable over the NTnC indicator for monitoring neuronal calcium activity because of its more linear and higher amplitude response.</s><s>However, the ΔF/F response of the YTnC indicator in patched neurons in the range of 2-100 APs was 1.5-2.6-fold</s><s>lower than that of GCaMP6s (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), which translated into a lower ΔF/F response relative to that of GCaMP6s in the soma of neurons in vivo.</s></p><p><s>We further validated the performance of the YTnC indicator in a classical in vivo application, using two-photon imaging of neuronal calcium activity in the L2/3 primary visual cortex (V1) of YTnC-infected mice with a fixed head.</s><s>Using the YTnC indicator, we identified spontaneous and drifting grating-evoked neuronal activity in the soma of neurons located in the mouse visual cortex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>The averaged grating-specific ΔF/F response of the YTnC indicator was 1.9-fold lower than that of the GCaMP6s indicator (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,c</ref>).</s><s>The YTnC indicator had spontaneous activity in the spines of neurons, with an ΔF/F response similar to that of GCaMP6s (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>In a similar brain structure with a similar stimulus and two-photon imaging conditions, the YTnC indicator had a 3-fold larger average grating-evoked ΔF/F response in the soma than NTnC (the latter had an average grating-evoked ΔF/F response of 20 ± 6%) 2 .</s><s>Thus, the YTnC indicator could be successfully used for in vivo two-photon imaging experiments, and it significantly outperformed the NTnC indicator in the soma or was similar to the GCaMP6s indicator in the soma or spines during spontaneous activity or inferior to GCaMP6s in soma during grating-specific activity in this type of in vivo application.</s></p><p><s>We also probed the YTnC indicator for its ability to image neuronal calcium activity in the hippocampus of freely moving mice using an nVista miniscope.</s><s>In the hippocampus of freely moving mice, the YTnC indicator had a similar and 1.4-fold lower averageΔF/F response than the GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s indicators, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>These in vivo responses were in accordance with the similar K d values for the YTnC and GCaMP6f indicators and the ~2-fold lower K d value for GCaMP6s determined in vitro in the presence of 1 mM Mg 2+ (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>The average ΔF/F response of the NTnC indicator in the visual cortex of freely moving mice was 2.5-fold lower than that of GCaMP6s 2 .</s><s>Under similar conditions, the average GCaMP6s response in the hippocampus was slightly lower, 1.3-fold, than that in the visual cortex, i.e., 0.023 ± 0.03 vs 0.03 ± 0.02, respectively.</s><s>Taking into account this difference, in in vivo experiments with a nVista miniscope, the YTnC indicator demonstrated an average ΔF/F response that was 1.7-fold larger than that of the NTnC indicator.</s><s>The ΔF/F response and SNR of the YTnC indicator were also 1.6-and 2.1-fold larger than those for the recently published iYTnC2 indicator under the same conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Using the YTnC indicator, we showed place specific neuronal activity in the hippocampus of freely moving mice during the exploration of a novel context.</s><s>Thus, compared with the NTnC and iYTnC2 indicators, YTnC had a better response during in vivo tasks with nVista miniscope.</s><s>Overall, the YTnC indicator is currently the best NTnC-like GECI for in vivo calcium imaging experiments; however, it remains suboptimal compared to the GCaMP6s indicator, which prompted us to search for other applications in which the YTnC indicator would be advantageous compared with GCaMP6s.</s></p><p><s>We determined that YTnC outperformed the GCaMP6s indicator in the presence of N-terminal fusions, which targeted it to the lumen or the IMS of the mitochondria or ER, in terms of proper localization, brightness and ionomycin-induced ΔF/F response in cultured HeLa cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">4 and 5</ref>).</s><s>The thapsigargin-induced ΔF/F responses of the YTnC in the lumen and IMS of the mitochondria were 2.2-fold larger than and similar to the respective responses of GCaMP6s in the same organelles of HeLa cells (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>), respectively.</s><s>The YTnC indicator N-terminally targeted to the lumen or IMS of the mitochondria or ER also demonstrated better localization than GCaMP6s in neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>The YTnC indicator localized in the lumen of mitochondria showed spontaneous activity of neurons with a similar ΔF/F response as that of GCaMP6s (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).</s><s>The C-terminal KV2.1, MBD, AIS and KA2 neuron-specific motifs did not efficiently target both the YTnC and GCaMP6s indicators to the subcellular sites of neurons and, in some cases, worsened the ΔF/F response of the indicators (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">20</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).</s><s>The better tolerance of the YTnC indicator to N-terminal fusions compared with GCaMP6s may be related to their different designs.</s><s>The NTnC-like design has both N-and C-termini that are the same as in the EGFP protein; however, the GCaMP-like design suggests the presence of a short M13-like peptide on its N-terminus through which the N-terminally fused partner-protein may affect the properties of the GCaMP indicator.</s></p><p><s>Despite the decreased number of Ca 2+ -binding sites and "inert" TnC domain, the YTnC indicator did not exhibit an advantage over GCaMP6s in its expected lower cytotoxicity because we did not identify a difference in the glia surrounding neurons expressing the YTnC or GCaM6s indicators in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21</ref>).</s><s>Despite the smaller size of YTnC, we did not identify a significant difference between the distribution of the YTnC and GCaMP6f indicators in the branches and spines of neurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">22 and 23</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We anticipate that further enhancement of the brightness and ΔF/F sensitivity of the YTnC indicator would bring it to the next performance level, superior to that of GECIs with a conventional design, and would provide calcium imaging tools with additional advantages of the NTnC-like design, such as efficient targeting to cellular compartments.</s></p></div>
