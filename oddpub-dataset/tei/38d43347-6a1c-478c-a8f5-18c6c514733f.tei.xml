<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>The evolution of immunosuppressive regimens over the past few decades has led to considerable improvement in acute rejection rates and short-term graft survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Patient and graft survival at 1 year post transplantation now exceed 95 % in the case of living donation and 90 % after deceased donation.</s><s>However, the long-term outcomes post kidney transplantation do not show a similar trend of improvement.</s><s>At 10 years, graft survival remains about 50 % after deceased donation in the US and in Europe, with approximately 30 % of patients returning to dialysis and one of four patients dying with a functioning graft <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>The lack of improvement in longterm outcomes is further reflected by the fact that the number of re-transplants among adult kidney transplant patients has remained almost unchanged over the last decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Currently, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), cyclosporine, and tacrolimus are the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy post kidney transplantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>However, their long-term use may be associated with nonreversible nephrotoxicity, morphologically characterised by striped fibrosis, progressive arteriolar hyalinosis, and ischemic glomerulosclerosis, which is a well-recognised cause of morbidity in transplant patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Chronic allograft injury alone accounts for two thirds of kidney graft failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Clinical data has shown that lowering the dose of CNI can improve renal function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In this regard, the focus should be on optimising the currently available immunosuppressive regimens with the aim of preserving long-term renal function while maintaining the efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies with a reduced-dose CNI and everolimus regimen have shown that it maintained efficacy and preserved renal function (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) .</s><s>In the large randomised A2309 trial, preemptive everolimus therapy was associated with a greater than 60 % reduction in cyclosporine exposure while preserving renal function with comparable efficacy to mycophenolic acid and standard-exposure cyclosporine in de novo kidney transplant patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>In the ASSET study, an everolimus-facilitated tacrolimus minimisation strategy achieved good renal function with an acceptable safety profile without compromising efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, everolimus exerts other non-immunosuppressive properties, including potential cardioprotective, anti-malignancy, and antiviral effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>These non-immunosuppressive benefits further suggest that everolimus-based regimens may be a preferred approach as cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and infections account for nearly four out of the five deaths occurring with functioning grafts <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The ATHENA trial is designed to further increase our knowledge and seek answers relating to the use of everolimus in CNI minimisation protocols in de novo kidney transplant patients.</s><s>The ATHENA study assesses the change in renal function at 12 months post transplant as the primary objective.</s><s>The design of the trial is described here.</s><s>Eligible patients are randomised before transplantation using a validated system to ensure an unbiased treatment assignment in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either everolimus with a reduced dose of cyclosporine, or everolimus with tacrolimus, or a standard regimen of mycophenolic acid with tacrolimus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All patients receive induction therapy with basiliximab and maintenance steroids.</s><s>At the time of randomisation, patients are stratified based on the donor type (living donor, deceased standard criteria donor, or deceased expanded criteria donor) and the participation of the recipient in the European Senior Program.</s><s>The study protocol and the proposed informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the national institutional review boards or independent ethics committees at each centre and the federal institute for drugs and medical devices (Additional file 1).</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</s><s>The clinical study was designed and is conducted in accordance with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.</s></p></div>
