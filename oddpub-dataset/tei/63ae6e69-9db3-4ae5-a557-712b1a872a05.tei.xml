<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion</head><p><s>When we started developing methods for the analysis of HMO, we used oligosaccharide standards purchased off the shelf from laboratory chemical suppliers.</s><s>However, we rapidly ran into problems achieving oligosaccharide recoveries well in excess of 100%.</s><s>Troubleshooting exercises suggested that the purity of the standards was significantly less than the purity of the bulk material produced as ingredients.</s><s>We therefore decided to use the 2 -FL and LNnT ingredients as our standards, but required a way to confirm the purity of the material.</s><s>This was achieved using qNMR.</s><s>Good quality HMO standards with qNMR data are not readily available from laboratory chemical vendors, but they can be obtained from some suppliers if specifically requested.</s><s>Acquiring such standards remains something of a challenge.</s><s>However, as more HMO become available as ingredients it is likely that good quality quantitative standards will become more readily obtainable.</s></p><p><s>We initially developed the method for 2 -FL and LNnT analysis on HPAEC-PAD, since it is a well-established technique for the analysis of oligosaccharides, and sample preparation is normally very simple.</s><s>Validation of the HPAEC-PAD method was performed by dry mixing the HMO in to commercially available formula, and analyzing on six different days in duplicate.</s><s>Method trueness and precision were both acceptable (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>When we received samples from a pilot plant for analysis the results obtained by HPAEC-PAD were lower than expected from the addition rate (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>; formulas (1)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)).</s><s>Investigations at the pilot plant confirmed that the correct addition rates had been applied, and it was not expected that there would be significant degradation of HMO under the processing conditions used.</s><s>As part of the investigations in the analytical lab, we tried to analyze the samples using an alternative method.</s><s>Since we were running galactooligosaccharide analysis at the time using HILIC-FLD <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, we decided to apply that method to HMO.</s><s>We used the same internal standard (laminaritriose), sample preparation protocol, and LC conditions for the HMO analysis as we used for GOS analysis.</s><s>Unfortunately, under those conditions, the 2 -FL co-eluted with the internal standard, thus it was not possible to quantify 2 -FL, and the LNnT had to be quantified using an external calibration curve.</s><s>Nevertheless, the measured LNnT concentrations were close to the expected content of 0.40 g/100 g (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>. Formulas ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)).</s><s>This led us to abandon the HPAEC-PAD method, and start development on the HILIC-FLD method.</s></p><p><s>The HILIC-FLD method was adapted from the GOS method by changing from HLPC to UHPLC, and adapting the column temperature and gradient conditions to avoid co-elution of 2 -FL with the internal standard.</s><s>The HILIC-FLD method was also validated by dry-mixing HMO in to existing formula products.</s><s>The validation data indicated that the HILIC-FLD method performed at least as well as the HPAEC-PAD method on spiked samples (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Two pilot plant samples were also included in the validation to assess precision (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>) in samples which were expected to be more homogenous than the dry-mixed lab samples.</s><s>The RSD(r) and RSD(iR) determined on the pilot plant samples were similar to the samples from spiking experiments at 5% or less.</s></p><p><s>A selection of commercial and pilot plant samples was analyzed by both the HILIC-FLD method and the HPAEC-PAD method (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s><s>In general, the results obtained by HILIC-FLD tended to be higher than those obtained by HPAEC-PAD.</s><s>We hypothesize that there are some interactions between the analytes and the matrix which may be initiated during the industrial production process.</s><s>That interaction is not completely disrupted when samples are simply extracted in warm water, and thus the analysis by HPAEC-PAD seems to underestimate 2 -FL and LNnT.</s><s>The more aggressive conditions used during the oligosaccharide labeling procedure (using low pH and DMSO as solvent) seem to disrupt those interactions, and thus the results from the HILIC-FLD method are more in line with expectations.</s><s>However, as can be seen from data on commercial and pilot plant samples (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>), the HPAEC-PAD method does not always underestimate the content of the HMO (see formula <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Thus the hypothesis is not universal for all products, and is probably dependent on the product recipe and specific processing conditions.</s></p></div>
