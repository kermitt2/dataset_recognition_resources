<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IL-12 and STAT4 upregulate T-bet in NK cells during MCMV infection</head><p><s>To gain insight into when T-box transcription factors may be exerting influences on the proliferation of virus-specific NK cells, the amount of T-bet and Eomes in Ly49H + NK cells were measured at different time points during MCMV infection.</s><s>We found that T-bet expression is upregulated in NK cells at day 2 PI and remains high at effector (day 7 PI) and memory (day 42 PI) time points, whereas Eomes expression is largely unchanged at day 2 PI and downregulated at day 7 and 42 PI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>).</s><s>The rapid modulation of T-bet levels immediately following MCMV infection suggests a role for proinflammatory cytokine signals in its upregulation.</s><s>Because IL-12 has been described to upregulate T-bet expression in CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15)</ref>, we evaluated the expression of T-bet in NK cells from WT:Il12rb2 2/2 bone marrow chimeric mice infected with MCMV.</s><s>In contrast to WT NK cells, we found that T-bet levels were not upregulated at day 2 and 7 PI in Il12rb2 2/2 NK cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref>).</s><s>Eomes expression in Il12rb2 2/2 NK cells did not differ from WT NK cells at various time points during MCMV infection (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Given that IL-12 induces T-bet, we predicted that the STAT4, which acts downstream of the IL-12 receptor, may directly bind to the gene loci encoding T-bet (Tbx21) in activated NK cells.</s><s>Analysis of the Tbx21 promoter and enhancer regions revealed several putative STAT4 binding sites (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>), one of which (site 2) is embedded within a conserved noncoding site.</s><s>We performed STAT4 ChIP on resting and IL-12 + IL-18-activated NK cells, and found substantial enrichment of STAT4 at site 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>, 3D), an enhancer ∼11 Kb upstream of the Tbx21 transcriptional start site.</s><s>In addition, we demonstrate an increase in the "permissive" histone modification H3K4me3 at the promoter region in activated WT but not Stat4 2/2 NK cells, which correlates with an increase in Tbx21 transcript levels in the WT but not Stat4 2/2 NK cells at day 2 PI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3D</ref>, Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E</ref>).</s><s>Thus, together these data support the direct regulation of T-bet expression in NK cells by IL-12 signaling and STAT4 activity during MCMV infection.</s><s>T-bet, but not Eomes, is required for the maintenance of virus-specific memory NK cells Lastly, we investigated the role of Eomes and T-bet on the maintenance of memory NK cells following MCMV infection.</s><s>We isolated NK cells from the spleen of Eomes f/f 3 Ub Cre-ERT2 or Tbx21 f/f 3 Ub Cre-ERT2 mice (CD45.2) and cotransferred them with equal numbers of WT NK cells (CD45.1)</s><s>into Ly49h 2/2 recipients that were immediately infected with MCMV.</s><s>At day 19 PI, when memory NK cell numbers were comparable between the two groups, we administered tamoxifen to induce gene deletion in the Eomes f/f 3 Ub Cre-ERT2 NK cells.</s><s>We found that the ratio of WT to Eomes-deleted NK cells did not change for several weeks after tamoxifen administration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4A</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, no changes were observed in the frequency of TRAIL-expressing or CD27 + CD11b + NK cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4B</ref>), and unlike effector NK cells, memory NK cells did not suffer a decrease in KLRG1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4C</ref>).</s><s>This lack of a memory maintenance defect in Eomes 2/2 NK cells is consistent with the observation that Eomes expression was found to be downregulated in virusspecific memory NK cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In contrast to Eomes ablation, induced deletion of T-bet in memory NK cells led to a significant 3-4-fold decrease in the ratio of T-bet 2/2 to WT cells in mice receiving tamoxifen compared with controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4D</ref>), suggesting a role for T-bet in the persistence of virus-specific memory NK cells.</s><s>Although only slight changes were observed in the frequency of TRAIL-expressing or CD27 + CD11b + NK cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4E</ref>, Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2F, 2G</ref>), a significant decrease in the expression of KLRG1 was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4F</ref>, Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2G</ref>).</s><s>Previous reports have suggested T-bet to be an important factor in the terminal maturation of NK cells (4), and our data suggests that T-bet is continuously required for the maintenance of a mature NK cell phenotype.</s><s>Altogether, these data uncover a unique role for T-bet, but not Eomes, in the maintenance of number and phenotype of virus-specific memory NK cells, further highlighting the divergent function of these T-box family transcription factors at different stages of the antiviral response.</s></p><p><s>Although Eomes and T-bet may play a complementary role in the induction of a proliferative program in NK cells responding to viral infection, our data suggest that only T-bet acts to maintain Ag-experienced NK cells in a mature state.</s><s>We propose that in addition to TRAIL marking immature NK cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16)</ref> and possibly a distinct NK cell lineage in the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(6)</ref>, it may also serve to track NK cell differentiation, as loss of TRAIL was accompanied with increased KLRG1 expression.</s><s>Interestingly T-bet, but not Eomes, was found to be critical in the maintenance of memory NK cell numbers and phenotype.</s><s>In contrast to the continuous importance of individual T-box transcription factors throughout the lifespan of NK cells, Nfil3 is a transcription factor required for NK cell development, but dispensable in mature NK cell homeostasis or response to infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(17)</ref>.</s><s>How T-bet and Eomes are driving the clonal proliferation of NK cells via a nonredundant mechanism remains to be elucidated.</s><s>The underlying mechanisms by which T-bet promotes survival of memory NK cells, possibly by regulating IL-15 responsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(7)</ref>, also require further investigation.</s><s>Nonetheless, these findings highlight a stage-specific influence of individual T-box transcription factors in NK cells responding to MCMV infection.</s></p><p><s>Our current findings reveal distinct molecular events that influence NK cell responses against viral infection, including the maintenance of a memory NK cell pool, which may inform clinical approaches that couple NK cell-mediated immunity to the treatment of human diseases.</s></p></div>
