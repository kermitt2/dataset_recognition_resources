<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design</head><p><s>This was a phase III, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, multinational, add-on study (ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>identifier: NCT00902538).</s><s>The study design (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) included a screening/tapering-off period (1-5 weeks), a single-blind run-in, and a randomized double-blind add-on period.</s></p><p><s>The protocol, amendments, and informed consent document were approved by the independent ethics committee for each center prior to study initiation.</s><s>This study was designed and monitored in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>Written informed consent was received from all patients prior to admission.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>In patients with inadequately controlled hypertension on the high-dose dual combination of OLM/AML, the addition of both HCTZ 12.5 mg and 25 mg increased reductions in seated and ambulatory BP goals.</s><s>Furthermore, triple-combination therapy improved achievement of seated and ambulatory BP targets.</s><s>Larger-thanexpected changes in SeBP were seen in the group that continued with dual-combination therapy.</s><s>This finding was undoubtedly related to the nonresponder parallelgroup design of the trial, which was based on regulatory criteria.</s><s>When changes in BP were assessed using ambulatory BP, the between-group differences were larger and more significantly in favor of the triplecombination group.</s><s>All treatments were generally well tolerated.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1.
