<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study shows a clear relationship between in-hospital CRP plasma concentrations and the development of post-infarction heart failure in patients undergoing PCI for a first STEMI.</s></p><p><s>Our study is in agreement with other reports, where the acute inflammatory reaction in AMI starts 4 to 8 h after the acute onset and peaks within 48 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we showed that peak CRP levels identify patients prone to HF progression and worse prognosis.</s><s>In a previous study <ref type="bibr">Berton et al. found</ref> an association between CRP levels and heart failure in patients with AMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However, they examined patients with myocardial infarction in general and did not differentiate between STEMI and non-STEMI (NSTEMI).</s><s>Furthermore, they included patients with previous myocardial infarction and some of the patients were treated with thrombolysis.</s><s>In our study, we recruited only STEMI patients without a prior history of myocardial infarction.</s><s>All of our patients were treated with primary PCI within 60 min after hospital admission.</s></p><p><s>Generally, CRP is an acute phase reactant, synthesized primarily by the liver.</s><s>For many years CRP has thus been merely used as a marker for systemic inflammation.</s><s>However, there are accumulating data indicating that CRP could be more than just a biomarker of inflammation.</s></p><p><s>Previous data indicate that CRP may induce complement activation and thus may lead to maladaptive cardiac remodeling in acute ischemic left ventricular damage.</s><s>After aggregation and ligand binding, CRP is a potent activator of the classical complement pathway.</s><s>In this context, CRP has been found on myocardial cells within the infarcted area together with activated complement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>In diverse animal models, several authors have shown that CRP markedly increases the extent of myocardial damage produced by ischemic injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, the rapid rise in CRP levels reflects the severity of the inflammatory reaction within the infarcted area.</s><s>The CRP levels positively correlated with CK activity and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction.</s><s>The extent of inflammatory activation seems to be a major determinant in post-infarction remodeling.</s><s>Combining the respective preclinical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> with our results, high CRP levels may not only be a sign of an activated inflammatory reaction, but also a determinant of further myocardial damage.</s><s>After aggregation or ligand binding, human CRP activates the classical complement pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>In this concept, CRP also binds to non-irremediable damaged cells and leads to complement activation.</s><s>As a consequence, the targeted cells were opsonized, thereby increasing the amount of cell death and thus increasing infarct size.</s><s>This concept could in part explain our results that patients with high CRP levels developed post-infarction heart failure.</s><s>Large infarct size, thus resulting in heart failure, is furthermore a major determinant of morbidity and mortality following STEMI.</s><s>In our patients stratified by CRP levels, the cut-off value was 47.5 mg/l for predicting heart failure and cardiovascular adverse events within the first 12 months following STEMI.</s><s>Together with the data from other groups the marked rise in patients developing heart failure may not only be an epiphenomenon but may represent a pathogenic process that leads to further myocardial damage and thus heart failure.</s><s>Generally, inflammation plays a very important role in wound healing after myocardial infarction.</s><s>Since CRP is one of the acute phase proteins, it is very important in "orchestrating" one of the first inflammatory responses.</s><s>An excessive inflammatory response, however, leads to worsening heart failure and poor outcome after myocardial infarction.</s></p><p><s>Therapeutic inhibition of an excessive CRP response could thus be a promising new approach to cardioprotection in STEMI patients.</s><s>In this context Pepys et al. developed a specific small-molecule inhibitor of CRP <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>In rats undergoing AMI this inhibitor could abrogate the increase in infarct size and cardiac dysfunction.</s><s>In another interesting approach Sheriff et al. developed a specific CRP adsorber and showed that CRP depletion by apheresis led to a reduction of infarct size in a porcine animal model of AMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Although it is difficult to transfer these data to the clinical setting of patients suffering STEMI, it supports the assumption that therapeutic inhibition of CRP could be a promising approach to cardioprotection after STEMI.</s><s>However, further investigations need to be performed to test the impact of therapeutic CRP depletion in a human clinical setting.</s></p><p><s>Although there is no widespread use of the only approved anti-CRP treatment possibility (CRP apheresis) at the moment, our data may make an important contribution to identify STEMI patients at risk for heart failure and worse prognosis.</s><s>Once identified, these patients could perhaps benefit from a specific heart failure therapy or may furthermore be evaluated for strict monitoring up to the use of a LifeVest defibrillator for the first weeks after acute STEMI.</s><s>However, further studies are needed to confirm these data in a large trial.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 3
