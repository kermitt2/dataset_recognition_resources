that is, the ζ potential of CeNPs reacted with ES was governed by the polymers in the ES rather than the small charged molecules, such as phosphate.</s><s>In addition, the ζ potential of SS + CeNPs, which contained inorganic phosphate, also exhibit the same trend as that of ES + CeNPs.</s><s>There are two factors that caused the similarity.</s><s>One factor is the steric barrier created by the organic matter, even by molecules size smaller than 1 kDa, because the FTIR spectra of ES, PS, and SS revealed that the functional groups of the compounds adsorbed on the CeNPs were nearly identical (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The other factor is the decreased concentration of SS due to dialysis.</s><s>The SS solution was diluted to approximately one quarter, implying the possibility of decreased amounts of adsorbed inorganic phosphate in the ES.</s><s>Indeed, the adsorption experiment of inorganic phosphate using various concentrations of phosphate revealed that the ζ potential increases gradually as the P concentration decreases, and the pH dependence at the P concentration of 1.6 µM, which is two orders of magnitude less than the P concentration in ES, became identical to that of the control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7a</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the average hydrodynamic diameter also changed concurrently; when P concentration decreased from 160 μM to 16 μM, the ζ potential shifted to a positive value, the iep shifted from ~1.6 to ~4.3, and the pH, at which the average hydrodynamic diameter becomes the maximum, shifted from ~1.9 to ~5.0.</s><s>The pH dependence of the average hydrodynamic dimeter of the SS + CeNPs appeared similar to that of P + CeNPs (16 µM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7b</ref>).</s><s>When the CeNPs were exposed to 107 µM P, the same P concentration in SS, the iep shifted from ~1.6 to ~2.0, though the pH dependence of the ζ potential was almost identical to the 160 µM P case.</s><s>Thus, the pH dependence of the ζ potentials for SS + CeNPs and ES + CeNPs can be ascribed to the similar characteristics of the polymeric substances, even when of different molecular sizes.</s></p><p><s>The effects of ES, PS, and SS on the size of the aggregates.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref> shows the average hydrodynamic diameter of CeNPs in three conditions: (i) 1.0 mM NaCl;
