the hypothesis of a Ca 2+ -dependent mechanism.</s><s>Interestingly, a similar observation was made previously, when Li + was tested as a preventive medication in dorsal root ganglion neurons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref></s><s>Another possibility in regards to PTX-mediated neurotoxic effects could be neurophysiological changes exerted for instance on hippocampal synaptic function.</s><s>This possibility appears however unlikely, as cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of 10 μM PTX (50 times the concentrations observed in our study in hippocampal tissue) did not elicit clear alterations of hippocampal synaptic function in an in vivo rat model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref></s><s>Yet another possibility is that PTX-induced cell death is ameliorated by an enhanced Li +mediated neurogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> with increased neuronal differentiation of progenitor cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref></s><s>These effects were shown to be neuroprotective in other conditions such as Huntington's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> and hypoxia-ischemia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref></s><s>In contrast to the aforementioned study that used continuous Li + treatment over 4 weeks, mice were injected only 12 times in our paradigm.</s><s>Given the relatively short half-life of Li + in rodents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> the absence of a measurable increase of BrdUpositive neuronal cells in Li + -treated control animals and the fact that Li + dosages in our study were almost an order of magnitude lower, an effect based solely on proliferation/differentiation induced by Li + seems very unlikely.</s><s>Presently, Li + is used for different psychiatric conditions with desired serum concentrations of 0.6-1.2</s><s>mM l − 1 .</s><s>Although its pharmacology is challenging, it has been thoroughly characterized and therefore would not present an obstacle for clinical translation (reviewed by ref. 74).</s><s>Importantly, in our animal model lithium serum levels of up to 0.6 mM l − 1 proved to be effective in the prevention of paclitaxelinduced neurotoxicity and were well below toxic concentrations which start above 1.5 mM l − 1 .</s><s>In the context of a potential use in cancer patients, the question of whether Li + reduces PTX' cytostatic efficacy is a key issue.</s><s>To this point, no detrimental effect of Li + on the antineoplastic effects of PTX has been observed in vitro or in a tumor transplant model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> but additional preclinical and clinical studies are needed to address this question.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we report that dose-dense PTX therapy in mice leads to death of neuronal stem and progenitor cells in the hippocampus and impaired spatial memory.</s><s>As the measured PTX concentrations in the CNS were low and only a small percentage of NSC were in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle, only a small fraction of the observed cell death can be attributed to the tubulin-dependent cytostatic properties of PTX.</s><s>PTX-induced toxicity against NSC appears to be mainly caused by a Ca 2 + -dependent molecular mechanism involving the proteins NCS-1 as well as InsP 3 R1.</s><s>Targeting this mechanism with Li + co-treatment reduced toxicity in vitro, and prevented behavioral and histological alterations in vivo.</s><s>As a result, a new strategy for the clinical prevention of PTX-induced neurotoxicity in the central and peripheral nervous emerges, which has the potential to change clinical practice.</s></p></div>
