colon-in-continuity, and one had an end-jejunostomy.</s><s>However, other evidence from the same analysis suggests that teduglutide discontinuation may be associated with a rebound in PS requirements.</s><s>Twelve of 25 patients who responded to teduglutide with a ≥20% reduction in PS volume required increases in PS after stopping teduglutide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref></s><s>Compared with drug responders who maintained or decreased PS volume following teduglutide discontinuation, these 12 patients had shorter remnant small bowel (58 vs 35 cm, respectively) and were less likely to have colon-in-continuity (92% vs 57%), but neither observation reached statistical significance.</s><s>In the current phase III extension study group as a whole, patients who received teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/d required a mean increase in PS of 1.5 L/wk between end of treatment and the 4-week follow-up visit. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>hese findings highlight the importance of individualized patient management with teduglutide and continued monitoring after PS weaning.</s><s>Patients who obtain oral or enteral autonomy still have their underlying condition of SBS and will likely continue to require specialized diets, vitamin and other micronutrient supplementation, concomitant antidiarrheal and other medications, and fluid optimization after weaning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>his study was limited by the small patient sample size, which precluded performance of regression analyses for predictive factors associated with PS independence.</s><s>In addition, the studies pooled for this analysis included minor protocol differences that may have influenced rates of PS weaning.</s><s>For example, the weaning algorithm in NCT00081458/ NCT00172185 permitted a 10% maximum reduction from baseline in PS volume during a PS adjustment vs a 30% maximum reduction in the STEPS study and its extension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>The intervals between study visits were also shorter in the RCTs compared with the extension studies (2-4 vs 2-12 weeks, respectively).</s><s>Furthermore, the influence of spontaneous intestinal adaptation on PS weaning during the extension studies is currently unclear.</s><s>Although most spontaneous intestinal adaptation is thought to occur during the first 2 years following small bowel resection, recent studies indicate that adaptation can advance over longer time periods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>Finally, the patients described here were managed under strict clinical trial protocols and may not fully reflect the experiences of patients treated in general clinical practice.</s><s>The ongoing teduglutide global registration study (ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>identifier: NCT01990040) will provide critical data regarding the efficacy and safety of teduglutide treatment under real-world conditions.</s></p><p><s>Together, these data indicate that oral or enteral autonomy is possible for some patients with SBS-IF who are treated with teduglutide, regardless of baseline characteristics and despite long-term dependence on PS.</s><s>Studies involving larger patient populations are required to establish factors that may predict PS independence associated with teduglutide treatment.</s><s>Oral or enteral autonomy in patients with SBS may be conditional, particularly during periods of metabolic stress and if teduglutide treatment is discontinued.</s><s>Careful monitoring and individualized patient management can allow patients to obtain optimal results.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Duration of
