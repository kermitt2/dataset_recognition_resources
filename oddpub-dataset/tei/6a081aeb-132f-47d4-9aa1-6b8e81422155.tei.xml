<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Recommendations</head><p><s>There has been increasing discussion of late as to whether a multivitamin and mineral supplement is really necessary in pregnancy for women who have a healthy diet.</s><s>Regardless of specific views on this issue, maternity health practitioners recommending prenatal supplements should be aware of safety prior to making recommendations.</s><s>Recognizing the widespread contamination of commonly consumed prenatal supplements, it is important to avoid recommendations that might be harmful to the mother and her developing child.</s><s>As a result of the findings in this study, we have some recommendation:</s></p><p><s>• All batches of prenatal vitamins should be tested for toxic elements.</s></p><p><s>• Guidelines for maximum acceptable levels incorporating the cumulative exposure of toxic agents should be established.</s><s>As standards change and become lower, such as the case for Pb, these may need to reviewed accordingly.</s></p><p><s>• All prenatal vitamins should contain sufficient essential minerals and vitamin D to potentially reduce the amount of toxic elements absorbed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>• Many women are already taking prenatal vitamin supplementation prior to ever seeing their health provider.</s><s>Accordingly, the objective of securing avoidance of chemical toxicants appears to be best met through preconception care <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>• To ensure the manufacture and delivery of safe and reliable prenatal supplements, all natural health products should be regulated.</s><s>We recommend the implementation of stringent self-regulatory process for safety and purity by industry, with government oversight and accountability.</s><s>A detailed explanation for this can be found in a previous paper on this issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although the number of prescription prenatal supplements was limited, there was no correlation between requiring a medical prescription and level of contamination with toxic elements.</s><s>These findings do not ensure that such supplements are not contaminated with other adverse chemical toxicants − as testing for the wide range of other potential toxicants was not performed as part of this study.</s><s>It is absolutely possible that some supplements with low levels of toxic element contamination may have high levels of contamination with various organic toxicants such as certain pesticides, solvents, perfluorinated compounds, or other adverse agents.</s><s>Similarly, it is possible that exposure to multiple toxic elements even at doses at or below regulatory limits may result in increased risks or yet unidentified hazards, that may need to be addressed in the future as information becomes available <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</s><s>Hormesis, a poorly understood concept at this time, may result in a non-linear response to the level of toxic exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</s></p></div>
