<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Over the last years, the importance of PCs in chronic and relapsing infections has been increasingly recognized and a growing body of research has focused on finding alternative strategies for the eradication of antibiotic tolerant bacteria.</s><s>Several innovative approaches have been suggested for the elimination of PCs, including their reversion to a metabolically active and antibiotic-susceptible state through exposure to chemical compounds such as the fatty acid cis-2decenoic acid and the quorum sensing inhibitor (Z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-3-methylfuran-2(5H)-one <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kim et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pan et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Marques et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Considerable attention has been devoted to the identification of antimicrobial agents with a growth-independent mechanism of action in order to target both actively dividing cells and PCs.</s><s>Indeed, eradication of entire bacterial populations is mandatory to avoid the relapse of the infection and minimize the chance of resistance development during prolonged antibiotic treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Zhang, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>In this regard, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Conlon et al. (2013)</ref> have recently proposed a mechanism of persister killing based on activation of Clp protease and dysregulation of proteolysis by acyldepsipeptide-4 (ADEP4).</s><s>Interestingly, combining ADEP4 with rifampicin resulted in complete eradication of S. aureus biofilms both in vitro and in a murine model of deep-seated infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Conlon et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, mitomycin C and cisplatin have been demonstrated to be active against a broad range of PCs due to the direct crosslinking of DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kwan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chowdhury et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Antipersister strategies involving cationic AMPs have also emerged as promising routes of investigation although still poorly explored.</s><s>Due to their ability to physically damage bacterial membranes, AMPs have been proven effective in withstanding the dormant and quiescent state of PCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Briers et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mohamed et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although recent progress in developing alternative therapeutic strategies against PCs is encouraging, testing novel anti-persister molecules is often a complex process because of the difficulty in isolating the small fraction of PCs from the main bacterial population.</s><s>Traditional isolation methods rely on the differential response of persister and non-persister subpopulations to antibiotic exposure, which results in typical biphasic killing patterns.</s><s>Addition of increasing concentrations of antibiotics to bacterial cultures and/or prolonged exposure times determine a rapid elimination of non-persisters that is followed by a killing plateau ascribable to surviving PCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gefen and Balaban, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fauvart et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, due to the low levels of naturally forming PCs, antibiotic-based methods provide persisters with a very low efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Henry and Brynildsen, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, difficulties have been found in separating the surviving persister subpopulation from the large proportion of dead bacteria, which may interfere with the proper assessment of the antibacterial activity of molecules with unconventional mechanisms of action like membrane-active AMPs.</s><s>Other more sophisticated protocols aimed at PCs analysis and isolation have been proposed (e.g., fluorescence-activated cell sorting based methods), but they are a feasible solution only for well-equipped laboratories <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Orman and Brynildsen, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To address this issue, we sought to develop an improved and simple method for obtaining persister-enriched cultures of medically relevant bacteria based on the treatment with the uncoupling agent CCCP.</s><s>The ability of CCCP to induce high levels of persistence has been previously reported for the model organism E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kwan et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>The development of a persister-like status in CCCP-treated cells has been linked to the inhibition of ATP synthesis and the consequent reduction in bacterial metabolic activity.</s><s>Importantly, CCCP treatment mimics a naturally occurring mechanism of persister formation (i.e., ATP depletion), which has been recently demonstrated to control persistence in both S. aureus and E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Conlon et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Shan et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Here we investigated the effect of CCCP on the induction of persistence in P. aeruginosa and S. aureus by evaluating the acquisition of antibiotic tolerance and the metabolic activity of CCCP-treated bacteria.</s><s>Different parameters of method were examined in order to define the optimal concentration of CCCP and exposure time able to ensure the maximum cell survival and to generate the highest number of PCs.</s><s>We succeeded in obtaining high-persister cultures with only a minor effect on cell viability by treating stationary-phase cultures of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus for 3 h with CCCP at 200 and 400 µg/mL, respectively.</s><s>Indeed, these exposure conditions determined a substantial increase in cell survival to the treatment with different classes of bactericidal antibiotics, inducing a persister status in 20-60% of the initial bacterial population.</s><s>Tolerance to antibiotics was found to correlate with a significant decrease in bacterial metabolic activity as proven by isothermal microcalorimetry and flow cytometry.</s><s>Although isothermal microcalorimetry is not yet routinely used in the field of microbiology, it emerged as a valuable technique for the assessment of the persister status in bacteria as it allowed to measure in real time bacterial metabolism in terms of heat production.</s><s>Global reduction in bacterial heat production and low oxidoreductase activity confirmed the induction of a state of dormancy in CCCP-treated cells.</s><s>Furthermore, since the exit of PCs from their dormant state is associated with a specific lag phase during the resuscitation process, we also evaluated the revival of CCCP-induced persisters upon incubation in a nutrient-rich medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gefen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jõers et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Like naturally occurring PCs, CCCP-induced persisters displayed a typical delay before resumption of normal growth, thus providing an additional indication of the efficiency of CCCP in inducing persistence.</s><s>When tested for susceptibility to antibiotics, the bacterial population regrown from CCCPinduced persisters exhibited a normal and antibiotic-sensitive phenotype highlighting the transient nature of the induced persister status.</s><s>Additionally, reversion to the normal phenotype allowed us to definitely characterize the antibiotic tolerance of CCCP-treated bacteria as persistence rather than spontaneous or CCCP-induced genetic resistance.</s><s>Persister-enriched cultures of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus generated by CCCP treatment were employed to evaluate the anti-persister activity of three structurally different AMPs.</s><s>The polypeptide colistin and the lipopeptide daptomycin were also tested for their activity against PCs as a model of licensed peptide-based antibiotics with a membrane-targeting mechanism of action.</s><s>All tested AMPs were highly effective against CCCPinduced persisters of both bacterial species, even leading to the complete eradication of the bacteria.</s><s>Among the three peptides tested, C5 and Den-SB056 exhibited a superior bactericidal activity against both CCCP-treated and untreated cells as compared to TB_L1FK, reasonably due to their higher cationic charge and number of amino acid residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Han et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>In the case of membrane-active antibiotics, we found colistin to be highly active against PCs of P. aeruginosa, in accordance with previous studies that have reported its ability to eradicate PCs of E. coli and to enhance the anti-persister activity of different antibiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cui et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, daptomycin was effective at eliminating CCCP-induced persisters of S. aureus only at very high concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lechner et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Based on these observations, we were able to prove that our protocol ensures a reliable determination of the anti-persister activity of membrane-targeting molecules, allowing for the detection of the bactericidal activity of both highly active and poorly effective agents.</s><s>Moreover, our results confirmed that targeting the bacterial membrane represents a valuable strategy to eliminate PCs.</s><s>Antibiotic-tolerance of PCs can largely be explained by the arrest in metabolic activity since conventional antibiotics target active cellular processes like macromolecule biosynthesis.</s><s>On the contrary, membrane-targeting molecules do not require an active metabolism to exert their bactericidal action, thus resulting in a rapid and effective killing of both replicating cells and non-replicating persisters <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Briers et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cui et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, membrane-active molecules may represent attractive templates for the development of novel anti-persister agents and a suitable treatment option for persistent biofilmassociated infections.</s><s>Furthermore, the broad-spectrum antipersister activity of AMPs constitutes an additional advantage of developing such molecules as anti-persister agents as they might be able to control multispecies infections involving both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.</s></p></div>
