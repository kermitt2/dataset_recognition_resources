spontaneously and require implantation of biomaterial-based bone substitutes to achieve bone tissue regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Over the last several decades, numerous experiments have been performed to fabricate an ideal bone substitute material <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Typical screening of such material involves in vitro and in vivo experiments to investigate biomaterial attributes, including biocompatibility and bioactivity.</s><s>In addition, many strategies have been developed to optimize the material composition, 3D architecture and mechanical properties to improve its biological performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>However, more recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that the host immune reaction following implantation of bone substitute material determines the success of bone regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Inflammation is recognized as a crucial component of in vivo bone injury repair that influences the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The processes of bone repair are biologically associated with those of the host immune response, sharing a number of cytokines, receptors and signaling molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, in recent studies, the host immune response against bone substitute material has been increasingly explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>These studies have primarily focused on changes in material properties affecting immune cells, such as surface topography <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, porosity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and release ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>However, material properties are not able to accurately modulate the material-host response due to its complex biological nature, and most of these studies have been performed as retrospective and passive observations of immune cell phenotypes associated with successful biomaterials <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, recent studies have begun to evaluate improvements in regenerative outcomes after immunomodulation by cytokines delivered from the material <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>However, the immunomodulation is a 'double-edged sword', and different extents of immunomodulation lead down different paths.</s><s>Research that accurately and proactively modulates the material-host response is required to further optimize the immunomodulatory strategy and may hold great promise in the context of advanced bone substitute material design.</s></p><p><s>Here, we envisioned a new strategy to accurately and proactively modulate the host immune response via cytokine delivery to improve bone substitute material-mediated osteogenesis and angiogenesis.</s><s>Recently, macrophage-material interactions have received particular attention because macrophages are the central cell type in directing host inflammatory and immune processes.</s><s>A spectrum of macrophage phenotypes contained between two extremes have been identified, ranging from pro-inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes, with significant implications in disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, wound healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> and biomaterial performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The findings of studies in nearly all organ systems have demonstrated that re-establishment of the normal homeostatic state after wounding is often associated with the M2 macrophage profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we accurately and proactively construct and optimize the inflammatory microenvironment via the classic M2-polarizing cytokine (IL-4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and evaluate its potential in promoting material-mediated osteogenesis and the related angiogenesis.</s><s>A decellularized bone matrix (DBM) material commonly utilized in bone repair was chosen as a model bone substitute material.</s><s>First, post-operation of DBM material implantation into rat large cranial bone defects, four different IL-4 doses (0 ng, 10 ng, 50 ng and 100 ng) were delivered into the defect region, and the results demonstrated that accurate and proactive immunomodulation via 10 ng of IL-4 promoted neo-vascularization of the DBM and achieved nearly complete healing of the cranial defect at 12 weeks.</s><s>Next, the M1/M2 macrophage polarization and local inflammatory microenvironment were evaluated.</s><s>Finally, the potential effects of polarized macrophages on bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) migration, survival, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were examined.</s></p></div>

type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>.</s><s>It is reported that the sequential release of SDF-1 and BMP-2 from biomaterial scaffolds enhances bone regeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, suggesting that coordinated activation of M1 and M2 macrophages, which secrete these two factors, would be beneficial.</s><s>Here, we demonstrated that IL-4 induced macrophage polarization into an M2 type and had no direct effect on the osteogenic ability of BMSCs.</s><s>The present study and previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref> show that the presence of M2 macrophages influences the effect of IL-4 and thereby enhances the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs.</s><s>These results may appear to be contradictory to those observing that increased osteogenesis can be induced with M1 macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</s><s>This may be attributed to the fact that the dynamic bi-directional cellular interactions between BMSCs and macrophages were ignored in these studies, which used a direct coculture system.</s><s>After all, BMSCs can also promote macrophage differentiation toward an M2-like phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, in this study the effects of macrophage type on the migration, proliferation and maturation of BMSCs were investigated through an indirect co-culture model using conditioned media.</s><s>Specifically, the present study demonstrated that M1 macrophages significantly promoted BMSC migration and M2 polarization showed stimulatory effects on BMSC proliferation and osteogenesis.</s></p><p><s>Despite these encouraging results, translating this accurate and proactive immunomodulatory strategy into a biomaterial design has to be pursued in further studies.</s><s>Although the calvarial bone regeneration outcome provides evidence that sustained administration of 10 ng of IL-4 via local injection is effective for in vivo use, further work should investigate how to endow bone substitute materials with the ability to accurately and proactively release IL-4 directly from the biomaterial.</s></p><p><s>In summary, as a proof-of-concept experiment, we used four different doses of IL-4 to proactively explore the effects of accurate immunomodulation on bone substitute material-based bone regeneration.</s><s>As expected, our in vivo data demonstrated that proper delivery of IL-4 can generate the most preferable M1/M2 macrophage profile, resulting in a pro-healing microenvironment coupled with enhanced downstream osteogenesis and angiogenesis.</s><s>Moreover, in vitro data suggest that the coordinated involvement of M1 (chemotactic effects) and M2 (mitogenic and morphogenic effects) macrophages promotes bone osteogenesis, explaining the in vivo findings.</s><s>With the help of drug delivery systems, this accurate and proactive immunomodulatory strategy holds great promise for construct clinically effective bone substitute material with accurate and sustained delivery of IL-4.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Schematic diagrams of the experimental design
