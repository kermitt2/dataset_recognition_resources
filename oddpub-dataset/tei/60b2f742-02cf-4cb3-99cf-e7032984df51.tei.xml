<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study demonstrates that in patients with PAF, a second-line ablation strategy after a trial of antiarrhythmic drug treatment is non-inferior to a direct first line ablation strategy over a 12-month follow-up period.</s></p><p><s>Current guidelines recommend catheter ablation of symptomatic paroxysmal AF as a second line therapy in patients after failed AAD treatment.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> This recommendation is based on one randomized controlled trial as well as a meta-analysis comparing outcome of second line AF ablation and AAD therapy, both of which showed higher arrhythmia-free survival after AF ablation.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>  MANTRA-PAF, a multicentre randomized controlled trial, had set the scene for AF ablation as a first line therapy, showing that reduction of AF burden was comparable for AF ablation and antiarrhythmic drug therapy.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Five year follow-up in this study cohort revealed a reduction in AF burden and symptomatic recurrences as well as an improved quality of life.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> These findings are reflected in current ESC and HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE guidelines, stating that in selected patients, taking into account patient choice, risk and benefit, catheter ablation can be considered as an alternative to initiating AAD therapy.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> Both recommendations on second and first line ablation are based on studies comparing catheter ablation to AAD therapy.</s><s>To date, there has been no study directly comparing outcome in patients undergoing first or second line ablation.</s><s>We could show that outcome after ablation on and off AAD therapy was comparable, regardless whether patients were previously treated with an AAD.</s></p><p><s>These findings suggest that pre-treatment with AAD seems not to increase success of catheter ablation.</s><s>This is in line with the finding from previous studies on antiarrhythmic drug therapy during the blanking period.</s><s>Although short term AAD therapy is used to avoid AF recurrences after ablation, randomized controlled trials on improving long-term arrhythmiafree survival after drug therapy during the blanking period have been disappointing.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref> Although this study represents all-comers for ablation, both groups are comparable regarding patient's characteristics.</s><s>The only comorbidity that was more prevalent in the second line group was arterial hypertension.</s><s>Nevertheless, the fact that echo parameters such as EF, LA size and LVEDD as well as nt-pro-BNP were comparable, indicates, that arterial hypertension was well-treated and not associated with an increase in remodelled substrate.</s><s>Generally, as shown in other studies including patients with PAF, subjects had a small number of comorbidities.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> Most patients in this study had CHADS 2 and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc-Scores of 1, only around one tenth had coronary artery disease and even less suffered from diabetes or had experienced a stroke or TIA.</s></p><p><s>The fact that outcome after ablation was not improved in second line patients raises the question, whether the waiting period to ablation should be bridged with AADs.</s><s>AAD therapy increases sinus rhythm maintenance two-fold as compared to no therapy but might be proarrhythmic and frequently cause extra-cardiac side effects.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> This fact must be considered in the patient population represented in this study that is in an early stage of AF with low AF burden, is relatively young and has few comorbidities.</s></p><p><s>Single as well as multiple procedure success rates in this patient cohort are comparable to prior studies.</s><s>Since Ouyang and colleagues reported a one year success rate of 62% in 2010, multiple other groups have reported increasing single procedure success rates that are attributed to increasing experience and novel technologies including force measurements.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> Introduction of contact force measurements increased one year arrhythmia-free survival to up to around 85% which is comparable to the 78 and 81% success rate reported in this trial.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> Results from this trial point into the same direction that remodelling in this patient cohort in PAF might not be so advanced that rhythm control with AAD therapy favours outcome.</s><s>Keeping patients in the status of paroxysmal AF with infrequent episodes might be the cornerstone for arrhythmia-free survival.</s><s>In this study it seems not to make a difference for one-year arrhythmia-free survival whether patients underwent a trial of AAD therapy or were ablated before an AAD trial, as long as time to ablation is not prolonged by an AAD trial, which has shown to be associated with poorer outcomes after ablation in prior studies.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> This is also supported by the fact that both groups had comparable histories of AF and waiting time from presentation to AF ablation, so in our population, an AAD trial did not prolong time to ablation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Success of AF ablation did not differ between patients who received AF ablation as first line therapy and those who received AF ablation as a second line therapy.</s><s>Based on these data, a trial of AAD therapy before AF ablation may be justified in most patients with symptomatic PAF eligible for rhythm control.</s></p></div>
