<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High salt decreases Lactobacillus in mice</head><p><s>To determine the effect of a HSD on the gut microbiome composition, we analyzed fecal pellets from normal salt diet (NSD) or HSD-fed FVB/N mice by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene sequencing.</s><s>Both diets were equally well-tolerated, indicated by similar body weight and food intake (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a, b</ref>).</s><s>HSD-fed mice had a significantly higher fluid and salt intake than NSD-fed mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c-f</ref>), but similar intestinal transit (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>).</s><s>The overall microbial composition (based on Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs, assigned using Ribosomal Database Project, RDP) showed no obvious pattern shifts between HSD and NSD mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a, b, 3a</ref>).</s><s>Although Jensen-Shannon Divergence indicated differences between HSD and NSD bacterial communities, these differences were not confirmed by Bray-Curtis or UniFrac metrics (data not shown).</s><s>Bacterial load was not significantly different between NSD and HSD (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>), but several OTUs were significantly decreased under HSD on day 14, including species with the genera Lactobacillus, Oscillibacter, Pseudoflavonifractor, Clostridium XIVa, Johnsonella and Rothia, while others increased under HSD, e.g.</s><s>Parasutterella spp.</s><s>(Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, analysis of fecal metabolites from central carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry showed clear differences between the two groups (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d-g</ref>).</s><s>The absence of large-scale taxonomic differences was unexpected, given the differences in metabolites, but consistent with the fact that the two diets are identical in energy content and only differ in salt content.</s><s>To identify the specific bacterial OTUs that did change across diet, we employed a sensitive machine learning approach.</s><s>An AdaBoost classifier trained to distinguish NSD from HSD samples on day 14 of the treatment identified 8 OTUs with nontrivial feature importance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a, c</ref>) with 92% accuracy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>).</s><s>These OTUs varied in maximum relative abundance (from 0.04% to 19.5%) and responded differently to the HSD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a, c</ref>).</s><s>OTUs identified as most important were consistent across different cross-validation runs, and across different algorithms (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>).</s><s>The most important OTU (25% feature importance) was a member of the genus Lactobacillus, and was depleted under HSD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>).</s><s>Other features included OTUs from Prevotellaceae, Pseudoflavonifractor, Clostridia, Parasutterella, Akkermansia, Bacteroidetes and Alistipes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a, c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>).</s><s>Lactobacillus depletion showed a quick onset detectable 1 day after initiation of the HSD, remaining at low levels during the HSD with the lowest abundance on day 14.</s><s>When the mice were returned to NSD, the Lactobacillus OTU abundance returned to baseline levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Since the Lactobacillus OTU was the bacterial group most strongly associated with high salt, we aimed to isolate a Lactobacillus strain from the mouse feces.</s><s>The 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate shared 100% identity with the V4-V5 16S region of the OTU described above, and was identified as L. murinus.</s><s>We confirmed the decrease of this strain under HSD using qPCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1e, f</ref>).</s><s>Genome sequencing of the isolate showed 93% similarity to two published L. murinus genomes19,20 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>).</s><s>Notably, there are no strains of L. murinus known to be native to the human microbiota, with the closest 16S sequence in the human gut microbiota matching at below 90% identity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>).</s><s>The prevalence of different Lactobacillus species varies in humans, each present in 0.5-22% of subjects in the MetaHIT21 Danish subcohort (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we cultured L. murinus, human-associated Lactobacilli and non-related control strains in vitro and tested their growth under increasing NaCl concentrations.</s><s>Half maximal growth inhibition (IC 50 ) of L. murinus occurred at comparable NaCl concentrations under aerobic and anaerobic culture conditions (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c, d</ref>).</s><s>NaCl inhibited the growth of several human isolates at slightly lower concentrations, with the exception of L. salivarius (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e, f</ref>).</s><s>However, not all strains tested were similarly salt-sensitive.</s><s>For instance, Akkermansia muciniphila, identified by the classifier and increasing in fecal abundance upon HSD, and Escherichia coli had higher salt tolerances (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d, g</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, in vivo colonic fecal sodium concentrations in HSD-fed mice are comparable to growth inhibitory NaCl concentrations in vitro (0.252 for HSD vs. 0.133 M for NSD).</s></p><p><s>Since Lactobacilli are known to metabolize tryptophan to indole metabolites22, we speculated that HSD would also reduce fecal indoles.</s><s>Indeed, HSD significantly reduced fecal levels of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>), while indole-3-carboxaldehyde was unchanged (IAld, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>).</s><s>Notably, mice monocolonized with the L. murinus isolate exhibited fecal ILA, IAA and IAld as compared to germ-free (GF) controls, indicating L. murinus capability of producing these indoles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1h</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6c-d</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L. murinus reduces salt-sensitive hypertension</head><p><s>Accumulating evidence suggests that T H 17 cells play a role in the genesis of hypertension7.</s><s>Moreover, a recent meta-analysis provided preliminary support that Lactobacillus-rich probiotics might affect blood pressure in hypertensive subjects27.</s><s>Thus, we tested whether L. murinus treatment would decrease experimental salt-sensitive hypertension.</s></p><p><s>Blood pressure increased over 3 weeks of HSD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>, b, Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure">9a</ref>).</s><s>Concomitant daily treatment with L. murinus led to a significant reduction of systolic and normalization of diastolic blood pressure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>, b, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9b, c</ref>).</s><s>L. reuteri was similarly effective, while non-Lactobacillus strain E. coli Nissle 1917 was ineffective (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9d-g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next asked if L. murinus treatment affects T H 17 cells in experimental salt-sensitive hypertension and analyzed intestinal and splenic lymphocytes by flow cytometry.</s><s>Compared to NSD, HSD led to a significant increase in CD4 + RORγt + T H 17 cell frequencies in siLPL, which was significantly reduced by L. murinus treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c</ref>).</s><s>In addition, flow cytometry analysis of siLPL, cLPL and splenic lymphocytes revealed a significant reduction of T H 17 cell frequencies by L. murinus treatment compared to HSD feeding alone (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4d-f</ref>).</s><s>The effect of HSD and concomitant L. murinus treatment on effector T cells was again largely specific to T H 17, as a similar pattern was not observed for T H 1 markers.</s><s>Except for the siLPL, HSD and L. murinus treatment did not alter the expression of T H 1 cytokine IFNγ (Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure">9 h-j</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the frequencies of regulatory CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T cells (T reg ) were neither significantly affected by the HSD, nor by concomitant L. murinus treatment in intestinal and splenic tissues (data not shown).</s><s>Thus, L. murinus prevents HSD-induced generation of T H 17 cells and consequently ameliorates salt-sensitive hypertension.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Salt challenge in healthy humans</head><p><s>To corroborate our findings in humans, we conducted an exploratory pilot study in healthy male volunteers, where participants were subjected to an increased salt intake for 14 days.</s><s>Participants received 6 g sodium chloride per day (corresponding to 2.36 Na + g/day) using slow-release NaCl tablets in addition to their accustomed diets.</s><s>According to dietary records, salt intake from foods and drinks was similar between baseline and day 14 of high salt.</s><s>During high salt challenge, the total salt intake was 13.8±2.6</s><s>g/day (Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10a</ref>).</s><s>We monitored ambulatory blood pressure at baseline and after salt challenge in a subgroup of 8 participants.</s><s>To standardize blood pressure measurements and exclude physical activity or stress-driven alterations during daytime28 unrelated to salt-sensitivity, we monitored nocturnal blood pressure during bed rest.</s><s>Compared to baseline, high salt challenge significantly increased mean nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>).</s><s>Since HSD increased T H 17 cells in mice, we analyzed T H 17 cells in human blood before and after high salt.</s><s>Analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes using flow cytometry revealed a significant increase in CD4 + IL-17A + TNF-α + T H 17 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To investigate the effect of high salt challenge on the human gut microbiome, we analyzed the abundance of Lactobacilli in fecal samples before and after high salt challenge.</s><s>To achieve more detailed taxonomic resolution, full shotgun metagenomic was performed (see Supplementary Information).</s><s>Lactobacillus is not a dominant member of the human feces.</s><s>In a control data set used here29,30 only 41.3% were positive for any Lactobacillus.</s><s>In our present study, likewise 5 of 12 (41.7%)</s><s>subjects were positive for at least one gut Lactobacillus species at baseline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref>).</s><s>Overall, we detected 7 different gut Lactobacillus species at baseline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref>, species assignment using SpecI31).</s><s>After high salt challenge, nine of ten initially present Lactobacillus populations could no longer be detected in the respective study subjects, suggesting a loss of Lactobacillus species (Supplementary Information and Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10b, c, d</ref> for cross-validation).</s><s>To test whether this is expected for the human gut over time, we reanalyzed 121 published Illumina-sequenced healthy gut metagenomes29,30 with time course information.</s><s>A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis on all Lactobacillus populations revealed a significantly decreased survival (defined here as continued detectability) rate of Lactobacillus gut populations under HSD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d</ref>).</s><s>Compared to non-Lactobacillus species, Lactobacilli were lost significantly faster under HSD, reflecting high salt impact on an intrinsically low-resilience taxon (Supplementary Information and Extended Data Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10e, f</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we observed that several study subjects had gained at least one novel Lactobacillus species by day 14, which was not detected at baseline (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">10g-i</ref>).</s><s>We speculate that this is the consequence of ingested Lactobacillus-containing foods, since study participants were not subjected to dietary restrictions.</s><s>Thus, high salt challenge induces an increase in blood pressure and T H 17 cells in healthy subjects, alongside reducing survival of intestinal Lactobacillus species in subjects harboring Lactobacillus at baseline.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our data document the impact of an increased salt consumption on intestinal bacteria in mice and men and broaden existing knowledge on the effects of this nutrient.</s><s>Several intestinal bacteria were affected by high salt; particularly Lactobacillus spp.</s><s>were suppressed.</s><s>In addition, fecal metabolites levels, particularly bacterial tryptophan metabolites, responded to HSD in mice.</s><s>Such effects may contribute to salt-induced T H 17 responses and salt-sensitive conditions.</s><s>Since L. murinus produces ILA, we speculate that its salt-induced decrease with reduced ILA generation could be responsible for an enhanced T H 17 response.</s><s>Importantly, the experimental approaches in mice demonstrate that L. murinus supplementation blunts HSD-induced T H 17 activation and ameliorates salt-sensitive hypertension and actively-induced EAE in vivo.</s><s>Yet, actively-induced EAE differs from spontaneous disease models14.</s><s>It is thus currently unclear whether high salt effects can be generalized beyond the actively-induced model and to MS.</s><s>These limitations may also extend to the recent controversy on more general effects of a HSD in neuroinflammation32,33.</s><s>However, in the actively-induced EAE and hypertension models used here and in humans, high salt enhanced T H 17 cells.</s></p><p><s>Lactobacillus metabolites are known to affect host physiology22,34 and ameliorate activelyinduced EAE26.</s><s>Other tryptophan metabolites have been shown to reduce blood pressure35.</s><s>Our data in mice suggest that L. murinus may substantially influence the abundance of fecal tryptophan metabolites, not excluding the possibility that other strains (e.g.</s><s>Bifidobacterium spp.) may be producers of similar importance.</s><s>Additionally, we demonstrated that ILA inhibited murine T H 17 polarization in vitro, a finding that needs to be addressed in more detail in vivo.</s><s>These results highlight the microbiome as a salt-sensitive compartment but do not speak against a more direct effect of high salt on host cells.</s><s>Earlier investigations showed that the ionic microenvironment directly affects various immune cells36-39.</s><s>Salt intake also has profound actions on hormonal systems such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.</s></p><p><s>Our exploratory pilot study in humans is limited in power and needs to be validated in larger studies.</s><s>Considering this limitation, it suggests that even a moderate salt challenge may affect the persistence of intestinal Lactobacilli and other bacteria, along with an increase in pro-inflammatory T H 17 cells and salt-sensitive blood pressure changes.</s><s>Interestingly, newborn infants have the greatest Lactobacillus abundance that decreases over time40,41.</s><s>Compared to microbiomes from indigenous populations, Lactobacillus abundance in 'Western' gut microbiomes is low42.</s><s>Salt ingestion already starting at young age may partially have contributed to the relative loss of Lactobacilli from Western microbiomes and thereby may play role in the development of hypertension and autoimmunity.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the development of microbiota-targeted therapies is an intriguing new avenue for many diseases.</s><s>Nevertheless, changes in microbiome composition or function must first be carefully shown to contribute to any disease.</s><s>Our experimental data in mice suggest that the gut microbiota might serve as a potential target to counteract salt-sensitive conditions.</s><s>The identification of Lactobacillus as a 'natural inhibitor' of high salt-induced T H 17 cells in mice could serve as a basis for the development of novel prevention and treatment strategies.</s><s>It is up to randomized controlled trials in diseased humans to test this hypothesis.</s><s>Moreover, any future dietary salt intervention trial should thus consider monitoring the microbiome to expand on our observations.</s></p></div>
