<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Extracellular RNA promotes pneumococcal infection of lung epithelial cells.</s><s>In order to investigate the role of eRNA in S. pneumoniae infection, we first tested whether eRNA associates with lung epithelial cell membrane.</s><s>To this end, A549 cells were incubated with the different concentrations of biotinylated eRNA and its interaction with the cell membrane was examined by FACS.</s><s>Flow cytometry analysis revealed a dose-dependent binding of eRNA to epithelial cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Next, to study the impact of eRNA on S. pneumoniae invasion of lung epithelial cells, adherence of bacteria to the cells in the absence or presence of eRNA was monitored.</s><s>Preincubation of A549 cells with eRNA nearly doubled bacterial adhesion to A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner from 46.03 ± 9.9 adherent bacteria per cell without eRNA up to 76.64 ± 25 bacteria per cell with 10 μ g eRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B,C</ref>).</s><s>In general, the internalization rate of pneumococci into A549 cells was low, however in the presence of eRNA this process was enhanced too (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained when human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) were employed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>In order to clarify the effect of eRNA-supplementation on bacterial internalization, antibiotic protection assays with a pneumolysin-deficient strain (SpΔply) were performed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Quantification of internalized bacteria by determination of cfu after plating revealed a three-fold increase in pneumococcal internalization from 1.1 ± 0.3 bacteria per cell up to 3.1 ± 1.0 bacteria per cell (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Of note, no replication of bacteria during infection of A549 cells was observed (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>To test specificity of eRNA impact, human extracellular DNA (eDNA) was utilized, however, no effect of eDNA on bacteria invasion was observed (data not shown).</s><s>To determine whether eRNA may directly bind to S. pneumoniae, bacteria (10 4 -10 9 cfu) were immobilized on a membrane and incubated with biotinylated eRNA.</s><s>As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>, eRNA interacted with pneumococci in a dose-dependent manner.</s><s>Interestingly, eRNA interacted not only with Gram-positive (S. pneumoniae 35 A, S. pneumoniae TIGR4, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes), but also with Gram-negative (Neisseria meningitides and Escherichia coli) bacteria and the binding of eRNA to bacteria was independent on the expression of pneumolysin (Sp35AΔply) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</s><s>Altogether, these results indicate an important role of eRNA as a mediator of pneumococcal adhesion.</s></p></div>

direct interaction of eRNA with bacterial cell wall-associated proteins to serve as a bridging factor between bacteria and host cells.</s><s>Using a mass spectrometry approach novel eRNA-binding proteins potentially involved in eRNA-mediated pneumococcal invasion were identified.</s><s>We demonstrated, for the first time, that Eno, a well-characterized Plg-receptor, strongly interacts with

C-terminal lysine deletion and the mutation of internal Plg-binding motif were not significantly impaired.</s><s>Consequently, proteomic analysis of cell wall fraction of S. pneumoniae identified, in addition to Eno, several surface-associated eRNA-binding proteins.</s><s>These include: EFTu, ATPα , BglA3, MalABC, DivA, and RNAPα .</s><s>Interestingly, treatment with RNase1 completely inhibited eRNA-mediated pneumococcal adherence to and internalization into alveolar epithelial cells.</s><s>Together, these data indicate that eRNA represents a novel virulence cofactor promoting pneumococcal
