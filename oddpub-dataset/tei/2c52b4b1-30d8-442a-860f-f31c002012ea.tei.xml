differences of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci levels between patients and healthy controls and no correlation of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 levels with MRI measures of MS and the EDSS in patients with CIS/early RRMS.</s></p><p><s>The median levels of γ-H2AX observed in our study, expressed as number of foci per cell (0.04), were similar to previously reported levels of γ-H2AX foci per cell in healthy

which likely has no harmful consequences as it is counteracted by DNA damage repair mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>As expected, lymphocytic γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci were strongly correlated, consistent with the concept that generation of γ-H2AX foci in response to DNA double-strand breaks provides a platform for the recruitment of further DNA damage response proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>However, γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci did not always colocalize (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), suggesting that γ-H2AX might not be a necessary prerequisite for recruitment of 53BP1 or that expression of 53BP1 exceeds the duration of γ-H2AX expression.</s></p><p><s>The absence of any significant differences of γ-H2AX or 53BP1 foci between patients with CIS/early RRMS and healthy controls suggests that lymphocytic DNA double-strand breaks are not associated with CIS/early MS and, therefore, appear unlikely to play a major role in the pathophysiology of MS.</s><s>Our data are in contrast to previous findings by <ref type="bibr">Grecchi et al., who</ref>  reported a significantly (p = 0.025) higher percentage of γ-H2AX

considerable overlap between both groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Among the reasons for the disparate findings may be the larger sample size of the current study as well as different patient characteristics with more patients in the earliest phase of MS in our work.</s><s>Nevertheless, the similar EDSS values of the patients included in the two studies do not suggest major differences in clinical disability between the two patient populations.</s><s>Although the study by Grecchi et al. included treatment naive patients only, the fact that some patients in our study were treated with immunomodulatory therapies does likewise not seem to be a confounder, as we did not observe any differences of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 in treated vs. untreated patients.</s><s>The study by Grecchi et al. and our study used different methods for the fixation of cells.</s><s>However, as in each study the method of fixation was identical for patients and controls, it appears unlikely that different fixation methods may explain the different results of both studies.</s><s>While in contrast to the study by Grecchi et al. few of our patients did not undergo blood withdrawal
