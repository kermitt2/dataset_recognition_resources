Lourenco, 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Weight loss maintenance (WLM) is defined as a process of maintaining a nominally significant intentional weight loss accomplished by one's own efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Elfhag &amp; Rössner, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, weight loss of 5-10% is deemed clinically significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Crawford, Jeffery, &amp; French, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Wing &amp; Hill, 2001)</ref>, as it is associated with reduced obesityrelated morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Franz et al., 2007)</ref>; and maintenance is defined as keeping this weight off for a minimum of six months <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Elfhag &amp; Rössner, 2005)</ref> to one year <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Wing &amp; Hill, 2001)</ref>.</s><s>While some health benefits might be achieved and maintained even if weight is subsequently regained (e.g., diabetes prevention; Diabetes Prevention Program Research <ref type="bibr">Group, 2009)</ref>, interventions that support sustained WLM are needed to optimise the long-term effects of successful weight loss interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Penn et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Evidence has shown that it is possible to decrease the levels of weight regain following initial weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Simpson, Shaw, &amp; McNamara, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Turk et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>For example, in a systematic review of 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), participants who received extended care interventions were less likely to regain lost weight compared to control groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Middleton, Patidar, &amp;

Sniehotta, 2014b)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In reality, individuals attempt to lose weight using a multitude of different supported and unsupported methods.</s><s>WLM on the other hand, involves a series of complex behaviour and goal-related changes (i.e., from initiation to maintenance) that are often associated with the transition from an energy deficit diet to a sustainable WLM lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sniehotta, Simpson, &amp; Greaves, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Combined with the finding that effective strategies for weight loss and maintenance differ <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sciamanna et al., 2011)</ref>, the implication of this is a need to develop flexible WLM interventions that are applicable independently of prior weight loss method.</s><s>In contrast, inducing weight loss prior to randomisation to WLM conditions inevitably results in a more homogeneous sample than would be obtained if the former type of participant were recruited, with the effectiveness of the WLM intervention therefore being closely linked to the effectiveness and suitability of the weight loss phase.</s><s>Despite this important methodological consideration, only 3 of the 45 included studies in a WLM systematic review recruited individuals who had lost clinically significant amounts of weight on their own before the WLM intervention was offered <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dombrowski et al., 2014b)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Based on the clear need to fill this gap, here we describe the first step in the development of a multi-component behavioural WLM intervention; namely, a single face-to-face session with a trained facilitator, which was designed to be attended at the commencement of a broader, 12-month duration WLM programme.</s><s>Briefly, the NULevel intervention is a primarily SMS-delivered, self-regulatory intervention consisting of a face-to-face session, followed by frequent text messages to prompt self-weighing (using study scales with weights transmitted digitally to the study team) and weekly diary completion (including achievement of eating and physical activity goals), and to deliver theory-based behaviour change techniques (BCTs) targeting motivation, psychological resources, social support, and managing conflicting priorities, among other themes.</s><s>The entire intervention has been described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Evans et al., 2015)</ref> and is being tested for effectiveness in an RCT design with an internal pilot study and process evaluation to further establish acceptability and feasibility.</s><s>Outside of this specific context, it is anticipated that the intervention session could also be used as a supplement to other existing weight management programmes to aid the transition from weight loss to WLM, regardless of initial weight loss method.</s><s>The aims of this study were to (1) develop the content of the face-to-face component of the behavioural WLM intervention; (2) establish the acceptability and feasibility of this novel WLM intervention component; and (3) optimise the intervention session in line with participant feedback.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study design</head><p><s>Interventions should be based on best available evidence and theory to maximise effectiveness and understand how and why interventions do or do not work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bartholomew, Parcel, Kok, Gottlieb, &amp; Fernandez, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Craig et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hoffmann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Michie &amp; Abraham, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with the recommendations of the Medical Research Council and Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) frameworks for the development and evaluation of complex interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Craig et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Glasgow, McKay, Piette, &amp; Reynolds, 2001)</ref>, as well as the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist for reporting interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hoffmann et al., 2014)</ref>, the development, piloting, and optimisation process of the intervention in the target population is described here.</s><s>Specifically, this involved the delivery of the initial version of the intervention session to members of the target population, followed by user engagement research to elicit feedback directly after the session, and the feedback was used to revise and optimise the intervention session for future use.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Participant recruitment procedure</head><p><s>Participants were recruited using two routes.</s><s>First, individuals participating in a weight loss programme funded by the local government authority were invited to participate on behalf of the study team.</s><s>Second, individuals were recruited via advertisements (posters, e-posters, or the university intranet).</s><s>All individuals who contacted the research team were provided with study information and given the opportunity to ask questions prior to consent.</s><s>Those interested in participating were screened for study inclusion criteria: (i) intentional loss of at least 5% of body weight in the previous 12 months; and (ii) a pre-weight loss Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m 2 (adjusted appropriately for participants from Asian backgrounds; <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jafar, Chatuverdi, &amp; Pappas, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Exclusion criteria included recent weight gain due to pregnancy, and unintentional weight loss (e.g., through illness).</s></p><p><s>Individuals meeting the inclusion criteria were posted a pre-session pack approximately one week prior to the face-to-face intervention session.</s><s>This included the participant information sheet, a four-day food and activity diary, and a pedometer (Omron Walking Style II, piezoelectric pedometer-Omron Healthcare Ltd.</s><s>Milton Keynes, UK).</s><s>Prior to attending the face-to-face intervention session, participants recorded their food and fluid intake, portion size, and any other additional detail perceived as relevant (e.g., cooking methods, context) in a provided diary.</s><s>In addition, participants self-monitored their daily steps using the pedometer and recorded them in the diary (BCT: prompt self-monitoring of behavioureating and activity).</s><s>They then attended a face-to-face session at the university campus at a convenient time (between July and September 2013).</s><s>Participants were asked to bring their completed pre-session pack to the intervention session.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Baseline measures</head><p><s>Socio-demographic and weight measures were collected at the beginning of the face-toface session including sex, occupation, current weight, and current height.</s><s>Weight was self-reported rather than measured objectively because the goal of this early stage of the wider study was primarily to assess acceptability of this intervention component rather than its effectiveness for WLM.</s><s>Data were also gathered on weight management goals (i.e., to lose or to maintain weight), ideal weight, amount of weight lost in their most successful weight loss attempt (self-report), number and duration of weight loss attempts in the past 12 months, and the weight loss strategies employed in the last attempt (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for a list of strategies).</s></p></div>

Jolly, 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, further research is needed to test whether any positive results can be generalised to varying populations of obese people regardless of initial weight loss method, as was intended in the development of this tool, or whether effectiveness differs according to predictable user characteristics or preferences.</s><s>This should include assessment across samples with different socioeconomic statuses to ensure that the delivery of the intervention does not widen health inequalities that already exist in obesity.</s></p><p><s>Strengths of this study include that all aspects of the intervention development process adhered to current guidelines for the design and evaluation, and reporting of complex behavioural interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Craig et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hoffmann et al., 2014)</ref> and were based on recent comprehensive reviews of evidence and theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dombrowski et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dombrowski, Sniehotta, Avenell, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Teixeira et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the use of self-regulation, self-efficacy, and relapse prevention techniques is in line with the current state of the evidence for the most effective components of WLM interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dombrowski et al., 2014a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dombrowski et al., , 2014b;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Latner et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Linde et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Shin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Teixeira et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wilson et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Further, the iterative refinement process involved a multidisciplinary collaboration to ensure that both the dietary and physical activity content, and the psychological and behaviour change elements of the intervention were comprehensive and understandable.</s><s>The incorporation of such expertise with user engagement also represents a strength, by ensuring that relevant behaviour change theory, accurate and detailed nutritional and activity information, and factors that impact participant acceptability and engagement were given equal weight in the refinement and optimisation of the session for future use.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Conclusions</head><p><s>We have described the evidence-based design, piloting, and optimisation of a novel singlesession, face-to-face intervention to support the transition from successful weight loss to WLM, regardless of prior weight loss method and which a range of allied health professionals and others could deliver.</s><s>Preliminary results for acceptability appear promising and the incorporation of user feedback into the optimised version suggests that the tool is likely to be acceptable when used as part of the wider trial, and to go some way towards filling the current gap in the literaturethat is, to provide one form of muchneeded support to people who have lost weight to avoid regain, which could in turn potentially reduce both the illness and financial burden that obesity incurs for individuals, communities, and the health care system.</s></p></div>
