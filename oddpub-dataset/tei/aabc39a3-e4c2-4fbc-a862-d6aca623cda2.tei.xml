<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our results reveal that the engagement of CD22 with epratuzumab on the Daudi B cell lymphoma line and on primary human B cells directly enhances the phosphorylation of key regulatory Tyr residues on the CD22 intracellular tail and builds on previously reported data with B cell lines showing increased global CD22 phosphorylation with this antibody <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Carnahan et al 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Qu et al 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Such events would be expected to lead to the recruitment of phosphatases such as SHP-1, which was also demonstrated in the present study.</s><s>Finally, epratuzumab directly stimulated the phosphorylation of a key regulatory Tyr residue on the low affinity inhibitory Fc receptor, CD32B.</s><s>The results are summarised schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Whilst there were technical problems associated with measuring some of the individual phosphorylation events in all cell types, increased phosphorylation of Tyr 822 was most robustly demonstrated using both methods.</s><s>The demonstration  , the antibody also increased association of CD22 with the BCR complex itself.</s><s>Overall, it would appear that such events represent the Binitiating signal^that leads to subsequent inhibition of signalling and downstream immunoregulatory changes such as inhibition of cytokine production or B cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fleischer et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jacobi et al 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, the basal phosphorylation signal for Tyr 822 (and Tyr 842 ) was constitutively high in tonsil-derived B cells which has also been previously reported in terms of total CD22 phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Carnahan et al 2003)</ref> and may be a natural consequence of an increased activation state of tonsil B cells, since tonsils tend to be surgically removed during inflammatory episodes.</s><s>The data from tonsils suggest that CD22 ligation is not able to increase the phosphorylation of some Tyr residues, indicating that preactivated B cells may be less responsive to these inhibitory pathways.</s><s>Interestingly, recent data indicates that a similar mechanism may also exist in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where the B cells from patients have an intrinsically disturbed balance of BCRinitiated signalling pathways including enhanced Tyr phosphatase activity coupled with increased Akt phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fleischer et al. 2015b)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We were however able to show that in tonsil-derived B cells, epratuzumab can enhance the phosphorylation of Tyr 807 , another key regulatory residue on CD22 that is reported to recruit the SH2 adaptor protein Grb2.</s><s>Whilst the key effect was modest in magnitude, it has been known for some time that CD22 forms a quaternary complex with Grb2, SHIP and Shc to negatively regulate BCR-driven events such as Ca 2+ flux <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Poe et al 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, Grb2-deficient mice show hyperactivated Ca 2+ flux responses in response to BCR activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermann et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jang et al 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, Grb2 may also be involved in translating inhibitory signals driven through activation of CD32B <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Isnardi et al 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Neumann et al 2011)</ref>, which is of interest given our data showing induced phosphorylation of CD32B driven by epratuzumab.</s></p><p><s>In our studies, we found that a F(ab') 2 fragment of the epratuzumab antibody was not as active as the full length IgG and, in fact, we could only demonstrate an effect with the F(ab') 2 fragment when Tyr 822 was investigated.</s><s>Many other functional induced with such as CD22 internalisation inhibition of downstream BCR signalling appear to require the antibody to be bivalent but not dependent on the presence of the Fc moiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Sieger et al 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shock et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>It is hypothesized that the cross-linking event directly pulls CD22 into association with the BCR which then cluster in (or in the vicinity of) lipid rafts leading to subsequent internalisation and downstream functional effects (discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dörner et al 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, our confocal microscopy data showed that epratuzumab tends to pull proteins together in a single 'bud' on the B cell surface.</s><s>There is no apparent role for Fc-FcR-mediated events and, indeed, experiments are often conducted with a F(ab') 2 fragment to eliminate any confounding role of FcR's in mixed cell cultures.</s><s>The limited functional effect seen with F(ab') 2 epratuzumab on some readouts in the current study suggests that there may be a threshold for the direct induction of specific Tyr phosphorylation events that is more easily achieved with the coengagement of FcR's.</s><s>Alternatively, some effects with epratuzumab such as the loss of B cell surface proteins onto neighbouring cells (aka trogocytosis) have been shown to be dependent on the Fc <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rossi et al 2013)</ref> and this may indicate a differential mechanism for the phosphorylation of some of the regulatory Tyr residues on CD22.</s></p><p><s>Although CD16 is expressed on B cell progenitor cells in the bone marrow, CD32B is the only FcγR expressed on mature B cells.</s><s>When B cells are activated with immune complexes or anti-BCR, CD32B is known to co-aggregate with the BCR to deliver inhibitory BCR signals.</s><s>Specifically, phosphorylation of the ITIM motif at Tyr 292 by Src family tyrosine kinase members leads to the recruitment of SH2-domain containing phosphatases, in particular SHIP-1 but to a lesser extent SHP-1.</s><s>Some of the functional consequences of this include inhibition of Ca 2+ mobilization and proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ravetch and Bolland 2001)</ref>.</s><s>In the context of the present experiments, epratuzumab could trigger the phosphorylation of CD32B directly via its Fc interaction but this is unlikely due to the low affinity of CD32B for monomeric IgG and is more likely to be due to concomitant binding to CD22 and CD32B, thereby inducing the clustering of all three molecules (CD32B, CD22 and BCR) together on the B cell surface.</s><s>Another consequence of CD32B/BCR co-ligation is the dephosphorylation of CD19 which further attenuates BCR signalling and epratuzumab has been shown to down-regulate CD19 function on B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rossi et al 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Bispecific antibodies that co-engage CD32B with CD79β, a component of the BCR complex, have been shown to inhibit signalling and functional activation of B cells and such an approach has been proposed as a potential therapy in autoimmune diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Veri et al 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, the B cells from patients with autoimmune diseases such as SLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Mackay et al 2006)</ref> and RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Catalán et al 2010)</ref> express CD32B at lower levels relative to healthy individuals and, in this context, it would be relevant to explore the effects of epratuzumab on CD22 and CD32B phosphorylation events in B cells from patients with autoimmune diseases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Epratuzumab directly induced phosphorylation of inhibitory ITIM motifs within key negative regulatory B cell molecules.</s><s>On CD22, these included Tyr 822 , with a concomitant increase in SHP-1 co-localization and Tyr 807 , both of which would inhibit BCR-driven signaling.</s><s>Finally, epratuzumab induced Tyr 292 phosphorylation on the inhibitory Fc receptor CD32B, potentially further dampening a hyper-reactive B cell response.</s><s>Overall, the data provide further evidence that epratuzumab down-modulates B cell activation events in normal B cells extending also to CD32B.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 2 Engagement of CD22 with epratuzumab has no effect on CD22 Tyr 822 and Tyr 842 phosphorylation in tonsil-derived B cells.</s><s>CD22 was immunoprecipitated from tonsil derived B cells following the treatment</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,141.51,554.74,312.41,125.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
