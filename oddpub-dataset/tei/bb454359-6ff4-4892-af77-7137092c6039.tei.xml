<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>R. philippinarum adult specimens were collected in Sacca di Goro (Northern Adriatic Sea, close to the Delta of the Po River) during the spent phase (beginning of February 2016), and compared with specimens in the reconstituting phase (April) and in the gametogenic phase (July) <ref type="bibr">(2014)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2015)</ref>.</s><s>For histological sample preparation, the entire body was processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining following the method in Bettini et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Tissue samples for immunohistochemistry were processed as described in Milani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> with the following modifications: the entire body was collected from animals in the spent phase and fixed for 3.5 hours, while, given their larger body dimensions, pieces of the body of about 0.5-0.8</s><s>cm 3 were sampled from specimens in the gametogenic phase (July 2015-2016) and fixed for 3 hours.</s><s>Details on antisera production as well as specificity tests and experimental controls are provided in Milani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Imaging of hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed with Olympus BH-2 microscope and BEL BlackL.</s><s>5000 digital camera, and immunofluorescence imaging with confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica confocal SP2 microscope), and using Leica software.</s><s>A total number of 100 sections from 10 specimens was observed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result and Discussion</head><p><s>During the reproductive season, the bivalve anatomy generally envisages a strict association between the intestine and the newly formed, seasonal gonad <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>In this species, the reproductive tissue develops during the reproductive season as a non-discrete organ located inside the connective tissue near the intestinal loops at the base of the foot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>During R. philippinarum spent phase, the intestinal epithelium shows cells with a nuclear morphology comparable to that of VASA-stained cells in the gametogenic phase, for dimension (~ 5 µm), round shape, and highly condensed chromatin, and their localization close to the basal membrane of the intestinal batiprismatic epithelium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a,b</ref>, arrowhead; see also Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>When such cells are recognizable in the spent phase, either the cells do not show any staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) or, in some limited areas of the intestine and of the connective tissue, they show a faint VASA labelling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,d</ref>), compared with the strong labelling of the gametogenic phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-d</ref>).</s><s>The staining is concentrated in the cytoplasm at one side of the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>), as observed in similar cells during the gametogenic phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,d</ref>), but the weak signal probably indicates that VASA expression is just starting.</s><s>Single or grouped VASA-labelled cells present in the connective tissue of R. philippinarum have a similar morphology to the VASA-stained cells in the intestinal epithelium, with the VASA immunolabelling concentrated in the cytoplasm at one side of the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c and insets</ref>).</s><s>Also, characteristic formations inside the connective tissue, involving VASA-labelled cells arranged around empty cavities are visible in spent phase samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>It is reasonable that these structures represent the organization of gonadic primordia in which VASAlabelled cells proliferate and rebuild the gonad (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>The localization of VASA-labelled cells in the connective tissue is in agreement with what described by several authors who studied vasa transcripts using in situ hybridization in Crassostrea gigas, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and Pinctada fucata <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, they called germ line stem cells (GSCs) the few cells that remain quiescent in the connective tissue during the non-reproductive season.</s><s>In R. philippinarum, the report of VASA-stained cells in the connective tissue-GSCs, considering the nomenclature of the above-mentioned Authors-is accompanied by the observation of cells with similar morphology and VASA-staining localization within the intestinal wall.</s><s>It is a matter of conjecture that these two populations of cells belong to the same lineage, and that they both participate to gonad reconstitution.</s></p><p><s>Recently it was hypothesized that during the gonad reconstituting phase, VASA-stained primordial stem cells (PriSCs) coming from the intestine may contribute to the rebuilding of reproductive tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Actually, we suppose that the digestive epithelium could be a reservoir of multipotent cells-PriSCs-that can be deputed to multiple cell fate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>VASA-stained cells increase in number during gonad rebuilding and are present both in the intestine epithelium and in the connective tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>On the one hand, it is easy to assume that the VASA-positive cells in the connective tissue-were the new gonadic tissue is usually formed-are source of new gametogenic cells (see Online Resource 1 for confocal images of the reconstituting phase).</s><s>On the other hand, the massive proliferation of VASA-stained cells in the intestinal epithelium during the reproductive season is difficult to explain by gut renovation alone.</s><s>Indeed, cells deputed to renewal and turnover of the gut wall are present in the intestinal epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However, given the presence in several locations (in the intestinal epithelium, near the basal lamina, in the connective tissue, and around acini) of cells with similar nuclear morphology and VASA staining, it can also be hypothesized that those cells in the intestine are multipotent cells.</s><s>This is in some measure supported by recent studies on many animal species that describe VASA-positive cells as, more generally, primordial stem cells able to give rise to germ and somatic cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>This hypothesis does not rule out the first one, in fact, being PriSCs capable of originating both somatic and germ cells, they could act in the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23]</ref> and also contribute to the gonad rebuilding.</s><s>The two processes are indeed linked, because they are driven by the same environmental factors: the abundance of food triggers gametogenesis, thus beginning the reproductive season and the consequent increase in the need for massive nutrient assimilation.</s><s>Moreover, in the spent phase, the proliferation of VASA-stained cells seems to be absent, given that their number is consistently extremely limited.</s><s>This is in line with the reduced body mass of bivalves during this phase, size that increases with gonad rebuilding during the reproductive season <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In this context, the tight association between intestine and gonad can also facilitate nutrient exchange in support of germ cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>The evidence obtained with VASA localization inspired us to propose a hypothesis that would be interesting to test in the future.</s><s>We can advance a scenario about the localization of germ cell precursors in R. philippinarum (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for a visual summary): at the beginning of the reproductive season, quiescent PriSCs within the intestinal wall begin to proliferate massively, and migrate into the connective tissue, contributing to the organization of the developing gonad.</s><s>At the end of the season, the gonadic tissue undergoes reabsorption.</s><s>VASA-expressing cells persist in the intestinal niche, while the cells already migrated into the connective tissue (GSCs) remain there, some surrounding empty cavities.</s></p><p><s>According to our hypothesis, at the beginning of the following reproductive season, an increased expression of VASA and other germ line determinants triggers gonad development with the contribution of both the niches.</s></p><p><s>The investigation of cyclic events of development, like that here described, can provide some important inputs to the topic of reconstitution and renewal of tissues, especially in non-model organisms.</s></p></div>
