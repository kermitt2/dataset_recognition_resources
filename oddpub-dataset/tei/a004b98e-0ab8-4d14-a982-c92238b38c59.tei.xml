<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE-Among pediatric patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest compared with no intubation was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.</s><s>Although the study design does not eliminate the potential for confounding, these findings do not support the current emphasis on early tracheal intubation for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.</s></p><p><s>Survival rates from pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest are improving, yet mortality remains high. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Most pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests are precipitated by acute respiratory failure (hypoxia), and relatively few are attributable to primary arrhythmias (eg, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref></s><s>Therefore, the standard paradigm for pediatric in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) focuses on early effective respiratory support to establish adequate oxygenation and ventilation and on high-quality chest compressions to provide adequate myocardial and cerebral blood flow. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref></s><s>Although there is increasing evidence supporting the importance of high-quality chest compressions for survival from pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> less is known about the importance of invasive airway management during CPR.</s></p><p><s>Invasive airway management for children is often a challenging and potentially dangerous task.</s><s>Therefore, it is not surprising that tracheal intubation in the prehospital setting did not improve outcomes compared with bag-valve-mask ventilation during pediatric emergencies, including cardiac arrest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref></s><s>Consequently, recommendations from the International Liaison Committee On Resuscitation Pediatric Task Force and the American Heart Association support the use of bag-valve-mask ventilation as opposed to tracheal intubation in patients with out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest and with a short transport time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref></s><s> contrast to the prehospital setting, a large proportion of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in an intensive care unit, emergency department, or interventional setting (eg, catheterization laboratory or operating room), <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> where the hospital-based personnel are presumably highly trained for invasive airway management and ventilatory support.</s></p><p><s>The goal of the current investigation was to examine, among pediatric patients with inhospital cardiac arrest, whether tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest is associated with survival to hospital discharge.</s><s>Because acute respiratory failure is a common cause of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest, it was hypothesized that tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest would be associated with improved survival.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Source</head><p><s>Data from the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation (GWTG-R) registry were used.</s><s>This is an American Heart Association-sponsored prospective quality improvement registry of inhospital cardiac arrests in the United States.</s><s>The data collection process and reliability have been described in full detail. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref></s><s>In the registry, cardiac arrest is defined as pulselessness, or a pulse with inadequate perfusion, requiring chest compressions, defibrillation, or both and with a hospital-wide or unit-based emergency response by acute care facility personnel.</s><s>Hospital-level data (teaching status and type of hospital) were obtained from the American Hospital Association's Annual Survey from 2013. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> All participating hospitals in the GWTG-R registry are required to comply with local regulatory guidelines.</s><s>Because data are used primarily at the local site for quality improvement, sites are granted a waiver of informed consent under the common rule.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p><s>The cohort included data submitted to the GWTG-R registry between January 2000 and December 2014.</s><s>All patients younger than 18 years who had an index cardiac arrest with 1 minute or more of chest compressions were included.</s><s>Patients were excluded if they were receiving assisted ventilation, had an invasive airway (including a tracheostomy tube) in place at the time chest compressions were initiated, or both.</s><s>Furthermore, hospital visitors and cardiac arrests in the delivery room or neonatal intensive care unit were excluded.</s><s>For the primary analysis and majority of analyses, patients with missing or inconsistent data on tracheal intubation, timing of intubation, timing of the end of resuscitation, timing of pulselessness, survival, or relevant covariates were excluded (537 patients [19%], see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for details).</s><s>These patients were included in a preplanned sensitivity analysis accounting for missing data (see statistical analysis below).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intubation and Study Outcomes</head><p><s>Intubation was defined as insertion of a tracheal tube during the cardiac arrest event.</s><s>Unsuccessful intubation attempts were not counted as intubations.</s><s>The time to intubation was defined as the time interval in whole minutes from the start of chest compressions until the tracheal tube was inserted.</s><s>All times in the GWTG-R registry are collected in whole minutes.</s><s>As such, a time to intubation of 0 minutes indicates that the intubation was performed within the same whole minute as chest compressions were started; a time of 1 minute indicates that intubation was performed within the next whole minute, etc.</s><s>The primary outcome was designated a priori as survival to hospital discharge.</s><s>Secondary outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and favorable neurologic outcome at hospital discharge.</s><s>ROSC was defined as no further need for chest compressions (including initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) that was sustained for longer than 20 minutes.</s><s>Neurologic outcome was assessed as recommended by the Utstein guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> using the pediatric cerebral performance category (PCPC) score, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> where a PCPC score of 1 indicates no neurologic deficit; 2, mild cerebral disability; 3, moderate cerebral disability; 4, severe cerebral disability; 5, coma or vegetative state; and 6, brain death.</s><s>A PCPC score of 1 and 2 was considered a favorable neurologic outcome, and a PCPC score of 3 to 6 or death was considered a poor neurologic outcome.</s><s>Prospectively designated sensitivity analyses were performed with different definitions of favorable neurologic outcome: (1) a PCPC score of 1 or 2, or no increase from baseline; (2) a PCPC score of 1,2, or 3; and (3) a PCPC score of 1,2, or 3, or no increase from baseline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>ta abstractors were not blinded to outcomes but were unaware of the hypothesis of the current study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p><s>The study population was characterized using descriptive statistics.</s><s>Categorical variables are presented as counts and frequencies and continuous variables as medians with 25th and 75th percentiles.</s><s>The χ 2 test was used to compare categorical data between independent groups and the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare continuous variables.</s><s>The Cochran-Armitage test was used to test for linear trends in tracheal intubation over time.</s></p><p><s>To assess the adjusted association between tracheal intubation during CPR and survival to hospital discharge, time-dependent propensity score matching was used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>A similar methodology has been successfully applied to the adult cardiac arrest population and accounts for the time-dependent nature of interventions during cardiac arrest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s>If the timing of intubation is not accounted for, it is likely that the results would be biased toward a harmful effect of intubation, since intubation can be a function of prolonged resuscitation, and prolonged resuscitation is associated with poor outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s>e propensity score was calculated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model as explained in additional details in the eMethods in the Supplement.</s><s>All variables presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> were included in the propensity score model (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for definitions of preexisting conditions).</s><s>All variables were chosen a priori based on prior work or clinical reasoning derived from prior publications related to pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>tching (1:1) on the propensity score was performed using a nearest neighbor-matching algorithm with a maximum caliper of 0.01 of the propensity score.</s><s>Patients being intubated at any given minute (from minute 0 to minute 15) were separately and sequentially propensity score matched with a patient who was "at risk" of being intubated within the same minute.</s><s>Patients were matched up until 15 minutes after the cardiac arrest, because intubation at any given minute after 15 minutes was uncommon.</s><s>At-risk patients included those still undergoing resuscitation (ie, excluding patients with ROSC or resuscitation terminated without ROSC) and who did not receive intubation before or within the same minute.</s><s>At-risk patients also included patients intubated at a later point, because the matching should not be dependent on future events. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref></s><s>For example, a patient intubated at minute 3 was matched with a patient who was at risk of intubation at minute 3 (ie, either a patient intubated after minute 3 or a patient never intubated).</s><s>Replacement of controls was used to reduce the number of unmatched exposed patients.</s></p><p><s>To assess the performance of the matching, baseline categorical variables were compared between the matched groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and standardized differences were calculated for which a difference between −0.1 and 0.1 is generally considered negligible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref></s><s>Using the matched cohort, modified Poisson regression was performed to assess the association between intubation during CPR and survival to hospital discharge obtaining risk ratios (RRs) with robust variance estimates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref></s><s>To account for the matching, the correlation between resampled controls, and potential clustering within hospitals, generalized estimating equations were used as described by Miglioretti and Heagerty, accounting for the nonnested nature of these clusters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26</ref></s><s>The results from the regression models are reported as RRs with 95% confidence intervals.</s></p><p><s>Whether the association between intubation during CPR and survival varied with the duration of the event was examined by adding an interaction term between the intubation variable (yes/no) and time to intubation/matching (ie, time from start of chest compressions to the minute the patient was matched) to the modified Poisson regression model.</s><s>Time was first treated as a linear continuous variable and next as a categorical variable (0-5, 6-10, and 11-15 minutes).</s></p><p><s>Three predefined sensitivity analyses were performed.</s><s>First, multiple imputations were performed to account for missing data.</s><s>Categorical variables were imputed using the fully conditional specification method, and continuous time variables were imputed using Poisson distributions as described in more detail in the eMethods in the Supplement.</s><s>Second, the primary analysis was performed after excluding those patients who received cardiopulmonary bypass (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) during the event.</s><s>Third, the main analysis was performed including only those patients who had 2 minutes or more of chest compressions and not including patients intubated 2 minutes or less after the start of chest compressions.</s><s>A post hoc sensitivity analysis assessing the potential influence of an unmeasured confounder was performed using the method as described by Lin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27</ref> Additional details are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement.</s><s>As a second post hoc sensitivity analysis, we conducted a traditional propensity score-matched analysis (ie, not accounting for the timing of intubation).</s><s>Additional details are provided in the eMethods in the Supplement.</s></p><p><s>As a predefined subgroup analysis, the cohort was restricted to those patients who lost pulse at any time during the event.</s><s>For this analysis, the time to intubation was calculated as the time from loss of pulse to intubation, and patients who were intubated before pulselessness were excluded.</s><s>Then an approach similar to that described above was used to assess whether intubation during CPR was associated with outcomes in this subgroup of patients.</s><s>As a post hoc analysis, a subgroup analysis was also conducted in only those who received CPR for bradycardia and inadequate perfusion (ie, pulse present at initiation

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Although tracheal intubation to achieve effective oxygenation and ventilation is a basic tenet of advanced CPR for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests, this study was unable to demonstrate any association of improvement in survival with tracheal intubation during CPR when using time-dependent propensity score matching in this large multicenter study of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest.</s><s>Importantly, this study found that tracheal intubation during CPR was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge in the primary propensity-matched analysis.</s><s>This association was consistently demonstrable with several sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</s></p><p><s>Tracheal intubation is the current standard of care in the setting of in-hospital cardiac arrest and is commonly prioritized and accomplished during in-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest.</s><s>The data confirmed that this is the most common approach, as 68% of children who were not already intubated or receiving assisted ventilation at the time of CPR were intubated during CPR.</s><s>Although recent guidelines have deemphasized the focus on tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest, especially in the adult population, the optimal approach to airway management during cardiac arrest in general and particularly pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest remains unknown. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28</ref></s><s>Underlying pulmonary or airway disease and a presumed

literature on tracheal intubation during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest is scarce.</s><s>arrests at a single center.</s><s>Of 391 patients, 194 (50%) were not intubated or receiving invasive mechanical ventilation prior to the arrest.</s><s>In this subgroup, the authors found no association between the timing of invasive airway placement (tracheal intubation) and survival or favorable neurologic outcome, but the power of their study to find a difference was limited.</s><s>Their findings are consistent with those reported for adult in-hospital cardiac arrests <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">37</ref> and consistent with those reported here.</s><s>However, the analytic methodologies, multicenter data, and size of the database differ substantially.</s><s>In the current analysis, the association between the timing of intubation during CPR and outcomes was assessed by adding an interaction term between intubation and the timing of intubation and matching to the model.</s><s>This interaction was nonsignificant, indicating that the association between intubation during CPR and outcomes did not change with the duration of the arrest.</s></p><p><s>In the out-of-hospital setting, a quasi-randomized trial including 591 children in cardiac arrest found no difference in outcomes between patients in cardiac arrest receiving intubation compared with bag-valve-mask ventilation (24/301 vs 24/290 survivors). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref></s><s>In a large observational study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults, Hasegawa et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">38</ref> found that tracheal intubation as compared with bag-valve-mask ventilation was associated with decreased odds of survival and decreased favorable neurologic outcome.</s><s>Given the substantial differences between in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> and between pediatric and adult cardiac arrest, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> any direct comparison to the current study is challenging.</s></p><p><s>In this study of in-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest, time-dependent propensity score matching was used, which allows for adjustment for covariates, including time-dependent covariates, and adjustment for the time-dependent risk of being intubated during CPRsomething not possible using traditional regression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref></s><s>As described in detail in the Methods section, this approach is superior to traditional regression or propensity score matching in situations in which a time-dependent intervention is assessed.</s><s>Furthermore, the practical relevance of using this approach has previously been shown in relation to 2 highimpact observational studies regarding epinephrine administration in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.</s><s>The 2 studies used the same out-of-hospital database, but one used time-dependent propensity score matching, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> whereas the other used traditional propensity score matching, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">39</ref> ultimately yielding differing results.</s><s>One potential reason for these inconsistent results is that an intracardiac arrest intervention (eg, epinephrine or intubation) can be a function of the duration of the cardiac arrest (ie, patients are more likely to receive the intervention if the cardiac arrest is prolonged), thereby confounding the results.</s><s>Moreover, the intervention might influence the duration of the event (ie, a patient being intubated might have ROSC because of the intubation), and adjusting for duration of the arrest is therefore difficult when using traditional propensity score matching or regression.</s><s>The use of time-dependent propensity matching addresses these issues and allows for slightly different interpretation of the results.</s><s>Specifically, the effect estimates (risk ratios) should be interpreted as the risk of the outcome in those being intubated during CPR at a given minute (from 0 to 15) relative to the risk of the outcome in those not being intubated during CPR at that given minute, which include those being intubated at later time points.</s><s>This interpretation is more clinically relevant, because a clinician might consider intubating a patient at any given minute with future events being unknown.</s></p><p><s>The result of the analysis using traditional propensity score matching indicated a stronger association between intubation and poor outcome.</s><s>However, as discussed above, this analysis should be interpreted with caution, as it did not take into account the timing of intubation.</s></p><p><s>Although an association between intubation and decreased survival to hospital discharge was found, no significant association between intubation and neurologic outcome was seen in the main time-dependent propensity-matched multivariable analysis.</s><s>There are a number of possible explanations for this finding.</s><s>First, the current data set had a relatively high frequency of missing data on neurologic outcome (18%, corresponding to 36% of survivors), which limits the power and interpretability of the findings.</s><s>Second, neurologic outcome was based on a nongranular scoring system, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">40</ref> for which there might be significant variability in reporting, biasing the results toward the null hypothesis.</s><s>These potential explanations are supported by the findings of similar point estimates for the risk ratios for survival and favorable neurologic outcome but wider confidence intervals for the latter, resulting in nonsignificant findings.</s><s>These concerns prompted this study, a priori, to use survival-an objective and almost uniformly reported outcome-as the primary outcome measurement.</s></p><p><s>The results of the current study should be interpreted in the context of the study design and several limitations.</s><s>First, this was an observational study, and unmeasured confounders could have influenced the results.</s><s>The registry does not have data on the specific indication for intubation, data on clinician experience or background, quantitative data on the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or data on the effectiveness of noninvasive oxygenation and ventilation prior to intubation during CPR.</s><s>However, the sensitivity analysis assessing the potential influence of an unmeasured confounder indicated that any unmeasured confounder would be unlikely to mask a positive association between intubation and survival.</s><s>The lack of data on clinician experience and background also limits the ability to assess whether intubation could be beneficial if provided by more experienced clinicians and the ability to adjust for clustering by clinician.</s><s>Second, intubation attempts are not recorded in the registry, and unsuccessful intubation attempts are classified as "not intubated" and were therefore included in that group in the analyses.</s><s>This is in contrast to the intent-to-treat principle most often used in randomized clinical trials and could have biased the results, especially if failed intubation attempts during CPR led to poor outcomes.</s><s>However, this likely would have biased the results toward the null.</s><s>Third, the GWTG-R registry has very limited information on post-ROSC care, and we were therefore unable to describe this aspect.</s><s>Fourth, the study may have been underpowered to detect some clinically relevant associations, especially for neurologic outcomes and interactions.</s></p></div>
