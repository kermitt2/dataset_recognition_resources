<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analysis</head><p><s>Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that LAAO remained cost-effective compared with other strategies when stroke risk was varied from CHADS 2 score 0 to 6 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">4</ref>).</s><s>In particular, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban and rivaroxaban were dominated by LAAO.</s></p><p><s>When hemorrhage rate was varied by HAS-BLED score from 0 to 5 for anticoagulant drugs in the simulation model, LAAO remained cost-effective compared with each strategy.</s><s>Varying the time horizon from 20 to 15, 10 and 5 years did not affect the cost-effectiveness of LAAO against all other treatment strategies except for warfarin (ICER: US$74,422) with a short 5 years time horizon.</s><s>In tornado diagram, the results demonstrated the parameters with greatest impact were all-cause mortality of warfarin (−$32,048-$12,994) and all-cause mortality of LAAO ($3,631-$24,716), respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>PSA results demonstrated that the probability of LAAO strategy was the most cost-effective compared with other 7 strategies in 86.24 % of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations at the threshold of US$50,000/QALY (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Previous study has demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of LAAO, dabigatran and warfarin in the management of NVAF <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>This was the first comprehensive analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness between seven pharmacological strategies including newer oral anticoagulants and transcatheter LAA occlusion for stroke prevention in NVAF patients.</s><s>We demonstrated that LAAO was associated with the highest QALYs gained and the lowest ICER per QALY gained compared to 7 other pharmacological regimens in the prevention of AF-related stroke.</s><s>Sensitivity analysis also demonstrated that LAAO remained cost-effective compared with all 7 alternative strategies across the spectrum of stroke risks, bleeding risk and time horizon.</s><s>Atrial fibrillation is a growing problem in an aging society.</s><s>It causes &gt;50 000 strokes and $12 billion in medical expenditure each year in United States.</s><s>Warfarin used to be the standard of care in preventing stroke but it is difficult to be used conveniently and safely <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Shows the result of ICER values in comparison of the next-best strategy, and the black line connected from acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to LAA occlusion as the cost-effectiveness frontier.</s><s>The effectiveness is defined as the change of quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.</s><s>The cost-effectiveness frontier ran from ASA to warfarin to LAA occlusion and its slope increased when moving from the least costly/least effective alternative (ASA) towards the most costly/most effective alternative (LAA occlusion).</s><s>Clopidogrel plus ASA was an extended dominance* strategy.</s><s>LAA occlusion is the next more-effective strategy comparing to warfarin, ICER per QALY gained was US$6,298.</s><s>Dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were dominated by LAA occlusion because those four alternatives were less effective but more costly than LAA occlusion.</s><s>*Extended dominance: This refers to the observation when the ICER value for a given strategy is higher than that of the next, more effective, alternative.</s><s>Clopidogrel plus ASA had a higher ICER value than a more effective alternative (warfarin)     NOACs may be comparable to warfarin in terms of clinical efficacy but the benefit does not come without risk of bleeding.</s><s>Transcatheter LAAO potentially reduces both risks of stroke and bleeding associated with longterm anticoagulation and the 2012 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines recommended such intervention can be considered in patients with high stroke risk and contraindications for oral anticoagulants <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>A few studies attempted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these newer stroke preventive strategies.</s><s>One key analysis based on the RE-LY study <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> showed the ICERs of dabigatran 110 mg and 150 mg compared with warfarin were US$16,147-115,129 and US$39,680-263,543, respectively, which were much higher compared to the ICER for LAAO in our current study.</s><s>SM Singh, A Micieli and HC Wijeysundera <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> demonstrated LAAO was cost-effective as compared to dabigatran and warfarin but they did not address the impact of other commonly used NOACs and the treatment duration on the cost-effective performance of the device therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>In current analysis, we demonstrated the superior costeffectiveness of the device compared to other NOACs, which is independent of stroke risk (CHADS 2 score), bleeding risk (HAS-BLED score) and treatment duration (i.e.</s><s>device strategy was cost-effective even at 5 year follow-up).</s><s>In particular, LAAO was considered costeffective comparing to all alternative strategies when HAS-BLED score and CHADS 2 score were varied.</s><s>Considering most adverse events occur during and shortly after device implantation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, while events with oral anticoagulants develop continuously over time, our findings may provide additional insights in selecting specific therapy for individual patient groups.</s><s>Three endovascular LAA occluding devices have been widely used in humans and many other new devices are under pre-clinical evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The PLAATO device was the oldest with reported favorable clinical results up to 5 years but the device has been withdrawn from the market because of financial considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>PROTECT-AF trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> showed the WATCHMAN device was non-inferior to warfarin in reducing ischemic stroke in AF patients with CHADS 2 score of ≥1 and the device arm was associated with less hemorrhagic stroke.</s><s>Early registry results with Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (St Jude Medical Inc, US), consistently reported a high implantation success rate &gt;95 %, implying its wide applicability to AF patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>The longest followup data were also shown to demonstrate the promising results with Amplatzer device in AF patients for stroke prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>While the device therapy addresses both the concerns of inconvenience (no issue with drug interaction, blood monitoring and compliance) and safety (bleeding) associated with long term oral anticoagulant usage, it also has shortcomings in particular procedural-related complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and the risks of having incomplete LAAO and thrombus formation on the device during long-term follow up.</s><s>The costs of managing these events needed to be studied especially when the device strategy has been widely adopted in in-experienced centers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>There are a number of limitations of the current study.</s><s>Firstly, there was no directly comparative trial between LAAO and oral anticoagulation.</s><s>Secondly, the base-case values of the current model simulation were derived from individual clinical trials from different countries and healthcare systems with variable costs of management.</s><s>Thirdly, a number of base-case assumptions were necessary when trial data were lacking.</s><s>Fourthly, data from randomized clinical trials could not be generalizable to "real world" clinical practice.</s><s>It should also be noted that only direct medical cost was considered in the analysis.</s><s>Fifthly, we assumed that warfarin was discontinued after 45 days post LAAO although some patients may require warfarin beyond 45 days when TEE confirmed clots or device leak.</s><s>Furthermore, the long-term follow-up data for the newer LAAO devices were obtained from a single study with 10-year follow up of Amplatzer left atrial appendage occlusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, it may add to model uncertainties and parameter uncertainties in the results, however, sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of study results.</s></p></div>
