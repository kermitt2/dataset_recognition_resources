the mean VDT was increased in hearing impaired individuals by ~25% (an absolute difference of just 23 nm, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>However, it should be noted that the plot of VDT at 125 Hz shows 4 individuals with z-values that clearly reside in a loss of function window (below −1.96).</s><s>Interestingly, the subject with the worst z-score for VDT at 125 Hz (z-score = −3.85)</s><s>had self-reported difficulty in perceiving wetness.</s><s>This subject did not otherwise exhibit extreme deficits in any of the other tests.</s><s>We did not systematically ask subjects if they had difficulty perceiving wetness, and so it is unclear if this was the only such individual.</s><s>Because the major effect was found for VDT at 10 Hz, we asked if study subjects with z-values lying in a loss of function window (below −1.96) also performed poorly in other tests.</s><s>Hearing impaired subjects who performed poorly in the vibration detection task at 10 Hz did not perform poorly with the same test at 125 Hz.</s><s>Neither did these individuals perform better or worse than the rest of the hearing impaired population in any of the other test batteries used (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, hearing impaired individuals with an impairment in VDT tested at 125 Hz appear to be a different population of individuals than the majority of individuals with a VDT impairment at 10 Hz (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>However, it can also be seen that the 4 subjects with Usher syndrome all had increased thresholds (z scores &lt; −1.96) for 10 Hz vibrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</s><s>The VDT at 125 Hz for these subjects were all below −1 z-unit but not below −1.96 which may indicate a moderate impairment that parallels the prominent deficits for 10 Hz vibration.</s></p><p><s>Thermal detection thresholds for warming and cooling were also measured and we noted a strong and robust loss of function for cooling but not warm detection in the hearing impaired cohort (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Thus the mean cold detection threshold was around 40% higher in the hearing impaired cohort compared to controls and this was statistically significant (two-way ANOVA F (1,143) = 16.5, P &lt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Quantitative sensory testing was used to systematically test whether congenital hearing impairment is associated with somatosensory deficits.</s><s>In agreement with our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , we could confirm in an independent patient cohort that many adolescents born with hearing impairment exhibit substantial deficits in touch sensation.</s><s>The touch deficits we observed were most common and most severe for vibration detection at 10 Hz.</s><s>Indeed 50% of the hearing impaired subjects (18/36) had vibration detection thresholds that were more than two standard deviations higher than the control mean (z-score &gt; −1.96), and subjects with similarly impaired vibration detection thresholds at 125 Hz, but not at 10 Hz appeared to represent an additional population (4/36) thus at least 22/36 (61%) of hearing impaired subjects exhibit a severe vibration detection deficit.</s><s>Thus distinct patient groups were found with deficits in vibration detection threshold at 125 Hz and 10 Hz, respectively.</s><s>This finding strongly suggests that the underlying pathophysiology is specific for the function or connectivity of distinct sets of mechanoreceptors.</s><s>Thus it is known that a 10 Hz vibration is primarily detected by rapidly-adapting Meissner's corpuscle receptors and slowly-adapting Merkel cell mechanoreceptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, the detection of high frequency vibration of 125 Hz primarily requires rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that innervate Pacinian corpuscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In this study we asked whether sensory deficits in subjects with hearing impairments extend to pain.</s><s>We used a standardized testing protocol that included several elements of the QST of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain (DFNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>We found no clear deficits in pain sensitivity amongst hearing impaired individuals and this was especially clear for mechanical pain (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>There was significantly increased heat pain sensitivity in the hearing impaired cohort, but this was a relatively small effect (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>In addition to measures of tactile sensitivity, we also found a robust change in the ability of hearing impaired individuals to detect cooling, but no deficit was seen in warm detection (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>Several hearing impaired individuals (8/36) exhibited cold detection thresholds that were more than 1.5 standard deviations higher than the control means (z-score &gt; −1.47).</s><s>There appeared to be two groups of hearing impaired individuals those with cold detection thresholds clearly higher than the control mean and those with cold detection thresholds more similar to healthy controls.</s><s>Indeed many of the hearing impaired participants with a z-score for CDT below −1.0 also had a z-score for vibration detection (10 or 125 Hz) that was below −1.5 (16/18 individuals).</s><s>Cool objects have a distinct tactile quality compared to warm objects as exemplified by Weber's effect, a cold coin feels heavier than a thermally neutral coin <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>There is very recent evidence that information on cooling is processed by tactile responsive neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, C-fiber polymodal nociceptors that are sensitive to cooling appear to provide information on non-noxious cooling directly to the somatosensory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and human polymodal C-fibers are also responsive to cooling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p></div>

100 Hz).</s><s>It remains to be seen if there is significant cross-modality interactions for low frequency vibration which was most severely affected parameter in our hearing impaired cohort (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>In general we would argue that hearing impairment in itself is unlikely to reduce vibration detection thresholds by a generalized negative effect on the development of cortical circuits.</s><s>If a cortical development problem caused by hearing loss would underlie the loss of vibration sensitivity we would expect that all of our hearing impaired subjects exhibit clear touch deficits which they did not (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In summary, in a well controlled study using young aged matched individuals we could show highly specific deficits in vibration sensitivity in hearing-impaired individuals.</s><s>Interestingly, congenital hearing impairment was not associated with major changes in the detection of noxious mechanical stimuli.</s><s>The fact that deficits were most common and penetrant for a 10 Hz vibration detection task suggest that hearing genes may have a role in the development, function, or connectivity of classical mechanoreceptors.</s></p></div>

hearing loss.</s><s>Adolescents were recruited from three Berlin high schools.</s><s>Study participants were tested with a battery consisting of nine psychophysical tests applied to the skin.</s><s>The hearing impaired cohort was recruited from the Margaretha-von-Witzleben School in Berlin (www.witzleben-schule.de).</s><s>All subjects and their parents received written and oral information describing the study and signed an informed consent form.</s><s>The subjects and schools were received compensation for taking part in the study.</s><s>Because tactile sensitivity is known to change with age, we chose subjects with a narrow age range 14 to 20 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Eligible subjects were between 14 and 20 years of age, did not receive medication, and had no diabetes or hypertension.</s><s>The following subject information was routinely documented: age, gender, handedness, history of ear infections, family history of hearing loss, hearing devices (hearing aids, cochlear implants), and comorbidities.</s></p><p><s>Quantitative Sensory Testing.</s><s>Subjects were seated comfortably in a quiet room at the school.</s><s>Prior to testing, the participants were familiarized with the setup and their questions and concerns were addressed.</s><s>Tests were completed in 2 sessions each of 45 minutes duration.</s><s>Hearing impaired subjects were asked to switch off their hearing aids during the vibration detection threshold test.</s><s>Sensory testing was done on the side of the dominant hand.</s></p><p><s>Vibration detection threshold.</s><s>The test has been previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The device is composed of a linear Piezo actuator (P-602.1 L, Physik Instrument, Germany) whose displacements are driven and controlled by an amplifier/controller (E-665, Physik Instrument, Germany).</s><s>Signals are processed by the PowerLab (PowerLab 4/35, ADInstruments, USA) data acquisition system.</s><s>The vibration stimulus was 1.8 s long and the rise and fall time at on and offset were 500 and 600 ms, respectively, independent of the testing frequency or amplitude.</s><s>The duration of the stimulus between the on and offset phases was 700 ms.</s><s>A set of the vibration stimuli were employed that scaled logarithmically between 18 nm to 45 µm.</s><s>For the 10 Hz and 125 Hz vibration test, the starting amplitude was set to 7.18 µm and 2.84, respectively.</s><s>A monitor was employed to indicate the time interval at which the stimulus is presented, and a hand-held control (response box) allowed the subject to choose the interval at which a stimulus was perceived.</s><s>The stimulating probe was made of a flat circular smoothed edge thermoplastic material attached to a screw head that is tightened directly to the moving part of piezoelectric actuator.</s><s>The probe had a diameter of 8.21mm.</s><s>The Piezo actuator with the probe is mounted on a balanced brass bar (weight 15.5 kg) that assures a resting force of 30 grams applied to the skin surface at the probe-skin contact.</s><s>The subjects forearm was placed on a foam cushioned surface to prevent stray vibration.</s><s>We used medical dough under the finger to ensure proper contact between the probe and the skin.</s><s>The stimulating probe was placed on the small finger of the dominant hand just below the nail bed.</s><s>The test protocol was delivered with a program scripted in LabChart software (Labchart 7, ADInstruments, USA) that implements the two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) technique in the down/up staircase paradigm to estimate vibration detection threshold.</s><s>A vibration stimulus was randomly presented only once during one of the two intervals, indicated visually to the subjects as "1" and "2" on a screen.</s><s>After each trial the subject indicates with a button press whether the vibration was applied during the first or second test interval.</s><s>The experimental session consisted of a series of trials at stimulus strengths that were chosen based on the transformed down-up staircase method.</s><s>The experimental block ended after 8 reversal points were completed.</s><s>The threshold is determined by calculating the median of the stimulus intensity of the last 6 reversals.</s><s>This adaptive two-interval forced-choice procedure was used to obtain estimates of the detection threshold defined as the stimulus intensity at which the proportion of correct responses is 75%.</s><s>Subject data was excluded from the results if performance inconsistencies occurred such as change in reversal point values higher than 4 amplitude levels.</s></p><p><s>Tactile Acuity Test.</s><s>Tactile acuity is determined with a two-alternative forced choice grating orientation test using the Tactile Acuity Cube (TAC) (MyNeurolab.com/Leica</s><s>Microsystems) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> .</s><s>The 6 sides of the cube each contained a grating (bar and groove) whose widths are 0.75, 1.25, 1.75, 3.0, 4.5, and 6.0 mm.</s><s>During the experiment the test subjects were blind-folded using shielded eyeglasses.</s><s>The dominant hand is placed on a table with the palmar surface facing up.</s><s>Starting with the widest width, the gratings of the Tactile Acuity Cube are applied in each trial for 2 s to the finger pad in one of the two orthogonal directions relative to the long axis of the finger (longitudinal or transverse), in a way that the cube exerts its whole weight on the finger (233 g).</s><s>The subject indicated the perceived orientation of the alignment.</s><s>The orientation of the cube was randomly selected by the experimenter.</s><s>An adaptive method is used: a simple two-down (narrower grating when the subject answers correctly) and one-up (wider gratings when the subject answers incorrectly) procedure or algorithm is employed which converges to 71% correct response (the point at which the subject reliably perceives groove width).</s><s>The test concluded after thirteen reversal points (perceptual deflection points) were determined and the median of the last 10 were taken as threshold.</s><s>Thresholds were determined for the little finger and the index finger and the mean of the two values taken as tactile acuity.</s></p><p><s>Mechanical detection threshold.</s><s>Mechanical detection threshold was determined with a standardized set of 23 von Frey filaments (Optihair3-Set, Marstock Nervetest, Germany) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>The filaments had uniform size and shape (round, diameter 0.5mm) and exerted discrete forces between 0.25-256 mN.</s><s>The psychophysical method was a simple staircase algorithm (1 up and 1 down rule) that was completed after 5 reversals (change in tactile sensation).</s><s>With the subject blindfolded with shielded glasses, the von Frey filaments were applied in an ascending order on the dorsal aspect of the hand for 1 second until the subject perceived a tactile sensation.</s><s>The order was then reversed (descending) until the point where the subject did not perceive a tactile sensation.</s><s>The threshold was calculated as the geometric mean force of the 5 reversals.</s></p></div>
