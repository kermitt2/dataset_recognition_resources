stratified enrollment into DU history and no DU history groups.</s><s>Potential risk factors for the development of DUs were evaluated in the DU history group.</s><s>The no DU history group was included for exploratory purposes only, as the incidence of new DUs was expected to be low.</s><s>Enrollment occurred over a 1-year period to minimize seasonal effects.</s><s>Patients were monitored from the time of enrollment until the occurrence of a new DU or a maximum of 6 months, whichever came first.</s><s>At enrollment, patients were provided with an educational leaflet on the identification of DUs, and staff at each center telephoned patients monthly to inquire about the occurrence of new DUs.</s><s>If a DU was reported, a patient visit was organized so that the physician could confirm or exclude the presence of a DU.</s></p><p><s>Data management was performed centrally, and data quality was rigorously monitored.</s><s>Consistency of the source data with the clinical database was verified for critical variables for 3 randomly selected patients per site (or fewer, if fewer patients had been enrolled).</s><s>Data were reviewed regularly.</s></p><p><s>The CAP study was led by an independent steering committee (see the Supplementary Materials, available on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.</s><s>com/doi/10.1002/art.39718/abstract).</s><s>The complete list of CAP study investigators is also given in the Supplementary Materials.</s><s>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, followed the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice of the International Conference on Harmonisation, and was approved by the local institutional review boards and ethics committees.</s><s>All patients provided written informed consent.</s></p><p><s>Study population.</s><s>Fifty-nine SSc centers in 14 countries (12 European countries and Turkey and Israel) participated in the study between January 31, 2011 and July 26, 2012.</s><s>Patients ages $18 years with a diagnosis of SSc according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> and/or the LeRoy and Medsger (14) criteria were eligible for inclusion.</s><s>The inclusion criteria were broad to permit generalizability to a wider SSc population.</s><s>To enrich for the occurrence of new DUs in the study population, the patients had to meet 1 of the following 2 criteria: 1) a history of DUs or a DU at enrollment (DU history group), or 2) a disease duration of #2 years (no DU history group), defined as the time since the first physician-documented non-Raynaud's phenomenon clinical feature of SSc <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As the study was conducted to allow for extrapolation of the results to the real-world setting, patients were permitted to continue their ongoing treatments.</s><s>Patients unable to undergo NVC assessment were not eligible for study inclusion.</s><s>Patients with SSc sine scleroderma were excluded as they were not expected to develop DUs frequently during the 6-month observation period.</s><s>Furthermore, patients who had undergone stem cell transplantation or had participated in an interventional clinical trial within 3 months prior

main analytical method for examining the associations and discriminatory ability of potential risk factors for the occurrence of new DUs, including linear and quadratic functional relationships.</s><s>The strength of association between a risk factor and new DU outcome was given by the odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (95% CI); statistical significance was given via Wald's chi-square test.</s><s>Model calibration in the multivariable logistic regression (MLR) analysis was assessed via the Hosmer-Lemeshow chi-square test.</s><s>The discriminatory performance of the various risk factors (individually and combined) was given by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) and its corresponding 95% CI.</s></p><p><s>The statistical strategy for selecting the best-performing risk factors for the final MLR model was a stagewise process in 3 broad stages using "bundles" of covariables <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref

within-bundle analysis, and stage 3 is MLR across-bundles analysis.</s><s>The number of covariables was reduced at each stage, and the best-performing covariables from the bundles were carried forward to the next stage.</s></p><p><s>The non-NVC covariables with similar characteristics (according to the domains on the case report forms) were organized into 4 bundles: bundle 1 for demographics, bundle 2 for SSc clinical characteristics, bundle 3 for DU characteristics, and bundle 4 for other clinical characteristics.</s><s>Six sub-bundles of NVC covariables (bundles 5.1-5.6)</s><s>were derived in various ways from the 6 assessed covariables for the 4 fingers on each hand.</s><s>The NVC subbundles were organized on 3 levels for building competing MLR models: the patient, hand, and finger levels (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s><s>The 1 NVC pattern qualitative covariable was used in an alternative final model as a surrogate for the NVC quantitative covariables.</s><s>Bundle 6 was formed for statistical investigation of interactions between covariables, which were prespecified by The pattern of medication use (by class) varied from one country to another, and patients took a wide range of combinations from the different medication classes.</s><s>An analysis showed that medication use within 3 months prior to and at enrollment was associated with DU disease severity prior to and at enrollment (number of DUs, by Cochran-Armitage trend test, and previous hospitalizations due to DUs, by chi-square test) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, DU disease severity and medication use were collinear, meaning that one could be predicted from the other with reasonable accuracy.</s><s>Therefore, due to the collinearity in the multivariable regression and the complexity of medication use patterns across the countries, it was decided to not include medication use as a potential risk factor, but to instead include DU disease severity in the model-building process.</s></p><p><s>Statistical criteria for selecting good-performing covariables via forward stepwise selection (FSS) at the ULR stage were the Wald's chi-square test statistic, P , 0.15 for linear terms, or P , 0.05 for quadratic terms.</s><s>Categorical variables with a frequency of ,20 patients were not moved forward from ULR to MLR (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">9</ref>, available online at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39718/abstract).</s><s>In addition to FSS, the nominal group technique was used by the steering committee to exclude some covariables based on lack of clinical plausibility and/or feasibility, with particular regard to use in standard practice (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">10</ref>).</s><s>Statistical criteria for selecting covariables via FSS during MLR stage 2 (within-bundle) analysis were to enter if P , 0.15 and retain if P , 0.10.</s><s>At MLR stage 3 (across-bundles) analysis, statistical criteria for selecting covariables via FSS were to enter if P , 0.15 and retain if P , 0.05.</s><s>The reduction of covariables at each of the 3 stages resulted in the final MLR model.</s></p><p><s>Modeling within each of the NVC sub-bundles resulted in 6 competing MLR models.</s><s>In order to retain only 1 type of NVC assessment in the final model from among the several assessment options for the NVC (qualitative or quantitative [on the patient, hand, and finger levels]), it was decided to carry forward the sub-bundle with the highest ROC AUC into the across-bundles stage.</s></p><p><s>Model validation.</s><s>Internal validation of the final MLR model was performed through the bootstrap method (35), with 2,000 re-samples using the same model-building and covariable selection procedures as for the final model.</s></p><p><s>SAS software, version 9.1.3,</s><s>was used for the statistical analysis and the

critical digital ischemia at enrollment.</s><s>Thus, a patient with 5 capillaries/mm in the middle finger of the dominant hand, plus 2 DUs at enrollment, plus critical digital ischemia at enrollment has a 59% probability of developing new DUs within 6 months.</s><s>eventual disease-modifying characteristics of treatment on the clinical complications of SSc such as DUs <ref type="bibr"

was the strongest risk factor (ROC AUC 0.678), followed by the number of capillaries/mm in the middle finger of the dominant hand (ROC AUC 0.614), and then the presence of critical digital ischemia at enrollment (ROC AUC 0.556).</s><s>The combination of the 3 variables in the final MLR model improved the model's discriminatory ability (ROC AUC 0.738).</s><s>Furthermore, the relative weights of the Wald's chi-square values for the 3 variables (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>) demonstrated that both the number of capillaries/ mm in the middle finger of the dominant hand (NVC variable) and critical digital ischemia at enrollment make important additional contributions to the number of DUs for determining the risk of new DUs in the final MLR model.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, whereas a 50% incidence of new DUs in the DU history group had been assumed in the sample size estimation of our study, in reality, there was only a 22% incidence.</s><s>The lower-than-expected incidence of new DUs may be the result of patients already receiving best practice standard of care for the management of their disease at enrollment.</s><s>Medication use was not restricted, varied between countries, and was found to be associated with DU disease severity, which is consistent with findings from the Digital Ulcer Outcome Registry showing that patients with chronic and/or recurrent DUs have a shorter time to new DUs as compared with patients with no or episodic DUs <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, medication use was not considered to be an independent variable and was not included as a potential risk factor for new DUs.</s></p><p><s>Because the no DU history subgroup was considered exploratory, it was not possible to identify variables that predicted DUs because of the small number of cases in this subgroup.</s><s>We had anticipated at least 20% of cases, based on the report that 50% of patients with SSc experience DUs (1) and the fact that the first DU usually occurs early in the disease course (3); however, we observed only 4.1% of cases of new DUs in this subgroup.</s><s>This may have 2 explanations.</s><s>First, the SSc population may have changed in the last few years: patients with SSc may be diagnosed earlier than in the past, and preventive and efficient measures are now more widely used.</s><s>Second, it might have been beneficial to restrict patients in the no DU history group to those with a first non-Raynaud's phenomenon symptom within 1 year (instead of 2 years) in order to be closer to the population described by Hachulla et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, in which 43% of patients had their first DU within 1 year of their first clinical sign of SSc.</s></p><p><s>NVC has the potential to be a useful tool for monitoring the progression of microvascular disease associated with SSc and for measuring the response to treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53)</ref>.</s><s>It is a well-established, noninvasive technique that allows for higher-magnification analysis compared with the older widefield capillaroscopic method <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54)</ref>.</s><s>The training needed for the device is minimal (;5 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>) and the required examination time is short (;10 minutes including image recording).</s><s>An NVC apparatus is more costly than handheld devices such as dermatoscopes, but NVC has been shown to permit more-detailed assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(56)</ref> and the grading of more images <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>.</s><s>During patient follow-up, detailed assessment and quantification of abnormalities is important, and therefore, handheld tools may not be as useful in this setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>.</s><s>Of note, capillaroscopy has been recently introduced as a criterion in the ACR/EULAR classification criteria for SSc <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>, thereby increasing their sensitivity and specificity.</s></p><p><s>Overall, there are several key strengths of this study.</s><s>First is its generalizability, ensured by the broad distribution of participating centers and patients representing current standard of care.</s><s>Second is its applicability in real-world clinical practice, owing to the broad study population, the simplicity and ease of clinical evaluation of the NVC, and the clinical risk factors that built the final model.</s><s>Third is its value in the management of patients with a history or presence of DUs.</s><s>The scope of the CAP study was to determine risk factors for developing DUs by using NVC and other clinical characteristics in routine clinical practice and health care environments, including centers with different levels of NVC experience.</s><s>Thus, the "center" was not regarded as a potential risk factor, which could allow generalizability of the study findings for patients with SSc outside of the study centers.</s><s>The interrater variability of NVC assessments has been of concern, and the capillary density has been identified as the NVC variable with the best interrater agreement in earlier, smaller studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57)</ref>.</s><s>In the CAP study, interrater variability was addressed by practical training and teaching booklets that were offered to the investigators.</s><s>Despite these efforts, the ambitious intention to allow extrapolation to the real-world setting may have introduced a large amount of noise that was detrimental to obtaining a final model with high discriminatory ability.</s></p><p><s>Limitations of this study include the fact that the diagnosis of DUs and critical digital ischemia is not always unequivocal <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">59)</ref>, although definitions were provided in the protocol and/or the case report form.</s><s>Investigators were not blinded to the NVC and other clinical characteristics assessed at enrollment and may therefore have been biased in favor of a diagnosis of a new DU.</s><s>However, this was inherent to the real-world nature of the study, as physicians in clinical practice are not blinded to the results of other assessments.</s></p><p><s>Although the wide geographic spread of centers permits generalizability, it was conducive to introducing heterogeneity in the data.</s><s>The center effect could not be explored in depth because of the wide distribution of patients across a large number of centers, with a small number of cases per center.</s><s>Although it was estimated that 150 cases would be a reasonable number for exploring risk factor associations with the development of DUs, only 103 cases were observed in this cohort and, as such, the study was underpowered.</s><s>Nevertheless, the modeling strategy (ULR, MLR within-bundle, MLR across-bundles analyses), together with the reduction in the number of variables entered into the model and the bootstrap validation demonstrated the robustness of the variables in the final model, thereby compensating for the lower-than-prespecified number of cases.</s></p><p><s>Laboratory biomarkers were not included in this study, which could have helped to improve the discriminatory ability of the final model.</s><s>Biomarkers have previously been shown to be useful for predicting DUs <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref> and may be useful to include in future studies.</s><s>Given the nature of this real-world observational study, it was not feasible to determine the presence of an association between medication use and development of DUs.</s><s>Future larger studies could be designed to explore this association by controlling for confounding factors such as DU disease severity and the use of medications (individually and in combination) in different countries.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this longitudinal, multicenter study of almost 500 patients with SSc has shown that the mean number of capillaries/mm on the middle finger of the dominant hand, the number of DUs at enrollment, and the presence of critical digital ischemia at enrollment are risk factors for the development of new DUs.</s><s>The risk factors identified are simple to evaluate in the clinic, and the real-world nature of the study allows the results to be generalized to a wider SSc population, thereby providing the physician with useful information when considering a patient's risk of future DUs.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Flow
