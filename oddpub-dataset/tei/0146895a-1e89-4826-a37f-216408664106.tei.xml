<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and design</head><p><s>This study utilized a cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design using a survey method.</s><s>A sample of 200 older adults with cancer was recruited from two medical oncology practices and one radiation oncology practice in the northeastern United States.</s></p><p><s>With the permission of the practices, flyers advertising the study were developed by the investigator and placed in waiting rooms and examination rooms.</s><s>Interested patients were directed to contact any nurse in the practice.</s><s>If patients who met the inclusion criteria were identified by nurses, a survey packet was offered to them.</s><s>Once completed, the survey packet was returned to the nurse and the patient received a $10 gift card.</s></p><p><s>The criteria for inclusion in this study were as follows: being 65 years of age or older, English-speaking, having the ability to read English at an eighth-grade level, having a current cancer diagnosis, and receiving cancer treatment.</s><s>A power analysis was conducted to determine the appropriate sample size to conduct correlational statistics and regression analysis.</s><s>Using the effect size as a guideline, a sample size range of 193 (d = 0.40) to 346 (d = 0.30) was calculated.</s><s>Thus, a sample size of 193 was needed to achieve the power of 0.80 using a two-tailed test of significance at 0.05.</s><s>The DCS was developed to elicit "healthcare consumers' uncertainty in making a health-related decision, the factors contributing to the uncertainty, and health-care consumers' perceived effective decision-making." <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref></s><s>There are four versions of the DCS; however, the traditional DCS was used in this study because it has been used in &gt;30 studies and sufficient psychometric data exist. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref></s><s>The traditional DCS is a 16-item instrument that consists of five subscales: informed (items 1-3); values clarity (items 4-6); support (items 7-9); uncertainty (items 10-12); and effective decision (items 13-16).</s><s>Items in each subscale are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = strongly agree, 1 = agree, 2 = neither agree nor disagree, 3 = disagree, and 5 = strongly disagree).</s><s>DCS scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high-decisional conflict).</s><s>According to O'Connor, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> investigators using the DCS should "set the stage" for participants by asking them to focus on their opinions regarding a treatment decision specific to the area of inquiry.</s><s>To this end, the investigator developed an opening paragraph to the DCS that focused respondents to cancer treatment-related decisions, an open-ended question to determine the decision that was made, and a multiple choice question to determine when the decision was made.</s><s>The paragraph and questions were pilot-tested with a sample (n = 10) that met the inclusion criteria for the current study.</s><s>Minor logistical revisions were made based on the pilot study.</s><s>In this study, reliability analyses indicated acceptable reliability with Cronbach's α &gt; 0.70 for the DCS total score and each of the subscales.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</s><s>Initially, a series of descriptive statistics were conducted on the demographic data and on the dependent variable, decisional conflict, and independent variables, quality of life, and comorbidity.</s><s>Next, a series of correlations were conducted to determine the relationship between the variables.</s><s>Histograms as well as additional descriptive analyses conducted indicated that these measures were not normally distributed; therefore, the assumptions of parametric testing were not met.</s><s>Thus, Spearman's rho (r s ), the nonparametric equivalent of Pearson's r, was used for the correlational analyses.</s><s>Scatterplots were used to test for the assumptions of multiple regression.</s><s>Since the scatterplots revealed linearity, multivariate normality, homoscedasticity, and no multicollinearity, multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine whether the predictors of quality of life and comorbidity significantly impact decisional conflict.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Descriptive analysis revealed there was no decisional conflict in this sample.</s><s>A DCS score &lt;25 indicates no decision-making difficulty. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref></s><s>The mean DCS total score of 22.1 in this study demonstrated that, overall, the participants in this study did not have difficulty with decision making.</s><s>Participants demonstrated a higher level of decisional conflict in DCS subscale four which evaluates how informed one is "about options, risks, and benefits, and feeling clear about values and value tradeoffs in the decision." <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref></s><s>A higher score in this subscale indicates that doctor, family, and cancer

type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref></s><s>ne of the aims of this study was to examine the relationship between and among decisional conflict, quality of life, and comorbidity.</s><s>Correlational analysis indicated that decisional conflict was significantly correlated with quality life.</s><s>The weak, though positive and significant, the correlation between decisional conflict and quality of life indicates that greater treatment-related decisional conflict may be associated with greater quality of life.</s><s>A study <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> found that older adults with cancer chose their treatment decisions depending on the burden of the treatment, possible outcomes, and likelihood of adverse functional and cognitive outcomes.</s><s>However, to date, there have been no published reports of the relationship between decisional conflict and quality of life.</s><s>Additional studies are needed to validate the findings in this study.</s></p><p><s>The correlational analysis also indicated that quality of life was significantly correlated with comorbidity.</s><s>The weak to moderate, though positive, correlation indicates that greater quality of life may be associated with greater comorbidity.</s><s>This result must be interpreted cautiously since the SCQ was not found to have an acceptable level of reliability and thus, a Type I error may have occurred.</s><s>Finally, decisional conflict and comorbidity were not found to be significantly correlated.</s><s>However, due to the low level of reliability of the SCQ, this result must also be interpreted cautiously because a Type II error may have occurred.</s></p><p><s>The other aim of this study was to determine the degree to which quality of life and comorbidity predict decisional conflict.</s><s>The results of the regression analysis of this data indicate that higher/healthier emotional function may be predictive of lower decisional conflict.</s><s>Previous studies have documented a relationship between decisional conflict and emotional status, with mixed results.</s><s>In a study of hospital patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> the investigators found that a decrease in decisional conflict leads to less fretting and nervousness.</s><s>Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> found a similar relationship to the present study with a negative predictive relationship between anxiety and DCS.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, of those physical symptoms that achieved significance, a negative relationship was found.</s><s>The symptom of diarrhea (EORTC QLQ-C30) was significant in five of the six regression models, with the exception of the informed subscale.</s><s>Other symptoms that were found to be significant included insomnia (values clarity subscale), fatigue (support subscale), and nausea/vomiting (effective decision subscale).</s><s>This is a curious finding, as it would seem that worse physical symptoms, especially if they were treatment-related, may increase decisional conflict.</s><s>Although an explanation for this finding is unclear, it may be that participants felt that the symptoms are expected with cancer treatment and thus, did not increase conflict in the decision-making process.</s><s>Alternatively, if the symptoms are cancer-related, participants may have felt that the treatment was helping them Financial problems, reported as a component of the EORTC QLQ-C30, were found to be predictive of higher DCS total, informed subscale, and uncertainty subscale.</s><s>Lack of insurance and having a poor financial status are important contextual factors that can influence treatment choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref></s><s>In this study, &gt;87% identified as "retired" or "disabled."</s><s>Although financial information and insurance status were not collected in this study, it is reasonable to suspect that this majority would have some financial challenges or limitations being on a fixed income.</s><s>In addition to decisional conflict and quality of life, components of the DIF were included in the regression analysis.</s><s>The presence of spiritual support has been shown to impact treatment-related decisions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref></s><s>In this study, the use of a spiritual support person for decision making significantly decreased scores in the informed and effective decision subscales.</s><s>There are no published studies examining the relationship between spiritual support and decisional conflict; however, the results of this study are suggestive of spiritual support lowering some components of decisional conflict.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>There are several limitations that impact the generalizability of the findings of this study.</s><s>It is important    to recognize that these data are reflective of a group of predominantly white cancer patients from a suburban area and are not representative of the nation.</s><s>Therefore, the results of this study may not be generalizable to individuals with different demographic characteristics.</s><s>All of the data utilized in this study was self-reported, which could impact the accuracy of the data.</s><s>Although study participation was voluntary and anonymous, it is possible that not all participants were comfortable exploring some of the psychosocial or emotional components of the surveys.</s><s>Since most of the participants reported that they do not go to their appointments alone, the surveys may have been completed in the presence of someone else.</s><s>This may have affected their responses.</s><s>Furthermore, about comorbidity, it is possible that the SCQ was not the best instrument to use in this population given the low Cronbach's alpha.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future research</head><p><s>Research that focuses on older adults with cancer is limited in the literature.</s><s>This was the first study to examine the variables of decisional conflict, quality of life, and comorbidity in older adults.</s><s>Future research should focus on the additional investigation of these variables, particularly with a diverse sample, and to further validate these study results.</s><s>Since decisional conflict can diminish over time, it would be helpful to repeat this study with patients who are currently in the process of making a treatment-related decision and possibly, prospectively follow them over a period.</s><s>In light of the results of the regression analyses, further research is indicated about emotional function, spiritual support, and symptom management in the setting of decision making in older adults with cancer.</s></p></div>
