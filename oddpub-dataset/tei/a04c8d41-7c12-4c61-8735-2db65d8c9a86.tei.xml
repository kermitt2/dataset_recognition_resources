arms slightly bend and away from the body; hands making a fist with thumbs showing forward; and head positioned compliant with the Frankfort horizontal plane (StdScan), 2. relaxed position: legs hip-wide apart, arms hanging relaxed without contact to the body, hands making a fist, head aligned in Frankfort horizontal plane (RlxScan), and 3. relaxed position after maximum expiration (ExhScan).</s><s>Except for the ExhScan, participants were asked to breathe normally during the scan procedure.</s><s>All scan images were immediately visually checked by the study personnel.</s><s>A scan was repeated if the scan quality did not reach pre-defined standards, e.g. with regard to image artifacts, deficient resolution, or if the posture was not correct.</s><s>The scan measurement series was cancelled in case the quality remained insufficient after three repeated attempts in the same individual.</s><s>The 3DPS was calibrated prior to the first examination of each day with a cylinder tube of defined height and width provided by the manufacturer.</s></p><p><s>The assessment of BV by ADP was performed with a BOD POD 1 (model number: BOD POD 2007A, COSMED USA, Inc., Concord, USA), which shows high short-term reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and followed the instructions given by the manufacturer's software (version 5.4.1).</s><s>Hence, the BOD POD 1 was calibrated each day with a 50 l calibration cylinder, allowing for a maximum standard deviation (SD) of 50 ml in a series of five volume measurements.</s><s>Body weight was measured with an integrated electronic scale (precision: ±10 g, maximum weight: 250 kg) connected to the BOD POD 1 , which was calibrated every 14 days with two pre-specified 10 kg weights.</s><s>Body height was taken from the above described stadiometer measurement.</s><s>Directly before each measurement, an obligate 2-step calibration was carried out: first, the volume of the chamber was measured without participant inside and then again with the 50 l calibration cylinder placed inside.</s><s>After the participant entered the chamber, two measurements of raw BV were executed.</s><s>If these two measurements differed by 150 ml or 0.2% of BV, a third measurement was performed and the two closest measurements within these agreement criteria were averaged.</s><s>The estimate of raw BV was adjusted for thoracic gas volume (TGV) predicted from gender, age, and height by the software (8) and a body surface area artifact, which arises due to the apparent negative volume of air under isothermal conditions related to the skin surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Using the corrected BV (BV corr ), body density was calculated as:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Body</formula><p><s>All calculations were automatically executed by the BOD POD 1 software.</s><s>The 3DPS derived BV was corrected for TGV for the StdScan and RlxScan, and residual volume (VR) for the ExhScan, respectively.</s><s>TGV was calculated according to the following equations by Brozek et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and Crapo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> based on functional residual capacity (FRC) and tidal volume (VT).</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">TGV ¼ FRC þ 0:5 Â VT<label>ð4Þ</label></formula><p><s>Men :</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_3">FRC ¼ 0:0472 Â height þ 0:0090 Â age À 5:290;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The aim of our study was to investigate validity and longer-term reliability of 3DPS based BV and %BF over an approximately four weeks period for an application in epidemiological studies in the general adult population.</s><s>Our study evaluating the validity of BV and %BF measurements from 3DPS in comparison to measurements of APD showed a strong correlation of the results from both methods, although our data also indicated that measurements derived by 3DPS were on average higher than those derived by ADP.</s><s>Further, we found high reliability in the measurement of BV and %BF using 3DPS over a period of four weeks.</s><s>Of the three 3DPS scans that we used, the scan in relaxed position showed the strongest agreement to ADP.</s><s>The measurement differences in BV found in our study are somewhat similar to what was found in other validation studies for other 3DPS scanners using ADP or underwater weighing (UWW) as reference methods.</s><s>A study from Wells et al. with 22 adults using a Hamamatsu Bodyline Scanner reported an underestimation of 0.3 ± 2.7 L against ADP and overestimation of 0.5 ± 2.4 L for UWW, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, Wang et al. revealed an overestimation of 0.5 ± 0.1 L compared with UWW for an updated version of the Hamamatsu scanner in adult men and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, whereas Pepper et al. found a mean difference of 0.2 L in middle-aged women using a rotary laser scanning system developed by their research group <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, analyses from Ng et al. with a Fit3D Proscanner resulted in a 4.2 L (95% CI: −5.13; −3.17) smaller BV measured by 3DPS compared to ADP <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Differences in the BV measurement agreement between 3DPS and ADP among the different studies may have several reasons.</s><s>First, various body surface scanner models from different manufacturers were employed in these studies, which vary regarding point density, scan time, the number of cameras and laser used, and hardware components.</s><s>Further, the scanning procedure proposed by the manufacturer differed between studies.</s><s>Additionally, the scanner software is proprietary to the manufacturers and it remains unclear how the algorithm of a specific scanner model calculates BV from the point cloud.</s><s>Further, varying study populations could have contributed to differences in the measurement agreement reported in the studies.</s><s>Finally, different approaches for the adjustment of BV based on 3DPS scans for lung volume were used.</s><s>Lung volume was either predicted from weight and height similarly to our approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, was measured by spirometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, or no adjustment was made <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our results are not in accordance with the study of Wang et al., which used spirometry to directly measure residual volume and subsequently correct a scan after maximum expiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, since we found the highest discrepancy from ADP for the scan after maximum expiration corrected for predicted residual volume.</s><s>However, spirometry measurements probably give more valid estimates than the equation used in our analysis.</s><s>Moreover, in spirometry, the participants are instructed to breathe out as much as possible necessarily with some effort.</s><s>However, this was not practical during the 3DPS examination, since it would have influenced the posture of the participants.</s><s>Therefore some expiratory reserve volume was probably retained in the lungs and accounted, in part, for the high discrepancy of the 3DPS exhaled scan compared to ADP, if only the FRC was deducted from 3DPS.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, the calculation rather than measurement of TGV (or residual volume) could have resulted in discrepancies from actual TGV values on an individual level, for which we could not account for.</s><s>Though this similarly affected both ADP and 3DPS, the ongoing approaches to adjust for TGV differed between methods, e.g.</s><s>ADP BV was adjusted for 40% of TGV, whereas it was completely deducted from 3DPS BV.</s></p><p><s>The 3DPS does not follow the standardized WHO measurement protocol for assessment of height.</s><s>In this regard, we previously showed that the VitusSmart XXL 3DPS overestimates body height by on average 0.9 cm compared to manual measurements on basis of standardized WHO guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>However, this is unlikely to account for the differences in the measurement of BV between 3DPS and ADP since we used manual height measurements following the WHO protocol to calculate TGV in our analyses.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, other factors independent of the scanner's ability to validly estimate BV could have contributed to the overestimation of BV. 3DPS visually scans the body surface and thus, any body-enlarging object, like clothing and hair, amplifies BV.</s><s>Even though this influence was minimized by wearing tight-fitting underwear and a bathing cap, it could not be completely eliminated, e.g. if the participant had a large hair volume, a beard, thick body hair, or padded underwear.</s><s>In addition, participants may have had the tendency to hold their breath or breathe flatly during the scanning procedure in order to not blur the picture, which could have led to a higher air volume in their lungs.</s></p><p><s>While we observed an acceptable difference between 3DPS and ADP for BV, the agreement between methods found for %BF was lower.</s><s>A non-zero intercept and non-identity slope in the Bland Altman plots reflected the estimation of %BF on the basis of 3DPS BV to yield higher values than estimation based on ADP.</s><s>Similar graphical findings were also reported in a study by Wang et al. using underwater weighing as comparison method to evaluate validity of 3DPS based BV and %BF <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Bearing in mind that the regression lines of BV and %BF are independent from each other, these differences may mainly be due to the fact that there is no linear association between BV and %BF.</s><s>This is attributable to the formulas used to derive %BF from BV <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, which include body density as ratio of body mass to BV, with BV being indirectly assessed using 3DPS or ADP in our study (Eqs 2 and 3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>As a consequence, small deviations in BV between 3DPS and ADP might result in proportionally pronounced deviations in %BF.</s><s>This sensitivity of Siri's and Brozek's formula to small differences in BV estimation is well known <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, we found a mean BV difference of 1.1 L for the StdScan to result in a 7.0% higher mean %BF.</s><s>Wells et al. found differences in %BF between 3DPS and ADP of -2.6 ± 21.4% using a Hamamatsu Bodyline scanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and Wang et al. found differences in %BF of 0.7 ± 1.0% when another Hamamatsu scanner was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Pepper et al. yielded a 1.4% higher %BF for 3DPS than for ADP, but a 1.9% lower estimate against dual X-ray absorptiometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>In consequence, this could lead to misclassification regarding the allocation to normal or elevated %BF.</s><s>In our study, 39% of the participants were differentially allocated to normal vs. elevated %BF on the basis of ADP and 3DPS, meaning that they had normal %BF based on ADP but elevated %BF based on 3DPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, in contrast to BV, for %BF we found a correlation between the difference and the mean of 3DPS and ADP measurements, with higher estimates based on 3DPS than for ADP observed for lower %BF, while with increasing %BF the opposite was true.</s><s>A similar dependency of the difference between methods and the mean %BF was also found by Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>This skew in the comparison might be due to the fact that for persons with a BMI of &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 (as well as for persons with BMI &gt;30.0 kg/m 2 ) Brozek's <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> instead of Siri's formula is used to derive %BF from BV <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>; using two different formulas might to some extent distort the comparability along the entire %BF spectrum.</s><s>However, the differences in %BF between 3DPS and ADP were within the limits of agreement according to the Bland Altman plots.</s></p><p><s>In respect to the reliability of the 3DPS, it should be mentioned that a single assessment of a biomarker, as has often been done in baseline examinations of large-scale epidemiological studies, may be susceptible to short-term variation and not reflect true long-term exposure.</s><s>Therefore, random measurement error generally tends to decrease correlation and regression coefficients in epidemiological studies toward 0 and bias relative risks toward 1.</s><s>However, in our analysis, the 3DPS scanner revealed an excellent reliability after a time period of four weeks.</s><s>To our knowledge, reliability over a longer-time period has not been analyzed previously; however, other studies with consecutive measurements showed very good short-term reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>These findings suggest that a single measurement of BV or %BF may be sufficient for risk assessment in epidemiological studies.</s><s>Furthermore, as a low reliability for a risk factor measurement tend to attenuate exposure-disease associations, ICCs derived from our study may also enable to deattenuate estimates of observed relative risks to approximate true relative risks in cohort studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some strengths and limitations.</s><s>ADP has been shown to be an accurate method for assessment of BV, and it is probably the method that is most often used in experimental studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>However, ADP is based on the two-compartment model of body composition estimation, and it presumes a constant density of fat free mass, which is not always appropriate, e.g. in old age or in athletes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, other methods like dual X-ray absorptiometry or magnetic resonance imaging could give more valid %BF estimates and thus might be the preferred 'gold standard' for 3DPS validation.</s><s>The sample sizes of our validity and reliability study were relatively small and did not aim to be representative of the general population; however, the distribution of characteristics of study participants was broad, and, therefore, our findings should be applicable to populations with similar characteristics.</s><s>Further, we found narrow confidence intervals for validity with most p-values being highly significant; thus, our sample sizes, although small, were adequate to produce conclusive results.</s><s>Nevertheless, validity and reliability in subjects with different phenotypes (e.g., diseased populations) need to be investigated in future studies.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study showed good agreement between 3DPS and ADP for measurement of BV and %BF, although measurements were slightly higher for 3DPS compared to ADP.</s><s>Further, we found high ICCs for BV and %BF when measured with 3DPS four weeks apart.</s><s>These data indicate good validity and excellent four-week reliability for an application of 3DPS to assess BV and %BF in an epidemiological study.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1A
