all patients were given omalizumab 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks), and (2) a follow-on 24-week double-blind phase (n 5 134; patients with a UAS7 of &lt; _6 in the final 2 consecutive weeks of the open-label period were randomized to continue omalizumab or switch to placebo).</s><s>During the double-blind period, randomized patients with investigator-assessed clinical worsening of CIU/CSU (UAS7 of at least 12 for 2 consecutive weeks) could be transitioned to open-label omalizumab treatment and continued through week 48.</s><s>Patients used the Urticaria Patient Daily Diary <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref> to record symptoms twice daily and completed the paper-based Dermatology Life Quality Index 6 at weeks 24, 36, and 48 of the double-blind period.</s><s>The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients with CIU/CSU clinical worsening (UAS7 of at least 12 for at least 2 consecutive weeks between weeks 24 and 48).</s></p><p><s>Most placebo-treated patients (60.4%) experienced CIU/CSU relapse versus 21% of omalizumab-treated patients (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref>).</s><s>A separation in time to clinical worsening between omalizumab and placebo was noted as early as 1 month and continued to increase until the end of the double-blind period (P &lt;
