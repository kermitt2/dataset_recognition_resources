<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study participants</head><p><s>Women presenting at the obstetric triage unit for PE evaluation at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) between July 2009 and June 2012 were eligible (BIDMC approval 2009P-000084).</s><s>Women provided written informed consent.</s><s>Subjects presenting before October 2010 have been reported earlier, but a different definition of adverse outcome was used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>Current analyses were limited to singleton pregnancies first evaluated at ≤ 34.0 weeks with angiogenic marker measurements, pregnancy outcomes and delivery information.</s><s>The majority of pregnancies seen at triage were first evaluated after 34.0 weeks, and these were not considered in our analyses.</s><s>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (chronic, gestational hypertension, PE and superimposed PE) were defined according to the 2002 ACOG Bulletin <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> with minor modifications as defined previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>levant findings for the woman and the fetus Clinical findings, results of physical examinations, blood pressures, standard laboratory tests and ultrasound findings within 2 weeks of the initial presentation were stored along with information from subsequent outpatient and inpatient visits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>   The finding was recorded within 14 days following the initial presentation at the triage clinic.</s><s>In practice, the intent is for women to be retested and reinterpreted every 2 weeks.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample collection and measurement of angiogenic factors</head><p><s>Residual blood samples from clinical testing were stored at 4 °C for 48 h, collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min.</s><s>Plasma was aliquoted and stored at À80 °C; these analytes are stable for 10 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>Samples had not been thawed prior to testing.</s><s>Testing for sFlt1 and PlGF on samples collected through October 2010 was performed on an automated platform (Elecys, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>Remaining samples (through June 2012) were tested on the same platform at BIDMC.</s><s>Inter-assay coefficients of variation for sFlt1 and PlGF were 2.6 to 3.0% and 2.0 to 2.4%, respectively.</s><s>Laboratory personnel were blinded to clinical information, and physicians were unaware of test results.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of three pregnancy outcome categories</head><p><s>Samples were obtained prospectively, but angiogenic factors were tested after delivery.</s><s>Thus, the women were subject to the current care standards.</s><s>A 'referent' category included all pregnancies with no adverse maternal or fetal findings (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, PE was not considered as a maternal finding.</s><s>This referent group was used to define the gestational age relationships for angiogenic factors and to define the false positive rate.</s><s>The 'severe' category contained those pregnancies with an adverse outcome for the mother, fetus or both (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), usually occurring within the next 2 weeks.</s><s>This group was used to determine the detection rate.</s><s>Our aim was to avoid arbitrary classifications that would be biased toward abnormal angiogenic factor measurements or toward a PE diagnosis.</s><s>Delivery prior to 32.0 weeks was hypothesized to be because of severe disease with accompanying complications.</s><s>Remaining pregnancies were placed in a third heterogeneous 'unclassified' category with the assumption that a PE diagnosis may have influenced delivery in our observational study.</s><s>The 2week limit on measuring outcomes reflects the intent that such testing be repeated in these pregnancies every 2 weeks until they reach 34.0 weeks' gestation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Included pregnancies were randomly assigned to a modeling or validation subset.</s><s>Within the modeling dataset, measurements from referent samples were used to derive median levels between 20 and 34 weeks' gestation.</s><s>Modeling was based on validated approaches used for prenatal Down syndrome screening. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>Assay results were converted to multiples of the median (MoM) and weight adjusted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>Data were further examined to determine whether parity, smoking or other factors might influence measurements.</s><s>Bivariate discriminant analysis was used to model the ability of angiogenic factors to differentiate severe and referent outcomes.</s><s>The discriminant function provided the likelihood of a pregnancy being in a given outcome category.</s><s>The risk of a severe outcome was calibrated using the dataset's observed risk of a severe outcome (e.g. the model's average risk equals risk in the dataset).</s><s>Risks were arbitrarily stratified into 'low' (more than a 10-fold reduction from baseline), 'high' (more than a 10-fold increase) or 'moderate' (all intervening risks) groups.</s><s>Individual risks were capped at 100-fold increase or decrease.</s><s>This preliminary model was then applied to the validation dataset and its performance compared.</s><s>If the performance was consistent in the two datasets, a final model would be produced using the entire cohort.</s></p><p><s>Approximately 15 pregnancies with severe outcomes are required for each of the independent factors considered (i.e. 30 severe outcomes in the modeling and validation datasets for sFlt-1 and PlGF), for a total of 60 cases.</s><s>Approximately 30% of our originally published cohort presented ≤34.0 weeks, and adverse outcomes occur in about 30%.</s><s>Thus, about 670 women (60/0.3/0.3)</s><s>attending a PE triage clinic would be sufficient for reliable modeling.</s><s>The entire cohort consisted of 1141 evaluated women, but this included twin pregnancies and multiple enrollments for the same woman, along with many women presenting after 34 weeks' gestation.</s><s>Thus, the entire cohort would be needed for the analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Creating the datasets</head><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows how maternal and fetal findings define three outcome categories.</s><s>The findings do not include diagnosis of PE or relate to whether the outcome might be related to angiogenic abnormality.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows that 328 of 1141 women (29%) enrolled ≤34.0 weeks of gestation and had a singleton pregnancy.</s><s>These were allocated into the modeling (N = 163) and validation (N = 165) datasets with approximately equal numbers in each of the outcome categories.</s><s>Demographic characteristics in the two datasets did not differ (Supplemental Data Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Converting to multiples of the median (MoM)</head><p><s>sFlt1 and PlGF measurements from referent pregnancies in the modeling dataset (N = 69) were used to compute medians between 20 and 34 weeks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) that were used to convert each woman's individual analyte measurements into MoM levels.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Potential covariates of angiogenic factors</head><p><s>Laboratory results expressed as MoM were examined against potential covariates (Supplemental Data Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) using regression analysis.</s><s>In referent pregnancies, maternal weight had a significant negative association with sFlt1 (p = 0.037) and PlGF (p = 0.0056) and the levels were adjusted using a fitted reciprocal weight equation.</s><s>The sFlt1/PlGF ratio was also significantly associated with maternal weight but was not adjusted.</s><s>For primiparous pregnancies, sFlt1 and the ratio tended to be higher (p = 0.16, p = 0.19, respectively), but only the ratio reached statistical significance (p = 0.017, Supplemental Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>The corresponding levels for PlGF were significantly lower (p = 0.034).</s><s>Both sFlt1 and PlGF were adjusted for parity.</s><s>Smoking and maternal age were not strongly related to any of the analyte levels, and no adjustments were made.</s></p></div>

a preliminary finding that requires confirmation.</s></p><p><s>Our study has limitations.</s><s>Data were collected from a single institution, but sufficient information was provided so our model could be applied to existing data from other high-risk cohorts.</s><s>This could provide confirmation and transferability of our results.</s><s>Because our study was observational, it was not possible to categorize all enrolled pregnancies as having a referent or severe outcome as a result of the potential impact of a PE diagnosis on delivery timing.</s><s>Our analyses did not include a direct comparison with the diagnosis of PE because of this potentially strong bias.</s><s>This may become even more of an issue with the new ACOG criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>Our model is not directly applicable to the general population, where the prior risks of PE are much lower.</s><s>Lastly, it was not possible to serially follow all of the pregnancies every 2 weeks to look at longer term results, as only a subset of women were re-enrolled later in pregnancy.</s></p><p><s>Our study models late second through early third-trimester sFlt1 and PlGF measurements reported in MoM.</s><s>In this respect, it is similar to the approach used in a large general population cohort of women at background risk for PE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref></s><s>Our model, however, provides a validated patient-specific risk rather than a positive or negative interpretation and allows providers to incorporate additional information into decisionmaking.</s><s>Enrollment for our high-risk cohort includes enrollment prior to 34 weeks, and we chose to predict severe adverse outcomes rather than the diagnosis of PE.</s><s>Although these differences in design and analyses are important, both studies find that the angiogenic factors are capable of identifying women for whom more or less intensive interventions may be warranted.</s><s>It is now time to undertake randomized trials that could avoid issues related to our unclassified category and provide for serial testing of women every 2 weeks until 34.0 weeks' gestation.</s><s>Implementation of such a model in a practice setting could provide evidence that most severe outcomes can be identified and treated and that lower rates of preterm deliveries, improvement of resource allocation and reduced costs can be achieved.</s></p></div>
