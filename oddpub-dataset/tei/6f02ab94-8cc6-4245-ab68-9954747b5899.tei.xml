<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>A cross-sectional study was conducted by administering a one-time survey (https://www.cpsp.cps.ca/uploads/surveys/</s><s>e-cigarettes-e-liquid-survey-questions.pdf) to all practicing paedia tricians participating in the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) (n=2533).</s><s>The CPSP conducts national surveillance on paediatric disorders or conditions that are high in disability, morbidity, mortality and economic cost to society, despite low frequency.</s><s>The CPSP gathers information through multi-year studies and one-time surveys.</s></p><p><s>Participants were asked about the number and injuries/symptoms of children and adolescents who had presented with e-cigarette exposure (inhalation and ingestion cases) in the previous 12 months.</s><s>In addition, information was collected on patients' age, sex, treatment setting sought, e-cigarette use and access.</s></p><p><s>Exposure was categorized into either ingestion or inhalation cases.</s><s>Questions for cases included patient age group (&lt;1 year, 1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, 15 to &lt;19 years) and sex (male, female).</s><s>Health care setting was categorized as office or outpatient clinic, hospital inpatient ward, hospital emergency department or other (specify).</s><s>Injury and/or symptom categories included nausea/vomiting, cough, throat irritation, mouth irritation, respiratory irritation, symptoms of acute nicotine toxicity (other than nausea/vomiting), burn (skin, mouth/ esophagus), decrease in pulmonary function (e.g., increased dynamic airway resistance), central nervous system depression, other (specify).</s><s>Access to the e-fluid was categorized by purchases from the Internet, from a mall kiosk/convenience store, in the home, from parents/caregivers, friends, unknown or other (specify).</s><s>Finally, respondents were asked to indicate the types of flavours most commonly reported ingested from the following: tobacco, fruit, coffee, menthol, candy, alcohol, unknown and other (specify).</s><s>Respondents were also asked to provide the frequency of reported use of e-cigarettes in inhalation cases that included: once, once per week, two to three times per week, four to seven times per week and more than seven times per week.</s></p><p><s>All data were analyzed using STATA 12.0 (StataCorp, Texas) software and aggregate descriptive data are reported.</s><s>This study did not require research ethics approval due to the aggregate and anonymous collection of data for surveillance purposes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Of the 2533 paediatricians and paediatric subspecialists in Canada, 520 surveys were received, representing a 20.5% response frequency.</s><s>Twenty per cent of respondents indicated that the topic presented in the survey was not relevant to their area of practice.</s><s>Over the previous year period, there were 220 children and adolescents under the age of 19 years, seen by paediatricians for injuries/symptoms from exposure to e-cigarettes.</s><s>Fifty per cent were seen by a general paediatrician and 50% by a paediatric subspecialist.</s><s>Of the cases seen by subspecialists, most were emergency medicine, adolescent medicine, gastroenterology or infectious disease experts.</s><s>Symptoms related to inhalation were present in 135 cases (43 unintentional, 92 intentional) and in 85 cases related to ingestion (35 unintentional, 50 intentional) (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for characteristics by ingestion and inhalation case type).</s></p><p><s>For inhalation cases, the majority of cases were reported to be male, ages 15 to 19 years.</s><s>Cases most often sought treatment for cough, nausea/vomiting, throat irritation or acute nicotine toxicity in an outpatient clinic or office.</s><s>Most inhalation cases reported e-cigarette use 2 to 3 days per week, and e-cigarettes purchases from a mall kiosk/store.</s><s>For ingestion cases, most were male, ages 1 to 4 years presenting to an emergency department with nausea/vomiting, cough or respiratory irritation.</s><s>Younger ingestion cases accessed e-fluid at home, older cases purchased it in a mall kiosk/store.</s><s>E-fluid flavours reported consumed were fruit, candy and tobacco.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The results of this survey suggest that e-cigarette products cause injury to a number of Canadian children and youth.</s><s>E-cigarettes have increased in popularity and accessibility in Canada in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>.</s><s>What remains unknown is the adverse affects of e-cigarettes among children and youth, including exposure from inhalation and ingestion of the associated products (i.e., vapour and e-fluid).</s><s>In 2009, Health Canada provided guidelines for the importation and sale of e-cigarettes and related products that contained nicotine.</s><s>What remained; however, was the ability for consumers of all ages to purchase e-cigarettes and related products, particularly over the internet, and these products have been cited to have significant variability in the actual nicotine content in the e-fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7)</ref>.</s><s>Legislation to control the sale and use of e-cigarettes at the federal level has not been passed; however, there is some regulation at the provincial and territorial level in Canada.</s><s>Provinces in Canada that have passed legislation to include e-cigarettes in the Tobacco Sale and Access Act that include restrictions on the sale or purchase of e-cigarette and e-cigarette products include Ontario ( January, 2016 -passed), British Columbia (March, 2015 -introduced), Manitoba (November, 2015 -passed), Nova Scotia (May, 2015 -passed), New Brunswick ( July, 2015 -passed), Quebec (November, 2015 -passed) and Prince Edward Island ( June, 2015 -introduced).</s><s>Provinces and territories yet to introduce provincial legislation include Saskatchewan, North west Territories, Yukon, Nunavut, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, and Alberta.</s><s>Of the provinces that have enacted legislation, all provinces except Ontario have also included legislation to include e-cigarettes in the Smoke-Free Places Act that restricts use of e-cigarettes in specified locations (e.g., bars, restaurants, hotels, etc.).</s></p><p><s>Regulation of e-cigarettes and e-fluid contents and packaging are also issues of concern in Canada.</s><s>The liquid used in e-cigarette devices is often flavoured with candy and fruit; flavouring that may be appealing to the first-time, experimental user.</s><s>In addition, the labelling for e-fluids is often colourful, which may draw the attention of younger children who are unaware of the contents of the product, placing them at risk of unintentional ingestion.</s><s>From this survey, 34 cases presented to a health care setting as a result of unintentional ingestion of e-fluids.</s><s>Unintentional ingestion of e-fluid is of serious concern as labelling is not required to meet any restrictive or legal standards in Canada <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, there is no legislation to label the actual nicotine content in e-fluids, and it has been reported that these concentrations vary widely (6,7).</s><s>Finally, there have been several reports in mainstream media of e-cigarette devices causing serious injury by exploding.</s><s>In the October 2014 report from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the USA, there were 25 separate incidents of explosion and fire involving an e-cigarette device reported in the media <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>.</s><s>In a recent review of all media sources found on local and national sites on the Internet, there have been a total of 183 reports of e-cigarette explosions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The results of this survey are consistent with the existing literature.</s><s>For both inhalation and ingestion, the majority of cases were reported to be male.</s><s>This is consistent with self-reported data from the Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey that reported males (14.5%) were significantly more likely to use e-cigarettes, compared to females (8.7%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, a recent study by <ref type="bibr">Reid et al. found</ref> Canadian male teens to have slightly higher self-reported use of e-cigarettes over females <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Data from the USA also supports higher use among males; 15% of males compared to 11.9% of females reported use of an e-cigarette in the previous 30 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29)</ref> and Forrester et al. reported 51% of cases reported to Texas poison centres were male <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>.</s><s>This is the first study in Canada to report the adverse health effects of exposure to e-cigarettes and e-fluid in children and adolescents.</s><s>Studies from the US cite similar reported injuries including cough, mouth and throat irritation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(33)</ref>; however, these studies were reported adult e-cigarette users.</s><s>One US study in children under the age of 5, reported the most commonly reported clinical effects of cases included vomiting, drowsiness and cough <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>.</s><s>US poison control centres have reported a 28-fold increase, (84 cases in 2011 to 2360 cases in 2014) in the number of calls about children ages 5 and under who had been exposed to e-fluid containing nicotine <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(34)</ref>, and an increase in the number of cases of acute nicotine toxicity from unintentional exposures to e-fluid, including one reported child death <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>E-cigarettes, recently introduced into the Canadian market are causing harm to children and adolescents.</s><s>Results of this study highlight the spectrum of injuries resulting from exposure to e-cigarettes and e-fluid.</s><s>Children and youth reported in this survey presented to paediatricians with injuries including cough, nausea/vomiting, throat and respiratory irritation or acute nicotine toxicity.</s><s>Improving education for parents and caregivers about the risk of injury that can result from exposure to e-cigarettes and e-fluid may reduce the risk.</s><s>However, more stringent legislation around the use, access, and control of sale and purchase of e-cigarettes in Canada and the USA is needed.</s><s>Policy recommendations from the Canadian Paediatric Society related to the federal Tobacco Control Act include: regulation of the marketing, packaging (including child resistant packaging on all e-fluid containers) and labelling of devices (i.e., enforcement of a maximum dose of nicotine in e-fluids together with accurate labelling; all packaging to include information of the potential and known harmful effects of use; banning advertising, sponsorship and marketing at events and activities where children and youth are involved); restriction of e-cigarette manufacturers or sellers from making positive health claims related to the use of the products; restrictions on the sale of e-cigarettes and products over the internet to identified adults with direct mailing options; and enactment of legislation, across all provinces and territories, making it illegal for children and youth (by provincial legal age determinants) to use, purchase or have any form of e-cigarette device <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(8)</ref>.</s><s>The American Association for Cancer Research, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Academy of Pediatrics have called for regulation in the USA, recommending that all levels of government regulate the sale, labelling, advertising and packaging of e-cigarette and related products <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35)</ref>.</s><s>Further investigation into the health impacts, patterns of use, access and mechanisms to reduce the risks that e-cigarettes pose to children and adolescents is needed in order to minimize injury and to provide the evidence to support provincial and federal advocacy for policy change.</s><s>Finally, Canadians should follow the progress being made by the recent introduction of Bill S-7, first read into parliament on <ref type="bibr">November 22, 2016 (36)</ref>.</s><s>This Bill proposes to amend the existing Tobacco Act and the Non-smokers Health Act to regulate vaping and vaping products under the newly renamed Act, the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(36)</ref>.</s><s>This Bill does not include all of the recommendations provided in this paper; however, it is a step in the right direction to regulate these hazardous products with respect to selling, packaging, labelling and use.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Paediatrics &amp; Child Health, 2018, 255-259 doi: 10.1093/pch/pxx204 Original Article Advance Access publication 1 March 2018</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
