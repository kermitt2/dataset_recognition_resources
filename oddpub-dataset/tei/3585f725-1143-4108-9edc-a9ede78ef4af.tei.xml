<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>In utero gene editing has the potential to prenatally treat genetic diseases that result in significant morbidity and mortality before or shortly after birth.</s><s>We assessed the viral vector-mediated delivery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPRassociated 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) or base editor 3 (BE3) in utero, seeking therapeutic modification of Pcsk9 or Hpd in wild-type mice or the murine model of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1), respectively.</s><s>We observed long-term postnatal persistence of edited cells in both models, with reduction of plasma PCSK9 and cholesterol levels following in utero Pcsk9 targeting and rescue of the lethal phenotype of HT1 following in utero Hpd targeting.</s><s>The results of this proof-of-concept work demonstrate the possibility to efficiently perform gene editing before birth, pointing to a potential new therapeutic approach for select congenital genetic disorders.</s></p><p><s>The developing fetus has several properties that would make it favorable for therapeutic gene editing.</s><s>It is immunologically immature; studies of in utero gene therapy demonstrated tolerance to the transgene product and lack of an immune response to the vector following prenatal viral vector delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>This contrasts with the development of antibody and T cellmediated responses following postnatal gene therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> .</s><s>The small fetal size allows high levels of vectors to be given per fetal weight.</s><s>Cells of multiple organs are highly proliferative and accessible for efficient vector transduction during fetal development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Finally, in utero editing offers the potential to target genes before disease onset, critical for diseases with high prenatal or perinatal morbidity and mortality.</s></p><p><s>We sought to establish the feasibility of in utero gene editing with Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) genome editing or BE3 base editing <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>We undertook standard genome editing with adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors in R26 mTmG/+ mice, which constitutively express red fluorescence in each cell until deletion of a loxP-flanked cassette switches the fluorescence to green.</s><s>We injected AAV9 encoding Cre recombinase (AAV9.Cre; positive control) or two AAV9 vectors (AAV9.SpCas9.mTmG)</s><s>encoding SpCas9 and a loxPtargeting guide RNA (gRNA) into embryonic day 16 (E16) R26 mTmG/+ fetuses via the vitelline vein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, Supplementary Video 1), providing first-pass effect to liver.</s><s>On day of life 1 (DOL1), we observed editing predominantly in liver and heart (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The ultimate objective of this work was to use BE3 for in utero base editing of hepatocytes.</s></p><p><s>BE3 can make site-specific CT or GA changes in coding sequences without double-strand DNA breaks, making it potentially safer than standard CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>The large size of SpCas9-based BE3 (~5.1 kb) preempts its delivery via AAV (capacity ~4.7 kb).</s><s>We thus turned to adenoviral (Ad) vectors for the subsequent series of proof-of-concept experiments, fully recognizing the limitations of Ad vectors for clinical translation due to adverse host immune responses that might lead to systemic toxicity including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and liver damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>We injected E16 wild-type fetuses with an Ad vector expressing GFP (Ad.GFP) via the vitelline vein and observed robust hepatocyte transduction at DOL1, with decreased levels at 3 months (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We then injected Ad vectors encoding either SpCas9 and a loxP-targeting gRNA (Ad.SpCas9.mTmG)</s><s>or Cre recombinase (Ad.Cre) into E16 R26 mTmG/+ fetuses and observed editing in various organs on DOL1, with the most robust editing seen in liver and heart (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 reduce cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease risk without serious adverse consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>Previous studies demonstrated CRISPR-Cas9mediated nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) or base editing to disrupt PCSK9 orthologs in mouse 10-13 and human hepatocytes 14 in vivo postnatally.</s><s>We evaluated if in utero base editing of murine Pcsk9 reduces postnatal plasma PCSK9 and cholesterol levels.</s><s>We used an Ad vector containing BE3 and a gRNA targeting Pcsk9 codon W159 (Ad.BE3.Pcsk9) that in a previous adult mouse study resulted in conversion to stop codons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Following injection of E16 Balb/c fetuses, Ad.BE3.Pcsk9 resulted in base editing in liver apparent on DOL1 without evidence of editing in other organs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-d</ref>).</s><s>Analysis of DNA from organs of mothers of injected fetuses showed no significant Pcsk9 editing [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>; next-generation sequencing (NGS) on-target Pcsk9 base-edited alleles: 0.06-0.14%,</s><s>N=2 mothers; negative control: 0.06-0.3%].</s></p><p><s>Assessed by Surveyor assays and NGS of the target site, the proportion of Pcsk9 base-edited alleles in livers of in utero Ad.BE3.Pcsk9-injected mice was stable at 10-15% between DOL1 and 3 months (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f,g</ref>).</s><s>The indel rate was low (~2%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>), contrasting with &gt;40% indel rates seen in previous postnatal studies using NHEJ to disrupt Pcsk9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>NGS analysis of 9 top predicted off-target sites in liver DNA from two 2-week-old Ad.BE3.Pcsk9-injected mice showed no evidence of editing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Compared with a control Ad vector, in utero Ad.BE3.Pcsk9 resulted in decreased postnatal levels of PCSK9 protein and total cholesterol at 1 and 3 months, with no differences in alanine aminotransferase levels and grossly normal liver histology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-l</ref>).</s><s>Mice treated postnatally at 5 weeks of age with Ad.BE3.Pcsk9 had substantial editing at early post-injection timepoints (5 days, 1 month) but attenuated editing at later timepoints (2 and 3 months) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2m</ref>,n).</s><s>In contrast, prenatal Ad.BE3.Pcsk9 recipients had stable editing over time, with significantly higher editing rates than postnatal recipients at 3 months despite having similar rates at 5 days (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2n</ref>).</s><s>Previous studies of gene therapy documented immune responses to both the Ad vector and the transgene product following postnatal delivery that were diminished with prenatal delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>We assessed if there was a different immune response to the Ad vector and SpCas9-based BE3 transgene product following prenatal versus postnatal Ad.BE3.Pcsk9 delivery, which might explain the difference in editing stability.</s><s>Serum anti-Ad and anti-SpCas9 antibodies were higher in postnatal compared to prenatal recipients and naïve controls at 1 and 3 months postinjection, and equal or lower in prenatal recipients compared to naïve controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2o,p</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Having demonstrated in utero base editing of Pcsk9, we next sought to target a gene for which the in utero approach would be more relevant.</s><s>HT1 results from a mutated Fah gene blocking the tyrosine catabolic pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Inhibiting the upstream HPD enzyme in this pathway with the drug NTBC prevents the accumulation of toxic metabolites and rescues the lethal liver failure (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>We sought to introduce a nonsense mutation in the Hpd gene in utero to permanently knock out gene function.</s><s>We screened 8 gRNAs in vitro and observed the most editing at codon Q352 (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>In utero base editing of Hpd in E16 wild-type fetuses with an Ad vector encoding BE3 and the Q352 gRNA (Ad.BE3.Hpd) resulted in a mean editing rate of ~15% in liver at 2 weeks of age;
