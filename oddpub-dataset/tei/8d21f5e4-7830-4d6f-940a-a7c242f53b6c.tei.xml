<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>A central question in neuroscience is how neural circuits selforganize into functional structures during development.</s><s>The wiring of compound eyes to the brain of flies provides a fascinating model system for studying this question <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Land, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Meinertzhagen, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nilsson, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the neural superposition eye, such as found in advanced flies, is characterized by a complicated wiring diagram (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): each point in visual space is captured by multiple photoreceptors from different ommatidia that converge upon the same synaptic unit (cartridge) in the brain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>); different photoreceptors within the same ommatidium view different points in visual space and project to neighboring cartridges (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Braitenberg, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Clandinin and Zipursky, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kirschfeld, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vigier, 1907a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Vigier, , 1907b))</ref>.</s><s>The correct pooling of axon terminals viewing the same point in space into a single cartridge increases sensitivity without loss of spatial resolution compared with simpler, ancestral eye types <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Braitenberg, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kirschfeld, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Nilsson, 1989)</ref>.</s><s>The developmental process underlying neural superposition is remarkable, because each individual axon, among thousands of neighboring axons in the brain, must be sorted together with those few axons that receive input from the same point in visual space.</s></p><p><s>A classic model of neural superposition is found in the Drosophila compound eye, which contains 800 ommatidia.</s><s>Each ommatidium projects a bundle of eight photoreceptor (retinula or R-cell) axons into the brain.</s><s>Six of these photoreceptors, R1-R6 (the focus of our current study) form the primary visual map in the lamina (first optic neuropil) of the fly brain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>; R1-R6 are color-coded consistently throughout the paper: R1, blue; R2, green; R3, red; R4, yellow; R5, magenta; and R6, orange).</s><s>The R1-R6 axons from one bundle that receive input from six different points in visual space are denoted A-F (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-1C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>After neural superposition is established, the R-cells have a precise organization of the six subtypes around the circumference of cartridges, that is, R1 neighbors R2, which neighbors R3, etc., referred to as ''rotational stereotypy'' (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B and  1C</ref>).</s><s>The precision of rotational stereotypy is noteworthy, as the six axon terminals in a cartridge carry the same input information and synapse with the same postsynaptic target cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Braitenberg, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Trujillo-Ceno ´z, 1965)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, rotational stereotypy is not a functional requirement for neural superposition and increases the demands placed on the sorting problem from 800 cartridges to 4,800 (800 3 6 R1-R6) precise terminal positions.</s><s>The role, development, and evolutionary origin of this wiring precision are unknown.</s></p><p><s>The neural superposition wiring diagram has a ''canonical'' pattern of six R-cell axon terminals per cartridge.</s><s>An equator from anterior to posterior divides the compound eye, as well as the wiring pattern in the lamina, into dorsal and ventral halves.</s><s>The wiring patterns in each half of the lamina are opposite to one another with respect to the equator axis (blue line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>As a consequence, six rows of ''non-canonical'' cartridges exist at the equator that contain stereotypic compositions of seven or eight R1-R6 cell axon terminals (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Horridge and Meinertzhagen, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993)</ref>.</s><s>The three different types of equator cartridges also exhibit rotational stereotypy, each with a distinct pattern <ref type="bibr">(Figure 1C)</ref>.</s><s>As in the case of canonical cartridges, the function of the rotational stereotypic arrangement of photoreceptor terminals within the equator cartridges is unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Horridge and Meinertzhagen, 1970)</ref>.</s><s>It is unclear which common developmental rules or mechanisms might robustly encode the canonical cartridges, as well as the three types of equator cartridges (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>The Drosophila visual system is an example of a genetically encoded neural circuit in which a developmental sorting step precedes and ensures synaptic specificity between input neurons and their targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hiesinger et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Many aspects of the developmental sorting step have been characterized in detail, including the formation of an initial grid by lamina cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hadjieconomou et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Previous studies have suggested the possibility of simple developmental rules underlying this sorting process <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clandinin and Zipursky, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Meinertzhagen, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, work in recent years has revealed molecular mechanistic insight into how differential adhesion of guidance receptors may play a key role in growth cone sorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen and Clandinin, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schwabe et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, no rule set or algorithm has been formulated that is sufficient to generate precise neural superposition in canonical cartridges and equator cartridges.</s><s>Two key challenges have been (1) the inability to monitor the dynamic sorting process live in devel- oping flies and (2) lack of quantitative, data-driven models to conceptualize or test our understanding of this apparently complicated process.</s></p><p><s>Here, we report live imaging of R1-R6 growth cone dynamics in intact developing pupa and the derivation of a model that summarizes our conceptual understanding of the development of neural superposition.</s><s>We propose that three simple rules are sufficient to provide a solution to the neural superposition sorting problem.</s><s>Systematic tests of these rules in a computational model reveal that the same rule set leads to precise superposition and the three types of cartridges observed at the equator.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intravital Imaging Reveals the Morphogenesis of the Lamina during Brain Development</head><p><s>In order to visualize the growth cone movements that establish neural superposition, we made use of multi-photon time-lapse microscopy to image through the eye of intact developing pupae (intravital imaging; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>This approach allowed us to visualize both large-scale tissue movements and small-scale growth cone dynamics in the developing pupa.</s><s>Importantly, our method is non-invasive, and only data from pupae that completed development normally were used throughout this study.</s></p><p><s>The lamina plexus is a temporary structure in which R1-R6 growth cones sort in a 2D, dynamically warping plane <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Labeling of all photoreceptors with a membrane-tagged CD4-tdGFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Han et al., 2011)</ref> throughout the time period of neural superposition development from 20-40 hr after puparium formation (APF) allowed the visualization of R1-R6 projections that form the lamina plexus in relation to the deeper projections of R7/8 axons (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-2D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Our intravital imaging technique enabled us to identify two major large-scale tissue movements that were, to our knowledge, previously uncharacterized (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B-2G</ref>; Movie S1).</s><s>First, we observed a 90 rotation of the entire lamina-medulla complex (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B-2D</ref>).</s><s>Second, the lamina plexus flattens in a temporal wave of shortening axons underneath the eye (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E-2G</ref>).</s><s>The 20-40 hr temporal wave alters the orientation of the lamina from a plane close to perpendicular to one that is parallel with both the eye and the medulla (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E-2G</ref>; red arrows in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).</s><s>Hence, the relative change of angles between the lamina plexus and medulla, known as ''medulla rotation,'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">White and Kankel, 1978)</ref> is the result of the progressive intercalation of the lamina plexus between the eye and medulla.</s><s>This developmental process ensures a perfect alignment of eye and lamina with minimal axon length for the transmission of graded potentials.</s><s>Our understanding of lamina plexus movements allowed us to distinguish individual growth cone dynamics from movements of the tissue in which they are embedded.</s></p><p><s>To visualize individual growth cones in the lamina plexus, we utilized a sparse labeling technique (Experimental Procedures; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Rintelen et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>At 40 hr APF, all randomly labeled growth cones fall into one of six distinct classes based on their threedimensional morphology and orientation.</s><s>Tracing axons back to their unique cell-body positions in the eye unequivocally identified each as an R1-R6 subtype (color-coded as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) .</s><s>Next, we followed each growth cone through all time points back to 25 hr APF (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2K and 2L</ref>; Movie S2).</s><s>As the warped plane of the lamina plexus unfolds, different parts change their position relative to the fixed light path during intravital imaging.</s><s>We therefore corrected clusters of 2-12 growth cones for these tissue movements (Experimental Procedures).</s><s>The resulting data provide complete 4D dynamics of identified R1-R6 growth cones throughout the process of superposition sorting in a 2D plane.</s></p><p><s>The Scaffolding Rule: Bipolar Growth Cone ''Heels'' Generate a Stable Framework for the Sorting Process During the establishment of neural superposition, 6 3 800 (4,800) growth cones leave their origination bundles and terminate in surrounding destination cartridges (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>This sorting of axons predicts the repositioning of neighboring growth cones relative to each other.</s><s>Such rearrangements of individual growth cones were inferred from previous studies on fixed preparations at timed stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Meinertzhagen and Hanson, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Trujillo-Ceno ´z and Melamed, 1973)</ref> and should be readily apparent in our intravital imaging data.</s></p><p><s>Surprisingly, we did not observe the expected rearrangements of growth cones between 25-40 hr APF, despite the emergence of polarized, extended growth cone shapes.</s><s>Four out of the six subtypes develop distinct bipolar growth cone shapes that were not previously described in fixed preparations.</s><s>After 30 hr APF, we observed distinct ''heel'' structures anchored at the original arrival points of the axons (arrowheads in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A-3F</ref>) and distinct ''front'' densities in the direction of polar extension for R1, R3, R4, and R6 (arrows in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D-3F</ref>).</s><s>A time-lapse movie of the growth cone heels revealed no rearrangements of their relative positions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A'-3F'</ref>; Movie S3).</s><s>In contrast, the growth cone fronts progressively move away from their respective heels with subtype-specific speeds and angles.</s><s>Distinct filopodial movements are clearly visible at both the heels (arrowheads) and fronts (arrows) .</s><s>Importantly, bipolarity gives the two active ends of each growth cone-the stationary heel and the extending front-the potential to execute different functions during growth cone sorting.</s></p><p><s>Fortuitously, our imaging data revealed a background grid-like pattern (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>).</s><s>None of the identified growth cone heels, but all fronts, overlap with this background pattern.</s><s>Hence, the visible pattern in the live-imaging data of sparsely labeled growth cones coincides with the growth cone fronts in the target area, while all growth cone heels are positioned around these regions.</s><s>Based on these data, we extrapolated the positions of heels and fronts for all R-cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H</ref>).</s><s>The heels occupy about half of the space in the 2D grid and provide a complementary pattern to the growth cone fronts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>The heel and target grid frame the starting and ending positions of growth cone sorting in 2D (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3J</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Extension Rule: Quantitative Analysis of Growth Cone Dynamics Reveals Synchronized Extension</head><p><s>Programs Specific for Each R1-R6 Subtype Next, we analyzed the dynamics of growth cone extension between 25 and 40 hr APF.</s><s>For each time point, and for each of the 58 growth cones, we measured the position of the (1) heel (solid circle), ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>) front (open circle), (3) tip of the longest filopodium extending away from the heel (small solid circle), and (4) tip of the longest filopodium extending away from the front (small open circle) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>; Movie S5).</s><s>Heel-front separation became apparent at distinct time points for different R1-R6 subtypes (asterisks in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>The distances between fronts and heels increase steadily during subtype-specific 5-10 hr time windows (black lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>; see also Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G-4I</ref> for traces of individual cells): R3 and R4 extend for more than 10 hr from 25 hr APF onward; R1 and R6 extend between 30 and 37 hr APF; and R2 and R5 show minimal extension between 30 and 35 hr APF.</s><s>Thus, polarized growth of a directed collateral, as previously speculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Trujillo-Ceno ´z and Melamed, 1973)</ref>, is not supported from our observations.</s></p><p><s>All six growth cone subtypes additionally exhibit angular constancy over the entire time period of their extension (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>Next, we analyzed the angles between heels and the tips of the longest front filopodia, which are unequivocal and objective points for each growth cone and time point.</s><s>The average of the longest front filopodia for all growth cones of one subtype revealed the same angular constancy and the same angles over time as those determined by manual front identification (compare Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C and 4D</ref>).</s><s>We noted that filopodia at the heel and front revealed different dynamics with characteristic filopodial exploration angles (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E and 4F</ref>) and subtypespecific lengths of exploration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to the polarized front filopodia (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>), all R1-R6 heel filopodia randomly explored angles around and away from the direction of polarity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>).</s><s>This observation further supports the notion of different functions of growth cone heels and fronts.</s></p><p><s>As shown above (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B-2G</ref>), the entire lamina plexus undergoes a progressive alignment in an anterior-to-posterior temporal wave of shortening axons that occurs between 20-40 hr APF; this is concurrent with growth cone sorting in the lamina plexus.</s><s>We sought to determine whether growth cone dynamics follow this temporal wave by analyzing growth cones in different positions along the anterior to posterior axis (i.e., in different parts of the unfolding 2D array and consequently for axon bundles of different ages).</s><s>We found that growth cones of the same subtypes at different positions along the anterior-to-posterior axis exhibit no significant differences, neither in their start time nor in their extension behavior (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G-4I</ref>).</s><s>These measurements are consistent with previous observations in fixed preparations that suggested growth cones of distinct subtypes exhibit no morphological gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hiesinger et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Schwabe et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>We conclude that the tissue movements of the lamina between 20-40 hr APF are unlikely to play an instructive role in the synchronous sorting of growth cones.</s></p><p><s>A previous study on fixed preparations proposed that the development of polarity as early as 20 hr APF precedes and predicts the direction of a separate extension phase after 32 hr APF <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Schwabe et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>However, our live imaging did not reveal separate polarization and extension phases at least for time points after 25 hr APF, but rather showed one continuous extension process.</s><s>The angles and speeds specific to each R1-R6 subtype ensure that all R-cell growth cone fronts ''meet'' in the correct target areas for neural superposition as defined by the corresponding heel scaffold.</s><s>A key aspect of this ''extension rule'' is that all growth cones of each of the six R-cell subtypes exhibit identical extension behavior across the entire lamina, including the equator region (see below).</s></p><p><s>The Stop Rule, Part 1: Growth Cone Fronts Overlap with Multiple Targets in the Scaffold How does growth cone extension stop?</s><s>We systematically considered extension stop rules ranging from stop rules that require no interactions with surrounding cells to stop rules that integrate multiple intercellular interactions.</s><s>We envision that ''no interaction'' stop rules would be either (1) ''programmed'' into cell-autonomous extension or (2) triggered by an exogenous stop signal that functions synchronously across the entire lamina plexus.</s><s>In both cases, the targeting accuracy depends fully on the precision of the scaffold and the extension angles.</s><s>Our imaging data show that the scaffold within the  unfolding lamina exhibits minor warped or bent areas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) and that the measured extension angles have SDs of around 10 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>A lack of feedback from the target area for either of the ''no interaction'' stop rules would thereby lead to inaccuracies in arrival points of growth cone fronts.</s><s>This would likely lead to high error rates for wiring and especially rotational stereotypy, which has not been observed (see discussion in section Validation at the Equator).</s><s>We therefore consider ''no interaction'' stop rules unlikely, though they remain a theoretical possibility.</s><s>In the following, we focus on interaction-based stop rules but return to a test of both types of rules in the last section.</s></p><p><s>Arguably, the simplest interactionbased stop rule would be the recognition of a target cell.</s><s>Can a target cell be robustly recognized among incorrect alternatives in the densely packed lamina plexus?</s><s>The lamina neurons (L-cells) are R1-R6's prospective synaptic targets and are also the main cells in the putative target region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Throughout the establishment of neural superposition, the L-cells are positioned in the correct target areas and surrounded by R heels (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A and  S1</ref>).</s><s>However, the extent and arrangement of L-cell processes between 20-35 hr APF also pose a potential problem for L-cells in providing restricted target cues.</s><s>At 28 hr APF, L-cell processes form a filopodial mesh that covers most of the lamina plexus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>This network of L-cell processes overlaps to a large extent with the R1-R6 growth cones.</s><s>For example, R3 growth cones overlap to different degrees with three to six L-cell clusters in potential target areas.</s><s>Importantly, the closest target areas to the R3 growth cones are incorrect (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>, black asterisks).</s></p><p><s>To quantitatively analyze the conditions under which L-cells could serve as targets, we developed a computational model.</s><s>The scaffolding rule was implemented using the measured heel grid (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3J</ref>).</s><s>The extension rule was implemented using synchronous movements of R front sensing areas (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>We defined the distance between centers of adjacent target areas as D = 1 (5.5 mm; Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C and S3</ref>).</s><s>However, the shape and area of R-cell growth cone fronts that sense potential targets could not be easily determined from the biological data.</s><s>Instead, we approximated sensing regions of R-cell fronts as discs.</s><s>Our data suggest a range of sensing radii (SR) between 0.22 and 0.5: an area defined by SR = 0.22 is contained in &gt;90% of the imaged R front areas; SR = 0.36 is contained in 60%-90% of R front areas; and SR = 0.5 (a circle with a full cartridge diameter) is contained in &gt;30% of imaged R front areas.</s></p><p><s>If minimal overlap of an R-cell front with a single target region is sufficient to stop growth cone extension, even a relatively small sensing radius would lead to incorrect targeting (black arrow in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>).</s><s>However, R3 fronts experience partial overlap in passing with even relatively small incorrect targets (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D-5F</ref>, gray circles with SR = 0.22).</s><s>(This would also be true for an elliptic R-cell front shape-either centered on or extended ahead of the growth cone front-that has a much larger SR in the direction of polarity; see blue shapes at 30 and 35 hr time points in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>).</s><s>Partial overlap is apparent in the case of a single representative growth cone over time (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>) and especially for outlines of all imaged R3 growth cones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>).</s><s>This observation suggests that partial overlap must be permissible to avoid stopping the R3 fronts prematurely.</s><s>Therefore, in our model we allowed R fronts to ignore partial overlaps with targets, up to the distance SR, during extension.</s><s>For example, the partial overlaps highlighted by the black arrow in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D, 5G</ref>, and 5J are not sufficient to arrest R3 growth cone extension, because the distance between the overlapping circumferences is less than SR = 0.22.</s><s>Hence, the model allowed us to systematically explore stop rules based on varying R-cell front sizes and overlaps with targets.</s></p><p><s>We first simulated the extension of R-cell growth cone fronts away from the heels in the scaffold with measured angles (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures).</s><s>Our simulation shows that correct sorting is possible for R-cell fronts and target sensing areas as small as SR = 0.22.</s><s>The total overlap with any target for each R-cell front with SR = 0.22 (moving at measured angles) reveals overlap of R3 with an incorrect target (arrows in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D and 5G</ref>), although the overlap is below threshold for stopping.</s><s>Note that our defined threshold covers a variety of alternative sensing possibilities.</s><s>For example, a given sensing radius with SR/2 overlap is equivalent to half that sensing radius when sensing ''on touch'' (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5L</ref>).</s><s>For an R3 front with SR = 0.36 this overlap reaches SR and causes an early, incorrect stop (arrowhead in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5H</ref>); R fronts with SR = 0.5 exhibit so much target overlap with surrounding targets that none of them move far (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5I</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we tested whether possible measurement inaccuracies caused this lack of robustness by simulating targeting with ideal (mathematically computed) angles from heel to target regions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D, 5J, and 5K</ref>).</s><s>Remarkably, the ideal model yielded almost identical results to measured data, including a failure to establish neural superposition wiring with growth cone front SRs of 0.36 and above (arrowhead in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5K</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Our analyses of a ''target only'' stop rule indicate that L-cellsor any other cue at the target area-can function as a stop signal only within substantial constraints.</s><s>Specifically, our model shows that the premature arrest of growth cone extension can be averted only if R-cell fronts use a sensing area that is either insensitive to or much smaller than the apparent morphological area covered by the growth cone front and its filopodia when it passes the incorrect targets.</s></p><p><s>The Stop Rule, Part 2: Overlaps between R1-R6 Growth Cone Fronts Can Increase the Robustness of the Stop Rule In addition to overlaps of R1-R6 fronts with multiple target areas, overlaps among the R1-R6 fronts themselves in the correct target region are already apparent around 25 hr APF (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A-6C</ref>).</s><s>This overlap increases substantially until 35 hr APF (Figures 6D-6F).</s><s>At the end of growth cone sorting, each R1-R6 front covers 50% or more of its target area, which is shared with the five other growth cone fronts needed to establish correct neural superposition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6G</ref>; arrow shows overlap of all six ''incoming'' R-cell fronts needed to establish the correct pattern of sorting).</s><s>We therefore incorporated increasing overlaps between R1-R6 fronts into the model.</s></p><p><s>We first simulated a ''combinatorial overlap + target'' stop rule, in which an R-cell growth cone front stops only if it encounters a target area plus five other R-cell fronts (defined by overlap of a given SR).</s><s>In order to allow the R-cell fronts to move out of their originating bundles, the stop rule was required to begin shortly after extension starts (Experimental Procedures).</s><s>A simulation with SR = 0.36, which failed using the ''target only'' stop rule <ref type="bibr">(Figures 5D and 5H)</ref>, reveals correct establishment of neural superposition wiring in the model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6H</ref>, top row) (Movie S6 shows a ''combinatorial overlap'' simulation without requiring a target, which behaves identically to the ''combinatorial overlap + target'' stop rule, see below).</s><s>Remarkably, even an extraordinarily large sensing area, with a diameter of the entire inter-cartridge distance (using SR = 0.5), can correctly establish neural superposition (Movie S6; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6H</ref> bottom row).</s><s>This is surprising because larger sensing radii have a higher chance to cause a premature stop due to overlap.</s><s>However, R fronts exhibit a collective, sharp increase of total area overlap with other R fronts and target areas only once they reach the correct target area (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6I</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we systematically compared the precision of wiring for ''combinatorial overlap + target'' stop rules for different numbers k (k = 0 to 5) of other R-cell fronts.</s><s>We additionally performed this test while scanning SR from 0.2 to 0.5.</s><s>Our results show that all combinatorial stop rules for overlap with k R 3 other R-cells perform more robustly with larger sensing areas than the ''target only'' (k = 0) rule (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6J</ref>).</s><s>Stop rules that combine target recognition with the sensing of 4 or 5 other R-cell fronts function robustly over the wide range of scanned sensing radii.</s><s>Hence, these findings suggest that R fronts of large sizes and substantial overlap can target correctly if the target is defined by coincidence detection of the target plus other R-cell fronts, independent of their subtype.</s></p><p><s>Surprisingly, a ''combinatorial overlap'' stop rule, based on R-cell front sensing when the target area itself does not contribute to the combinatorial stop rule, functions robustly (Movie S6).</s><s>Specifically, recognition of k R 4 other R-cell fronts without the target area itself is nearly as robust as when the target area is included (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6J</ref>).</s><s>This finding reveals the theoretical possibility that target recognition during growth cone sorting may be an intrinsic property of the R-cell growth cone array and does not require the recognition of the actual target itself (e.g., L-cells) as part of the stop rule.</s><s>In addition, our results show that even in an unconstrained model in which all R-cells sense all other R-cells, the geometry of the scaffold ensures that only the ''right'' R-cell fronts stop each other in the right place (Movie S6).</s></p><p><s>Next, we quantitatively assessed the robustness of the ''target only'' and ''combinatorial overlap'' models with respect to perturbations in extension angle.</s><s>We computed the probability of accurate neural superposition patterning in the case when the extension direction of each R1-R6 subtype was randomly varied up to ±10 around its idealized direction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>; n = 100 simulations per condition).</s><s>We created phase plane diagrams of accuracy as a function of the sensing radii of R-cell fronts, sensing start time and stop rules (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6K-6M</ref>).</s><s>The simulations of the ''target only'' model reveal that correct neural superposition wiring is only robust for small sensing radii (SR &lt; 0.35) if the overlap is sensed throughout sorting (sensing start time earlier than 30 hr APF; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6K</ref>).</s><s>However, larger sensing radii can function robustly in the ''target only'' model only if overlap sensing is turned on at 35 hr APF or later, i.e., at the very end of extension, after R-cell fronts have already passed incorrect targets.</s><s>Such a late overlap sensing start would be facilitated by the synchronous nature of growth cone sorting.</s><s>However, the ''target only'' model lacks robustness for sensing radii that match the morphological appearance of the imaged R fronts (Figures 5D-5F, 6A-6G, and S4A) and overlap sensing prior to 32 hr APF.</s><s>In contrast, ''combinatorial overlap'' stop rules based on R-cell front sensing (with or without the target) exhibit robustness for larger sensing radii that have extensive R-cell overlap throughout sorting.</s><s>Consistent with the biologically relevant parameters of SR &gt; 0.2, and the time for actual sorting to fall between 20 and 40 hr APF (red boxes in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6K-6M</ref>), these combinatorial stop rules exhibit a high probability of perfect wiring (yellow) for SR &gt; 0.3 despite the random angle variation (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4B and S4C</ref>).</s><s>In summary, our model indicates that ''combinatorial overlap'' stop rules that utilize R-cell front overlaps, as observed in the imaging data, greatly improve robustness of the stop rule.</s><s>The model further predicts optimal sensing radii between 0.3 and 0.4, closely resembling the observed size of growth cone fronts (compare Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref> and Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A-6G</ref>).</s><s>However, our modeling results alone only reveal the ''combinatorial overlap'' stop rule as a robust solution, but do not exclude the ''target only'' or ''no interaction'' stop rules.</s></p><p><s>Validation at the Equator: The Three Neural Superposition Rules Provide an Explanation for Reduced Equator Wiring Robustness and All Four Types of Rotational Stereotypy within Cartridges Observed in Wild-Type A test of the growth cone extension and stop rules in perturbation experiments by ablating R-or L-cells is not easily possible, because loss of any of the involved cell types disrupts the scaffold.</s><s>However, the wiring pattern around the equator provides an important natural experiment that tests the model: six rows of cartridges have varying composition and represent three different degrees of disruption of the canonical wiring pattern (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1C and 7A</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, cartridges of the three rows near the equator differ from the canonical cartridge patterning by containing: an extra R3 (wiring-type ''7R;'' Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>), an extra R3, and an extra R4 (''8R type 1;'' Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>) and

exhibits a distinct pattern of rotational stereotypy (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1C and 7A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Horridge and Meinertzhagen, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Meinertzhagen, 1972)</ref>.</s><s>This enigmatic and ''overly precise'' wiring specificity has remained unexplained.</s><s>The computational model based on a combinatorial stop rule generates precise equator wiring and all precise patterns of rotational stereotypy in the placement of R-cell terminals in cartridge profiles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>; Movie S7).</s><s>This observation suggests that the apparent precision of the wiring pattern is a side effect of the developmental algorithm presented here.</s><s>The observed four types of R-terminal rotational stereotypy also provide support for the idea that R-cell front interactions are part of the stop rule.</s><s>The measured vectors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3J</ref>) and R front overlap (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) alone do not obviously lead to rotational stereotypy.</s><s>However, recognition and ''sandwiching'' between direct neighbors provide an elegant mechanism that preserves the rotational stereotypy, whereas it is more difficult to envision how R-cell fronts would retain the exact same two R-cell subtypes as neighbors without sensing each other.</s></p><p><s>To test more directly the role of interactions between R-cell fronts during growth cone targeting, we analyzed the growth cone dynamics and robustness underlying extension and stop rules in the equator versus main lamina.</s><s>The longest growth cones (R3s) need to navigate seven different environments near the equator (red vectors in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>).</s><s>We hypothesized that if R-cell front interactions instruct either the growth cone's extension angle or its speed, then the altered equator environments should cause altered growth cone behavior.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we compared growth cones at the equator with those in the main lamina.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref

regions.</s><s>However, it is difficult to envision a molecular mechanism for interactions between the R-cell fronts for the seven different environments that would lead to identical dynamics.</s><s>We conclude that these measurements do not support a mechanism whereby R front-R front interactions (for R-cells originating in different bundles) instruct extension angle or speed.</s></p><p><s>Next, we asked whether R-cell front interactions might play a role as part of the stop rule, as suggested by our robustness analyses in the main lamina (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6K-6M</ref>) and the observation of rotational stereotypy in all parts of the lamina (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1C and  7B</ref>).</s><s>The equator region provides a decisive test, as our model predicts reduced robustness at the equator for any stop rule that involves R-cell front interactions, but not for ''target only .</s><s>The ''target only'' stop rule has the same robustness at and away from the equator, with wiring succeeding or failing at the same sensing radii (red vertical line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7H</ref>) because the target grid is isotropic across the entire lamina (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, all ''no interaction'' stop rules have the same robustness at or away from the equator (data not shown), because the stopping condition is independent of the R-cell environment.</s><s>In contrast, all stop rules based on R front sensing exhibit reduced equator robustness compared with neural superposition wiring in the main lamina (broken red lines in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7I-7M</ref>).</s><s>This is consistent with the prediction that increased numbers of R-cell fronts at the equator more easily lead to a premature stop, which results from an R-cell front meeting head on with other R-cell fronts.</s><s>Hence, we hypothesize that if R front sensing is part of the stop rule, the wild-type equator should exhibit reduced robustness, which would be apparent as an increased wild-type error rate.</s></p><p><s>A test of this hypothesis is available in the form of two seminal single-axon tracing studies in the neural superposition eye of the blow fly Calliphora <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Horridge and Meinertzhagen,

equator <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Horridge and Meinertzhagen, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Meinertzhagen, 1972)</ref>.</s><s>Hence, the observation of wiring errors at the wild-type equator, in conjunction with the observations that R-cell front interactions are not required during extension, supports the hypothesis that R-cell front interactions are part of the stop rule and argues against both the ''no interaction'' and ''target only'' stop rules.</s><s>Similar to the equator, our model generates edge cartridges at the borders of the lamina that match and explain

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Here, we describe a developmental algorithm for the axonal sorting of 4,800 presynaptic cells in the primary visual map of Drosophila.</s><s>Our work suggests that the neural superposition wiring diagram found in adult fly brains can be established through simple, local pattern formation principles without the need for an elaborate molecular matchmaking code.</s><s>Our codification of the developmental algorithm reveals quantitative constraints and provides a conceptual framework for molecular mechanisms that execute these rules.</s></p><p><s>Three Rules to Ring Them All Our findings, together with previous studies, support the following developmental algorithm.</s><s>Rule 1: The Scaffolding Rule Incoming rows of axon bundles from individual ommatidia are organized in a repeating pattern of evenly spaced semi-circles.</s><s>This pattern and spacing of original axon arrival points provide a scaffold that remains stable during the entire process of growth cone sorting and is required for neural superposition.</s><s>The future target areas are encircled by the anchored heels and thus already defined prior to growth cone movements.</s><s>How the precision of the scaffold pattern develops is unknown.</s><s>The scaffold is likely to instruct the extension angle through non-autonomous R-cell interactions within a bundle <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen and Clandinin, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Such intra-bundle interactions have been proposed to play a more prominent role than do interactions across bundles <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Schwabe et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>To which extent the geometric arrangement of heels observed in the scaffold is influenced by their axonal arrangements within the bundles or by other cells within the target area is unclear.</s><s>Rule 2: The Extension Rule All R1-R6 growth cones extend synchronously with speeds and angles specific to their R-cell subtype during the 5-10 hr of extension.</s><s>The extension is unaffected by highly varying environments at the equator and thus is unlikely to depend on R-cell front interactions.</s><s>However, precise extension dynamics may require permissive R-cell heel interactions and recognition of other cells that are equally distributed across the equator as instructive guides.</s><s>It is unlikely that R-cell growth cones simply extend toward attractive cues at the target regions because the growth cones can overlap with several target regions throughout their sorting (including the target regions closest to the heels).</s><s>Based on these observations, we consider that the extension process of the bipolar R-cell growth cones differs from the classic view of growth cone movements toward attractive targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Caudy and Bentley, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Mason and Erskine, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Rule 3: The Stop Rule The target regions defined by the scaffold (and the L-cells therein) provide possible, but poor, targets for R-cell fronts to stop extending, because those R-cell fronts overlap with multiple targets simultaneously and throughout their extension.</s><s>In addition, all R-cell fronts increasingly overlap with other R-cell fronts throughout their extension.</s><s>The computational model reveals that stop rules based on R-cell front overlap function even without any target-derived cues and are more robust than a ''target only'' model under the same conditions.</s><s>A target model using coincidence detection of overlap with other R fronts, as well as target L-cells, performs best.</s><s>R-cell front interaction is predicted to be part of the stop rule because of reduced robustness at the equator and because of the rotational stereotypy of R-cell terminal positions within cartridges.</s><s>These two observations also argue against ''no interaction'' stop rules.</s><s>However, our results do not rule out the existence of a synchronously applied stop signal that could act as part of a combinatorial stop rule.</s><s>The precise nature and molecular correlate of the stop rule remain unknown.</s></p><p><s>Previous work has revealed important insights into further constraints of these rules.</s><s>Most importantly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Clandinin and Zipursky (2000)</ref> have shown that the 180 rotation of a single bundle results in 180 rotated extension angles.</s><s>This finding is consistent with our model.</s><s>In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Clandinin and Zipursky (2000)</ref> unraveled differential subtype dependencies, where R1, R2, R5 and R6 targeting depend on R3 and R4, but not the other way round.</s><s>Whether this dependency arises from the scaffolding, extension, or stop rule remains to be determined.</s><s>It is not yet known whether reconciliation of our model with these observations arises from constraining existing rules or requires new ones.</s></p><p><s>After growth cone sorting is complete, a process of centripetal growth commences synchronously from all R-cell fronts and these then generate R-cell terminal columns orthogonal to the lamina plexus (Movie 4).</s><s>This columnar extension preserves and freezes the relative positions of R-cell fronts in the lamina plexus; the resulting columns of R-cell terminals then define the adult lamina.</s></p></div>
