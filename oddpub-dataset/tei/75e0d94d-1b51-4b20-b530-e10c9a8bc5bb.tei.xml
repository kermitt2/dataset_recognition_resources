<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Seasonal influenza is a serious infectious disease of the respiratory tract.</s><s>In a typical year there are 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, claiming up to 500.000</s><s>deaths world-wide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Human influenza viruses are characterized by continuous antigenic drift and the occurrence of new variants of co-circulating influenza A and B viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Yearly vaccination and previous infections contribute to herd immunity in the human population.</s><s>However, the emergence of a new subtype of influenza virus, or the re-emergence of a subtype that has not circulated for a long time, raise the risk for a pandemic spread as it occurred in 2009 with a new A(H1N1) virus originating from pigs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In the event of a newly emerging strain, rapid development of a vaccination strategy is crucial and the prediction of non-response to such vaccine is of great importance.</s><s>Here we present a prediction algorithm for the response to the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus strain after seasonal vaccination as a model for this situation.</s></p><p><s>Since its appearance, the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain was included in the annual trivalent vaccine.</s><s>For the season 2011-2012 (or 2013-2014 season), A(H1N1)pdm09/California/7/2009 together with A(H3N2)/Perth/16/2009 and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (or A(H3N2)/Texas/50/2012 and B/Massachusetts/2/2012) were used as vaccine strains.</s><s>The A(H3N2) and the B strains were circulating also before 2009 in the human population and accumulated small changes by antigenic drift over the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we would expect cross-reactivity with past strains and a memory immune response after vaccination even in individuals that are sero-negative to these specific strains.</s><s>In contrast, the California strain represents a new virus of the subtype A (H1N1) with other features than seasonal H1N1 viruses circulating before 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and therefore we expect that individuals who are sero-negative to this strain have little cross-reactivity to previous strains and probably represent a primary immune response.</s><s>Thus, here we attempt to predict the specific serological response to the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain following a seasonal vaccination in individuals who are sero-negative to this California strain.</s></p><p><s>Systems biology approaches and mathematical modeling are increasingly used to improve the understanding and the prediction of biological processes.</s><s>Several models to predict the efficacy of influenza vaccination were published in the last years.</s><s>Trtica-Majnaric et al. developed a model that included a high number of clinical variables in addition to cell populations of the immune systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, but with such a large number of variables the model is very difficult to use in a clinical setup.</s><s>In another approach, Nayak et al. used the expansion of CD4 + T cells between day 0 and day 7 post-vaccination as a predictive marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>A systems biology study of <ref type="bibr">Nakaya et al. resulted</ref> in a high number of potential models combining the expression of 3 to 4 genes at day 0, 3 or 7 after vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>However, using data derived after the vaccination, rather than baseline status, makes it problematic to use as a predictive model of response to vaccine.</s><s>Lastly, an unbiased analysis of a high number of immune cell populations by Tsang et al. revealed a baseline signature with a predictive capacity for the post-vaccination response <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>However, in all of these models prediction was made for the maximal sero-conversion of one out of several strains, but not for the response to a specific newly emerged strain.</s></p><p><s>Here we analyzed in a pilot study a large number of immune cell populations in individuals sero-negative for the A(H1N1)/California/7/2009 strain with respect to the post-vaccination sero-protection to that strain.</s><s>We identified CD4 + T cells, in particular naive CD4 + T cells, as critical for a protective response to A(H1N1) California, but not to the A(H3N2) Perth or the influenza B Brisbane strain.</s><s>Moreover, we developed a specific logistic regression model predicting sero-protection for the A(H1N1)pdm09 California strain with a high accuracy utilizing only a few baseline parameters.</s><s>We had then gone further and conducted a larger validation study to particularly test the prospectively defined prediction algorithm.</s><s>Based on the publish, or preparation of the manuscript and only provided financial

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We have conducted an extensive exploratory study followed by a validation study to predict protection against the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 California strain by the immune status pre-vaccination.</s><s>We have focused on predicting the serological immune response (measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay, HAI) to the newly emerged influenza strain A/California/7/2009 rather than the combined response to all three strains in the seasonal tri-valent influenza vaccine.</s><s>The other strains used in the seasonal vaccinations in our study were the H3N2 strains (A/Perth/16/2009 or A/Texas/50/2012) and the influenza B strains (B/Brisbane/ 60/2008 or B/Massachusetts/2/2012) that were circulating, either themselves or in similar strains, in the human population for a longer time.</s><s>Indeed, we observed that the immune cells sub-populations that show a significant difference between responders and non-responders, are not the same for each of those antigens.</s><s>In particular, total CD4 + T cell counts at baseline together with age and the number of influenza strains that an individual was sero-negative to at baseline (NSSN) were highly predictive for the response against the new H1N1 California strain in vaccinees that were sero-negative to that strain at baseline.</s><s>Since naive CD4 + T cells are dispensable in a memory response, our observations that naïve CD4 + T cell counts at baseline, rather than influenza specific (for all 3 vaccine strains together) CD4 + CD40L + activated T cell counts at baseline, were highly associated with the serological response to the H1N1 California strain, indicate that the CD4 + T cell immune response in sero-negative donors is indeed more a primary-like, than a memory-like, immune response against the newly emerged strain.</s><s>A critical part of the primary immune response is the stimulation of virus-specific B cells by specific CD4 + T cells, recruited from the naive pool.</s><s>The chance to select CD4 + T cells with a high binding capacity will increase with the number of available naive CD4 + T cells.</s><s>These results are in accordance with a recent publication demonstrating that A(H1N1)pdm09 virus induced two types of CD4 + T cell responses after both infection or vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>One type of CD4 + T cells recognized conserved regions of the hemagglutinin and was recruited from the memory pool.</s><s>The major immune response was in contrast directed against unique features of the virus strain and the corresponding CD4 + T Fig 5 <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Prediction of non-protection to the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza strain as function of the combination of age, NSSN and CD4 + T cells after the validation study.</s><s>The logistic regression model combining baseline CD4 + T cell counts with age and NSSN is validated with a high ROC-AUC = 0.85, significant p-value = 0.0056 and high accuracy of 85% for the same age groups (&lt;31 and &gt;49 years) as in the pilot study (left panels in A and B).</s><s>However, the addition of the middle age group (31-49 years) in the validation study somewhat reduces the accuracy of the prediction when using age as a linear function (center panels in A and B), because donors with these ages respond rather like the younger donors.</s><s>Transformation of age to a sigmoid based function (with a midpoint age of 50 years) gives the best prediction with accuracy 85% and a highly significant p-value = 0.0000004 when combining both studies (right panels in A and B).</s><s>The multi-factorial risk profile for non-protection (HAI&lt;40) to the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza strain is clearly seen (C) when combining the sero-negative vaccinees from both studies (N = 80).</s><s>Donors with high baseline CD4 + T cell counts (&gt;860 cells/μL) are all protected (p = 0.02 for NSSN = 3), as well as young (&lt;50 years) donors with low CD4 + counts but NSSN = 1-2.</s><s>Non-protection is only observed for old donors with low CD4 + counts (20%, 50% and 64% for NSSN = 1, 2 and 3 respectively) and for young donors with low CD4 + counts and NSSN = 3 (24%).</s><s>Lastly, a prediction model (D) for the probability of non-protection to the California H1N1 strain is obtained by simulating the continuous contribution of age (after logistic function transformation from 20 years young in blue to 80 years old in red), NSSN and baseline CD4 + T cell counts, where the combined effect of the 3 variables can be clearly seen.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150812.g005</s><s>cells were selected from the naive CD4 + T cell pool.</s><s>The CD4 + T cell expansion was recently also described to be predictive for the neutralizing antibody response to a monovalent 2009 A (H1N1)pdm09 vaccine <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, similar to our study, low CD4 + T cell counts in well controlled HIV-infected patients resulted in poor protection rate after receiving a A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>It will be interesting to verify if the kinetics, rather than the baseline level, of influenza specific CD4 + CD40L + activated T cells is correlated with the H1N1 serological response.</s></p><p><s>Remarkably, the response to the new California strain was strongly depending also on the number of strains for which each donor was sero-negative to at baseline (NSSN) among donors sero-negative to the California strain.</s><s>Lower protection rates were found in donors that were sero-negative for all 3 strains (NSSN = 3) as compared to higher protection in donors that were sero-positive for either Perth or Brisbane (NSSN = 2) and in donors that were sero-positive to both Perth and Brisbane (NSSN = 1).</s><s>Although the California 2009 H1N1 strain is a newly emerged influenza virus with a swine origin, higher number of strains with sero-positivity (lower NSSN) may be a marker for higher cross-reactivity to pre-circulating strains that could play a role in a more rapid generation of hemagglutination antibodies against the newly emerged H1N1 virus.</s><s>Alternatively, this could be explained by the necessity to divide limited resources, which are critical for a successful immune response, between a primary immune responses to 3 strains in the NSSN = 3 donors, as compared to the donors which are already sero-positive for some of the strains and may raise a memory response to them.</s></p><p><s>Age was still a critical factor in the prediction of non-protection to A(H1N1)pdm09.</s><s>Comparing the protection rates for donors at ages 35-50 with those younger and older, shows that the predictive function of age is not linear but rather sigmoid with a midpoint at about 50 years.</s><s>The availability of naive CD4 + T cells may account for part of the age effect, since we observed that naive CD4 + T cell count was significantly higher in the young donor group as compared to old.</s><s>However, low naive CD4 + T cell count may increase the probability for nonprotection irrespective of age, but age still plays a role among vaccinees with low counts of naive CD4 + T cells (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s><s>Thus, other age related factors still need to be elucidated in order to completely understand the age effect.</s></p><p><s>The correlation between age and counts of various immune cell populations is also important to understand the selection of independent predictors in the multi-variate logistic regression model.</s><s>A strong association between younger age and higher CD4 + naive T cell, as well as CD4 + regulatory T cell, counts is well documented in the literature and was also found in our study (S1 Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, although both CD4 + naive and CD4 + Treg variables were significantly associated with successful immune response against A(H1N1)pdm09 (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">)</ref>, they were not selected as significant independent predictors in the logistic regression model due to their strong interaction with age.</s><s>On the other hand, total CD4 + T cell counts were not significantly associated with age, or with NSSN, and therefore the CD4 + baseline count variable emerges as a significant independent predictor even when combined with age and NSSN.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, both sub-populations of CD4 + naive T cells, recent thymic emigrants (RTE, CD31 + ) and non-RTE (CD31 -), contributed similarly to the prediction of non-protection to H1N1.</s><s>The reason for this might be that indeed RTEs are the important factor, but the association between CD4 Naive count and age creates a confluence also with the non-RTE population.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have extensively tested a large number of immune markers before vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine and found that a surprisingly simple model predicts the success of serological response to the newly emerged influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus A/California/7/2009. Combining age, number of sero-negative strains at baseline (NSSN) and baseline CD4 + T cell counts allows predicting protection to A(H1N1)pdm09 with a highly statistical significance and an accuracy of 85%, in particular capturing all the non-protected vaccinees.</s><s>The rigorous testing methodology we have undertaken, including one-leave-out and drop-one procedures to select the best predictive models during the exploratory pilot study, as well as the followup validation study, which was conducted with power for multiple testing of the 3 prospectively defined best models from the first phase, ensures the robustness of our results.</s><s>The combined population of both studies, with N = 80 vaccinees sero-negatives to the H1N1 California strain, clearly elucidates the multi-factorial effect of the 3 predictors in the model.</s><s>Finally, the simulation predictive model we suggest is simple enough and accurate enough to allow its use in clinical settings.</s><s>It would be interesting to conduct similar analysis of immune response to other newly emerging viral strains to test if this prediction model is specific for the A(H1N1)/California/7/2009 pandemic strain or more generic.</s><s>models with monocytes (CD14 + ), natural killer (CD56 + NK) cells, dendritic cells (pDCs), plasmablasts and influenza specific activated (CD4 + CD40L + ) cells in the pilot study.</s><s>Plasmablasts counts are significantly (p = 0.03) different between H1N1 protected and non-protected vaccinees, while the other sub-populations in this figure show no significant association with protection on their own.</s><s>The prediction of serological response using multi-variate logistic regression including baseline immune cell populations, age and NSSN is presented.</s><s>Even if significant, the results for these cell populations are not as good as the CD4 + T cell model.</s><s>In particular of interest that the model using baseline counts of specifically activated cells (CD4 + CD40L + ) sorted after stimulation with the 3 influenza strains in the vaccine does not give a good prediction.</s></p></div>
