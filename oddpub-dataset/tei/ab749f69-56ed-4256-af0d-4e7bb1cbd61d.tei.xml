<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Though clinical guidelines for assessment and treatment of chronic subjective tinnitus do exist, a comprehensive review of those guidelines has not been performed.</s><s>The objective of this review was to identify current clinical guidelines, and compare their recommendations for the assessment and treatment of subjective tinnitus in adults.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method:</head><p><s>We systematically searched a range of sources for clinical guidelines (as defined by the Institute of Medicine, United States) for the assessment and/or treatment of subjective tinnitus in adults.</s><s>No restrictions on language or year of publication were applied to guidelines.</s></p><p><s>Results: Clinical guidelines from Denmark, Germany, Sweden, The Netherlands, and the United States were included in the review.</s><s>There was a high level of consistency across the guidelines with regard to recommendations for audiometric assessment, physical examination, use of a validated questionnaire(s) to assess tinnitus related distress, and referral to a psychologist when required.</s><s>Cognitive behavioral treatment for tinnitus related distress, use of hearing aids in instances of hearing loss and recommendations against the use of medicines were consistent across the included guidelines.</s><s>Differences between the guidelines centered on the use of imaging in assessment procedures and sound therapy as a form of treatment for tinnitus distress respectively.</s><s>Fuller et al.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review of Guidelines for Tinnitus</head><p><s>Conclusion: Given the level of commonality across tinnitus guidelines from different countries the development of a European guideline for the assessment and treatment of subjective tinnitus in adults seems feasible.</s><s>This guideline would have the potential to benefit the large number of clinicians in countries where clinical guidelines do not yet exist, and would support standardization of treatment for patients across Europe.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Tinnitus is essentially made up of two components, the phantom perception of a sound in the ears or head, and the degree of emotional reaction to that percept.</s><s>Tinnitus can co-occur with several medical-otological disorders such as presbycusis, though etiology is unknown for the majority of tinnitus patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baguley et al., 2013b)</ref>.</s><s>In rare cases tinnitus indicates a serious underlying pathology such as vascular troubles, vestibular schwannoma (VS), or otosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baguley et al., 2013a)</ref>.</s><s>In most cases however subjective tinnitus is a benign symptom.</s><s>In many patients co-morbidities exist such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and concentration problems, all of which severely impair quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Langguth et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In 1-3% of cases tinnitus causes severe health problems, with a wide range of effects on daily life functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Davis and Refaie, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fujii et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kim et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Evidence corroborates that the aversive psychological reactions, such as cognitive problems, negative emotions, and dysfunctional attentional processes are of main importance in leading to a severe tinnitus condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Erlandsson and Hallberg, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andersson et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cima et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kleinstauber et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">McKenna et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Handscomb et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>During the last decades, efforts have been made to better understand tinnitus pathophysiology and provide specialized treatments to patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kamalski et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cima et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Langguth et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hoekstra et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>A large number of management strategies including various assessment and treatment procedures exist and have evolved but lack empirical support.</s><s>For example, there is no evidenced treatment or licensed pharmacological therapy to eliminate the tinnitus percept <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Langguth and Elgoyhen, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The Cochrane Library lists 10 completed systematic reviews on different tinnitus treatments, all of which reported small numbers of studies of variable quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Martinez-Devesa et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>These facts combined makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to decide what is best for which tinnitus patient.</s><s>This is evidenced by the discrepancy between scientific and clinical perspectives on the management of tinnitus and the actual day-to-day practice in European healthcare settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hoare et al., 2012)</ref>; tinnitus patient care is fragmented and ad hoc <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hoare and Hall, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hoare et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>To date there has been no overview of the number of existing clinical practice guidelines for tinnitus, the details included, their comparability, or their purpose.</s><s>Clinical practice guidelines are defined as systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Field and Lohr, 1990)</ref>.</s><s>They have the benefit of simplifying and standardizing assessment and treatment options for clinicians and patients.</s><s>A European Union guideline would extend this benefit to 28 countries.</s><s>This systematic review aims to identify, review, and examine the clinical guidelines which do exist for tinnitus.</s><s>The tinnitus assessments (diagnostics and measures), processes, and treatment options recommended by the respective guidelines will be compared and summarized.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>The aims, the work plan, and the protocol for this systematic review were developed by TINNET Working Group 1, a COST Action <ref type="bibr">BM1306 (2014</ref><ref type="bibr">BM1306 ( -2018) )</ref> to create a pan-European tinnitus research network (http://tinnet.tinnitusresearch.net/).</s><s>This review was registered with PROSPERO, the international register of systematic reviews (protocol number: CRD42016038588) prior to commencing the literature search.</s><s>The review was exempt from human ethics procedures as there were no human participants and only secondary sources of data (the clinical guidelines) were used.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eligibility Criteria</head><p><s>Records were considered eligible for inclusion if they fit the definition of a guideline by describing and making recommendations on the assessment, diagnosis, and or treatment of subjective tinnitus for adults (i.e., people aged 16 years or older).</s><s>Those records were required to identify or describe themselves as guidelines, and be the most recent guideline form the country of origin.</s><s>No publication date or language restrictions were imposed on the eligibility of the guidelines.</s></p><p><s>Guidelines were excluded if they were for objective tinnitus, pediatrics, referred only to the triage or referral pathways for assessing and treating tinnitus, or if they were a guide for only one specific type of assessment or treatment procedure for tinnitus.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Literature Search</head><p><s>The literature search for clinical guidelines included the Medline, PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and EMBASE databases.</s><s>In addition to these the National Guideline Clearinghouse (www.guideline.</s><s>gov), National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE; https://www.nice.org.uk/),</s><s>Guideline International Network (GIN; http://www.g-i-n.net/),</s><s>Google, and hand-search of reference lists of any included guidelines was undertaken.</s><s>International experts were also contacted to ask if they were aware of any guidelines that had not already been identified from the search results.</s><s>The date that the search for guidelines was first conducted was 2 May 2016 and was undertaken by TEF and HH using "tinnitus" and "guideline" as the two key terms.</s><s>The final search was conducted on 24 June 2016.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Selection</head><p><s>Two reviewers independently screened search results by title and abstract, and then by full text if required.</s><s>The first 20 pages of search results from Google, and all search results from GIN, NICE, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse were screened.</s><s>In the event of disagreements, a third reviewer (BM) acted as an arbiter.</s><s>As an additional check and in line with other systemic review searches using internet search engines, a post-hoc rule of stopping searching after three consecutive pages without new search results was applied.</s><s>In this case, no new search results were identified after the first eight pages.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Extraction</head><p><s>Data extraction was undertaken using a tailored form that had been pilot tested and was emailed to reviewers in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.</s><s>A document with guidance on the extraction of information for each of the items was provided to each of the reviewers to improve consistency of data extraction.</s><s>Data extraction from each guideline was undertaken by at least two reviewers who were native speakers of or fluent in the language in which the guideline was published.</s><s>Reviewers extracted information from the guidelines regarding items about the: country and year of publication, availability, author details, sponsor/funder involved, scope, target audience, developers and process related to the guideline, recommendations for assessment and treatment procedures, the level of evidence and type of rating system used (e.g., Oxford) related to the recommendations, and items related to the implementation and revision of the guideline.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Management</head><p><s>HH and TEF were responsible for data management and maintained editorial rights.</s><s>All identified records were saved into a Microsoft word master file and then saved in pdf-copy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias</head><p><s>All reviewers of the guidelines also completed the AGREE II tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brouwers et al., 2010)</ref> to assess the quality of the guidelines.</s><s>AGREE II is an international tool to assess the quality and reporting of practice guidelines (www.agreetrust.org).</s><s>It contains 23 items grouped under six guideline domains.</s><s>Each item is scored on a 1-7 scale where 1 = "Strongly disagree" and 7 = "Strongly agree."</s><s>Scores are standardized to provide an overall percentage score.</s><s>Previous reviews have used a 60% marker to distinguish high and low quality guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sanclemente et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ruszczynski et al., 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Details relating to the sources of funding, professional affiliations, and editorial independence of the guideline developers were extracted as indicative of risk of bias.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Synthesis</head><p><s>Data extracted by the reviewers were collated and integrated into summary tables and a narrative synthesis describing the similarities and differences between the clinical practice guidelines was completed.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This systematic review aims to compare existing clinical guidelines for the assessment and treatment of subjective tinnitus in adults.</s><s>Five guidelines, developed in the last 10 years within Europe, Scandinavia, and North America were included in the review.</s><s>Although there are differences in some specific recommendations for assessment and treatment procedures across the guidelines, in general, commonalities across guidelines were high.</s><s>The fact that there are differences in some of the recommendations is not surprising and appears to reflect the relatively young state of the field and the evolving nature of assessment and treatments for subjective tinnitus-a symptom with a high level of heterogeneity.</s><s>On the other hand, the level of agreement, for example, in the recommendation of specialized cognitive behavioral therapy reflects the growing evidence base for the effectiveness of this treatment to alleviate patients' distress and impairment, even though significant changes in the tinnitus percept itself as a result of CBT have been proposed, though not yet assessed across studies.</s><s>When the methods of the development of guidelines were reported, it was clear that the respective groups were making efforts to be transparent, systematic, and using the best available evidence base, and frequently linking recommendations to specific research literature.</s><s>For example, systematic reviews and meta-analyses were referred to whenever available to inform recommendations.</s><s>It should be noted though that there is a lack of high quality studies or powered randomized trials of some treatments either for practical or methodological reasons.</s><s>Regardless, the strengths and limitations of the evidence for particular recommendations were included for the majority of the guidelines and thus enable the user/reader to make informed decisions about following the recommended actions.</s><s>Furthermore, target users were generally clearly defined and the development groups were comprised of a range of the health professionals often involved in the assessment and treatment of tinnitus.</s><s>These two factors are important not only for providing expert input into the guideline, but also for garnering "buy-in" from potential users of the guidelines and focussing the content.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differences between the Guidelines</head><p><s>Differences in recommended assessment procedures tend to relate to specific techniques (questionnaires, diagnostic tests, types of scanning techniques) rather than general principles [e.g., trying to establish tinnitus severity, hearing loss, psychosocial problem(s)], or the presence or absence of severe physical pathology that might be causing the tinnitus.</s><s>Differences related to, for example, the recommended questionnaires for assessing tinnitus related interference and distress.</s><s>While all the guidelines referred to the THI (the German guideline indirectly refers to this), only the American, Dutch and German guidelines referred to the TQ.</s><s>Recommendations for specific questionnaires to measure psychological distress (especially symptoms of anxiety and depression) also varied with some guidelines not mentioning any (e.g., United States) and others such as the Dutch and Swedish guidelines which referred to the HADS.</s><s>Differences also existed between the recommendations to assess loudness discomfort levels with the American and Dutch guidelines not recommending the use of such tests while the other guidelines did.</s></p><p><s>With regard to treatments, differences are found primarily regarding recommendations for the use of sound therapies.</s><s>TRT specifically is not recommended by the German guideline, conditionally by the Dutch guideline and the American guideline indicates that clinicians "may" recommend it; TRT is currently being tested in a large multicenter trial in the U.S. (clinical trials ID: NCT01177137).</s><s>A lack of evidences about other treatments such as acupuncture, hyperbaric oxygen and some herbal supplements leads most groups to recommend against them.</s><s>The American guideline though is more cautious and simply states that because there is a lack of evidence they can neither recommend for or against the use of such treatments.</s></p><p><s>Differences in the recommendations of assessment and treatment procedures could be explained by a combination of factors including the time of the development of the guideline and availability of translated versions of the questionnaires (e.g., the TFI was published in 2012 which was after that of the Danish and Swedish guidelines), the known psychometric properties of the questionnaires themselves [e.g., concerns have been raised about the cross-cultural use of the HADS <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Maters et al., 2013)</ref>], and the different methods used to reach consensus by the different guideline groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consistencies across the Guidelines</head><p><s>Across the guidelines consensus appears to exist on a number of important general features of assessment relating to subjective tinnitus.</s><s>Specifically, there is consensus about the initial need for excluding a physical cause of the tinnitus, conducting an audiometric assessment of the patient, using standardized questionnaires to measure degrees of tinnitus related distress, and when relevant, making referrals for further psychological assessment.</s></p><p><s>Regarding the therapeutic recommendations for the treatment of subjective tinnitus, all guidelines recommend against the use of medicines for the treatment of the tinnitus specifically but note that medicines are appropriate for treating co-morbid conditions.</s><s>There is also agreement in the recommendations to use hearing aids for patients experiencing hearing loss and CBT to facilitate adjustment to the symptom, alleviate distress and tinnitus-related interference in daily life.</s></p><p><s>As a group of tinnitus researchers and clinicians, we endorse the specific principles and practices of assessment and treatment that are consistently found across the guidelines.</s><s>Further, while a treatment for removing the tinnitus percept does not exist, we reiterate the importance of providing patients with bothersome tinnitus, evidence based cost-effective treatment(s) in a way (such as stepped care) that is minimally burdensome to the patient.</s><s>That is patients who are assessed as having relatively little tinnitus related distress and interference should receive less intensive treatment in the first instance, than someone who is assessed as having severe levels of distress and interference in activities of daily living.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and Limitations of the Review</head><p><s>There are two critical factors that affect the conclusions that can be drawn from the included guidelines.</s><s>Firstly, and as with all systematic reviews, the search strategy and inclusion criteria used determine what is located and subsequently included.</s><s>In this review, we used the search terms "tinnitus" and "guideline" to conduct the search in a wide range of databases, repositories of clinical guidelines, and search engines, with the intention of being focussed enough to identify the most relevant documents within a manageable number of search results.</s><s>Only including the term "guideline" though might have resulted in relevant documents, albeit not called "guidelines, " being omitted from search results.</s><s>Similarly, our use of inclusion/exclusion criteria that led to the decision to exclude documents such as the TRI flowchart could be problematic as it (the TRI flowchart) is a comprehensive document potentially used in many situations to inform assessment and treatment decisions.</s></p><p><s>To minimize the risk of omitting relevant search results we contacted a range of international experts and members of guideline development groups.</s><s>In addition to this, we conducted hand searches of the references lists of included guidelines for relevant sources.</s><s>We also recruited native speakers to extract data from the respective guidelines in an effort to ensure that data collection was as accurate as possible.</s><s>It is possible, that different search and inclusion criteria might have led to different documents being included.</s><s>However, given the large range of assessment and treatment options and the limited evidence base around many treatments in particular, it is unlikely that our conclusions would differ significantly if further guidelines had been identified at this time.</s><s>Future systematic reviews though will be able to use this as a reference point.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>As researchers from around the world are collecting and making efforts to better understand the heterogeneity of subjective tinnitus in adults and systematically evaluate assessment and treatment options, we have, for the first time, described the major similarities and differences between existing clinical guidelines for subjective tinnitus in adults.</s><s>The results reveal true guidelines from only five countries and thus highlight a need to develop guidelines that are endorsed by the range of professionals involved in assessing and treating tinnitus.</s><s>Although we do not place a great deal of weight on the quality assessment ratings of the guidelines, they do suggest that there is room for improvement particularly with regard to implementation and evaluation.</s><s>The absence of guidelines contributes to the variations that exist in assessment and treatment of tinnitus internationally.</s></p><p><s>While it would be tempting to do so, it is beyond the scope of this paper to formulate a new or composite guideline based on the results that we have obtained.</s><s>Instead, the results of this review in conjunction with those from a survey of European tinnitus healthcare providers and researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cima et al., 2016)</ref> will form the basis of further work on the development of a set of European clinical guidelines for the assessment and treatment of tinnitus being undertaken by the COST-action TINNET: Working Group I "Clinical."</s><s>As with existing clinical guidelines, attention will need to be given to how the future European guideline is disseminated, subsequently evaluated, and the implications for resource management considered.</s><s>We expect it to be challenging task but one that will hopefully result in a more reliable and equitable assessment and treatment of tinnitus patients across Europe.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 | PRISMA flowchart showing the stages of guideline search, screening and inclusion.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,119.64,70.07,356.40,321.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
