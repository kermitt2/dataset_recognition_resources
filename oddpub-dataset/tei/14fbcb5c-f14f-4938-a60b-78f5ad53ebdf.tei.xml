(ii) sites with methylation levels monotonically decreasing over cell divisions if they have high initial methylation levels at the first cell generation, high probability of failure of maintenance, and low probability of de novo methylation, which we name decreasing-methylated CpGs and are informative in inferring mitotic age; (iii) sites with stationary methylation levels over cell divisions that are not informative in inferring mitotic age; and (iv) sites with unstable methylation levels, which are dynamic but not informative in inferring mitotic age.</s><s>The MiAge model assumes site-specific parameters at a CpG site: the methylation level at the first cell generation, the probability of failure of maintenance, and the probability of de novo methylation are the same for all tissue samples of the same type.</s><s>By comparing observed to expected methylation levels at presentday genome under the MiAge model, we are able to estimate the total number of cell divisions a tissue sample has gone through, as well as the site-specific parameters of selected CpGs that are most informative in inferring mitotic activities using a selection procedure imbedded in the MiAge model.</s><s>We applied the MiAge model to training data of DNA methylation measures of 4,020 tumor and adjacent normal samples of 8 cancer types and built the MiAge Calculator that consists of a panel of 286 increasing-methylated CpGs that are mitotic-activity-informative together with their estimated site-specific parameters, which can be applied to methylation data of new samples of other tissue types to estimate their mitotic age.</s><s>We tested this non-tissue-specific property of the MiAge Calculator using testing data of DNA methylation measures of 2,221 tumor and adjacent normal samples of 5 cancer types different from the 8 cancer types in the training data.</s><s>We further validated the MiAge Calculator by showing high correlations between estimated mitotic age and three surrogate measures of the unknown true mitotic age.</s></p><p><s>Although we focused on cancer applications, the MiAge Calculator is readily applicable to aging studies using DNA methylation measures to estimate mitotic age as a new molecular target of aging marker.</s></p></div>
