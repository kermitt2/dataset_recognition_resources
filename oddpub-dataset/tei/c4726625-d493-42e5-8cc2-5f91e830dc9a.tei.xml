<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Conclusions and Relevance-Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.</s><s>Although the study design does not eliminate the potential for confounding by indication, these findings do not support early tracheal intubation for adult in-hospital cardiac arrest.</s></p><p><s>Mortality after adult in-hospital cardiac arrest remains high, and little is known about the effect of most interventions during cardiac arrest, including drugs and the use of advanced airway management. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Since 2010, guidelines have deemphasized the importance of tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest in adults, and the most optimal approach to airway management during cardiac arrest remainsunknown. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The 2015 guidelines of both the American Heart Association and the European Resuscitation Council state that either a bagvalve-mask device or an advanced airway may be used for ventilation and oxygenation during cardiac arrest, and the guidelines make no distinction between the out-of-hospital and in-hospital setting. <ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3</ref></s><s>large Japanese observational study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest showed that advanced airway management was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome. <ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s>However, similar data are lacking for the in-hospital setting, where patient characteristics, the cause of cardiac arrest, the timing of interventions, the skills and experience of the health care professionals, and overall outcomes are significantly different. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">5</ref></s><s>e aim of the current study was to evaluate the association between tracheal intubation during adult in-hospital cardiac arrest and survival to hospital discharge using the multicenter Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation (GWTG-R) registry.</s><s>This study also aimed to assess whether this association was modified by the first documented rhythm (shockable vs nonshockable) or other patient and event factors explored in prespecified subgroups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Source</head><p><s>This study retrospectively analyzed data from the GWTG-R registry, a prospective quality improvement registry of in hospital cardiac arrest in US hospitals; the registry is sponsored by the American Heart Association, which has regimented data collection methods and reliability checks. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s>Data are collected on all patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest who do not have prior do-not-resuscitate orders.</s><s>Cardiac arrest is defined as pulselessness requiring chest compressions and/or defibrillation, with a hospital-wide or unit-based emergency response.</s><s>Integrity of the data is ensured through online certification of data entry personnel and the use of standardized software. 7</s><s>Data from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2014, were used.</s><s>Hospital-level data were obtained from the American Hospital Association's Annual Survey from 2013. <ref type="bibr">8</ref></s><s>l participating hospitals are required to comply with local regulatory guidelines.</s><s>Because data are used primarily at the local site for quality improvement, sites are granted a waiver of informed consent under the common rule.</s><s>The Committee on Clinical Investigations at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center confirmed that this is not considered human subjects research under the common law and therefore waived the need for informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Population</head><p><s>This study included adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with an index cardiac arrest for which they received chest compressions.</s><s>Patients who had an invasive airway in place at the time of the cardiac arrest (including tracheal tube, tracheostomy, laryngeal mask airway, or other invasive airways but not including nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airways) were not included.</s><s>Hospital visitors and employees were not included.</s><s>For the main analysis, patients with missing data on tracheal intubation, covariates (except race, for which a "not reported" category was created), and survival were excluded.</s><s>This included patients with missing or inconsistent data on timing of tracheal intubation, timing of epinephrine administration, or timing of defibrillation (in those with a shockable rhythm).</s><s>These patients were included after imputation of missing values in a preplanned sensitivity analysis (see "Statistical Analysis").</s></p><p><s>Race was included in the analysis because previous research has suggested that race might be associated with outcomes. <ref type="bibr">9</ref></s><s>Race was self-reported by the patient or family or, if these were not available, by the clinical physician or institution.</s><s>Race was reported as American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, white, or unable to determine.</s><s>Given small sample sizes in some groups, these were recategorized into white, black, other, and not reported.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tracheal Intubation</head><p><s>Tracheal intubation was defined as insertion of a tracheal or tracheostomy tube during the cardiac arrest.</s><s>The end of the cardiac arrest was when the patient had return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or when resuscitation was terminated without ROSC.</s><s>Unsuccessful intubation attempts are not registered as intubations in the registry.</s><s>The time to tracheal intubation was defined as the interval in whole minutes from loss of pulses until the tracheal tube was inserted.</s><s>All times in the GWTG-R registry are collected in whole minutes.</s><s>As such, a time to tracheal intubation of 0 minutes indicates that the tracheal intubation was performed within the same whole minute that pulses were lost, a time of 1 minute indicates that tracheal intubation was performed within the next whole minute, and so on.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p><s>The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge.</s><s>Secondary outcomes were ROSC and favorable functional outcome at hospital discharge.</s><s>ROSC was defined as no further need for chest compressions (including cardiopulmonary bypass) sustained for at least 20 minutes.</s><s>A cerebral performance category score of 1 (mild or no neurological deficit) or 2 (moderate cerebral disability) was considered a good functional outcome consistent with current Utstein guidelines. <ref type="bibr">10</ref></s><s>The cerebral performance category score was determined by data abstractors reviewing the medical record.</s><s>Abstractors assessing outcomes were not blinded to exposure status but were unaware of the hypothesis of the current study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>The statistical analysis plan for the current study largely follows that of a recent, similar GWTG-R study in children. <ref type="bibr">11</ref></s><s>Categorical variables are presented as counts (frequencies), and continuous variables are presented as medians (interquartile ranges [IQRs]).</s><s>Independent categorical variables were compared with the χ 2 test, and the Cochran-Armitage test was used to test for trends in tracheal intubation over time.</s></p><p><s>To assess the adjusted association between tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest and survival to hospital discharge, this study used time-dependent propensity scorematching. 12</s><s>This approach has previously been used in studies analyzing time-dependent cardiac arrest interventions, <ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> and it is designed to account for the fact that the intubation procedure might not occur during the cardiac arrest if ROSC or termination of efforts occurs first.</s><s>The propensity score was calculated based on a Cox proportional hazards model with intubation during the cardiac arrest as the dependent variable and with all variables included in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> as independent variables.</s><s>Additional details are provided in the eAppendix in the Supplement.</s></p><p><s>Next, 1:1 risk set matching on the propensity score was performed using a nearest neighbormatching algorithm with a maximum caliber of 0.01 of the propensity score.</s><s>Patients being intubated at any given minute (from minute 0 to minute 15) were separately and sequentially propensity score matched with a patient who was at risk of being intubated within the same minute. 11</s><s>At-risk patients included those who were still undergoing resuscitation and were not intubated before or within the same minute.</s><s>At-risk patients therefore also included patients who were intubated later, as the matching should not be dependent on future events. 11-14</s><s>As such, the matched group with no intubation includes patients who subsequently were intubated (although later than their matched counterpart).</s><s>For additional details on the rationale for and interpretation of this type of analysis and matching, see the eAppendix in the Supplement.</s></p><p><s>To assess the performance of the matching, baseline characteristics were compared with standardized differences where a difference less than 0.1 is generally considered negligible. <ref type="bibr">15</ref></s><s>Using the matched cohort, modified Poisson regression was performed to assess the association between tracheal intubation during cardiac arrest and survival to hospital discharge, obtaining risk ratios (RRs) with robust variance estimates. <ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">17</ref></s><s>To account for the matching and potential clustering within hospitals, generalized estimating equations were used as described by Miglioretti and Heagerty. <ref type="bibr">18</ref></s><s>Results are reported from the regression models as RRs with 95% confidence intervals.</s><s>The analysis was repeated for the secondary outcomes.</s></p><p><s>This study tested whether the association between tracheal intubation and survival to hospital discharge differed according to a number of pre specified subgroups: initial rhythm (shockable [pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation] vs nonshockable [asystole or pulseless electrical activity]), timing of the matching (0-4, 5-9, and 10-15 minutes), illness category, whether the patient had preceding respiratory insufficiency (see eTable 1 in the Supplement for definition), and the location of the event.</s><s>Subgroup differences were tested by adding an interaction between the intubation variable and the subgroup variable of interest to the modified Poisson regression model in the propensitymatched cohort.</s><s>As a post hoc analysis, this study also considered the interaction when treating timing of the matching as a continuous linear variable.</s><s>To account for missing data, multiple imputations were performed as described in thee Appendix in the Supplement.</s><s>As a post hoc analysis, we used non-time-dependent propensity score matching (see the eAppendix in the Supplement for details).</s></p><p><s>All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, with a significance level of P &lt; .05.</s><s>All secondary analyses should be considered exploratory as no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. <ref type="bibr">19</ref></s><s>Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).</s><s>The statistical analysis plan was outlined and agreed on by the entire author group before any analyses were performed unless stated otherwise.</s></p></div>
