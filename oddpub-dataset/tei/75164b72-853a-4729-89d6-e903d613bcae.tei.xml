(15) recently reported data supporting this concept.</s><s>This would also explain the putative discrepancy between our patients with PH-HFpEF having a mean PVR of 7 WU and the previous reports mentioned earlier, which provided either no resistance data (2,27) or a median PVR of 2.6 WU (28).</s><s>The survival curves in the 3 patient populations studied herein were almost superimposable.</s><s>In the ASPIRE (Assessing the Spectrum of Pulmonary Hypertension Identified at a Referral Centre) registry (20), patients with PH-HFpEF had a 3-year-survival rate &gt;80%, compared with 62% in our series.</s><s>In contrast to our patients, patients with PH-HFpEF in ASPIRE had lower PVR values and normal cardiac output.</s><s>It is conceivable that our patients' more severe PH contributed to their higher mortality.</s><s>This notion was supported by the fact that PH and right heart failure were listed as cause of death in 32% of the patients with PH-HFpEF in our series.</s><s>Our data supported the hypothesis that there may be a disease continuum ranging from typical IPAH through atypical IPAH to PH-HFpEF (Central Illustration).</s><s>As in many other fields of medicine, clinical classifications were introduced to clarify complex biological systems, but often single cut-off values failed to separate disease entities, especially in multifactorial diseases and in aging patient populations (13).</s><s>The hemodynamic separation of prefrom post-capillary PH by the PAWP threshold of 15 mm Hg might be such an example.</s><s>On the basis of data presented here, it is most likely that a number of our patients have been labeled as IPAH despite the presence of several risk factors (as defined earlier) predisposing for the development of post-capillary PH.</s><s>In the AMBITION trial, this phenomenon was observed during the early enrollment period, which led to modification of the inclusion criteria preventing further enrollment of patients with 3 or more risk</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
