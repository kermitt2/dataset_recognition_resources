<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>Between August 2010 and May 2015, 166 severe COPD patients were assessed prior to ELVR by the Chartis console (Pulmonx) at our hospital, and the assessments were retrospectively analyzed.</s><s>The anonymous analysis of the Chartis assessments was approved by the local ethics committee with the study goals to specify how many phenotypes could be identified using Chartis and what the exact criteria are of the variables used to distinguish these Chartis phenotypes (EA1/064/12).</s></p><p><s>Initially, the patients had an ambulant visit to the outpatient clinic to be evaluated for ELVR treatment.</s><s>At this visit, the patients had a physical examination, optimizations for COPD medication and oxygen therapy, pulmonary function and diffusion tests (Weinmann, Germany), a six-minute walk test, the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire and blood gas analysis that included testing the carboxyhemoglobin levels.</s><s>The patients were instructed to exhaust all conservative treatment options such as a cure with optimization of physiotherapy before considering ELVR with valves.</s></p><p><s>From December 2010 to February 2015, 52 patients without CV as determined by the new Chartis criteria were treated with endobronchial valves.</s><s>The clinical outcomes of these patients following valve insertion were evaluated with the approval of the local ethics committee (EA1/136/13) with the aim to analyze how the different Chartis phenotypes respond to valve treatment.</s></p><p><s>The inclusion criteria for ELVR treatment were patients over 40 years of age diagnosed with severe lung emphysema, GOLD stage III or IV, and a nonsmoker status verified by carboxyhemoglobin levels below 2.0%.</s><s>The exclusion criteria were a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) either below 15% of the predicted value (pred.)</s><s>or above 45% pred., a residual volume (RV) below 150% pred., a total lung capacity below 100%, or major comorbidities, such as significant pulmonary hypertension or unstable cardiac conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chartis Assessment</head><p><s>The CV was assessed with the Chartis console in an ambulant bronchoscopic setting.</s><s>As a premedication, patients were given 50 mg pethidine to reduce coughing during measurement.</s><s>To minimize bronchial secretions, 0.5 mg atropine was administered if the pulse rate fell below 100 beats/min.</s></p><p><s>The Chartis assessments were taken under spontaneous breathing.</s><s>For the bronchoscopic sedation, 2.5-5.0 mg midazolam and 10-20 mg propofol boli (up to 400 mg maximum) were used.</s><s>All patients were intubated with a 7.5 endotracheal tube with a separate oxygen tube (Bronchoflex, Rüsch, Germany) to keep the central airways open and to ease the insertion and removal of the bronchoscope.</s><s>The patients received 2-6 liters/min oxygen, continuously assessed during bronchoscopy according to oxygen saturation.</s></p><p><s>The Chartis system includes a catheter with an inflatable balloon at its tip and an external console to record the measurements.</s><s>After instillation of 10-15 ml 1% lidocaine into the tracheobronchial tree and target lobes for local anesthesia, the Chartis catheter was inserted via the working channel of the bronchoscope (Pen-taxEurope, Hamburg) and placed in front of the ostium of the target lobe's main bronchus.</s><s>The balloon was then inflated until the bronchus was completely sealed.</s><s>The tip of the catheter was placed in a manner that allowed airflow from all segments of the target lobe to reach the catheter tip.</s><s>A complete sealing of the target lobe by the balloon was maintained throughout the measurement period, including the 10-second pre-and postassessment periods.</s></p><p><s>Chartis assessments were included in this study only if they had detectable expiratory flows (ExpF) during the pre-and postassessment periods.</s><s>ExpF, inspiratory pressure, total exhaled volume (TVol) and the ratio of inspiratory pressure to ExpF, termed resistance (Rndx), were recorded by the Chartis console in real time (Rrt) and visually shown on the display ( fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ).</s><s>The Rndx is the average of the Rrt over the course of the measurement period.</s><s>The measurement time lasted longer than 4 min, stopping earlier only if there was an increase in the Rndx greater than 10 cm H 2 O × s/ ml, as recently suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> , or if the ExpF showed a trend towards zero, both criteria applying to the CV-phenotype.</s><s>As an assessment algorithm, the primary and secondary target lobes were measured in sequence.</s><s>If the assessments were inconclusive with regard to the presence or absence of CV, such as with the low flow (LF) or some low plateau (LP) phenotypes, the corresponding ipsilateral lobe was measured.</s><s>In the case of significant artifacts during assessments preventing a conclusive phenotype, the Chartis assessment was repeated.</s><s>If the LF phenotype turned into a CV+ or CV-phenotype in the second assessment, only the second assessment was included into the study.</s><s>If several assessments were available for one lobe, only the assessment with the best quality was used.</s><s>The middle lobe (ML) was excluded from all analyses in this study because it has too little volume to be a primary target for valve therapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of Chartis Criteria by Visual Assessment and Software-Based Analyses</head><p><s>All Chartis assessments were visually categorized into the Chartis phenotypes.</s><s>The Chartis phenotypes were analyzed by software (LabView, National Instruments, USA) with respect to the parameters which are displayed on the Chartis console in realtime: expiratory peak flow (ExpF, ml/min), Rndx (unit: cm H 2 O × s/ml) and TVol (ml), after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min of Chartis measurement time.</s><s>The ExpF corresponds to the percentage change in ExpF peaks relative to the last ExpF peak before the start of the measurement.</s><s>The Rndx was calculated by the Chartis console.</s><s>The Chartis cutoff criteria were defined from these values.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Validation of Chartis Criteria</head><p><s>To validate the Chartis criteria obtained from the visual and software analyses of the 304 available measurements, 100 consecutive Chartis assessments taken between 07/2011 and 05/2012 were randomly chosen, printed and numbered in a blinded fashion.</s><s>Seven readers (4th-year medical students) were asked to phenotype these 100 assessments using the new criteria.</s><s>They were provided with the description of each phenotype (online suppl.</s><s>table 1; see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000442886</s><s>for all online suppl.</s><s>material) and with sample photographs taken by the authors ( fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ) to assist in the evaluation.</s><s>To assess the intraobserver agreement, all students made a second evaluation of the same 100 Chartis assessments in reverse order on the day following the first evaluation.</s><s>The authors most familiar with Chartis assessments determined the correct phenotype of all the evaluations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endobronchial Valve Treatment</head><p><s>The patients were hospitalized 1 day prior to ELVR valve treatment and examined for stable condition.</s><s>The bronchoscopic setting including premedication and the sedation protocol were the same as in the bronchoscopic setting for the Chartis assessments.</s><s>Zephyr valves (Pulmonx) in three sizes (4.0, 4.0-LP and 5.5) were used.</s><s>For complete occlusion, valves were inserted into lobar, segmental or subsegmental bronchi according to the patient's individual lung anatomy.</s><s>Radiologists and pneumologists defined the target lobe for treatment by the absence of CV and the highest emphysema distribution and/or lung destruction.</s><s>After ELVR, all patients were hospitalized and discharged at the earliest 4 days after valve implantation if they were in stable conditions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantification of Computed Tomography</head><p><s>Computed tomography (CT) was performed before the Chartis assessment to quantify the lung emphysema in the lobes.</s><s>Another CT was taken at follow-up to evaluate the target lobe volume reduction (TLVR).</s><s>It was performed using the MeVisPULMO software (Fraunhofer MEVIS, Germany).</s><s>A TLVR of &gt;350 ml in the target lobe defined the significant cutoff criterion for lung volume reduction.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-Up</head><p><s>At 3 months, patients underwent a physical examination, pulmonary function tests and CT scans analyzed with Pulmo3D to determine TLVR.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analyses</head><p><s>The Chartis phenotypes were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with respect to TVol, ExpF and Rndx at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min.</s><s>The χ 2 test and the Fisher's exact test for discrete variables were used for the statistical analysis of categorical variables.</s><s>The ordinal variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test.</s><s>A p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</s><s>Cohen's kappa was used to calculate the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of the Chartis criteria.</s><s>The data are displayed as mean ± standard deviation.</s><s>SPSS (IBM, version 20) was used for the statistical analyses.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Chartis represents a real-time measurement of dynamic changes in the collaterals of COPD lungs.</s><s>Although there is still no gold standard for the detection of CV, visual analysis of fissure integrity from CT scans and quantitative CT (e.g.</s><s>VIDA diagnostics ® ) are potential alternatives to Chartis, and eventually a combination of the methods is needed to select the most appropriate candidates for ELVR.</s><s>A recent study showed that pneumologists and radiologists agree at most moderately in visual fissure analysis and concluded that the visual analysis might require experienced chest radiologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>Quantitative CT is a potential alternative to Chartis and has recently shown comparable results for selecting appropriate patients for ELVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> .</s><s>The Chartis measurement is known to be complicated particularly in patients with difficult anatomy, coughing or when mucous clogs the tip of the Chartis catheter.</s><s>In our data set, about 90% of the assessments were conclusive, and in our clinic, the number of inconsistent measurements due to artifacts has decreased with the increasing experience of the bronchoscopists.</s><s>The rate of inconclusive assessments decreased from 20% in 2011 to 8% in 2015.</s><s>Inconclusive assessments consisted of the Chartis tip touching the bronchial wall, coughing artifacts, secret occlusion of the tip or when the patient was exhaling on exertion during the assessment (see examples in online suppl.</s><s>fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In this context, premedication with drugs such as atropine or pethidine helped in our hands to reduce endobronchial secretion and coughing; nevertheless, it is mandatory that the contraindications and side effects of these drugs be considered.</s><s>Interestingly, some assessments also showed a sudden drop in flow accompanied by a sharp increase in the Rndx (example in online suppl.</s><s>fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>) mainly in CV-phenotype lobes at the end of the assessment, probably due to a dynamic collapse similar to that in the LF phenotype.</s></p><p><s>Only the CV-phenotype has been described to benefit from ELVR with valves.</s><s>Various studies have shown no significant improvement in CV+ patient groups, and we did not treat this phenotype with valves <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, criteria are urgently required for a reliable discrimination of the Chartis CV-and CV+ phenotypes.</s><s>This is the first analysis providing adequate cutoff criteria for phenotyping Chartis assessments of CV.</s><s>CV+ was characterized by no significant decrease in ExpF below 50% and no significant increase in the Rndx above 3 cm H 2 O × s/ml, within the 5 min of measurement time.</s><s>In many CV+ lobes, there was a continuous air supply from the adjacent lobes through collaterals into the target lobe, which explained the high TVol of more than 750 ml during the measurement period.</s><s>After 3 min, 79% of CV+ had an ExpF over 80%, while all of CV-and LP demonstrated an ExpF below 80%, suggesting this cutoff criterion to be helpful in phenotyping a majority of CV+ assessments at only 3 min of measurement time.</s></p><p><s>CV-was characterized by a gradual decline in ExpF below 20% and a corresponding increase in the Rndx of more than 3 cm H 2 O × s/ml.</s><s>TVol remained below 750 ml during the measurement period because CV-lobes are fully occluded with no other air supply from the other lobes during the Chartis assessment.</s><s>As a consequence, CV-demonstrated shorter measurement times than did CV+ and LP lobes.</s></p><p><s>LF became evident quickly, following only a few breaths, such that measurement times never exceeded 30 s ( fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> ).</s><s>LF showed an abrupt decrease in ExpF towards zero and a corresponding sharp increase in the Rndx of more than 100 cm H 2 O × s/ml.</s><s>There was almost no flow detected in TVol, such that synonymously LF might also be termed 'no flow'.</s><s>There are currently several hypotheses about the causes of LF: A possible explanation is the presence of CV in the LF Chartis-measured lobe.</s><s>According to this hypothesis, the presence of collateral channels results in the exhaled air finding alternate paths of lower resistance to flow out, which is perceived as an airway with LF by the Chartis console.</s><s>Since we have assessed many ipsilateral lobes as CV-, we think the presence of CV is an unlikely explanation for all LF.</s><s>Another hypothesis suggests distal airway collapse due to inherent properties of the airway or due to the Chartis catheter itself limiting the lumen of the airways.</s><s>A blockage of the catheter by secretions or the apposition of the catheter against the airway is also possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> .</s><s>We repeated the LF assessments in a large cohort being careful to exclude measurement artifacts and the majority of assessments showed the LF pattern again.</s></p><p><s>LF was almost always seen in LL, and thus almost never in UL, suggesting that the parenchyma in LL is more vulnerable to collapsing.</s><s>As a sign of collapsed airways, TVol was less than 50 ml, another typical pattern of LF.</s><s>LF does not allow the conclusions regarding the presence of collateral channels in this specific lobe that fissure analysis by CT scan does.</s><s>A possible option to detect the presence or absence of CV in LF LL in the right lung might be the occlusion of the right middle lobe by another Chartis balloon and the simultaneous Chartis measurement of right upper lobe (RUL).</s><s>Another theoretical option for better characterization of CV might include the application of a reverse Chartis flow into the lung resulting in an increased pressure in CV-lobes, whereas in CV+ lobes the pressure would remain unchanged.</s><s>A Chartis assessment of the ipsilateral UL is recommended prior to valve treatment to decide whether the patient can be treated with valves (ipsilateral lobes CV-) or not (ipsilateral lobes CV+).</s><s>We successfully applied this algorithm in treating LF patients.</s></p><p><s>LP is a newly identified phenotype that could not be assigned to either CV-or CV+.</s><s>It is characterized by a CV-like pattern at the beginning of the measurement period, which is followed by a gradual decline in ExpF below 50% that reaches a plateau in ExpF above 20%.</s><s>The Rndx remains lower than 3 cm H 2 O × s/ml, resembling the CV+ curve pattern during a measurement time of 5 min, but which can be distinguished from a CV+ assessment by the decrease in ExpF below 50%.</s><s>LP might take an intermediate position between CV+ and CV-phenotypes, and a measurement time of more than 5 min is recommended to evaluate whether the LP pattern converts into a CV-phenotype by a decrease in ExpF together with  a corresponding increase in Rndx above 3.</s><s>The causes of LP are elusive, but the remaining ExpF during the measurement period may suggest the presence of micro-collaterals between the lobes.</s><s>The exclusion of CV in the ipsilateral lobes and a fissure analysis are further options in deciding whether an LP lobe can be treated with valves or not.</s></p><p><s>The clinical outcomes were similar in the treated patients with CV-UL, CV-LL or LF LL phenotypes.</s><s>The prognostic importance of LF was previously unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> .</s><s>The outcomes of this study suggest that patients with the LF phenotype can successfully be treated with valves after exclusion of CV in the ipsilateral UL.</s><s>These treatment outcomes provide evidence that there was an efficient selection of our patients for ELVR as a result of using the precise Chartis criteria.</s><s>An algorithm for Chartis assessments and recommendations with respect to ELVR with valves is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> .</s><s>There are no valid outcome data to assess whether LP phenotypes respond to ELVR.</s><s>Only 1 of the 9 LP patients from Chartis analysis received valves in the LP lobe, but the valves had to be removed early due to frequent exacerbations and the lack of subjective improvement.</s><s>Two LP patients in RUL and LUL were valve targeted in the ipsilateral adjacent LL due to a higher emphysema distribution and lung destruction, and showed comparable results to the CV-and LF cohort at 3 months.</s><s>Future studies based on more LP patients treated with valves are urgently required to evaluate whether LP is an appropriate phenotype for ELVR.</s></p><p><s>Among further possible limitations of the study are the retrospective design and the lack of patient randomization; thus, selection bias cannot be excluded and only data that were recorded in patients' files could be assessed.</s><s>In most patients, we did not measure all five lung lobes, which would have given us interesting information about the distribution of the Chartis phenotypes in COPD lungs and additional information supporting deductive reasoning on the fissure integrity.</s><s>We do not know whether the criteria are applicable to Chartis assessments of the mid-dle lobe because too few assessments of the middle lobe were recorded to be included into the study primarily because, due to its small volume, the middle lobe was not targeted for valve therapy.</s><s>Furthermore, we did not control the Chartis results with other radiological methods, such as a CT scan, which may have given further information about the phenotypes and their distribution in the lung.</s><s>With respect to reproducibility, we could provide second assessments for some but not all Chartis assessments.</s><s>All Chartis assessments were done under spontaneous breathing; the cutoff criteria are probably different when the Chartis assessments are performed under ventilation.</s><s>Applying positive pressure ventilation to Chartis assessment might provide more accurate information about CV because some collaterals might only open under ventilation and remain closed under spontaneous breathing.</s><s>Therefore, it would be very interesting to compare the outcome data of patients with mismatched Chartis results between spontaneous breathing and positive pressure ventilation.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, our analyses and conclusions are based on a large number of patients and Chartis-measured lobes, and the criteria were effective and reproducible in assessments under spontaneous breathing.</s></p><p><s>In summary, this study describes the most prevalent Chartis phenotypes in COPD patients: CV+, CV-, LF and LP using Chartis visual patterns and cutoff values for ExpF, Rndx and TVol.</s><s>While patients with CV-target lobe or LF target lobe and ipsilateral adjacent CV-lobe may successfully be treated with valves, it remains unclear whether patients with LP target lobe improve after valve treatment.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.
