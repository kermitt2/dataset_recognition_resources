Hann, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, one study on the effects of interventions targeting patient-HCP communication concluded that the interventions had only small, though significant, effect sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kelly et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In HIV care, there is limited evidence supporting that positive patient-HCP interactions are associated with increased likelihood of viral suppression, higher CD4 count, less severe symptom experiences, better quality of life (QOL), and long-term survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lee, Rand, Ellen, &amp; Agwu, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One study has shown that strong patient-HCP relationships can enhance self-efficacy and then study participants presented with better ART adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Johnson et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Another study found a significant association between patient-HCP relationships and improved physical health and functioning, as well as an improved engagement in care, especially in HIV-infected men who have sex with men <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bankoff, McCullough, &amp;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample, settings, and procedures</head><p><s>This study utilized a secondary data analysis approach and analyzed a pooled sample from two related, yet independent studies that focused primarily on self- management among local PLWHA.</s><s>These projects stemmed from ongoing research partnerships among the same group of investigators across several universities, Taipei City Hospital-Kunming (TCH) and Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center (SPHCC).</s><s>The survey component of the research involved Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) questionnaires given to 227 PLWHA who were receiving care at TCH and SPHCC.</s></p><p><s>The data were collected from April 2011 to November 2012 at TCH and November 2009 to March 2010 at SPHCC.</s><s>TCH and SPHCC clinicians informed patients from outpatient clinics during their routine clinical visits about the studies and referred them to non-clinical research personnel who then explained the study, answered questions, and obtained signed written consent.</s><s>The inclusion criteria included (a) diagnosed with HIV, (b) taking ART currently, and (c) at least 18 years old.</s><s>Prospective participants who passed the inclusion criteria and agreed to voluntarily participate in the studies were then led to a separate room where they can anonymously answer the surveys on the ACASI system.</s><s>All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the designated institutions.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p><s>In this study, several variables were chosen for statistical modeling, including demographics, recent CD4 counts, self-efficacy, patient-HCP relationship, adherence, and medication-taking difficulties.</s><s>These instruments have been previously tested in Chinese populations and have shown strong reliability and validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Holzemer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Shively, Smith, Bormann, &amp; Gifford, 2002)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p><s>Participants' age, sex, education level, and residency were collected via self-report.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient-HCP relationships</head><p><s>This is a 13-item scale designed to assess how individuals rate their interactions with their HCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bakken et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Cronbach's alpha reliability estimate was 0.96 in the U.S. based study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bakken et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>A Chinese version of the scale has been tested and published <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Each item is measured on a 4-point scale (1 = always true and 4 = never true).</s><s>Lower scores indicate greater provider engagement.</s><s>Cronbach's alpha reliability estimate in this sample was 0.94.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HIV self-efficacy (HIV-SE)</head><p><s>This scale is derived from the HIV-SE 34-item scale to measure self-efficacy for specific disease management behaviors in PLWHA.</s><s>The adapted scale measures two conceptual domains: managing medication and managing symptoms.</s><s>Each item describes a skill related to increasing degrees of confidence in management.</s><s>A 9point scale indicating how confident the respondent is of his/her ability to manage the disease is anchored by "not at all sure" at the low end and "totally sure" at the high end.</s><s>Internal consistency reliabilities in previous studies ranged from 0.88 to 0.97 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Shively et al., 2002)</ref> and in this sample was 0.82 to 0.90.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective medication-taking barriers</head><p><s>This nine-item survey measures reasons for missed medications.</s><s>This came from the revised AIDS Clinical Trials Group that collected reasons for non-adherence to medications <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Holzemer et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 = never to 3 = often <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Holzemer et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>A higher score indicates a lower level of adherence to medication regimens.</s><s>Cronbach's alpha for these two subscales and the total scale ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Holzemer et al., 2006)</ref> and in this sample was 0.82 to 0.91.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adherence</head><p><s>The participants were asked to do a 3-day and 30-day recall of any missed medication doses.</s><s>These two visual analog scales were designed to collect data on 3-day and 30-day adherence of the study participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Walsh, Mandalia, &amp; Gazzard, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The questions assess 3day and 30-day ART adherence, reporting separately for each drug, along a continuum from "took all of my doses" to "missed all of my doses."</s><s>Results returned by this scale have been shown to correspond with those reported by other adherence measures such as electronic monitoring caps for measuring the number of times a pill bottle has been opened <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Walsh et al., 2002)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CD4</head><p><s>The most recent CD4 counts to the data collected time were assessed by self-report.</s><s>Because the distribution of the CD4 counts was positively skewed, Yeo-Johnson transformation was applied to transform the CD4 value to an approximately normal distribution.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p><s>Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to examine the distributions of selected factors and the relationships among patient-HCP relationship, self-efficacy, medication-taking difficulties, adherence, CD4, and background characteristics.</s><s>For correlation analyses, we applied Pearson's r and Point-Biserial correlations according to the nature of the distributions of the selected variables.</s><s>Then we utilized SEM to test the proposed model.</s><s>First, we built a measurement model to create a latent variable (adherence to medication schedule) with three observed adherence indicators.</s><s>After we built the measurement model, we further tested the structural relationships among patient-HCP relationship, self-efficacy, medication-taking difficulties, adherence, and CD4 count.</s><s>In both models, we applied several model-fit criteria to judge the overall fit of the model to the data.</s><s>These criteria included Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) &lt; .07, the 90% Confidence Interval of RMSEA, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) &gt; .90, and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) &gt; .90.</s><s>To achieve a more parsimonious model, we further removed parameters that did not significantly differ from zero.</s><s>These adjustments were made with assistance of formal testing (chi-square test) and modification indices in order to maintain the excellent fit between the model and data.</s><s>We also adjusted the estimates by controlling key demographic backgrounds, including site, age, gender, and educational attainment.</s><s>Then, we calculated the direct and indirect effects of these factors to investigate the relationships between patient-HCP relationship and CD4 through different pathways.</s><s>Because this study drew upon samples from two different sites, we applied a cluster-robust Huber-White estimator to calculate the standard error for statistical inferences.</s><s>All tests were conducted using Stata 13 statistical packages.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural equation modeling</head><p><s>As measurement model only included three indicators, without additional constraints it was a saturated model and fit indices and Chi-Square test were not applicable.</s><s>However, since all the standardized loadings were close to or greater than 0.6 and statistically significant, it was suggested that the underlying latent construct, adherence to medication, can largely explain the observed variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>It is acceptable to include a latent construct that is just-identified if the overall structural model is over-identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Mora, Gelman, Steenkamp, &amp; Raisinghani, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Also, as shown by the fit indices that for the proposed model x 2 (18) = 19.206,</s><s>p = .379,</s><s>RMSEA = 0.017 (90% CI: 0.001-0.063,</s><s>P-Close = 0.852), CFI = 0.997 &amp; TLI = 0.997, suggesting the proposed structural model fit well to the data.</s><s>However, because the relationship between HCP-patient relationships and medication-taking difficulties was insignificant, we further suppressed this relationship to zero, which yielded slightly better AIC (proposed: 9021.571 vs. reduced: 9020.639) and BIC (proposed: 9175.495 vs. reduced: 9171.142)</s><s>values while the likelihood ratio test showed insignificant result (x 2</s></p><p><s>(1) = 1.070, p = .302).</s><s>This suggested that the reduced model fit as well as the proposed model.</s><s>The model fit indices for the reduced model were x 2 (19) = 20.274,</s><s>p = .378,</s><s>RMSEA = 0.017 (90% CI: 0.001-0.062,</s><s>P-Close = 0.860), CFI = 0.997 &amp; TLI = 0.993.</s><s>To achieve a more parsimonious model, therefore, we selected the reduced model to be our final model, as presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our data and models are consistent with an explanation that patients' positive relationships with HCP enhance medication self-efficacy, leading to better ART adherence and achievement of elevated CD4 counts.</s><s>Given the self-efficacy and medication-taking difficulties for PLWHA, a focus on improving healthy patient-HCP relationships is warranted as a potential mechanism to better ART adherence and consequently, enhanced CD4 counts and stronger immune function <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Johnson et al., 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our results echo previous studies that indicate a significant difference in patient engagement with HCPs, and specifically, studies showing that those who experience less engagement with their providers have lower medication self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Tyer-Viola et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Other studies have supported that better physician-patient collaboration is positively associated with better medication adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arbuthnott &amp;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitation</head><p><s>There are several limitations in this study.</s><s>First, this is a cross-sectional study.</s><s>Therefore, any associations among variables should not be taken to imply causality.</s><s>Future longitudinal studies should be conducted to further causally test these relationships.</s><s>Second, we recruited study participants from two major East Asian metropolitans with distinct healthcare systems.</s><s>PLWHA in other locations might not share the same experiences and the findings might not be generalizable to all culturally Chinese PLWHA.</s><s>Third, our participants were referred by clinicians and those who were dissatisfied with their HCP might choose not to participate.</s><s>Fourth, our selection of measurement was limited by the available data.</s><s>The measurements for adherence, for instance, may not be sufficiently sensitive because of their varied timeframes but were available in both datasets.</s><s>Fifth, although this study harmonized two datasets to increase the sample size, the additional Monte Carlo studies revealed that this sample size did not have sufficient power for two parameters in our proposed model.</s><s>Our sample size also prevented us from including additional latent variables to further handle potential measurement errors.</s><s>Last, in this model, we focus on the physical variables; therefore, many possible mental health variables were not discussed.</s><s>For example, depressive symptoms and perceived stigma might be also play important role on ART adherence.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>In this paper, we examined the association among patient-HCP relationships, medication self-efficacy, medication-taking difficulties, ART adherence, and CD4 counts in PLWHA.</s><s>The analysis is consistent with our model that medication self-efficacy and medication-taking difficulties mediators of patients' ability to achieve maximum adherence, and to maintain high CD4 counts over time.</s><s>Future interventions should be designed to enhance self-management and provide better patient-HCP communication.</s><s>This improved communication will enhance medication self-efficacy and decrease medication-taking difficulties.</s><s>This will improve medication adherence and immune function among PLWHA.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure1.</s><s>Hypothesized model.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
