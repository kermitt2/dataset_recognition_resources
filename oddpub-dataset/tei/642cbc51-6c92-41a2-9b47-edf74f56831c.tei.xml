<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The morphological evaluation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer is gaining momentum as evidence strengthens for the clinical relevance of this immunological biomarker.</s><s>Accumulating evidence suggests that the extent of lymphocytic infiltration in tumor tissue can be assessed as a major parameter by evaluation of (H&amp;E) hematoxylin and eosin-stained tumor sections.</s><s>TILs have been shown to provide prognostic and potentially predictive value, particularly in triple negative and HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.</s></p><p><s>Design: A standardized methodology for evaluating TILs is now needed as a prerequisite for integrating this parameter in standard histopathological practice, in a research setting as well as in clinical trials.</s><s>This article reviews current data on the clinical validity and utility of TILs in breast cancer in an effort to foster better knowledge and insight in this rapidly evolving field, and to develop a standardized methodology for visual assessment on H&amp;E-sections, acknowledging the future potential of molecular/multiplexed approaches.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key message</head><p><s>Several translational studies based on phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are a robust prognostic factor in TNBC.</s><s>For HER2-positive breast cancer, TILs in baseline samples have been associated with higher responses to trastuzumab and chemotherapy treatment.</s><s>There is therefore a need for harmonizing the histological approach to assess the percentage of stromal TILs in primary tumor specimens prior to therapy.</s><s>The goal of this article is to facilitate the use of TILs as a biomarker in research and clinical trial settings, and ultimately in diagnostic practice.</s><s>Herein, the current fundamental concepts for TILs-evaluation are laid out by pathologists to foster their widespread use and consistent interpretation at this early stage.</s><s>The recommendations illustrated in this manuscript focus on: 1) what areas to examine in the tumor, 2) how to score the TILs, and 3) why TILs are clinically relevant.</s><s>This information should provide a platform for pathologists to further engage in efforts leading to procedural standardization of this biomarker assay.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context of research:</head><p><s>A panel of pathology, clinical oncology, biostatisticians and translational research experts conducted a systematic review of the literature.</s><s>Panel members invited have had experience in TIL-assessment in phase III-trials or are involved in breast cancer translational research focused on the interactions between immunology and breast cancer.</s><s>There are no existing guidelines on TIL-assessment in breast cancer available for comparison; neither is there proficiency testing data available from international organizations.</s><s>No specific funding was obtained for this project.</s></p><p><s>For details on prognosis, prospective-retrospective phase III trials were the main basis for these recommendations.</s><s>However, we searched PubMed from Jan 1 2009 to April 30 2014 for full reports of studies involving clinical trial datasets or large institutional cohorts and evaluation of TILs, CD8+, CD3+ or immune gene signatures in primary breast cancer.</s><s>Studies were not limited to randomized trials, but included also large consecutive and retrospective series.</s><s>Inpress publications were also taken into consideration.</s><s>With regards to specific TILs pathological assessment, the panel undertook a formal expert consensus-based process by regular mail, teleconferences as well as two F2F-meetings by the writing committee (RS, SL, SdM, KWG, SA) to produce these recommendations.</s><s>Draft manuscripts were circulated by email to all co-authors and the writing committee had responsibility for approving the final manuscript.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>A fundamental role of the immune system is maintenance of tissue homeostasis by continuous immunosurveillance and initiation of inflammatory reactions that involve the coordinated activation of innate and adaptive immune cells <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Neoplastic transformation alters the orderly structure of tissues and induces immune responses that can eliminate incipient tumors.</s><s>In situations where elimination is incomplete neoplastic transformation of cells is able to escape immune control.</s><s>This process has been best conceptualized by the cancer immunoediting theory, which is supported by a large body of experimental data and clinical evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Immunoediting defines malignant progression on the basis of tumor and immune cell interactions in three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape.</s><s>While patients are most frequently diagnosed in the escape phase, this relationship between the tumor and host immunity continues to evolve and sometimes with it the magnitude of the anti-tumor immune response.</s></p><p><s>Even at advanced disease stages, immune parameters have now been recognized as directly or indirectly influencing patient survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recently, new therapies that reactivate anticancer immune-responses to cancer, for example in melanomas and lung cancer, have entered clinical practice and have improved outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">48]</ref>.</s><s>Several recent clinical studies have evaluated the prognostic and predictive importance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer (BC).</s><s>Some of these studies used similar methodological approaches for evaluating TILs, which allows for comparison of the results.</s><s>The foreseen inclusion of TILs assessment in current and future clinical studies and diagnostic assessments necessitates a detailed description of a standardized methodology.</s></p><p><s>In December 2013, a group of investigators from around the world representing major breast cancer research and clinical teams convened to candidly discuss the important parameters to consider as well as methodological obstacles in evaluating TILs in breast cancer.</s><s>The group at KU Leuven University Library on September 13, 2014 http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/</s><s>Downloaded from recognized the need to provide the breast cancer community with consensus recommendations for TILs-evaluation to foster their integration into future clinical trials, translational research and diagnostic practice.</s><s>These efforts may evolve into the establishment of a breast cancer "immunological grade", reflecting the strength of an individual patient's anti-tumor immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we outline the current fundamental concepts for TILs-evaluation by pathologists to facilitate its widespread use at this stage in our understanding of its relevance for breast cancer.</s><s>The recommendations focus on: 1) what areas to examine in the tumor, 2) how to score the TILs and 3) why TILs are clinically important.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is the composition and role of the immune infiltrate in human breast cancer?</head><p><s>Immune cells infiltrating tumors are frequently observed, but the composition of cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity varies between tumor types or organ sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Cumulative data from murine and human studies have associated most leukocyte subsets with a predominant contribution to either pro-or anti-tumor activities (illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">1</ref>).</s><s>Murine models have identified myeloid lineage leukocytes, including tumor-associated macrophages, dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells as playing a central role in shaping the microenvironment via the factors they produce, towards either an immuno-stimulatory anti-tumor milieu or a wound healing tumor-promoting microenvironment.</s><s>Anti-tumor T cells migrating into these contrasting settings can therefore either be activated or suppressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In turn, macrophage polarization towards pro-tumorigenic M2 or anti-tumor M1 functional phenotypes are regulated by Tlymphocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, highlighting the importance of cellular cross-talk in shaping the tumor microenvironment.</s></p><p><s>Studies in humans have demonstrated a significant association between the presence of specific subsets of immune cells and clinical response in patients with a variety of solid tumors at KU Leuven University Library on September 13, 2014 http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/</s><s>Downloaded from <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that adaptive immunity mediated by T and B lymphocytes provides the critical foundation for effective and sustained anti-tumor responses.</s><s>In breast cancer, extensive tumor infiltration by cytotoxic CD8 + T cells was strongly associated with patient survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">42]</ref> and response to therapy <ref
