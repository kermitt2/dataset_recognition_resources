<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (AECOPD) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization in the United States. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates that 1 out of every 5 patients over the age of 40 who have been hospitalized in the past decade carries a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 2 Given its prevalence in hospitalized patients, COPD and its acute exacerbation pose a heavy financial burden in health care. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> As a result, reducing the frequency of hospitalizations for patients with AECOPD has become a high priority for health care organizations and government agencies, including the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). <ref type="bibr">3</ref></s><s>In 2013, CMS identified the readmission of patients hospitalized for COPD as a measure for hospital performance. <ref type="bibr">3</ref></s><s>Hospitals across the country are assessed on their ability to reduce 30-day all-cause unplanned readmissions after an initial admission for a COPD exacerbation.</s><s>Furthermore, as CMS has tied readmission rates to hospital payments, reducing readmission rates for COPD exacerbation has become a major concern for hospitals.</s></p><p><s>Several previous studies have shown that many risk factors are associated with readmission in patients with AECOPD, including poor lung function, low oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry, history of cor pulmonale, muscle weakness, decreased activity levels, other medical comorbidities, and poor medication reconciliation during hospitalizations. <ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s>In 2013, Park et al found that the prevalence of frailty was 58% higher in patients with COPD aged 55 years or older compared to that of the general population, as assessed by a frailty tool which included weight loss, difficulty walking, weakness, cognitive impairment and vision and hearing impairment. 5</s><s>In 2 cross-sectional studies, Anecchino et al and Holguin et al demonstrated that 68% of patients admitted with AECOPD have at least 1 comorbidity, 16% have 2 or more, and 30% of patients have 4 or more comorbidities. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s>In addition, according to a study by <ref type="bibr">Shah et al,</ref><ref type="bibr">only 27.6%</ref> of all readmissions of COPD carry the same diagnosis as the index admission, 8 suggesting that clinical comorbidities might play an important role in COPD readmissions.</s><s>The increased prevalence of frailty and other comorbidities place patients with COPD at higher than average readmission risk.</s></p><p><s>While prior investigations have suggested that clinical and physiological parameters might be important determinants for COPD readmissions, specific strategies aimed at decreasing readmissions by addressing the factors above have not been formally investigated. 9</s><s>This suggests that other risk factors that have not yet been identified might also play an important role.</s><s>In 2011, Coventry, Gemmell and Todd showed that depression and lack of home ownership were both associated with an increased frequency of readmissions for patients with AECOPD. <ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s>lthough there is conflicting evidence, there is some support for the effect differing levels of social support and socioeconomic factors has on AECOPD readmission.</s><s>Living with a partner was identified as a protective factor for males with COPD, while lower socioeconomic status, inequalities in education, and income were associated with a 3-fold increase in risk for readmission. <ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref></s><s>These findings imply that psychosocial risk factors may also be drivers among patients who are readmitted.</s></p><p><s>Despite the studies mentioned above, there have not been well accepted management modalities and guidelines that address psychosocial risk factors for the prevention of COPD readmissions.</s><s>Furthermore, a patient's ability to follow discharge instructions or take medications as prescribed at home is often poorly assessed, and optimal transition of care to a primary care provider remains challenging. 9</s><s>As COPD exacerbation causes increased hospitalizations and poses a heavy financial burden to society, there is a great interest in decreasing readmissions for COPD exacerbation.</s><s>One approach to reduce readmissions and control costs being utilized is a comprehensive care management program (CCMP).</s><s>A Cochrane review of 26 studies in 2014 demonstrated a reduction in respiratory-related readmissions and hospital days when a CCMP was utilized. 11</s><s>Other studies, however, have shown that such programs have had varied success rates.</s><s>The study was designed to assess the risk factors associated with patients who are readmitted for any reason within 30 days of a COPD exacerbation.</s><s>The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Biomedical Research Alliance of New York Institutional Review Board who determined that informed consent could be waived given the nature of the study.</s><s>All guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient Population</head><p><s>With the implementation of the COPD readmission reduction initiative, patients admitted to Danbury Hospital with a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation were evaluated by a pulmonologist.</s><s>The diagnosis of COPD was made according to the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease standard, 17 defined as a</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This study aims to investigate both clinical and psychosocial risk factors associated with readmissions for COPD exacerbation among patients of an academic community hospital which implemented a CCMP.</s><s>In doing so, we seek to better understand and improve strategies that can further reduce readmissions for patients with COPD exacerbation.</s><s>ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of &lt; 0.7, after bronchodilator use.</s><s>In the absence of pulmonary function tests, presumptive diagnoses were made by the consulting pulmonologist based on risk factors such as a smoking history of more than 20 pack years, the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms, or other corroborating evidence such as the presence of emphysematous changes on a computerized tomography scan or chest radiograph.</s><s>Exacerbation of COPD was defined as increased cough, increased sputum, change in sputum color, or increased dyspnea in a patient with COPD.</s><s>All patients with a diagnosis of AECOPD were included in the study, save for a small number (fewer than 10% of patients) who were cared for by a private communitybased pulmonary group or who expired on the index admission or were on an end-of-life pathway such as being discharged to hospice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Collection</head><p><s>Data were collected and entered by an outpatientbased COPD care navigator.</s><s>A detailed description of variables is listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>Patients' age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) were collected.</s><s>BMI was categorized as underweight (BMI&lt;18.5),</s><s>normal weight (18.5≤</s><s>BMI&lt; 25), overweight (25≤BMI&lt;30), and obese (BMI≥30).</s><s>FEV1 was collected as a marker of COPD severity.</s><s>Clinical comorbidities, including history of obstructive sleep apnea, chronic hypercapnia, congestive heart failure, lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, atrial fibrillation, presence of musculoskeletal disorders, cognitive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and smoking status were also assessed.</s><s>Smoking status was categorized as current smoker, former smoker who quit within 3 months of index admission, former smoker who quit more than 3 months prior to index admission, and lifetime nonsmoker.</s><s>Psychosocial risk factors including anxiety, home safety, and access to transportation were also evaluated.</s><s>Anxiety was defined as diagnosis of anxiety disorder in the past, or current use of anti-anxiety medication such as a benzodiazepine.</s><s>Medication non-adherence was defined as history of medication non-compliance, inability to comply with medication regimen, and/or inability to perform teach-back.</s><s>The home safety assessment was evaluated by the COPD care navigator, in accordance with the Home Safety Self-Assessment Tool (HSSAT) by the International Classification for Patient Safety. <ref type="bibr">18</ref></s><s>Transportation issues included not having access to personal vehicles or other easily available transportation to outpatient appointments or pharmacies (like access-a-ride services).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>A two-tailed t-test was used to compare continuous variables; Chi-Square analyses were used for risk factor calculation among categorical variables.</s><s>Twotailed Fisher's exact test was used in cases of expected small cell size and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported for continuous variables; odds ratios and 95% CI are reported for categorical variables.</s></p><p><s>Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.</s><s>The mean age was 74.3 years (SD 10.5 years) among those who were readmitted and 73.1 years (SD 12.5 years) among those who had a single admission.</s><s>There were no statistically significant differences between those who were readmitted and those who were not with respect to age (p=0.66),</s><s>smoking status (p=0.46),</s><s>gender, (p=0.91) or BMI (p=0.49).</s><s>Mean FEV1 also did not differ significantly between the groups (p=0.43).</s><s>Clinical comorbidities are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Patients who were readmitted were significantly more likely to have pneumonia at their index admission than those who were not readmitted (30.0%</s><s>versus 13.1%, p&lt;0.05).</s><s>No statistically significant difference was seen between the 2 groups with respect to any other clinical comorbidities.</s><s>Patients who were readmitted within 30 days were significantly more likely than those who were not readmitted to have safety issues at home (80.0%</s><s>versus 39.3%, p&lt;0.001), anxiety (60.0%</s><s>versus 29.8%, p&lt;0.01) and lack of transportation (35.0% versus 15.5%, p&lt;0.05) (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Monthly hospital-wide 30-day readmission rates for patients with COPD are presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>The annual readmission rate decreased from 21.5% in the one-year period prior to CCMP implementation to 13.6% in the one-year period post-implementation (p&lt;0.01,</s><s>CI 2.08-12.45).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this retrospective study, we compared patients who had been readmitted to Danbury Hospital after an index AECOPD admission with those who were not readmitted from September 2014 to September 2015.</s><s>We hypothesized that patients who were readmitted following an AECOPD were more likely to have multiple clinical and psychosocial comorbidities.</s><s>We successfully demonstrated that those in the readmitted group had a higher rate of psychosocial risk factors such as anxiety, lack of transportation, and lack of home safety, compared to the non-readmitted group.</s><s>However, to our surprise, the readmitted group was associated with increased incidence of pneumonia, but not with other clinical comorbidities, as had been described in previous studies. <ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7</ref></s><s>There was no statistically significant difference in mean FEV1 between the groups, suggesting that readmission was not a function of disease severity.</s><s>It is not surprising that patients who were readmitted for COPD had a higher rate of psychological risk factors.</s><s>In 2016, Singh et al demonstrated that depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse are associated with a higher COPD readmission rate in Medicare beneficiaries. <ref type="bibr">19</ref></s><s> has been done to address anxiety in the formulation of CCMPs.</s><s>Our study has also shown that home safety issues are associated with COPD readmissions.</s><s>We speculate that this finding is explained by decreased activities of daily living performance in patients with COPD, as shown by a cross sectional study by <ref type="bibr">Bendixen et al in 2014. 20</ref> Living alone, lack of adequate support systems, and an unsafe structural environment puts these patients at risk for falls and increased shortness of breath due to exertion.</s><s>Lack of security due to inadequate social support might also contribute to increased likelihood of seeking emergency medical care for minimal symptoms, as opposed to contacting their primary care providers or pulmonologists.</s><s>Lack of transportation is a barrier to early outpatient intervention, which may contribute to more inpatient-based care for patients affected by this issue.</s><s>In a systematic review in 2011, Keating et al demonstrated that lack of transportation affects use of pulmonary rehabilitation services, which are important for patients with COPD. <ref type="bibr">21</ref></s><s>Interestingly, although our study shows an ostensible difference in readmissions in patients who had difficulties in medication adherence (35.0%</s><s>versus 17.9%), this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.075).</s><s>Medication non-adherence has been demonstrated to be associated with increased mortality and hospital admissions in COPD. <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">23</ref></s><s>We suspect that this discrepancy might be caused by lack of power due to small sample size.</s><s>The implementation of our CCMP for patients with AECOPD was associated with a reduction in readmission rate by more than one-third.</s><s>Interestingly, despite our success with a CCMP in reducing AECOPD readmissions, evidence regarding effectiveness of a CCMP for prevention of readmission after an AECOPD is controversial.</s><s>In 2012, a randomized controlled trial conducted by Fan et al demonstrated that a COPD CCMP did not improve readmission rates in 20 Veterans Administration centers, and the study was terminated due to increased mortality in the CCMP group. 12</s><s>In 2014, in a parallelgroup, stratified, randomized controlled trial, Linden et al also failed to show an improvement in COPD readmission rates in 2 community hospitals. 13</s><s>However, as suggested by the authors, this study might have been limited by difference in intensity and duration of their education program, poor execution, lack of involvement of outpatient providers and availability of home visits. <ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref></s><s>ur COPD initiative differed from the CCMP in other studies in several aspects.</s><s>First, our program strongly suggested a consultation with a pulmonologist for all admissions for AECOPD.</s><s>We believe that involvement of pulmonologists within 24 hours of inpatient admission helped identify patients with high clinical risk and allowed for early intervention, optimization, and individualization of their care plan.</s><s>Moreover, having multiple encounters with their consultants during their hospitalization might have led to a better patient-physician relationship, increasing patients' compliance.</s><s>The important transition to outpatient care in our CCMP was facilitated by direct communication between an inpatient and outpatient care navigator, allowing for better transmission of clinical information to the outpatient setting.</s><s>Furthermore, a modification of outpatient office workflow made space for early followups (within 5 days, often within 48 hours) as well as same day follow-ups (if a problem was identified), often solving challenges faced by patients after discharge without resorting to the emergency department.</s><s>Using the outpatient care navigator to actively reach out to patients by phone and to receive calls also helped to identify patients in trouble, making possible the direct early intervention.</s><s>We believe that the early involvement of a specialty service, the regimented use of a direct inpatient to outpatient transition of care and a flexible office schedule for same-day visits were the key to the successful decrease in AECOPD readmissions by our CCMP.</s></p><p><s>There are a few limitations to our study.</s><s>First, as a single center study, selection bias can be a concern.</s><s>However, as our study included almost all patients admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of AECOPD, we believe this bias is mitigated and that our sample is a good representation of the general population treated in an academic community hospital.</s><s>Second, the small sample size in the readmission group might have limited our power to show statistical significance in risk factors.</s><s>However, despite the limited number of readmissions, we were able to show significant differences between patients who were readmitted and those who were not.</s><s>The sample size may be masking differences such as medication nonadherence, which has been shown to be significant in other studies but had a p-value of 0.08 in our study.</s><s>As a retrospective analysis, our design is subject to confounding factors and is not able to determine causation, but only association.</s><s>Additionally, we were unable to determine whether any patients included in this study were subsequently admitted to another hospital.</s><s>This information is relevant, as overall patient care would be improved only if patients refrain from admission to any hospital, not just ours.</s><s>Of note, CMS would still penalize the index hospital for subsequent readmissions, regardless of hospital of readmission.</s><s>Further investigation with a prospective cohort study and randomized controlled trial will be needed to further delineate the risk factors for readmissions and completeness of readmission data.</s></p><p><s>Results from our hospital and previous studies have suggested that there might be benefit in a COPD CCMP.</s><s>From a community hospital that has successfully reduced readmissions for AECOPD after implementation of our CCMP, we speculate that a CCMP can reduce readmission rates with careful execution of a program that includes optimization of in-hospital care, better coordination of pre-and postdischarge care, attention to social variables, a system to better identify patient problems after discharge, and an office setup that can accommodate same day sick visits.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
