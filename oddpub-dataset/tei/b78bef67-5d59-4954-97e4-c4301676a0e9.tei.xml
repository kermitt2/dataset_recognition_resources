<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Model-Free Versus Model-Based Control.</s><s>A balance between modelfree and model-based choice behavior was assessed using a twostep decision task in 29 healthy participants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1 A and B</ref>).</s><s>In this task, subjects make two sequential choices between stimulus pairs to receive a monetary reward.</s><s>At the first stage, each choice option led commonly (70% probability) to one of two pairs of stimuli and rarely (30% probability) to the other pair.</s><s>After entering the second stage, a second choice was followed by monetary reward or zero outcome, delivered according to slowly changing Gaussian random walks to facilitate continuous updating of action values.</s><s>A purely model-based learner exploits probabilities in the transition structure from the first to the second stage, whereas a purely model-free learner neglects this task structure.</s><s>It has been shown that behavior shows influences of both systems (7) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>) and at an individual level a balance between model-free and model-based control can be quantified by a hybrid model.</s><s>This hybrid model combines the decision values of two algorithms according to a weighting factor ω. One algorithm involves model-free temporal difference learning, whereas the other performs a model-based tree search by using explicitly instructed transition probabilities to prospectively update first-stage decision values (SI Text).</s><s>A higher weighting parameter ω indicates a bias toward model-based choices and is our primary measure of interest.</s><s>The models were implemented as in the original paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, and in line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>, a hybrid model again best explained choice behavior as shown in a Bayesian model selection procedure (exceedance probability = 0.98; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>; ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Striatal Dopamine and a Balance of Behavioral Control.</s><s>To test whether striatal presynaptic dopamine levels relate to a balance between model-free and model-based choice behavior, we used the weighting parameter ω derived from computational modeling (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) as dependent variable in a linear regression analysis with a quantitative metric of F-DOPA uptake (K i ) from right and left ventral and remaining striatum as independent variables (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref>).</s><s>This revealed a significant positive relation between K i in right ventral striatum and the parameter ω (ventral striatum-right: β = 0.43, t = 2.16, P = 0.04; left: β = 0.10, t = 0.40, P = 0.70; remaining striatum-right: β = 0.10, t = 0.34, P = 0.73; left: β = −0.46,</s><s>t = 1.48,</s><s>P = 0.15; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref>).</s><s>We repeated this linear regression analysis with presynaptic dopamine from ventral striatum, caudate, and putamen for each hemisphere.</s><s>As in the initial regression analysis, this revealed that right ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine alone related to the weighting parameter ω (ventral striatum-right: β = 0.46, t = 2.22, P = 0.04; left: β = 0.07, t = 0.33, P = 0.74; caudate-right: β = −0.04,</s><s>t = 0.14, P = 0.89; left: β = −0.03,</s><s>t = 0.10, P = 0.92; putamenright: β = 0.09, t = 0.33, P = 0.74; left: β = −0.46,</s><s>t = 1.68,</s><s>P = 0.11).</s><s>This positive relationship was also consistent with findings from an analysis of stay-switch behavior at the first stage as a function of right ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine (SI Text, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>In line with our hypothesis, ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine levels were associated with a behavioral bias toward model-based choices.</s></p><p><s>Our finding of a positive relation between ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine and model-based control indicates that a modelbased system is more engaged as a function of higher ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine.</s><s>This relationship can also be probed via an analysis of second-stage reaction times.</s><s>In our task, a model-based learner uses knowledge about state transitions and second-stage reaction time differences between common versus rare states should reflect the level of involvement in model-based control.</s><s>When comparing common and rare states, we found that second-stage reaction times differed significantly (paired t test: mean difference, 218 ± 165 ms SD; t = 7.10; P &lt; 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>Note that model-free learning cannot account for this effect because it neglects the state transition matrix.</s><s>Reaction times were significantly slower in rare compared with common states and individual variability in this reaction time difference (most likely slowing down in rare states; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>) positively related to the parameter ω (r = 0.59, P = 0.001; Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>), where the latter was inferred independently of reaction times using computational modeling.</s><s>Crucially, a positive relation between the second-stage reaction time difference for rare versus common states was linked to right ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine (linear regression analysis: ventral striatum-right: β = 0.47, t = 2.33, P = 0.03; left: β = 0.03, t = 0.14, P = 0.89; remaining striatum-right: β = 0.07, t = 0.22, P = 0.83; left: β = −0.32,</s><s>t = −1.02,</s><s>P = 0.32; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref>).</s><s>The latter relationship was specific for the second-stage reaction time difference comparing common with rare states, whereas no relationship was evident between presynaptic dopamine levels in ventral striatum and overall reaction times at the second stage of the task (Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref>).</s><s>This analysis further supports the idea that higher levels of ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine relate to more pronounced model-based control in rare task states, where the computational cost of model-based inference is expected to result in slower reaction times.</s></p><p><s>Neural Signatures of Model-Free and Model-Based Choices.</s><s>We first replicated the results reported by Daw et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, who showed that ventral striatal blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals reflect model-free as well as model-based components.</s><s>Following the same analytic strategy, we first sought to identify brain regions where BOLD responses covaried with model-free prediction errors.</s><s>We then asked whether these BOLD signals might also incrementally reflect model-based components, by including the difference between model-based and model-free prediction errors as an additional regressor (for details, see Experimental Procedures).</s><s>Positive correlations with model-free prediction errors were observed in a prefrontal-striatal network, including sectors of lateral and medial PFC bilaterally as well as bilateral ventral striatum [P &lt; 0.05, familywise error (FWE)corrected at the peak level for the whole brain; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>].</s><s>The effect of additional model-based components reached significance in the same regions, namely bilateral ventral striatum, right lateral PFC, and medial PFC (P &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected at the peak level for the respective bilateral regions of interest; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).</s><s>The conjunction of model-free and model-based effects reached significance in right lateral PFC and bilateral ventral striatum (P &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected at the peak level for the respective bilateral regions of interest; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

that administration of L-DOPA increases model-based over model-free choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>Using PET, we now demonstrate that interindividual differences in ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine levels are related to this bias toward model-based control.</s><s>This accords with other studies that report enhanced cognitive capacities in subjects with higher levels of striatal F-DOPA uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>.</s><s>Cognitive capacity, particularly as it relates to working memory function, is also linked to the extent to which individuals exploit model-based control <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Conceptually, this pattern of results can be explained in a framework of uncertainty-based competition between the two decision systems (5).</s><s>Thus, participants with higher levels of presynaptic dopamine can be thought of as encoding model-based estimates with higher certainty.</s><s>At a neural level, we demonstrate that ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine levels relate positively to coding of model-based signatures in lateral PFC and are accompanied by a bias toward more model-based choices.</s><s>It is conceivable that higher levels of presynaptic dopamine enable lateral PFC to code cognitively demanding model-based information with greater  <ref type="table">S3</ref>.  precision, thereby increasing certainty in model-based estimates.</s></p><p><s>As a consequence, a model-based system may exert a greater influence on behavioral control.</s><s>In a similar vein, dopamine is implicated in a modulation of PFC maintenance processes via a gating of cortical gain, rendering coding of relevant environmental information more robust against noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the importance of lateral PFC for model-based inference is supported by findings that theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation compromises model-based control in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Our analysis of second-stage reaction times, which were affected by the state transition matrix, showed that a response time difference for rare versus common states was positively related to a bias toward more model-based choices.</s><s>Intriguingly, this reaction time difference for rare versus common states positively correlated with ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine.</s><s>These results are consistent with an engagement of a slower, computationally more costly model-based system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>.</s><s>Engagement of a model-based system is more likely after rare transitions as these trials are associated with increased uncertainty in representing an anticipated sequence of actions and outcomes.</s><s>Furthermore, ventral striatal tonic dopamine is implicated in signaling average reward rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, a theoretical proposal that has received recent empirical support (e.g., ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref>).</s><s>Nevertheless, in the context of the task used here, ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine levels were not related to invigoration per se as represented by overall reaction times.</s><s>In participants who used a more model-based strategy, one possible explanation is that faster reaction times in common versus rare states reflect higher expectation of average reward rates, resulting in greater invigoration for a specific action-outcome sequence.</s><s>However, the role of expected average reward rates, invigoration, and model-based learning requires experimental designs tailored to address this question.</s></p><p><s>Ventral Striatal Dopamine and a Model-Free System.</s><s>High levels of ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine can also influence a modelfree system as suggested by the inverse correlation with ventral striatal model-free prediction errors, a replication of previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>This indicates that participants with high levels of ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine show a bias toward a more pronounced model-based form of control and are also characterized by a diminished coding of ventral striatal model-free prediction errors.</s><s>The hypothesis of uncertainty-based competition (5) might also account for this finding under a premise that higher presynaptic dopamine levels result in larger phasic prediction error dopamine transients.</s><s>In the reinforcement learning account, this corresponds to an increase in a learning rate within a modelfree system.</s><s>With high model-free learning rates, model-free values change more quickly.</s><s>Thus, over the course of learning, value changes are more pronounced for single events and a value estimate at a given point in time represents an average across fewer experiences.</s><s>This could in turn result in greater uncertainty of model-free estimates.</s><s>Such uncertainty would reduce the weight attached to predictions by a model-free system.</s></p><p><s>There is substantial evidence that high levels of presynaptic dopamine exert a detrimental effect on NoGo-learning from negative prediction errors and promote Go-learning from positive prediction errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> as well as in our data, an alternative model with separate learning rates for positive and negative updating provided an inferior fit to the observed choices during the sequential decision task (SI Text) and failed to account for the observed enhancing effect of L-DOPA on model-based behavior in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>However, we had only Go-trials and future studies with paradigms designed to disentangle a potential role of Goand NoGo-learning and learning from positive and negative prediction errors in model-free and model-based control are required.</s></p><p><s>Ventral Striatal Dopamine and a Balance of the Two Systems.</s><s>Ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine may exert its influence on a balance between the two systems by directly affecting an arbitrator that chooses between the two.</s><s>Here, it is important to note that model-based signals modulated by ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine levels were located to the inferior part of the lateral PFC.</s><s>Activation at close coordinates has recently been reported to covary with the reliability of estimates arising from the two decision systems as inferred from a hierarchical computational model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>The latter finding links the inferior section of lateral PFC to an arbitration process.</s><s>We note that the study by <ref type="bibr">Lee et al. (32)</ref> extends the idea of uncertainty-based competition by identifying two PFC regions, the inferior lateral PFC and the frontopolar cortex, involved in the arbitration of the two systems by weighting the reliability of the predictions from each system.</s><s>With respect to the present study, this also underlines the importance of the association of model-based signatures in inferior lateral PFC with ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine levels hinting at the possibility that these dopamine levels may be directly involved in the arbitration process.</s><s>State prediction errors for implicit transition learning were expressed in parietal and dorsolateral PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</s><s>Future studies should study locally distinct learning signals in lateral PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and their hierarchical organization as suggested by models of lateral PFC function <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Mechanistic Considerations.</s><s>With regard to mechanisms, it is important to take into account the intricacies of dopamine neurotransmission.</s><s>In animal research, learning new reward contingencies is causally linked to time-locked, phasic activation of dopamine neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>We acknowledge that neither fMRI learning signals nor F-DOPA update kinetics can match the dynamical properties of these directly recorded signals.</s><s>However, phasic dopamine release in ventral striatum selectively facilitates context-dependent inputs to ventral striatal neurons via activation of D 1 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>This ventral striatal activation removes inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons resulting in an increase in firing of dopamine neurons leading to an enhanced tonic dopamine influence on ventral striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, potentially indexed by activity of dopa decarboxylase.</s><s>Thus, larger phasic dopamine transients, which happen in response to unexpected events, may reduce the weight attached to a model-free system and allow model-based inputs to dominate.</s><s>This could in turn be reflected in overall higher presynaptic dopaminergic activity.</s><s>Such changes have been demonstrated in animal research <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, and it is conceivable that a long-term dominance of such activity might be reflected in higher presynaptic dopamine levels, as assessed here via F-DOPA PET.</s><s>Although speculative, this notion is supported by evidence for reliability of F-DOPA uptake quantifications in healthy individuals over a period of 1 y (37).</s><s>Thus, relatively higher presynaptic dopamine levels could preferentially facilitate signals, which are thought to carry important, context-dependent, model-based information <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>A possible neural architecture for these signals includes the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, we did not observe model-based signatures in the hippocampus, which may well be due to the applied analytic strategy and the task design (3), but show that interindividual variability in ventral striatal presynaptic dopamine levels coincide with a greater coding of model-based information in lateral PFC.</s><s>This finding also resonates with the notion of disrupted presynaptic dopamine function in neurological and psychiatric illnesses (e.g., refs.</s><s>39 and 40).</s></p><p><s>Regarding the neural instantiation of both control systems, animal research has highlighted a dissociation between dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum, with dorsolateral lesions disrupting habit formation, whereas dorsomedial lesions impact on goaldirected control <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, we did not observe a relationship between striatal presynaptic dopamine in either caudate nucleus (the homolog of dorsomedial striatum) or putamen (the homolog of dorsolateral striatum) and modelbased fMRI effects (SI Text).</s><s>This may be due to several factors including the choice of experimental task, the type of neural measurement, and also limited homologies between neuroanatomical structures in rodents and primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, evidence indicates these structures may encode model-based and model-free value signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, quantities that were not assessed here.</s><s>However, these issues and inconsistencies require clarification in future translational research.</s></p></div>

consisted of a total of 201 trials with two choice stages within each trial.</s><s>At each stage, participants had to give a forced choice (maximum decision time, 2 s) between two stimuli presented either on two gray boxes at the first stage or two pairs of differently colored boxes at the second stage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>All stimuli were randomly assigned to the left and right position on the screen.</s><s>The chosen stimulus was surrounded with a red frame, moved to the top of the screen after completion of the 2-s decision phase and remained there for 1.5 s.</s><s>Subsequently, participants entered the second stage, and a reward was delivered after a second-stage choice.</s><s>Reward probabilities of second-stage stimuli were identical to those of Daw et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Each first-stage choice was associated with one pair of the second-stage stimuli via a fixed transition probability of 70%, which did not

of reward probabilities and their dynamic change over the course of the experiment.</s><s>Participants were instructed to maximize reward, which they received as monetary payout after completion of the task.</s><s>Before entering the scanner, participants performed a shortened version of the task (55 trials) with different reward probabilities and stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Computational

approach as implemented in SPM8.</s><s>As in the original paper by Daw et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, the analysis comprised two time points within each trial when prediction errors arise: at onsets of the second stage and at reward delivery.</s><s>Prediction errors at second-stage onsets compare values of first-and secondstage stimuli and can therefore be varied with respect to the weighting parameter ω of the hybrid algorithm.</s><s>Both time points were entered into the first-level model as one regressor, which was parametrically modulated by (i) model-free prediction errors and (ii) by the difference between modelbased and model-free prediction errors, which refers to the partial derivative of the value function with respect to ω and reflects the difference between model-based and model-free values.</s><s>For details of the first-level model, see SI Text.</s><s>Two contrasts of interest, model-free prediction errors and the difference regressor reflecting additional model-based predictions, were taken to a second-level random-effects model.</s><s>For correction of multiple comparisons, FWE correction was applied using small-volume correction
