<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M</head><p><s>odern subunit vaccines stimulate the B cell immune system and induce neutralizing Abs.</s><s>However, neutralizing Abs cannot be effective against pathogens that "hide" intracellularly (e.g., Plasmodium malariae), or that permanently change the antigenic nature of their surface structures ("antigenic drift"), as is the case with seasonal influenza or HIV.</s><s>Therefore, there is a need for vaccines utilizing the second powerful arm of the adaptive immune system, the cytotoxic defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>In this type of immunity, CD8 + T cells specifically recognize peptide fragments derived from (often conserved) pathogen proteins that are presented on the surface of infected cells in the context of MHC I.</s><s>As a result, the CD8 + T cells become activated, acquire cytotoxic capacity, and eliminate these infected cells in a highly specific fashion.</s></p><p><s>Apart from prophylactic vaccination, a therapeutic vaccination employing the cytotoxic potential of the immune system is also needed due to the limitations of current therapies against many hematological and solid tumors.</s><s>In particular, an immune therapy directed at removing residual cancerous tissue or metastases after surgical or chemical ablation of the tumor would be highly desirable.</s></p><p><s>The repertoire of CD8 + T cells in a naive organism contains only relatively few cells of a given Ag specificity, estimated to be in the order of several hundred cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>To induce potent cytotoxicity starting from this low number of Ag-specific T cells, a very effective Ag presentation to CD8 + T cells in an inflammatory context is required.</s><s>Only dendritic cells (DC) as professional APCs can prime naive CD8 + T cells to become effectors.</s><s>It is for this reason that elegant strategies to directly introduce Ag into DC in vivo have been developed in the past, originally in the laboratories of Steinman and Nussenzweig <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>, and later by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>All of these approaches to effectively induce cytotoxic CD8 + T cells were based on Ag coupled to Abs directed to surface molecules on DC.</s></p><p><s>Conventional DC in the mouse are currently being subdivided into two populations.</s><s>DC dependent in their development on the transcription factor Batf3 are highly capable of presenting exogenous Ag to naive CD8 + T cells (cross-presentation) (9-12), and Batf3-independent DC excel in Ag presentation to CD4 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>.</s><s>To optimally induce cytotoxic immunity, specific targeting of Ag into the Batf3-dependent DC is therefore highly desirable.</s><s>Most of the original targeting studies could not meet this goal, because at that time surface molecules restricted in their expression to this cross-presenting DC subset were not yet known.</s><s>In consequence, most of the work has been done on targeting Ag via CD205, a C-type lectin receptor present on cross-presenting DC, but also expressed on a variety of cell types in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref> and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Although the desired targeting specificity could not yet be achieved, these studies were pivotal in that they demonstrated that effective CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity could be induced through direct delivery of Ag into DC in vivo.</s></p><p><s>In the past few years, we and others recognized that the chemokine receptor XCR1 is exclusively expressed on the Batf3-dependent, crosspresenting DC and not elsewhere in the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>This highly restricted expression of XCR1 in the mouse is mirrored in the human system, where XCR1 can only be found on DC homologous to the mouse cross-presenting subset <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>.</s><s>XCR1 thus appears to be an ideal target to induce cytotoxic immunity in the human.</s></p><p><s>In the present work, we targeted Ag to XCR1 in the mouse using either a mAb or the specific murine chemokine ligand XCL1.</s><s>Both vectors delivered Ag into cross-presenting DC in a highly specific fashion and induced, when applied with LPS as adjuvant, potent cytotoxic immunity.</s><s>Moreover, we generated a transgenic mouse that orthotopically expresses only the human XCR1 receptor on cross-presenting DC.</s><s>In this model, we could demonstrate efficient induction of cytotoxic immunity with human XCL1 or XCL2 as vectors.</s><s>The successful targeting of Ag into cross-presenting DC via the human XCR1 under physiological conditions is a major step forward in establishing this system for induction of therapeutic CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity against neoplastic diseases in the human.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>No adverse effects on targeted DC or other cells</head><p><s>The use of the nonblocking, nonagonistic mAb MARX10 demonstrates that delivery of Ag via XCR1 using a mAb can be done without activation or depletion of the targeted DC.</s><s>The chemokine ligand XCL1 does elicit a short Ca 2+ burst upon binding to XCR1 and is an effective chemoattractant <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, application of high amounts of XCL1 does not induce a sustained activation of DC in vivo, as determined by measuring activation surface molecules.</s><s>Similarly, no adverse effects of the vector systems are to be expected on nontarget cells, because Abs (as a protein class) and the chemokine XCL1/2 are physiological proteins present in the circulation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Processing and presentation of delivered Ag in the MHC I pathway</head><p><s>Upon binding of their ligands, chemokine receptors are classically internalized.</s><s>Therefore, it is not surprising that Ag bound to XCL1, when used as a vector, is efficiently taken up by DC.</s><s>Interestingly, this is apparently also the case with mAb MARX10, which has no chemokine agonist activity.</s><s>Because the biochemical pathways involved in cross-presentation of Ag are not well defined, presentation in the MHC I pathway has to be determined empirically.</s><s>In this respect, XCR1 as a target structure appears to be highly effective, because very low amounts of MARX10-OVA or XCL1-OVA are capable of inducing potent CD8 + cytotoxicity.</s></p><p><s>In addition to their capacity for Ag cross-presentation, Batf3dependent DC can also classically process and present Ag in the MHC II pathway.</s><s>In our experiments, we have observed that targeting of OVA via XCR1 quite efficiently induces activation (our unpublished data), proliferation, and Th1 differentiation of CD4 + T cells, and leads to the generation of Ag-specific Abs.</s><s>This indicates that Ag internalized by XCR1 is shunted both to the MHC I and MHC II pathways, similar to Ag internalized by Clec9A/DNGR-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Absence of inherently immunogenic components</head><p><s>Vaccines usually have to be applied multiple times.</s><s>It is, therefore, of major importance whether the targeting vector (without attached Ag) is immunogenic.</s><s>For example, viral vectors typically induce strong immune reactions and memory, and therefore cannot be applied repeatedly.</s><s>Ample clinical experience indicates that targeting of Ag by humanized or human mAb should not pose such problems.</s><s>Human XCL1/2 is a physiological protein abundantly secreted into the circulation upon activation of the innate immune system and by activated CD8 + T cells, and therefore tolerance to this protein is fully established.</s><s>Thus, repeated application of either vector system for targeting of Ag into XCR1 + DC should be effective.</s><s>This may be quite important in the successive delivery of different Ags using therapeutic vaccination in neoplastic diseases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tissue penetration</head><p><s>The relatively high m.w. of Abs prevents their rapid clearance from the circulation, when systemically applied.</s><s>However, this high m.w. may compromise the tissue penetration of Ab targeting vectors in peripheral lymphoid organs.</s><s>Our finding of a rather selective detection of MARX10 on resident DC (as opposed to migratory DC) in LN after systemic injection points toward this direction; an engineered smaller Ab format could overcome these potential limitations.</s><s>XCL1/2, in contrast, is a small protein of â¼10 kDa.</s><s>As such, this molecule can be expected to have a high tissue penetration, which may only be limited by the size of the fused protein; in the case of (long) peptides, the tissue penetration should remain high.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Induction of CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity</head><p><s>Upon targeting of Ag, we could induce potent CD8 + cytotoxicity when applied together with the adjuvant LPS; in the absence of an adjuvant, only proliferation resulted.</s><s>This finding is in accordance with other targeting systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and indicates that inflammatory signals essential for induction of cytotoxicity have to be provided.</s><s>In the present work, we used LPS throughout the study, but additional experiments indicate that also other TLR agonists such as CpG or poly(I:C) are fully effective (our unpublished data).</s><s>Because TLR4, the receptor for LPS, is not present in human crosspresenting DC <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, other adjuvants such as poly(I:C) will have to be applied in the human.</s></p></div>
