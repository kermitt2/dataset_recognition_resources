<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we have shown that the IL-33 receptor ST2 is induced on Th1 effector cells upon differentiation in vitro and in vivo during LCMV infection.</s><s>ST2 expression on Th1 cells is transient and is associated with the cellular activation status.</s><s>In Th1 cells, STAT4 and T-bet cooperate to drive ST2 expression.</s><s>The absence of ST2 on CD4 + T cells impairs Th1 cell activation during viral infection and results in decreased expansion, impaired effector function, and reduced T-cell-mediated immunopathology.</s></p><p><s>ST2 protein has been reported to be expressed on in vitrodifferentiated Th2 but not Th1 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, ST2 + CD4 + T cells isolated from uninfected mice display mostly Th2 characteristics, such as expression of IL-4 and IL-5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>Using improved detection methods, we now show that ST2 is also expressed on activated Th1 cells, albeit at a lower expression level.</s><s>Moreover, Th1 cells intrinsically down-regulate ST2 expression when transferred to resting conditions.</s><s>Comparably higher stability and intensity of ST2 expression on Th2 cells may explain why in earlier ex vivo isolations from uninfected mice, ST2 + CD4 + T cells exhibited mainly Th2 cell characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>Very likely, Th1 cells originating from previous infections of those mice had lost ST2 expression while transitioning to a resting state, precluding detection of the ST2 receptor on these cells.</s><s>The lineage decision of Th cell subsets is controlled by "master regulator" transcription factors, e.g., T-bet in Th1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> and GATA-3 in Th2 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, T-bet and GATA-3 also share a considerable set of target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>GATA-3 has been identified as an inducer of ST2 expression in Th2 and Treg cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to Th2 cells, Th1 cells express only very low levels of GATA-3 and show a transient ST2 expression pattern; therefore, transcription factors other than GATA-3 likely play a role in Th1-related ST2 expression.</s><s>Indeed, we identified both T-bet and STAT4 as key drivers of ST2 expression in Th1 cells in vitro and in vivo during LCMV infection.</s><s>This finding is in line with transcription factor-binding data from ChIP-Seq experiments with in vitro-differentiated Th1 cells indicating the binding of T-bet <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> and STAT4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> to the ST2 gene locus.</s><s>Thus, the induction of ST2 expression may be accomplished by direct activation of Il1rl1 enhancers and promoters and/or permissive epigenetic changes by T-bet and STAT4.</s></p><p><s>ST2 expression on CD4 + T cells coincides with increases in splenic IL-33 mRNA during viral infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, suggesting an impact of IL-33 on effector CD4 + T-cell differentiation.</s><s>This notion is supported by several results.</s><s>First, the ST2 + fraction of the Th1 effector cells exhibited more pronounced Th1 cell characteristics and increased cell activation compared with their ST2 − counterparts at the peak of LCMV infection.</s><s>Second, in WT and Il1rl1 −/− mixed bone marrow chimeras, IL-33 signals were critical for the expansion and antiviral cytokine production of CD4 + T cells in LCMV infection.</s><s>Finally, adoptively transferred LCMV-specific Il1rl1 −/− CD4 + T cells showed decreased expansion, activation, and Th1 cell differentiation at the peak of LCMV infection, which translated into a reduced immunopathological potential of these cells.</s></p><p><s>Il1rl1 −/− CD4 + T cells exhibited decreased activation and Th1 effector characteristics during LCMV infection, but Th1 cell differentiation per se was not completely abrogated.</s><s>This finding is in line with the function of IL-33 as a general alarmin and not as a Th1-specific factor.</s><s>This is reflected by the plethora of different target cells of IL-33 (5) and the downstream signaling of its receptor, leading to the activation of rather broad transcriptional regulators like JNK, NF-κB, and p38 MAPK (2).</s><s>Nevertheless, an impact of two of those factors on optimal Th1 effector differentiation has already been documented.</s><s>NF-κB plays a T-cell-intrinsic role in optimizing Th1 cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, and the p38 MAP kinase pathway is required for optimal expression of IFN-γ in effector Th1 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our data indicate a direct and enhancing activity of the alarmin IL-33 on virus-induced effector Th1 cells.</s><s>These findings have considerable implications for the design of therapies that include the application of IL-33 or the blockade of its receptor ST2.</s></p></div>
