generated low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient and β5i/LMP7-deficient mice (LDLR −/− LMP7 −/− ); LDLR −/− littermate mice served as controls.</s><s>Upon control diet for 6 or 24 weeks, respectively, serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and non-HDL-C were similar between both genotypes (Supplement Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>Serum levels of triglycerides were lower in LDLR −/− LMP7 −/− mice compared to LDLR −/− littermates solely at 6 weeks of control diet and were found to be equal at 24 weeks of control diet (Supplement Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>Serum glucose levels were similar between both genotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure"

glucose between both genotypes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>LDLR −/− LMP7 −/− mice exhibited a trend to higher levels of triglycerides compared to LDLR −/− littermates, which was statistically significant solely after 6 weeks of WD (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Body weight was lower in LDLR −/− mice (statistically significant after 6 weeks of WD), while the actual body weight gain over the course of the WD did not differ between both genotypes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Serum levels of lipid peroxidation products measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were similar in both genotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>β5i/LMP7-deficiency does not aggravate atherosclerotic lesion progression in LDLR −/− mice.</s><s>LDLR −/− LMP7 −/− and LDLR −/− littermate mice developed early lesions in atherosclerosis-prone sites such as the aortic root and arch after being fed a WD for 6 weeks.</s><s>Mice fed a WD over 24 weeks exhibited advanced lesions in the entire aorta, as shown by en face and histologic analyses of the aortic root and the truncus brachiocephalicus (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1A and S3</ref>).</s><s>Lesion quantification did not reveal significant differences in atherosclerotic plaque burden between both genotypes at either stage of atherosclerosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Plaque macrophage (Mac-2) and T cell (CD4) content in advanced aortic root plaques did not differ between both genotypes (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B and S4</ref>).</s><s>Cells associated with strong FK2 staining, a marker for accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, were detectable in macrophage-rich areas and were not significantly affected by β5i/LMP7-deficiency (Fig. <ref type="figure"

macrophage polarization and stress response in BMDM of LDLR −/− mice.</s><s>Macrophage activation states have been shown to differentially influence atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Therefore, we assessed the influence of β5i/LMP7-deficiency on BMDM polarization towards M1 and M2 phenotypes induced by IFN-γ and IL-4, respectively.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> shows that IFN-γ induced mRNA levels of the M1 marker genes tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) to a similar extent in BMDM from LDLR −/− LMP7 −/− and LDLR −/− littermate mice.</s><s>Likewise, superoxide anion production of IFN-γ stimulated BMDM was not affected by β5i/LMP7-deficiency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>IL-4 stimulation induced mRNA expression of M2 marker arginase-1 similarly in BMDM of both genotypes (Fig. <ref

blot.</s><s>The amount of polyubiquitinated proteins was not changed after IFN-γ stimulation up to 24 hours in BMDM of both genotypes (Figs 2C and S5A).</s><s>After hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) challenge, we detected a similar increase in polyubiquitinated proteins in BMDM of both genotypes (Figs 2D and S5B).</s><s>BMDM survival following H 2 O 2 challenge was similar for both genotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Impact of β5i/LMP7-deficiency on proteasome composition and proteolytic activity in cells and tissues of LDLR −/− mice.</s><s>To determine the impact of β5i/LMP7-deficiency on proteasome subunit composition, we performed Western blots in BMDM, spleen and liver lysates of LDLR −/− LMP7 −/− and LDLR −/− littermate mice.</s><s>In BMDM lysates from LDLR −/− mice we detected expression of all standard and IP β subunits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>Standard proteasome subunits β5, β2, β1 and mature forms of IP subunit β1i were detectable in β5i/LMP7-deficient BMDM (under native and IFN-γ stimulated conditions) and in splenic lysates of β5i/LMP7-deficient mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>Mature forms of IP subunit β2i were detectable in splenic lysates of β5i/ LMP7-deficient mice.</s><s>In β5i/LMP7-deficient fibroblasts standard proteasome subunits β5, β2, β1 and induction of IP subunit β1i after IFN-γ stimulation were detectable (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6</ref>).</s><s>Enhanced bands for β5i/LMP7 were observable in spleens and livers of LDLR −/− mice fed a WD compared to tissues from CD fed mice (baseline) indicative of a systemic inflammatory response under WD (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A and S6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To examine the composition of β subunits incorporated into proteasomal core particles, we isolated 26 S proteasomes from BMDM and splenic lysates using native gel electrophoresis and determined their subunit composition by Western blot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</s><s>BMDM and spleens of LDLR −/− mice assembled IP subunits β5i/LMP7, β2i, β1i and standard proteasome subunits β1 and β2, indicating the presence of immuno-and intermediate proteasomes.</s></p><p><s>In proteasomes of β5i/LMP7-deficient BMDM and spleen standard subunits β5, β2, β1 and IP subunit β1i (and β2i in spleen) were detectable indicating the presence of standard and intermediate proteasomes.</s><s>Incorporated β2i was hardly detectable in β5i/LMP7-deficient BMDM.</s><s>Except for β5i/LMP7, mRNA expression levels of proteasome subunits in BMDM did not differ between both genotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we determined whether alterations in proteasomal composition ultimately lead to alterations in proteasomal proteolytic activities.</s><s>However, chymotrypsin-, trypsin-and caspase-like activities were similar in BMDM of both genotypes, as measured by using short fluorogenic peptides in BMDM whole cell lysates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).</s></p></div>
