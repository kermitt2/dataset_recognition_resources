immunosuppression are of clinical significance as the majority of renal transplant recipients are older than 50 years.</s></p><p><s>In our current study, we were able to show that TAC favors allograft survival in old mice.</s><s>Pharmacokinetic profiles in our model confirmed the clinical relevance of our model with old mice requiring only half of a weight-adapted dose to achieve therapeutic trough levels.</s><s>These findings are in accordance with previous clinical observations in kidney transplant recipients <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and strongly support an age-dependent reduction in first-pass effects and hepatic metabolism.</s><s>Of note, when adjusting the AUC subsequent to therapeutic TAC trough levels, old mice still exhibited a prolonged, although less pronounced graft survival.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel finding in the debate on age-specific immunosuppression.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref> Moreover, TAC suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production more efficiently in old CD4 + T cells.</s><s>Of relevance, decreased levels of IL-2 have been linked to an intensified control of NFATc1.(31)</s><s>Specifically, TAC demonstrated enhanced capacities of suppressing IL-2 in old mice, thus showing anti-proliferative capacities on CD4 + T cells.</s><s>While the critical role of IL-2 in T cell activation has been recognized, this effect appears impaired with age.</s><s>Moreover, reduced CD-4 proliferation can be restored by exogenous IL-2 at comparable rates for young and old CD4 + T cells.(32)</s><s>Strikingly, TAC was able to suppress old CD4 + IL-2 + T cells more effectively in an age-specific fashion.</s></p><p><s>It is known that calcineurin activity declines with aging, although these findings have not been associated with changes in calcineurin protein levels.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref> Nevertheless, our data indicate reduced concentrations of calcineurin not only in old murine but also in old human CD4 + T cells.</s><s>Of note, when measuring cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations, we found no significant differences between young and old CD4 + T cells.</s><s>However, when TAC was added in-vitro, we detected lower Ca 2+ levels again both in old human and murine CD4 + T cells suggesting that aging may render Ca 2+ channels more susceptible to TAC.</s></p><p><s>In line with an augmented suppression of IL-2 in old mice, anti-proliferative capacities of TAC were enhanced in old CD4 + T cells.</s><s>Although TAC did not affect the composition of CD4 + T cell subpopulations, TAC inhibited cytokine production in an age-specific manner.</s><s>In line with our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, overall production of IFN-γ in splenocytes of old animals was significantly reduced compared to their young counterparts while frequencies of IFN-γ + CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were significantly elevated in old recipients.</s><s>Although these findings may appear contradictive at a first glance, production of IFN-γ increased in parallel with an increased production of IL-10 in old animals.</s><s>Of note, double-positive CD4 + IFN-γ + IL-10 + cells also termed regulatory type 1 cells display potent immunosuppressive properties and are able to promote allograft survival independently of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells.(24)</s><s>Thus, altering the critical balance of IFN-γ and IL-10 may play a pivotal role in mediating age-specific effects of Tacrolimus.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref> CD8 + T cells are known to play a central role in alloimmune responses and graft rejection.</s><s>In our transplant mouse model, CD8 + T cell depletion did not alter prolonged allograft survival in TAC treated old recipient, suggesting that TAC effects were not CD8 + T cell mediated.</s></p><p><s>Clearly, further mechanistic studies detailing the interaction of TAC with CD4 + T cells in immunosenescence are in need.</s><s>Particularly
