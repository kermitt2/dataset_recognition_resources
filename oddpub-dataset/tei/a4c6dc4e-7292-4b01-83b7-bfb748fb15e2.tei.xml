<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FKBP surface engineering restores PTEN activity of the FKBP-PTEN fusion protein</head><p><s>We considered the possibility that FKBP Ã might directly interfere with PTEN activity by blocking substrate access to the active site of the enzyme, which consists of a large pocket with positive charges that accommodates the PTEN phosphoinositide substrates (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the electrostatic potential maps of the PTEN surface (PDB ID: 1d5r) and the FKBP Ã surface (PDB ID: 1BL4) revealed complementary charge distributions of the PTEN substrate binding region and large negatively charged protrusions present on the FKBP Ã surface (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we engineered the FKBP Ã surface such that the charged regions were neutralized by replacing two acidic amino acid residues (E31 and D32) with basic amino acid residues (Arg or Lys), with polar uncharged residues (Ser), with hydrophobic residues (Val or Ala), or with the small amino acid Gly (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Transfection of FKBP Ã -PTEN surface engineered variants into U87MG cells demonstrated that FKBP Ã modifications containing the aa substitutions E31S/ D32S, E31G/D32G or E31A/D32A (Fig 2b, PTEN variants 4, 6, 7) resulted in Shld1 dependent regulation of PTEN activity towards PI3K/Akt signaling.</s><s>However, only the E31S/D32S FKBP Ã mutant was efficiently stabilized by Shld1 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Hereafter, we refer to FKBP ÃE31S/D32S -PTEN as FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN.</s><s>As the expression level of stabilized FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN defines the dynamic range of the scalability of the FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN regulation system, we exploited the strong CAG promoter sequence, a combination of the CMV early enhancer element and the chicken beta-actin promoter to drive FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN expression.</s><s>Subcloning of the FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN cassette into a pCAG vector increased the level of protein expression and activity of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN to a level comparable to GFP-PTEN (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Engineered FKBP** permits rapid, reversible and tunable regulation of PTEN function in cellular and zebrafish models</head><p><s>To further characterize the scalability, speed and reversibility of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN in response to Shld1, we generated a U87MG cell line stably expressing FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN under the control of the CAG promoter (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Immunofluorescence labeling of these cells revealed that FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN was robustly stabilized following the addition of Shld1, and this stabilization could be abolished by Shld1 washout (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a and 3b</ref>).</s><s>FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN protein levels were gradually upregulated with increasing Shld1 concentration, resulting in a concomitant decrease in phosphorylated Akt, indicating that PI3K signaling can be fine-tuned by altering the level of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>The time-dependent stabilization profile of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN showed that the engineered FKBP ÃÃ responded within a few hours of addition of Shld1 and reached a plateau after 8 h (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the stabilization kinetics of FKBP ÃÃ is comparable to, or even faster than that of FKBP Ã <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>We also discovered a rapid turnover of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN within a few hours after the removal of Shld1 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>The half-life of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN fusion protein is as short as 2-4h, which is comparable to FKBP Ã <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and to approximately 5% of the 48-72 h half-life of endogenous PTEN <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our engineered FKBP ÃÃ provides an efficient molecular tool to manipulate PTEN activity in a scalable, rapid and reversible manner.</s><s>To characterize whether our engineered FKBP ÃÃ could finely tune PTEN activity and regulate biological responses, we carried out in vitro invasion and colony formation assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> using the FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN U87MG cell line.</s><s>Cell invasion and colony formation in FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN U87MG cells, but not wild type U87MG cells, could be inhibited by Shld1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, Shld1 can be used to fine tune PTEN activity to inhibit tumor growth and tumor cell division.</s></p><p><s>To investigate whether Shld1 can induce FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN stabilization and control biological responses in vivo, we used an established zebrafish metastasis model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and microinjected the FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN U87MG cells, either pre-stained with DiI or transfected with RFP, into the perivitelline cavity of 2 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish larvae.</s><s>Larvae were then transferred into Danieau's solution with or without 4μM Shld1.</s><s>Images of larvae were taken immediately after injections and 24h post-injection (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>The migration indices and the increase in tumor mass size of transplanted cells were quantified over this time-course.</s><s>These experiments demonstrated that Shld1 is effective in stabilizing FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN in zebrafish larvae, resulting in inhibition of invasion and growth of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN U87MG cells (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>They also show for the first time that DD-systems can be used effectively to manipulate protein levels on demand in the zebrafish.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Codon optimization of FKBP** establishes a conditional fine-tuning protein regulation system</head><p><s>In order to achieve advanced regulation of protein function, it would be desirable to combine tunable FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN with established systems enabling precise control of gene expression, such as the Cre/LoxP system (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</s><s>For this purpose, FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN was subcloned immediately downstream of the second LoxP site of the LoxP-Stop-LoxP (LSL) cassette.</s><s>We tested the pCAG-LSL-FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN construct in mouse cortical neuronal primary cultures by transient co-transfection with Cre-IresRFP (or, in control experiments, RFP).</s><s>The FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN fusion protein was only detectable by western blotting in the presence of Cre, and following application of the synthetic ligand Shld1 (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>Surprisingly, when Cre and FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN were coexpressed, the anti-PTEN antibody also identified a distinct protein band with lower molecular weight than full-length FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN, which was stable even in the absence of Shld1.</s><s>We reasoned that this protein could represent a form of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN with a truncation in the FKBP ÃÃ domain which allows it to escape Shld1 regulation.</s><s>A mechanism involving Credependent truncation of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN suggests that these two regulation systems could be incompatible.</s><s>Due to the sequence similarity of FKBP Ã and the engineered FKBP ÃÃ domain it is likely that this might also be true of the parental DD system.</s><s>We therefore investigated the potential sites of Cre action within the DD domain.</s></p><p><s>Cre recombinase is an enzyme known to catalyze site specific recombination events between two DNA recognition sites (LoxP sites) of 34 base pairs, which form a stem-loop-stem structure.</s><s>We aligned the LoxP sequence with the human FKBP ÃÃ DNA sequence and found an 88.9% similarity between the loop region of LoxP and the sequence surrounding the third ATG of the human FKBP ÃÃ gene (M3L cta and LoxP rev ) (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s><s>Consequentially, the third ATG region (ATGCTA) of the human FKBP ÃÃ gene might be erroneously recognized as a Cre cleavage site, resulting in the formation of a FKBP gene truncation in which translation begins from the fourth ATG.</s><s>In this case, although the destabilizing site L106P on FKBP ÃÃ protein still remains, the truncated FKBP ÃÃ might lose its destabilizing property as shown by the Shld1-independent band (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>).</s><s>To test this idea, we replaced the high similarity region ATGCTA (M3L cta ) of the human FKBP ÃÃ gene with silent mutations ATGTTG (M3L ttg ).</s><s>We found that the truncated FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN band (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>) disappeared following mutations of L cta to L ttg , whilst the expression of full-length FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN remained both Cre-and Shld1-dependent (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, we engineered FKBP ÃÃ further to implement a functioning system that offers dual control of FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN expression at transcription and posttranslational levels.</s></p><p><s>In order to test if PTEN loss can be directly coupled with the expression of tunable FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN, we co-transfected M3L ttg pCAG-LSL-FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN with Cre-RFP (or RFP alone in control experiments) into PTEN flox/flox mouse neurons by nucleofection.</s><s>Cre expression led to substantial decreases in endogenous PTEN levels, and created Shld1 depended regulation of exogenous FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref>).</s><s>Thus, insertion of the LSL cassette ensures that loss of endogenous PTEN and gain of tunable FKBP ÃÃ -PTEN takes place in the same cells.</s></p></div>
