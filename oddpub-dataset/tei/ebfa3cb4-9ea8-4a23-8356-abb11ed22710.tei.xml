this effect depended on the muscarinic cholinergic receptors, and was blocked by atropine <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study showed that ketamine-a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist-impaired reconsolidation of contextual fear memory in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There have also been pharmacological studies to diminish fear in humans.</s><s>Propranolol has been shown to interfere with fear and trauma memory reconsolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>; however, these effects have not been consistently replicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Cortisol has been shown to influence fear reconsolidation in men, but this effect could not be replicated in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Aside from such pharmacological interventions, various non-invasive methods have also been studied to interfere with fear memories.</s><s>Schiller et al. used the reconsolidation window to behaviourally rewrite fear memories with non-fearful information <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Burger et al.</ref> showed that tVNS (transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation) accelerates explicit fear extinction; however, it did not lead to better retention of extinction memory 24 h later <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>A common problem with most of these techniques is the lack of replicability and consistent long term effects.</s><s>Hence, it is important to systematically investigate different fear modulating interventions.</s></p><p><s>Non-invasive brain stimulation-more specifically, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-has also been shown to influence fear memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>tDCS has been shown to alter cortical excitability; anodal tDCS results in neuronal depolarisation, leading to an excitatory effect, whereas cathodal tDCS results in hyperpolarisation, and thus has an inhibitory effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Based on these antagonistic effects, many studies have demonstrated that tDCS affects cognition, mood, and working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date, three studies targeting different processes have demonstrated that tDCS can affect fear memories in humans.</s><s>Van't Wout et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> stimulated the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with anodal tDCS during extinction learning, and reported enhanced subsequent extinction of conditioned fear.</s><s>Asthana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> reported that cathodal tDCS of the left DLPFC resulted in inhibition of fear memory consolidation, whereas anodal tDCS did not lead to the enhancement of fear memory.</s><s>Previously, we have shown that tDCS (right prefrontal-anodal, left supraorbital-cathodal) during the reconsolidation window resulted in enhancement of fear memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The fear circuit underlying memory reconsolidation is unclear, and finding a window for tDCS to manipulate this circuit is challenging.</s><s>It has been proposed that noradrenergic and glutamergic inputs to the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) might restabilize glutamate-dependent plasticity during reconsolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the authors propose that BLA output neurons to the central nucleus of the amygdala control aversive responses during emotional memory expression.</s><s>tDCS can only induce changes in cortical excitability, and effects on deeper areas like the amygdala are indirect <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, we chose to target the prefrontal cortex-amygdala circuit to disrupt fear memory reconsolidation.</s><s>It is known that the DLPFC is involved in cognitive regulation of conditioned fear, and projects to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which in turn has inhibitory connections to the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Since our previous study influencing the same neural circuit resulted in the enhancement of fear memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>-in line with the AeCi hypothesis (anodal: excitatory, cathodal: inhibitory)-we reversed this protocol and performed right prefrontal-cathodal, left supraorbital-anodal tDCS during the reconsolidation window.</s><s>We chose the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as our target region for inhibitory cathodal stimulation because it is known that the right prefrontal cortex is activated during the processing of negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The reference electrode for anodal stimulation was positioned on the left supraorbital area, close to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which possibly has an inverse relationship with the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Enhancing the inhibitory connections from the vmPFC to the amygdala through anodal tDCS could inhibit fear memory.</s><s>Hence, we propose that inhibitory stimulation of the DLPFC, together with excitatory stimulation of the vmPFC, would result in the inhibition of fear memories.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods and Materials</head><p><s>We followed an identical protocol as in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, but for one important change; the electrode positions of the anode and cathode were reversed during tDCS stimulation in order to achieve the opposite effect.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Subjects</head><p><s>Twenty-five healthy subjects aged between 18 and 40 years were recruited by poster advertisements for the study.</s><s>Subjects with metal implants inside the skull or eye, severe scalp skin lesions, cranial bone fractures, known history of epilepsy or previous seizures, pregnant or breast-feeding women, and subjects with a known psychiatric disorder or on CNS-acting medications were excluded from the study.</s><s>The Charité institutional ethics committee approved the protocol, which was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</s><s>All subjects were given a complete oral and written description of the study, and informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to participation.</s><s>The subjects were compensated for their participation in the study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Procedure</head><p><s>The experiment was conducted over 3 days, with a wash-out period of 24 h between the sessions.</s><s>A quiet room was used to conduct the sessions in order to minimize the influence of external stimuli on skin conductance.</s><s>The protocol for all three sessions is summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>The experiment was performed using Presentation ® software (Version 7.0, [20]).</s><s>Two randomly assigned groups (tDCS and sham) underwent a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm with partial reinforcement.</s><s>The conditioned stimuli (CS) were blue and yellow squares, and the unconditioned stimulus (US) was a low intensity electric shock to the wrist.</s><s>One stimulus was paired with the US on 38% of the trials (CS+), and the other was never paired with a shock (CS−).</s><s>We used a partial reinforcement schedule to avoid rapid extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>A Grass Medical Instruments stimulator was used to deliver 50 pulses/second for a duration of 200 ms.</s><s>The intensity of the electric shock was adjusted to every individual subject, the threshold stimulus being uncomfortable but not painful.</s><s>We used a starting stimulus of 10 V, and went up to a maximum intensity of 60 V.</s><s>The participants were shown 10 randomized presentations of the CS+ and CS− each, and additionally 6 CS+ presentations, which were associated with a shock (US).</s><s>The order of appearance of the colour paired with the shock was also randomized in order to avoid bias.</s><s>We presented the stimuli for 4 s, with a 10-12 s gap between stimuli.</s><s>The duration between stimuli was randomized in order to avoid false responses because of habituation.</s><s>Skin conductance responses were measured using the Schuhfried Biofeedback X-pert 2000 device (Schuhfried, Moedling, Austria).</s><s>The electrode was connected to the ring finger of the left hand.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Day 2: tDCS</head><p><s>On the second day all subjects were shown a reminder using a single presentation of the coloured square (CS+) which was paired with a shock on Day 1.</s><s>However, no shock was administered on Day 2. Immediately after this, the subjects in the tDCS group were stimulated with tDCS (1 mA) for a total duration of 20 min using two saline-soaked surface sponge electrodes (15 cm 2 ) with a current density of 0.67 A/m 2 .</s><s>The subjects in the sham group received only a brief current for the first 30 s in order to mimic the itching associated with real stimulation.</s><s>The cathodal electrode was placed on the region of interest, the right DLPFC with electrodes (5 × 3 cm) placed at the right frontolateral location (F4 of the international 10:20 electroencephalogram system) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>, and the anode on the contralateral supraorbital area.</s><s>We used a constant current battery driven stimulator (CX6650, Rolf Schneider Electronics, Gleichen, Germany).</s><s>The current was ramped up to 1 mA over a period of 30 s to minimize side effects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Day 3: Fear Response Assessment</head><p><s>To test the effect of tDCS, we presented both groups with the conditioned stimulus without the unconditioned stimulus to assess their fear responses on Day 3. We presented the subjects with 10 CS+ and 11 CS− presentations, and the order of appearance was randomized to prevent bias.</s><s>Since the subjects were shown a reminder of CS+ on the second day, we used one extra presentation of CS− on Day 3 in order to keep the total number of trials on all three days equal.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Data Analysis</head><p><s>The response to an average of all trials during fear acquisition on Day 1 (except the first trial) was used as a criterion to decide if the subjects had successfully acquired fear conditioning.</s><s>It has been proposed that human participants habituate to the CS+ during conditioning, and that fear responses might be better observed in the earlier CS+ trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</s><s>We first assessed fear conditioning in all subjects (n = 25) before discarding any data.</s><s>Subjects (n = 8) where CS+ was equal or less than CS− for an average of all the trials during acquisition were excluded from the analysis.</s><s>Hence, 17 subjects were included in the final sample [tDCS = 7 (m = 3, f = 4); sham = 10 (m = 2, f = 8)].</s><s>We used Ledalab, a MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Sherborn, MA, USA) based software, more specifically the CDA (Continuous Decomposition Analysis) method to analyse the skin conductance data.</s><s>This method extracts the phasic information underlying the skin conductance response, and aims at retrieving the signal characteristics of the underlying sudomotor nerve activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Since we expected the fear responses to be most pronounced in the early phase on Day 3, we restricted our analysis to the first three presentations of the CS+ and CS−.</s><s>Since approximately one-third of the CS+ trials were paired with a shock (US) on the first day, we expected the conditioned subjects to show a fear response to at least the first three trials of CS+ on the third day.</s><s>However, since no shocks are actually administered, a gradual learning effect and thus diminishing of the fear responses is expected after the early phase.</s><s>We compared the mean differential SCR (skin conductance response) between the tDCS and the sham groups in the 0.5 to 4.5 s time window after stimulus onset (CS+ minus CS−).</s><s>Square root transformation of the raw data was performed to normalize distributions.</s><s>Each subject's normalized score was then divided by the mean square-root-transformed US response of that subject.</s><s>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p><s>All subjects tolerated the tDCS stimulation well, and no adverse effects were reported.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Day 1-Fear Acquisition</head><p><s>Fear responses were analysed for all subjects in the late phase on Day 1 (last three CS+ and last three CS− trials) using a repeated measures ANOVA with CS as the within-subjects factor and group (tDCS/sham) as the between-subjects factor.</s><s>We found significant main effects of CS trial [F(1,15) = 15.22,</s><s>p = 0.001, ηp 2 = 0.50], but no significant effects for group [F(1,15) = 1.09, p &gt; 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.07], or the interaction between group and CS [F(1,15) = 4.19, p &gt; 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.22].</s><s>The significant difference between CS+ and CS− indicates that participants successfully acquired fear conditioning on Day 1, and there was no significant difference between the sham and the real group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Day 3-Fear Memory Test</head><p><s>We first analysed the first three CS+ and the first three CS− trials on Day 3, since we expected gradual habituation after the initial phase.</s><s>There were no significant effects for CS [F(1,15) = 2.05, p &gt; 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.12] or group (tDCS/sham) [F(1,15) = 3.38, p &gt; 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.18]; the interaction between CS and group was also not significant [F(1,15) = 0.55, p &gt; 0.05, ηp 2 = 0.04].</s><s>Next, we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA for only the first two trials of CS+ and CS− on Day 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, we investigated the effects of tDCS (right prefrontal-cathodal, left supraorbital-anodal) on fear memories.</s><s>Our results show no significant differences in the fear response between the tDCS and sham group.</s><s>Recently, we reported that tDCS (right prefrontal-anodal, left supraorbital-cathodal) results in enhancement of fear memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>According to the assumption that anodal tDCS enhances cortical excitability, while cathodal tDCS diminishes it <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we hypothesized that reversing this stimulation protocol would result in an inhibition of fear memories.</s><s>However, our results do not confirm this hypothesis.</s></p><p><s>There are two possible explanations why tDCS (right prefrontal-cathodal, left supraorbital-anodal) did not inhibit fear memories.</s><s>Firstly, because the dual-polarity effect (more specifically, the cathodal inhibitory effect) is more difficult to replicate while investigating memory in comparison to motor cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The hypothesis that anodal tDCS promotes cortical excitability while cathodal tDCS inhibits it has been established mainly through motor cortex studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref>.</s><s>It has been proposed that the lack of a cathodal inhibition effect in cognitive studies could be state-dependent due to the brain areas involved already being highly activated during a task <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>This explanation is plausible in the case of our study; since the participants saw a reminder of the conditioned stimulus (connected to the electrical shock) just before tDCS, this probably resulted in the fear circuit being activated during the stimulation, hence making it difficult for the inhibitory cathodal stimulation to diminish these reactivated fear memories, as opposed to enhancement through anodal tDCS, where reactivation might play a facilitatory role <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Previous cognitive studies have also highlighted the difficulty in replicating polarity-dependent effects.</s><s>Marshall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref> reported that both cathodal and anodal tDCS intermittent stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex during a working memory task slowed reaction time.</s><s>Kincses et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> reported that anodal tDCS improved implicit learning; however, cathodal tDCS did not significantly impair implicit learning.</s><s>Our results are in line with these findings, since cathodal tDCS of the prefrontal cortex had no effect on fear memories, while anodal tDCS has been shown to enhance fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, it is possible that the complex fear neural circuitry involved in reconsolidation is difficult to manipulate by stimulating superficial cortical areas like the DLPFC and vmPFC with a single session of tDCS, as opposed to deeper subcortical regions like the amygdala; however, these deep regions are technically challenging to stimulate using tDCS.</s><s>At best, tDCS is capable of indirectly modifying cortico-subcortical connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>-a single session of tDCS might not be enough to manipulate physiological defensive responses reliably and consistently.</s><s>To our knowledge, there are no published studies on the effect of repetitive sessions of tDCS on fear memory reconsolidation.</s><s>Recently, LeDoux et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref> proposed a two systems framework with the first circuit involving cortical areas which are responsible for generating feelings of fear and anxiety, and a second circuit involving subcortical areas like the amygdala which are responsible for behavioural and physiological responses to fear.</s><s>Further, it is suggested that the amygdala itself is not a fear center generating the experience of fear, but rather responsible for detecting and responding to threats.</s><s>According to this model, stimulating cortical regions like the DLPFC and the vmPFC with tDCS might have more influence on the subjective feeling of fear rather than the physiological response to fear, since the second circuit is not directly influenced by tDCS.</s><s>On similar lines, Schiller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> reported that while standard extinction involves areas of the prefrontal cortex like the vmPFC, extinction during the reconsolidation window appears to bypass the prefrontal cortex.</s><s>Taking these findings together, we recommend that future studies with manipulations during the reconsolidation window should try to develop new techniques to target the amygdala, rather than the prefrontal cortex.</s></p><p><s>It is important to carefully consider the differences between our protocol and earlier studies which have manipulated fear using tDCS.</s><s>Firstly, the studies differed on the target and reference electrode positioning for tDCS.</s><s>Asthana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> stimulated the F3 area according to the 10-20 EEG system corresponding to the left DLPFC with cathodal and anodal tDCS in two different groups; the reference electrode was located over the left mastoid.</s><s>Van't Wout et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> stimulated the AF3 region with anodal tDCS, and the reference electrode was on the contralateral mastoid.</s><s>The authors argue that this protocol allows the best stimulation of the vmPFC.</s><s>In our earlier study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, we stimulated the F4 region corresponding to the right DLPFC with anodal tDCS and the left supraorbital area with cathodal tDCS.</s><s>Secondly, let us consider differences in current density and the intensity and duration of tDCS.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Van</ref> These contrasting stimulation protocols highlight the challenges that we face while attempting to influence different emotional processes with a complex neural circuit through tDCS.</s><s>Replication studies are needed for targeting each of these pathways to manipulate fear to check for consistent effects, before a conclusive statement can be made on a standard protocol that offers the best pathway to modify processes like fear extinction, consolidation, or reconsolidation.</s></p><p><s>Our study is limited by the small sample size (n = 17) and gender predominance towards females.</s><s>This makes a direct comparison with our first study difficult, since we had a larger sample size (n = 50) and better gender balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Because of the relatively large electrode sizes used for tDCS, we cannot rule out the possibility of having stimulated other cortical areas involved in the neural circuit modulating fear.</s><s>Since we used a bipolar stimulation design, we cannot discern between the effects of the left and right prefrontal electrodes.</s><s>We used skin conductance response to measure fear, which is susceptible to noise due to spontaneous fluctuations in SCR that constitute within-subject variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>We tried to minimize noise by using the CDA (Continuous Decomposition Analysis) method to analyse SCR;
