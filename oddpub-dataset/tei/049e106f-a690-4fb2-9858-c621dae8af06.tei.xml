<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P</head><p><s>sychiatry relies on signs and symptoms for clinical decision making, without the use of established biomarkers to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection.</s><s>It is increasingly recognized that existing clinical diagnostic categories could hinder the search for biomarkers in psychiatry <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> , as they are not clearly associated with distinct neurobiological abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>The high co-morbidity among psychiatric disorders exacerbates this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, studies have demonstrated common structural, functional, and genetic abnormalities across psychiatric syndromes, potentially explaining such comorbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> .</s><s>This body of evidence underscores the lack of direct mapping between clinical diagnostic categories and the underlying pathophysiology.</s></p><p><s>This context has motivated the development of the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria, which seek to construct a biologically-grounded framework for psychiatric diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>In such a model, the symptoms of individual patients are conceptualized as the result of mixed dimensional abnormalities of specific brain circuits.</s><s>While such a model system is theoretically attractive, it has been challenging to implement in practice due to both the multiplicity of clinical symptoms and the many brain systems implicated in psychiatric disorders.</s></p><p><s>Network neuroscience is a powerful approach for examining brain systems implicated in psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>One network property commonly evaluated is its community structure, or modular architecture.</s><s>A network module (also called a subnetwork or a community) is a group of densely interconnected nodes, which may form the basis for specialized sub-units of information processing.</s><s>Converging results across data sets, methods, and laboratories provide substantial agreement on large-scale functional brain modules such as the somatomotor, visual, default mode, and fronto-parietal control networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, multiple studies documented abnormalities within this modular topology in psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Specifically, evidence suggests that many psychiatric disorders are associated with abnormalities in network modules subserving higher-order cognitive processes, including the default mode and frontoparietal control networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In addition to such module-specific deficits, studies in mood disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , and other disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> have reported abnormal interactions between modules that are typically segregated from each other at rest.</s><s>This is of particular interest as modular segregation of both functional <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and structural <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> brain networks is refined during adolescence, a critical period when many psychiatric disorders emerge.</s><s>Such findings have led many disorders to be considered "neurodevelopmental connectopathies." <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>Describing the developmental substrates of psychiatric disorders is a necessary step towards early identification of at-risk youth, and might ultimately allow for interventions that "bend the curve" of maturation to achieve improved functional outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Despite the increasing interest in describing how abnormalities of brain network development lead to the emergence of psychiatric disorders, existing studies have been limited in several respects.</s><s>First, most have adopted a categorical casecontrol approach, or only examined a single dimension of psychopathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and are therefore unable to capture heterogeneity across diagnoses.</s><s>Second, dimensional psychopathology derived from factor analyses, including our prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> , were solely driven by covariance in the clinical symptomatology, rather than being guided by both brain and behavior features.</s><s>Third, especially in contrast to adult studies, existing work in youth has often used relatively small samples (e.g., dozens of participants).</s><s>While multivariate techniques allow the examination of both multiple brain systems and clinical dimensions simultaneously, such techniques usually require large samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In the current study, we seek to delineate functional network abnormalities associated with a broad array of psychopathology in youth.</s><s>We have capitalized on a large sample of youth from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> by applying a recently-developed machine learning technique called sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>As a multivariate method, sCCA is capable of discovering complex linear relationships between two high-dimensional datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>It should be noted that the approach of the current study is distinct from prior work discovering biotypes within categories of psychopathology, based purely on imaging features themselves (e.g., functional connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> and gray matter density <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> ).</s><s>In contrast, we seek to link a broad range of symptoms that are present across categories to individual differences in functional brain networks.</s><s>Such an approach has been successfully applied in prior work on neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> as well as normal brain-behavior relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Here, we use sCCA to delineate linked dimensions of psychopathology and functional connectivity.</s><s>As described below, we uncover dimensions of connectivity that are highly correlated with specific, interpretable dimensions of psychopathology.</s><s>We find that each psychopathological dimension is associated with a distinct pattern of abnormal connectivity, and that all dimensions are characterized by decreased segregation of default mode and executive networks (fronto-parietal and salience).</s><s>These network features linked to each dimension of psychopathology show expected

circuit-level abnormalities in specific brain systems to symptoms that might be present across clinical diagnoses <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Accordingly, there has been a

type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s><s>However, by focusing on a single behavioral measure or symptom domain, many studies ignore the comorbidity among psychiatric symptoms.</s><s>A common way to attempt to evaluate such co-morbidity is to find latent dimensions of psychopathology using factor analysis or related techniques.</s><s>For example, factor analyses of clinical psychopathology have suggested the presence of dimensions including internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and psychosis symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>While such dimensions are reliable, they are drawn entirely from the covariance structure of self-report or interview-based clinical data, and are not informed by neurobiology.</s></p><p><s>An alternative and increasingly pursued approach is to parse heterogeneity in psychiatric conditions using multivariate analysis of biomarker data such as neuroimaging.</s><s>For example, researchers have used functional connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> and gray matter density <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> to study the heterogeneity within major depressive disorder and psychotic disorders, respectively.</s><s>However, most studies have principally considered only one or two clinical diagnostic categories, and typically the analytic approach yields discrete subtypes (or "biotypes").</s><s>By definition, such a design is unable to discover continuous dimensions that span multiple categories.</s><s>Further, there is tension between the dimensional schema suggested by RDoC and categorical biotypes; as suggested by RDoC, it seems more plausible that psychopathology in an individual results from a mixture of abnormalities across several brain systems.</s><s>Finally, unsupervised learning approaches using only imaging data and not considering clinical data may frequently yield solutions that are difficult to interpret, and do not align with clinical experience.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, in this study we used a multivariate analysis technique -sCCAthat allowed simultaneous consideration of clinical and functional connectivity data in a large sample with diverse psychopathology.</s><s>This method allowed us to uncover linked dimensions of psychopathology and connectivity that cross diagnostic categories yet remain clinically interpretable.</s><s>Compared to supervised classification methods (e.g., case-control, or multi-class), where each subject is categorized into one discrete class, unsupervised sCCA overcomes the inherent limitation of using discrete diagnostic categories (such as those provided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and allows continuous dimensions of psychopathology to be present in an individual to a varying degree.</s><s>In addition, in contrast to "one-view" multivariate studies (such as factor analysis of clinical data or clustering of imaging data) <ref

target="#b33">34</ref> and normal brain-behavior relationships <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>In this dimensional, trans-diagnostic approach, the psychopathology of an individual is represented as a mixture of dimensional brain circuit abnormalities, which together produce a specific combination of psychiatric symptoms.</s><s>Notably, the brain-driven dimensions described here incorporated symptoms across several diagnostic categories while remaining congruent with prevailing models of psychopathology.</s><s>For example, the mood dimension was composed of items from five sections of the clinical interview: depression, mania, OCD, suicidality, and psychosis-spectrum.</s><s>Despite disparate origins, the content of the items forms a clinically coherent picture, including depressed mood, anhedonia, loss of sense of self, recurrent thoughts of self-harm, and irritability.</s><s>Notably, symptoms of irritability were also significantly represented in the externalizing behavior dimension, suggesting that irritability may have heterogeneous, divergent neurobiological antecedents.</s><s>The fear dimension, on the other hand, represents a more homogeneous picture of various types of phobias (e.g.</s><s>social phobia and agoraphobia), that had little overlap with other categorical symptoms.</s><s>Finally, the psychosis dimension (which was only

of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and findings that specific common genetic variants increase risk of both disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Instead of averaging over many

<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The two samples were confirmed to also have similar distributions in regards to age, sex, and race (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>),

or a history of medical problems that might affect brain function.</s><s>Of the remaining 958 participants, 45 were excluded for having low quality T1weighted images, and 250 were excluded for missing rs-fMRI, incomplete image coverage, or excessive motion during the functional scan, which is defined as having an average framewise motion more than 0.20 mm or more than 20 frames exhibiting over 0.25 mm movement (using the Jenkinson calculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> ).</s><s>These exclusion criteria produced a final discovery sample consisting of 663 youths (mean age 15.82, SD =

symptoms were evaluated using a structured screening interview (GOASSESS), which has been described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>To allow rapid training and standardization across a large number of assessors, GOAS-SESS was designed to be highly structured, with screen-level symptom and episode information.</s><s>The instrument is abbreviated and modified from the epidemiologic version of the NIMH Genetic Epidemiology Research Branch Kiddie-SADS <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> .</s><s>The psychopathology screen in GOASSESS assessed lifetime occurrence of major domains of psychopathology including psychosis spectrum symptoms, mood (major depressive episode, mania), anxiety (agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, panic, specific phobia, social phobia, separation anxiety), behavioral disorders (oppositional defiant, attention deficit/hyperactivity, conduct), eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia), and suicidal thinking and behavior (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The 111 item-level symptoms used in this study were described in prior factor analysis of the clinical data in PNC <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>For the specific items, see Supplementary Data 1.</s></p><p><s>Image acquisition.</s><s>Structural and functional subject data were acquired on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio scanner with a 32-channel head coil (Erlangen, Germany), as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Highresolution structural images were acquired in order to facilitate alignment of individual subject images into a common space.</s><s>Structural images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared, rapid-acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) T1-weighted sequence (T R = 1810ms; T E = 3.51 ms; FoV = 180 √ó 240 mm; resolution 0.9375 √ó 0.9375 √ó 1 mm).</s><s>Approximately 6 minutes of taskfree functional data were acquired for each subject using a blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD-weighted) sequence (T R = 3000 ms; T E = 32 ms; FoV = 192 √ó 192 mm; resolution 3 mm isotropic; 124 volumes).</s><s>Prior to scanning, in order to acclimate subjects to the MRI environment and to help subjects learn to remain still during the actual scanning session, a mock scanning session was conducted using a decommissioned MRI scanner and head coil.</s><s>Mock scanning was accompanied by acoustic recordings of the noise produced by gradient coils for each scanning pulse sequence.</s><s>During these sessions, feedback regarding head movement was provided using the MoTrack motion tracking system (Psychology Software Tools, Inc., Sharpsburg, PA).</s><s>Motion feedback was only given during the mock scanning session.</s><s>In order to further minimize motion, prior to data acquisition subjects' heads were stabilized in the head coil using one foam pad over each ear and a third over the top of the head.</s><s>During the resting-state scan, a fixation cross was displayed as images were acquired.</s><s>Subjects were instructed to stay awake, keep their eyes open, fixate on the displayed crosshair, and remain still.</s></p><p><s>Structural preprocessing.</s><s>A study-specific template was generated from a sample of 120 PNC subjects balanced across sex, race, and age bins using the buildtemplateparallel procedure in ANTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> .</s><s>Study-specific tissue priors were created using a multiatlas segmentation procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> .</s><s>Subject anatomical images were independently rated by three highly trained image analysts.</s><s>Any image that did not pass manual inspection was removed from the analysis.</s><s>Each subject's high-resolution structural image was processed using the ANTS Cortical Thickness Pipeline 66 .</s><s>Following bias field correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> , each structural image was diffeomorphically registered to the study-specific PNC template using the top-performing SYN deformation provided by ANTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> .</s><s>Study-specific tissue priors were used to guide brain extraction and segmentation of the subject's structural image <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Functional preprocessing.</s><s>Task-free functional images were processed using one of the top-performing pipelines for removal of motion-related artifact <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Preprocessing steps included (1) correction for distortions induced by magnetic field inhomogeneities using FSL's FUGUE utility, (2) removal of the 4 initial volumes of each acquisition, (3) realignment of all volumes to a selected reference volume using MCFLIRT <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> , (4) removal of and interpolation over intensity outliers in each voxel's time series using AFNI's 3DDESPIKE utility, (5) demeaning and removal of any linear or quadratic trends, and (6) co-registration of functional data to the high-resolution structural image using boundary-based registration <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> .</s><s>The artefactual variance in the data was modelled using a total of 36 parameters, including the six framewise estimates of motion, the mean signal extracted from eroded white matter and cerebrospinal fluid compartments, the mean signal extracted from the entire brain, the derivatives of each of these nine parameters, and quadratic terms of each of the nine parameters and their derivatives.</s><s>Importantly, our findings are robust to the methodological choice of regressing out global signal (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Both the BOLD-weighted time series and the artefactual model time series were temporally filtered using a first-order Butterworth filter with a passband between 0.01 and 0.08 Hz 71 .</s></p><p><s>Network construction.</s><s>We built a functional connectivity network using the residual timeseries (following de-noising) of all parcels of a common parcellation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>The parcellation used in the main analysis consists of 264 spherical nodes of 20 mm diameter distributed across the brain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>The a priori communities for this set of nodes were originally delineated using the Infomap algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> and were replicated in an independent sample.</s><s>This parcellation was particularly suitable for our analysis as it has been previously used for studying developmental changes in connectivity and network modularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and has been used as part of several studies in this dataset in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> .</s><s>As part of the supplementary analysis to demonstrate the robustness of the results independent of parcellation choices (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>), we also constructed networks based on an alternative parcellation developed by Gordon et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>This set of nodes was derived using edge detection and boundary mapping to define areal parcels.</s><s>The functional connectivity between any pair of brain regions was operationalized as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the mean activation timeseries extracted from those regions.</s><s>For each parcellation, an n √ó n weighted adjacency matrix encoding the connectome was thus obtained, where n represents the total number of nodes (or parcels) in that parcellation.</s><s>Community boundaries were defined a priori for each parcellation scheme.</s></p><p><s>To ensure that potential confounders did not drive the canonical correlations, we regressed out relevant covariates out of the input matrices.</s><s>Specifically, using the glm and residual.glm</s><s>functions in R, we regressed age, sex, race, and in-scanner motion out of the connectivity data, and regressed age, sex, and race out of the clinical data.</s><s>Importantly, we found that the canonical variates derived from regressed and non-regressed datasets were comparable, with highly correlated feature weights (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Dimensionality reduction.</s><s>Each correlation matrix comprised 34,980 unique connectivity features.</s><s>We reasoned that since sCCA seeks to capture sources of variation common to both datasets, connectivity features that are most predictive of psychiatric symptoms would be those with high variance across participants.</s><s>Therefore, to reduce dimensionality of the connectivity matrices, we selected the top edges with the highest median absolute deviation (MAD) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>MAD is defined as median X i √Ä median√∞X√û j j √∞ √û , or the median of the absolute deviations from the vector's median.</s><s>We chose MAD as a measurement for variance estimation, because it is a robust statistic, being more resilient to outliers in a data set than other measures such as the standard deviation.</s><s>To illustrate which edges were selected based on MAD, we visualized the network adjacency matrix with all edges, at 95th, 90th, and 75th percentile (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>An alternative approach for dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA), from which we selected the top 111 components (explaining 37% of variance) as connectivity features entered into sCCA.</s><s>As detailed in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, using PCA yielded similar canonical variates as MAD.</s><s>We ultimately chose feature selection with MAD because it allowed direct use of individual connectivity strength instead of latent variables (e.g.</s><s>components from PCA) as the input features to sCCA, thus increasing the interpretability of our results.</s></p><p><s>Sparse canonical correlation analysis.</s><s>sCCA is a multivariate procedure that seeks maximal correlations between linear combinations of variables in both sets, with regularization to achieve sparsity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>In essence, given two matrices, X n p and Y n√óq , where n is the number of observations (e.g., participants), p and q are the number of variables (e.g., clinical and connectivity features, respectively), sCCA involves finding u and v, which are loading vectors, that maximize cor (Xu,Yv).</s><s>Mathematically, this optimization problem can be expressed as maximize u T X T Yv; subject to jjujj</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2 2 1; jjvjj 2 2 1; jjujj 1 c 1 ; jjvjj 1 c 2 :<label>√∞1√û</label></formula><p><s>Since both L 1 (||‚Ä¢|| 1 ) and L 2 -norm (||‚Ä¢|| 2 ) are used, this is an elastic net regularization that combines the LASSO and ridge penalties.</s><s>The penalty parameters for the L 2 norm are fixed for both u and v at 1, but those of L 1 norm, namely c 1 and c 2 , are set by the user and need to be tuned (see below).</s></p><p><s>We chose a linear kernel over non-linear implementations of sCCA for two reasons.</s><s>First, while a more complex model may potentially better fit the data, increased model complexity often results in reduced interpretability.</s><s>Secondly, a non-linear model may require a larger sample size to accurately estimate the increased number of parameters.</s></p><p><s>Grid search for regularization parameters.</s><s>We tuned the L 1 regularization parameters for the connectivity and the clinical features, respectively (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>The range of sparsity parameters are constrained to be between 0 and 1 in the PMA package <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , where 0 indicates the smallest number of features (i.e., highest level of sparsity) and 1 indicates the largest number of features (i.e., lowest level of sparsity).</s><s>We conducted a grid search in increments of 0.1 to determine the combination of parameters that would yield the highest canonical correlation of the first variate across 10 randomly resampled samples, each consisting of two-thirds of the discovery dataset.</s><s>Note that the parameters were only tuned on the discovery sample and the same regularization parameters were applied in the replication analysis.</s></p><p><s>Permutation testing.</s><s>To assess the statistical significance of each canonical variate, we used a permutation testing procedure to create a null distribution of correlations (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>Essentially, we held the connectivity matrix constant, and then shuffled the rows of the clinical matrix so as to break the linkage of participants' brain features and their symptom features.</s><s>Then we performed sCCA using the same set of regularization parameters to generate a null distribution of correlations after permuting the input data 1000 times (B).</s><s>As permutation could induce arbitrary axis rotation, which changes the order of canonical variates, or axis reflection, which causes a sign change for the weights, we matched the canonical variates resulting from permuted data matrices to the ones derived from the original data matrix by comparing the clinical loadings (v) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> .</s><s>The P FDR value was estimated as the number of null correlations (r i ) that exceeded the average sCCA correlations estimated on the original dataset (r), with false discovery rate correction (FDR, q &lt; 0.05) across the top seven selected canonical variates:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P permutation ¬º P B i¬º1 1; if r i ! r 0; if r i &lt; r B :<label>√∞2√û</label></formula><p><s>In other words, we randomly assigned subjects' clinical features to other subjects' connectivity features, therefore breaking up the internal co-varying structures of the original dataset.</s><s>The canonical variates resulting from these re-aligned datasets with preserved data distribution will then serve as the null distribution against which the real correlations are compared.</s><s>The logic is that any significant co-varying relationships will have to be greater than the signals in a permuted data structure.</s></p><p><s>Resampling procedure.</s><s>To further select features that consistently contributed to each canonical variate, we performed a resampling procedure (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>In each of 1000 samples, we randomly selected two-thirds of the discovery sample and then randomly replaced the remaining one-third from those two-thirds (similar to bootstrapping with replacement).</s><s>Similar to the permutation procedure, we matched the corresponding canonical variates from resampled matrices to the original one to obtain a set of comparable decompositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Features whose 95% and 99% confidence intervals (for clinical and connectivity features, respectively) did not cross zero were considered significant, suggesting that they were stable across different sampling cohorts.</s></p><p><s>Network module analysis.</s><s>To visualize and understand the high dimensional connectivity loading matrix, we summarized it as mean within-and between-module loadings according to the a priori community assignment of the Power parcellation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s><s>Specifically, within-module connectivity loading is defined as</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P i;j2m 2W ij M j j M j j √Ä 1 √∞ √û ;<label>√∞3√û</label></formula><p><s>where W ij is the sCCA loading of the functional connectivity between nodes i and j, which both belong to the same community m in M.
