Kuntze) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The amount of theanine, which is the most abundant amino acid in green tea leaves, depends on nitrogen supply absorbed from the roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Matcha is a fine-powdered green tea that is prepared from tea leaves protected from sunlight.</s><s>When tea leaves are protected from direct sunlight, their amino acid content, especially theanine, remains high because the hydration of theanine used in the biosynthesis of catechin is lowered <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>To make matcha, cultivation under shade for about three weeks is necessary before harvest <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Given their protection from sunlight, catechin content is lower in matcha than in other popular green teas prepared from leaves grown in sunlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, matcha has a high content of caffeine because the buds and young leaves of Camellia plants contain more caffeine than mature leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The balance of these components, such as theanine, caffeine, and catechin, determines the quality of the green tea.</s><s>A higher content of amino acids indicates a higher level of "umami" ingredients.</s><s>Therefore, matcha is essentially the best-grade green tea, rich in theanine and caffeine, but with a low content of catechin compared with popular green tea.</s></p><p><s>Chronic psychosocial stress is associated with the development of depression, mood disorders, and various other stress-related diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Addressing stress-induced alterations with dietary supplements is a potential therapeutic strategy for a healthy life.</s><s>Green tea is the most popular drink in Asian countries and its consumption and that of theanine has revealed health benefits and medicinal potential for several ailments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Theanine exhibits an excellent stress-reducing effect on mice and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>However, the effect of theanine is antagonized by caffeine and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which are two major components of green tea <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the stress-reducing effect of theanine is enhanced by arginine (Arg), which is the second most abundant amino acid in Japanese green tea <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Glutamate (Glu), the third most abundant amino acid in green tea, has no effect on stress in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>To enhance the stress-reducing effect of green tea, low-caffeine green tea with reduced caffeine content can be prepared from tea leaves by irrigating them with hot water at 95 â¢ C for three minutes.</s><s>Published data showed that a significant stress-reducing effect of low-caffeine green tea was observed in participants in their 20 s, 40 s-50 s, and 80 s-90 s relative to barley tea or standard green tea <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Matcha is expected to have a stress-reducing effect due to its high theanine content, although this has not been scientifically proven.</s><s>Previous studies described above suggested that differences in the quantities and ratios of green tea components affect the efficiency of its stress-reducing action.</s><s>Therefore, the stress-reducing effect of matcha, which contains catechins, caffeine, and amino acids whose contents were measured, was evaluated in an animal (mouse) experiment.</s><s>Mice were stressed using territorial conflict between male mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The stress-reducing effect of matcha was evaluated as the suppression of adrenal hypertrophy in stressed mice because adrenal glands are sensitive to stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The relationship between suppressed adrenal hypertrophy and quantities or ratios of matcha tea components was examined.</s><s>Based on these data, test-matcha with contents expected to have a stress-reducing effect, as well as placebo-matcha with contents expected to have no stress-reducing effect, were selected for a clinical trial.</s><s>Participants, who were selected for a double-blind randomized controlled trial, consumed matcha (3 g) suspended in 500 mL water daily.</s><s>They were fifth year college students of the University of Shizuoka, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Japan, who were assigned to a pharmacy practice outside the university, such as a hospital or a pharmacy.</s><s>Commitment to a new environment provides a stressful condition for young students.</s><s>Since anxiety is a reaction to stress, to assess the anxiety of participants, the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) test was administered before and on the eighth day of pharmacy practice.</s><s>In addition, to assess the physiological stress response, the activity of salivary Î±-amylase activity (sAA), an oral cavity enzyme, was measured as a stress marker of sympathetic excitement <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>This enzyme rapidly increases in response to physiological and psychosocial stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>We examined whether test-matcha was able to reduce participants' stress.</s><s>Finally, based on the quantity and ratio of components of each matcha, 76 matcha samples sold in Japan and 67 samples sold abroad were evaluated to determine whether mental function such as anxiety and stress could be expected when humans consume these forms of matcha.</s></p></div>
