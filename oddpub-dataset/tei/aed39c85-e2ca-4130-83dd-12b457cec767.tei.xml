<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Lectin-like oxidized low-density-lipoprotein receptor 1 (Lox-1) is the receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a mediator in dyslipidemia.</s><s>Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and − 4 are receptors of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogen of chronic periodontitis.</s><s>Although some reports have demonstrated that periodontitis has an adverse effect on dyslipidemia, little is clear that the mechanism is explained the effects of dyslipidemia on osteoclastogenesis.</s><s>We have hypothesized that osteoclast oxLDL has directly effect on osteoclasts (OCs), and therefore alveolar bone loss on periodontitis may be increased by dyslipidemia.</s><s>The present study aimed to elucidate the effect of Lox-1 on osteoclastogenesis associated with TLRs in vitro.</s></p><p><s>Methods: Mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs) were stimulated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor into bone marrow macrophages (BMMs).</s><s>The cells were also stimulated with synthetic ligands for TLR2 (Pam3CSK4) or TLR4 (Lipid A), with or without receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and assessed for osteoclastogenesis by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, immunostaining, western blotting, flow activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and reverse transcription PCR.</s></p><p><s>Results: Lox-1 expression was significantly upregulated by Pam3CSK4 and Lipid A in BMCs (p &lt; 0.05), but not in BMMs.</s><s>FACS analysis identified that Pam3CSK4 upregulated RANK and Lox-1 expression in BMCs.</s><s>TRAP-positive cells were not increased by stimulation with Pam3CSK4 alone, but were increased by stimulation with combination combined Pam3CSK and oxLDL.</s><s>Expression of both Lox-1 and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), an essential adaptor protein in the TLR signaling pathway, were suppressed by inhibitors of TLR2, TLR4 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).</s></p><p><s>Conclusions: This study supports that osteoclastogenesis is promoted under the coexistence of oxLDL by TLR2-induced upregulation of Lox-1 in BMCs.</s><s>This indicates that periodontitis could worsen with progression of dyslipidemia.</s></p></div>

osteoblast progenitor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, little is known about how dyslipidemia influences bone resorption.</s><s>In the present study, we found that TLRs upregulated the oxLDL receptor, Lox-1, via MAPK in BMCs, resulting in promotion of osteoclastogenesis.</s><s>This finding suggests that periodontitis would worsen with progression of dyslipidemia.</s></p><p><s>The subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration of Pam3CSK4 is reported to upregulate bone resorption in vivo, suggesting that Pam3CSK4 directly promotes osteoclastogenesis from BMMs after RANKL priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s><s>However, synthetic TLR2 ligand inhibits OC formation in BMMs

compared with those treated with M-CSF and RANKL.</s><s>In contrast, the Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> BMC surface expression of Lox-1 and RANK proteins.</s><s>BMCs were cultured with or without Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 ligand, 100 ng/ml) or Lipid A (TLR4 ligand, 100 ng/ml) in the presence of M-CSF (20 ng/ml) for 3 days.</s><s>Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-Lox-1 or anti-RANK antibodies.</s><s>Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM (n = 3 experiments) addition of Pam3CSK and oxLDL, a Lox-1 ligand together at early phase, increased the number of TRAP-positive cells.</s><s>Although the mechanism through which P. gingivalis-induces bone resorption via TLR2 and TLR4 is not fully understood, our results suggest that TLR-stimulation in periodontitis upregulates alveolar bone resorption under high plasma concentration of oxLDL in dyslipidemia.</s></p><p><s>OC progenitors, including BMCs and BMMs, are reported to express abundant levels of LDL receptors, such as Lox-1, in a RANKL-independent manner.</s><s>Expression levels of Lox-1 are greatly decreased during osteoclastogenesis, particularly during the fusion of mononuclear cells to form multinuclear OCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>The present data showed that Lox-1 expression was upregulated by TLR 2 or 4 ligands in BMCs but not in BMMs.</s><s>Periodontal tissues in ApoE −/− hyperlipidemia model rats are reported to exhibit more TRAP-positive multinuclear cells and increased TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, suggesting that high oxLDL concentration effects osteoclastogenesis via the elevation of TLRs.</s><s>OxLDL is reported to suppress RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, TRAP activity, and bone-resorbing activity derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro.</s><s>This suppression is suggested to be caused by RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK, p38, and JNK kinases, together with the suppression of DNA binding activities of transcriptional factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa-B) and nuclear fsctor of activated T-cells (NFAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>Our data demonstrated that TLR 2 or 4 ligand-induced Lox-1 upregulation was reduced in the presence of TLR2/4 and MAPK inhibitor, respectively, and the inhibitors of JNK and MEK significantly inhibited the upregulation of TLR 2-induced RANK mRNA on BMCs.</s><s>We also found that TLR-stimulation together with oxLDL accelerated early-phase but not late-phase osteoclastogenesis, and only oxLDL stimulation suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis, consistent with previous studies.</s><s>In the present study, Pam3CSK4 was shown to upregulate the expression of RANK and Lox-1 in BMCs.</s><s>Furthermore, stimulation with both Pam3CSK4 and oxLDL was shown to promote progression of osteoclastogenesis, suggesting that oxLDL-Lox-1 signaling promotes osteoclastogenesis through expression of Lox-1 by stimulating TLRs.</s></p><p><s>Similar reports have shown that plasma lipids likely play a role in maintaining bone mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</s><s>A better understanding of the coupling between osteoporosis and atherosclerosis is indicated in previous studies whereby treatment of one disease may have beneficial

inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in short-term studies, there is no evidence that they prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) or modify its outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</s><s>Although our data could not support that ASVD developed due to periodontitis worsening dyslipidemia, it did show that osteoclastogenesis was upregulated by TLR-stimulation, like bacterial infection, in periodontitis with dyslipidemia.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we focused on elucidating the correlation between dyslipidemia and progression of periodontitis.</s><s>Our results indicated that stimulation of BMCs with TLRs, representative of a bacterial infection, upregulated Lox-1 expression resulting in promotion of osteoclastogenesis in the presence of oxLDL in dyslipidemia.</s><s>Although the present data did not clarify the direct relationships between periodontitis and atherosclerotic vascular disease, periodontitis at least partially worsens by the complication of dyslipidemia.</s></p></div>
