<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-dependent TLR2 activation by combined agonists</head><p><s>The sensitizing effect of eRNA on the Pam-mediated TNF-α release could be further increased by prolonged exposure of macrophages towards these agonists.</s><s>For example, upon exposure of cells towards eRNA/Pam for longer time periods, the mRNA expression of TNF-α IL-6, IL-1β and MCP-1 increased up to 6 h, but thereafter, it decreased or totally declined, respectively (Fig 4C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">-4F</ref>).</s><s>Using the same experimental setting, the release of TNF-α protein increased up to 6 h and then remained unchanged, whereas the release of IL-6 protein only started after 6 h of treatment (Fig 4A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">and 4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To exclude that autocrine effects of TNF-α were involved in the activation of macrophages, cell stimulation was performed in the presence of a TNF-α-receptor antagonist.</s><s>The TNF-α release induced by eRNA/Pam in the presence of the TNF-α-receptor blocker was unchanged after 2 h of treatment, whereas after 6 h, the cytokine release was significantly reduced by the TNF-α-receptor antagonist (S3 Fig).</s><s>Thus, activation of macrophages was performed only for 2 h to prevent any interfering effects by TNF-α itself.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Signaling pathways involved in TLR2 activation by combined eRNA/Pam treatment</head><p><s>To confirm the involvement of TLR2 in the macrophage response towards the combined agonists eRNA/Pam, a TLR2 neutralizing antibody was shown to abrogate not only the  eRNA/Pam-induced increase in TNF-α protein but also the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1 (Fig 5A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">-5E</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, the release of active TNF-α protein, which depends on the activation of the sheddase ADAM17, was abolished by the ADAM17-inhibitor TAPI (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>Since the activation of TLR2 involves engagement of the NFκB-pathway in any case, mRNA expression and protein release were totally blocked by the NFκB pathway inhibitor Bay.</s><s>In contrast, blockade of MAPkinases 42/44 and 38 by PD98059 and SB203580, respectively, partially reduced the release of TNF-α protein but did not affect mRNA expression of this cytokine (Fig 5A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">and 5B</ref>) and had variable effects on mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1 (Fig 5C <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">-5E</ref>).</s><s>No change in the cytokine mRNA expression or protein release was observed if these inhibitors were used in the absence of TLR2 agonists.</s><s>While the expression of TLR2 itself was slightly increased by eRNA or Pam alone and eRNA/Pam as well, other TLRs such as TLR3, 4 or 7 were not significantly affected in their mRNA expression upon exposure to either one of these agonists (S1 Supplement).</s></p><p><s>Influence of eRNA on the activation of TLR 3, 4, and 7</s></p><p><s>eRNA only slightly induced the activation of TLR4 by LPS, since at 1 ng/ml LPS (but not below or above this concentration) the release of TNF-α was moderately but significantly increased by eRNA (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>) without any remarkable effect on mRNA expression (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, eRNA had no influence on the activation of TLR7 and TLR3 by R848 and polyIC, as measured by the release of TNF-α (Fig 6B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">, 6C, 6E and 6F</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In the present study, self-eRNA was identified as a synergistic cofactor for Pam2CSK4, a typical TLR2 agonist, to strongly enhance macrophage activation.</s><s>The combined action of eRNA and Pam was not apparent for endosomal TLRs such as TLR3, TLR 7, or TLR 8, which all recognize non-self RNA.</s><s>However, under conditions of high abundance of self RNAs resulting from cell damage, defects in the RNA-degradation machinery, or after bindung and cellular uptake of RNA into endosomes, such self RNAs may activate endosomal PRRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>The combined action of eRNA/Pam resulted in a substantially elevated mRNA expression and release of cytokines in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, whereas each single agonist at the same concentration was ineffective.</s><s>Thus, the synergistic action of eRNA and Pam demonstrates a novel example of pathogen recognition and sensitization by host cells that is markedly influenced by DAMPs/alarmins and may only be observed in situations where a certain degree of cell stress or trauma with the release of eRNA has occured.</s><s>Another well-studied example of synergistic pathogen sensitization is CD14, the co-receptor for TLR4 in the recognition of LPS and the internalization of TLR2 ligands such as lipoteichoic acid or Pam3CSK4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, CD14 also binds to triacylated lipopeptides facilitating their recognition by TLR2/TLR1 complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Another case is CD36, which mainly acts as a sensor of diacylated lipopeptides that become recognised by TLR2/TLR6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The large difference between these surface-associated host proteins and eRNA is that the latter becomes released as DAMP upon cell stress or damage anywhere in the organism and thereby may fulfill a universal role as alarmin and sensitizer of TLR2-dependent cell responses.</s></p><p><s>As eRNA does not directly bind to CD14 or CD36 and also not to TLR2 itself, it is fair to assume that polymeric eRNA may serve as a scaffolding factor and could directly interact with multiple basic Pam molecules to ensure their enhanced recognition by TLR2.</s><s>This would explain that Pam promotes cell activation at very low concentrations only in the presence of eRNA.</s><s>An equivalent type of mechanism was observed in an experimental system with eRNA and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as interaction partners, since only in the Macrophages were pretreated with buffer, neutralizing antibodies against TLR2 (1 μg/ml), TAPI (10 μg/ml), Bay (100 μM), PD98059 (20 μM), or SB203580 (10 μM) for 30 min, and stimulated for 2 h with eRNA (10 μg/ml)/ Pam2CSK4 (Pam, 0.1 ng/ml), which were preincubated for 1 h at 37˚C.</s><s>Supernatants were analyzed for the release of TNF-α by ELISA (A).</s><s>Cell lysates were used for the quantification of mRNA expression of TNF-α (B), IL-6 (C), IL-1β (D), and MCP-1 (E) by qRT-PCR.</s><s>TNF-α release and mRNA expression induced by eRNA/Pam in the absence of presence of eRNA very low doses of VEGF could operate to induce endothelial cell signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In the present study it became obvious that the synergistic action of eRNA on TLR2 activation was dependent on the respective TLR2 ligand, whereby Pam2CSK4 showed a much higher synergistic response in comparison to FSL-1, although both ligands are known to bind to TLR2/TLR6 heterodimers.</s><s>Accordingly, synergistic activities of eRNA might rely on structure-and charge-dependent interactions with TLR2 ligands to facilitate TLR-activation.</s><s>Moreover, eRNA required preincubation with Pam2CSK4 prior to exposure towards macrophages to promote a synergistic TLR2-dependent response and eRNA digestion with RNase1 prior to the addition of Pam completely abolished eRNA/Pam-induced cytokine release.</s></p><p><s>Non-self bacterial DNA or RNA are protected from degradation, for example by their capsids, until they are released within the endo-lysosomal compartment of host cells, whereas self extracellular nucleic acids are degraded by nucleases, unless they are protected in nucleoprotein complexes or by association with cell membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, self nucleic acids may only reach endo-lysosomes and PRRs if bound to proteins or manipulated by e.g.</s><s>transfection agents.</s><s>For example, the antimicrobial peptide LL37 or HMGB1 can bind and protect RNA from degradation and shuttle it into endo-lysosomal compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, while self-RNA can be experimentally modified by transfection agents such as lipofectamin to reach intracellular compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>The latter, however, does not reflect the natural situation that was experimentally challenged in the present study.</s><s>Since the degradation of eRNA by RNase1 was not changed in the presence of Pam, the synergistic action of eRNA and Pam on TLR2 activation appears not to be related to eRNA protection against RNase1.</s><s>The cellular activity of eRNA might also depend on heterodimerization of TLRs and the type of TLR involved, as synergistic functions of eRNA were much stronger on agonists recognizing the TLR2/TLR6-compared to the TLR2/TLR1-heterodimer.</s><s>Moreover, only a minor eRNAdependent synergistic effect was seen for LPS in the activation of the TLR4 axis, and no influence was recognized for the typical RNA-receptors TLR3, TLR7 or TLR8.</s><s>At high concentrations of TLR3 agonist, poly IC, eRNA even seems to decrease the poly IC-induced TNF-α expression slightly, but not significantly.</s><s>Ligands of TLR3, like negatively charged doublestranded RNA, are quite different from ligands of TLR2 such as Pam containing more basic amino acids, which might change the binding modes of these ligands to their receptors in the presence of eRNA.</s><s>However, these results indicate that activities of DAMPs, which were identified to amplify the inflammatory response of PAMPs, differ appreciably regarding the activation of particular PRRs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>During longer periods of treatment, the continuous TNF-α release from macrophages was apparently due to autocrine stimulation as well, since blockade of the macrophage TNF-α receptor signaling resulted in diminished TNF-α-release.</s><s>Activation of the inflammasome leading to the caspase-1-dependent secretion of IL-1β seems not to be involved in the synergistic action of eRNA/Pam on TLR2 activation, as no release of IL-1β was detectable even after treatment of macrophages for longer time intervals up to 24 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Accordingly, a former study demonstrated DAMP-sensing of PRRs, whereby activation of endosomal TLRs by self-eRNA resulted in the uptake of eRNA into endosomes in a sequenceindependent manner by binding to the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), which had been identified as a surface-expressed self-eRNA receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the DAMP HMGB1 has been recognized as binding partner and general sentinel for immunogenic nucleic acids, as the absense of HMGB1 severely impaired the activation of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 by their cognate nucleic acid ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>HMGB1 further plays an important role in sepsis by facilitating the transfer of LPS to CD14 to initiate a TLR4-dependent proinflammatory response <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, the extracellular matrix component biglycan can act as an endogenous ligand of TLR4 and TLR2 and thereby sensitizes cells towards LPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>In accordance with these general mechanisms, we now describe eRNA as a sentinel for the activation of TLR2 by its cognate PAMP agonists to amplify the release of cytokines.</s></p><p><s>As cytokine-inducing activity of eRNA/Pam was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against TLR2, Myd88-induced pathways are likely to be involved.</s><s>Further signaling pathways required for the eRNA/Pam2SCK4-induced cytokine release involved the transcriptional activation of the NF-κB system, because blockade of this pathway fully abrogated the mRNAexpression as well as the release of TNF-α protein in macrophages.</s><s>In contrast, MAPkinase inhibitors only blocked the TNF-α release but not the mRNA expression, indicating the involvement of these MAPkinases in the activation of ADAM17, which is necessary for the shedding reaction of membrane-bound pro-TNF-α to release active soluble TNF-α <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>As TNF-α is liberated by the activation of ADAM17, this cytokine was already detected after 2 h treatment with eRNA/Pam (both ineffective when used alone), whereas the release of IL-6 protein was detectable only after 6 h stimulation.</s><s>Accordingly, the shedding of active TNF-α protein but not the mRNA expression of TNF-α, induced by eRNA/Pam, was blocked by TAPI, an inhibitor of ADAM17.</s><s>Surprisingly, the presence of TAPI significantly increased the mRNA expression of IL-1β and MCP-1 indicating a self-regulatory mechanism to compensate the missing TNF-α release.</s></p><p><s>Several studies demonstrated TLR activation even by isolated endogenous DAMPs, whereas the corresponding signaling pathways remain largely unknown.</s><s>The leucine-rich repeat motif of TLRs has been shown to be involved in the binding of PAMPs, but there is evidence that DAMPs require further cofactors or coreceptors for the optimal activation of TLRs and their association with diverse signaling routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study even indicates that the reported cytokine expression in response to putative endogenous ligands may in fact be due to PAMP contaminations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, in situations of cellular stress or upon infection, the DAMP eRNA serves a prominent cofactor role in facilitating PAMP-mediated activation of TLR2.</s><s>Only in a combined fashion, eRNA and TLR2-agonists promote activation of TLR2 on macrophages, resulting in appreciable cytokine mRNA expression and release, whereas each single agonist at the given concentration did not induce any inflammatory response.</s><s>Thus, it is proposed that the degree of tissue damage with the appearance of eRNA provides the appropriate condition for PAMP-dependent TLR2 activation.</s><s>As a consequence, chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, or atherosclerosis may depend on such perpetuated proinflammatory responses uncovered in this study.</s><s>In fact, eRNA was shown to be responsible for the development of such diseases in preclinical experimental animal models, whereby RNase1 administration resulted in a significant blockade of the inflammatory outcome and in considerable tissue protection <ref type="bibr"
