<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This study showed that HZ/su elicits strong gE-specific cellmediated and humoral immune responses in HIV-infected individuals after 2 and 3 doses and that the responses after dose 3 persist over prevaccination levels at least 1 year after the last vaccination.</s><s>HZ/su also elicited VZV-specific cell-mediated immune responses but to a lesser extent.</s><s>Furthermore, although the reactogenicity of HZ/su was substantial, no safety concerns arose in this population.</s></p><p><s>The primary immunogenicity objective of the study was met.</s><s>The superiority of HZ/su over saline was demonstrated at month 7 for both humoral and cellular immune responses.</s><s>These immune responses were comparable to those seen in healthy adults ≥50 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, 1 year after vaccination, the gE-specific CD4(2+) T-cell responses were higher than those seen 1 month after natural HZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>HZ/su is being evaluated as a 2-dose schedule in immunocompetent older adults, but it was not known whether 2 or 3 doses would be required to trigger a strong immune response in HIV-infected individuals.</s><s>The administration of a third dose  did not show substantial additional benefit over 2 doses in terms of gE-specific humoral and CMI immune responses.</s><s>These results suggest that, in terms of immunogenicity, a 2-dose schedule (at 0 and 2 months) is appropriate for HIV-infected adults, most of whom were receiving ART and have higher CD4 + T-cell counts, as it is for healthy older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, these results were similar to those obtained in another immunocompromised population, adult autologous HSCT recipients, in whom HZ/su was also strongly immunogenic <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Local and systemic reactions were common among HZ/su recipients, and up to 1 of 6 subjects experienced a severe solicited reaction, mostly injection site pain and fatigue.</s><s>However, these reactions were transient, and no subject withdrew from the study because of a solicited reaction.</s><s>No vaccination-related SAEs, deaths, or new onsets of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases were reported.</s><s>Furthermore, HZ/su had no sustained impact on either HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 + T-cell counts over the study period.</s></p><p><s>Few previous studies have assessed vaccination against HZ in HIV-infected populations.</s><s>One study evaluated safety and immunogenicity of 2 doses of a live-attenuated varicella vaccine (Varivax; Merck) as a HZ vaccine candidate in HIV-infected adults with CD4 + T-cell counts of &gt;400 cells/µL and HIV RNA loads of &lt; 1000 copies/mL <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>The vaccine was well tolerated and did not worsen HIV disease, but it was modestly immunogenic.</s><s>When given as 4 doses in HIV-infected adults with ≤200 CD4 + T cells/mm 3 , a heat-inactivated HZ vaccine induced low but significant VZV-specific T-cell and antibody responses and had a favorable safety profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study has some limitations.</s><s>Because of the widespread use of ART in clinical practice in countries participating in the study, we could not enroll many subjects in the ART/low CD4 + T-cell count and ART-naive cohorts.</s><s>Therefore, because most subjects were in the ART/high CD4 + T-cell count cohort, we pooled subjects of the 3 cohorts for analysis.</s><s>The analyses in the individual ART/low CD4 + T-cell count and ART-naive/ high CD4 + T-cell count cohorts had low statistical power because of the low numbers of subjects enrolled in these cohorts.</s><s>However, humoral and cellular immune responses were generally higher in the HZ/su groups than in the saline groups in both cohorts.</s><s>In this study, all subjects were to receive 3 doses of HZ/su; thus, long-term immunopersistence after 2 doses could not be assessed.</s><s>These data would be of interest because a 2-dose schedule is currently being evaluated in healthy older adults and may also be appropriate for HIV-infected adults.</s></p><p><s>One clinically confirmed case of HZ occurred in a subject who received 1 dose of HZ/su; however, this study was not designed to assess vaccine efficacy.</s><s>Furthermore, in the absence of an immunological correlate of protection for HZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, correlation between the immune responses described here and the level of clinical protection against HZ cannot be inferred, especially in this immunocompromised population.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study showed that HZ/su elicits strong gE-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in HIVinfected individuals after 2 doses and that the third dose added little if any immunological advantage.</s><s>Immunization with an adjuvanted gE subunit vaccine may be an appropriate approach to reduce the burden of HZ and its complications in HIV-infected adults and avoid any risks specific to a live-attenuated vaccine.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 2.
