<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Food allergy (FA) appears in diverse clinical patterns, typically involving the cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Besides observable clinical signs, many patients and parents also report subjective symptoms.</s><s>Infants may present with being uncomfortable or crying and preschool children may present with food refusal, unable to adequately express specific symptoms.</s><s>A causal link to a trigger food is usually suspected when signs or symptoms occur within 2 hours of ingestion but delayed appearance is sometimes observed, for example worsening of eczema and gastrointestinal symptoms.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Clinical evaluation of FA is usually set in motion based on a suggestive medical history, sometimes complemented through a prospective dietician-supervised elimination diet.</s><s>When the diagnosis is based only on self-reported symptoms or objective signs, a high number of healthy individuals are labeled food allergic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Objective assessment of sensitization (eg, skin prick test, allergen-specific immunoglobulin E) is considered to be the first step toward a more objective case definition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> but only challenge testing can verify the etiologic role of a suspected food. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>Current guidelines describe double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) as the highest diagnostic standard. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>riability may be introduced at the level of an individual physician's appraisal of signs and symptoms during food challenges, especially as those reported by food-allergic patients are expected to overlap with those of healthy individuals to a certain degree.</s><s>A permissive decision point should be chosen to miss only a small number of possible food allergies, including mild types, but this may result in falsely labeling healthy individuals as food allergic, leading to unnecessary restriction of nutrition and to faulty self-perception of FA status.</s><s>This may be an appropriate trade-off in clinical settings to secure the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening FA, but in research, observational and interventional, choosing a restrictive decision point based on more objectively measurable signs or symptoms would reduce the number of false positives and would strengthen comparability of data between study physicians (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> Using data from singleprotocol DBPCFCs conducted within the multicenter EuroPrevall birth cohort, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> we aimed to compare challenge outcomes as defined by the experienced and trained study physicians with those based on detailed documented signs and symptoms.</s><s>Our goal was to identify areas, which could be improved further to support comparability, including techniques used for challenge documentation and interpretation, and diagnostic algorithms to improve the current gold standard for a robust diagnosis of FA.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">| METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">| Setting and participants</head><p><s>The EuroPrevall birth cohort set out to estimate the frequency and factors influencing the onset and duration of FA in 9 study centers in 9 handling of the protocols.</s><s>Suspected food allergy was clinically evaluated by doubleblind, placebo-controlled food challenges using a nine dose escalation protocol.</s><s>The primary challenge outcomes based on physician's appraisal were compared to documented signs and symptoms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>Of 839 challenges conducted, study centers confirmed food allergy in 15.6% to 53.6% of locally conducted challenges.</s><s>Centers reported 0 to 16 positive placebo challenges.</s><s>Worsening of eczema was the most common sign when challenged with placebo.</s><s>Agreement between documented objective signs and the challenge outcome assigned by the physician was heterogeneous, with Cohen's kappa spanning from 0.42 to 0.84.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions: These differences suggest that the comparison of food challenge outcomes between centers is difficult despite common protocols and training.</s><s>We recommend detailed symptom assessment and documentation as well as objective sign-based challenge outcome algorithms to assure accuracy and comparability of blinded food challenges.</s><s>Training and supervision of staff conducting food challenges is a mandatory component of reliable outcome data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>K E Y W O R D S</head><p><s>data collection, decision-making, diagnostic techniques and procedures, food hypersensitivity, observer variation different European countries.</s><s>This initial phase of the cohort ran from birth to 30 months of age.</s><s>Detailed methods have been published previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>In short, 12 049 healthy newborns from the general population were enrolled before or shortly after birth and regularly followed in 6 month intervals, collecting data including dietary habits and other exposures.</s><s>Parents were instructed to report to their study center immediately upon suspected FA or developing eczema.</s><s>Additionally, interviews were conducted at 12, 24 and 30 months of age to screen for unrecognized signs or symptoms of food allergy.</s><s>For each child invited to the center and two age-matched healthy controls per symptomatic child, we performed skin prick tests (SPTs) and measured specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) antibodies in serum against six core allergens relevant in childhood (ie, cow's milk, hen's egg, wheat, soy, peanut, fish), plus suspected other food allergens.</s><s>The decision to perform a DBPCFC was based on a positive test for allergic sensitization (ie, SPT wheal ≥3 mm or sIgE ≥0.35 kU/L) without currently eating the food, immediate objective clinical signs and symptoms, subjective reactions upon repeated exposures or clear improvement under elimination diet.</s><s>Food challenges were performed in the participating clinics, supervised by trained physicians, and some centers asked families to stay overnight.</s><s>Delayed symptoms were considered up to 48 hours after the challenge.</s><s>Participants with confirmed FA were rechallenged after 12 months and, if still eligible, after 24 months of the initial diagnosis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Food challenges</head><p><s>The unit of observation for this analysis was a complete challenge including one food (verum) and a corresponding placebo control day.</s><s>A single placebo day may have served as a control for more than one food in question.</s><s>Two challenge days were randomly allocated to test food or placebo.</s><s>Challenge and placebo days were at least 48 hours apart.</s><s>Children were fed 9 incremental doses in 20 minute intervals under clinical supervision. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>The procedure was stopped at the discretion of the supervising physicians.</s><s>All physicians were trained in the food challenge protocol for this study to harmonize the identification of objective signs and symptoms warranting the discontinuation of the challenge.</s><s>However, as food allergy has very diverse appearances, it was not possible to formally define all indications for stopping the challenge, in particular in light of the patient's safety.</s><s>The assessment was unblinded after completion of the last challenge day.</s></p><p><s>In this analysis, we compared three different challenge-based definitions of food allergy, described in the following paragraphs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">| Physician's judgment of challenge outcome</head><p><s>For the first definition (physician's judgment), study physicians assigned outcomes (positive, negative) for each challenge day and then concluded an overall judgment after unblinding.</s><s>This overall conclusion was the first definition of food allergy used.</s><s>Patients were judged to be clinically tolerant (both days negative), allergic (test food positive, placebo negative), placebo reactors (test food negative, placebo positive), or inconclusive with regard to food allergy (both days positive).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">| Restrictive cutoff for challenge outcome</head><p><s>For the other two definitions of food allergy, clinical observations were recorded through a standardized record form with separate sections for each challenge step recording immediate and delayed (≥2 hours) reactions.</s><s>Besides skin assessment (SCORAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> ) and vital parameters before and after the challenge, 19 specific signs and symptoms were collected as dichotomous traits (present or absent).</s></p><p><s>Two different cutoff criteria were used to derive sign-and symptombased challenge outcomes.</s><s>After the judgment of the study physician was recorded, the restrictive cutoff (second definition of food allergy) to call a challenge positive was derived, limited to immediate urticaria, angioedema, flush, emesis, diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, immediate or late worsening of eczema with an objective SCORAD increase ≥10, and cardiovascular symptoms (never observed in this population).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">| Permissive cutoff for challenge outcome</head><p><s>The permissive cutoff (third definition of food allergy) additionally included reactions occurring more than 2 hours after the challenge (called delayed) and less pronounced worsening of eczema (SCORAD increase of 5 or more).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">| Statistical methods</head><p><s>Calculations were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</s><s>Missing data was rechecked against the initial study F I G U R E 1 Hypothetical distribution of symptom severity upon double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge in a preselected sample of preschool children evaluated for suspected food allergy matching eligibility criteria (eg, indicative history, specific sensitization), stratified by disease status (healthy vs food allergic)</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">| Main results</head><p><s>There were differences between centers comparing physician's appraisal and sign-and symptom-based outcomes recorded during blinded food challenges of infants and young children up to the age of 2 years within the multicenter EuroPrevall birth cohort study.</s><s>The agreement between the permissive cutoff and physician's appraisal was higher compared to the restrictive criteria, indicating a tendency for study physicians to apply a rather permissive decision threshold.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study center</head><p><s>The wide range of positive challenge outcomes between centers (15.6% to 53.6%) might either be due to a real difference in disease incidence, unequal inclusion thresholds to perform a challenge testing, or may, at least in part, result from differences in documenting and interpreting signs and symptoms of oral food challenges.</s><s>This emphasizes the need for standardization of all aspects of DBPCFCs including inclusion criteria, documentation of denial to participate, challenge conduct, and interpretation of the challenge outcome.</s></p><p><s>While the necessity of blinding in food challenges has been questioned (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> ), the considerable numbers of signs and symptoms during placebo challenges seen in this study, especially delayed self-reported eczema (18 times on placebo vs 81 on test food days), demonstrate that blinding is imperative for accurate interpretation of food challenges.</s><s>Interestingly, subjective gastrointestinal symptoms occurred almost only during the first lower doses, whereas subjective ENT symptoms and worsening of eczema were more common with higher doses of the tested allergen.</s><s>This could be due to different mechanisms of action, be it psychologic or biologic.</s><s>The frequent failure to reach the final dose during placebo challenges might be explained by the relatively large amounts of challenge agent used.</s><s>Interestingly, a high number of placebo reactors were seen in the first year of life, as has been shown previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>This finding stresses the need to perform blinded food challenges even in very young patients.</s></p><p><s>Detailed assessment and documentation of challenge signs and symptoms is a cornerstone of comparability, as seen by the difference between any eczema and SCORAD-scored eczema at the highest dose administered (on 66 vs 16 test food days).</s><s>It is likely that grading of other signs and symptoms could further improve the accuracy of food challenges.</s><s>Additionally, only three centers (A, C, F) recorded considerable numbers of subjective symptoms, supporting the need for a detailed assessment and documentation of these observations to be part of the challenge protocol.</s><s>These details could include grading, measurement, or weighting to improve comparability of challenge results.</s></p><p><s>That judgment of symptoms and clinical signs always relies on individual experience and appraisal threatens the validity of comparisons between study centers and observers, indicated by the considerable differences of positive placebo challenges (0 to 16 per center) and variable agreement comparing physician-based vs objective sign-based challenge outcomes (Cohen's kappa spanning from 0.42 to 0.84, restrictive cutoff).</s><s>In general, using a permissive cutoff yielded higher agreement with physician-based outcomes in all centers, highlighting the need for a unified, robust, and objective sign-based case definition for research.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">| Recommendations</head><p><s>Development and standardization of current guidelines and challenge protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> for the diagnosis of FA in the clinical setting are ongoing and should be promoted. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Their focus lies mainly on methodological aspects in light of their first priority, to rule out or confirm FA in real-life medical care settings.</s><s>Consequently, looking at different steps from suspicion to confirmation of FA, blinding of challenges, detailed sign and symptom assessment, and standardized interpretation of challenge outcomes are usually neglected, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> relying mainly on personal experience and individual judgment (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>When food challenges are used in research settings, these procedural aspects are likely to influence estimates of disease frequency and severity considerably and must not be ignored in study protocols.</s><s>Here, comparability and restrictive case definitions outweigh the usual "don'tmiss-any" approach, which is appropriate for individual care, where a false positive is a safer misclassification than a false negative.</s></p><p><s>As was done in this study, preparation and distribution of test food and placebo substrate should be centralized and off-site in research settings, ensuring a high degree of blinding.</s><s>Unblinding must be delayed until after the challenge documentation has been closed and, as is suggested to assess allocation concealment in clinical trials, blinding success should be documented by assessing participant's and study personnel's guessed allocation of each of the challenge days.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, already proposed but usually not implemented, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> all signs and symptoms should be quantified using appropriate measures such as size, distribution, and severity for skin manifestations beyond eczema, or amount and kind of vomit and diarrhea.</s><s>Moreover,  there is an urgent need for a standardized assessment of potentially relevant gastrointestinal symptoms like colic, and general symptoms like crying and being uncomfortable.</s><s>This is particularly needed for signs and symptoms commonly reported during placebo challenges and as delayed reactions (flush, urticaria, GI symptoms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> ).</s><s>Variation of clinical signs and symptoms, for example, worsening of eczema during or after the challenge day, can ideally be assessed by two independent physicians, the second blinded to judgment of the first, and not by parents alone.</s><s>Peer-to-peer teaching and training of reaction assessment may shed light on under-or over-recognized signs and symptoms and improve comparability.</s><s>As aimed for in this study, data entry for each challenge day should be closed before starting the next day.</s><s>Additionally, documentation of challenge details would support any independent and objective consideration of challenge outcomes.</s><s>These might include intentional and feasible protocol violations (eg, omission of the final dose), information about medical personnel (eg, level of experience), and the post-challenge period (eg, re-introduction of food, exact timing, and assessment of delayed reactions through professionals).</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F I G U R E 3</formula><p><s>Thirdly, after closing data entry, a centralized evaluation scheme could assign the final challenge outcome based on recorded signs and symptoms, with the need to register its technical implementation as a medical device.</s><s>Personnel on site should be asked to label observations they suspect to be causally linked to the ingested food, be it the allergen or placebo.</s><s>Challenge outcome and day allocation (unblinding) could then be finally returned to the clinical site.</s></p><p><s>Finally, using a generic online platform for research as well as individual care settings may facilitate data entry, for example, ensuring that data entry for each challenge day was closed before starting the next day, and allowing on-time queries and electronic evaluation of challenge outcomes.</s><s>Such an algorithm could be asked to return a binary decision (tolerant/reactive) using a rather loose cutoff with the intent to not miss any FA.</s><s>It may at the same time report quantified severity of the reaction using other cutoffs, ultimately improving comparability between physicians, clinical sites, and countries.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">| Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>As the current gold standard, blinded food challenges cannot be calibrated against another diagnostic test.</s><s>Therefore, we used the ideal setting of a large single-protocol, multicenter research project to indirectly identify potential shortcomings of its diagnostic capabilities.</s></p><p><s>Given stability of study personnel over time, heterogeneity of study centers in terms of initial experience with food challenges and different societal backgrounds between centers has allowed us to assess the influence of subjective (often undefined or not accessible) parameters, but we had no estimates for the individual experience of participating physicians.</s><s>With the lack of comparable prior knowledge about disease frequency and distribution of potential subtypes of FA in participating countries, we were not able to directly separate true from factitious intercenter differences.</s><s>We cannot prove that these differences indicate the influence of subjective parameters within this project alone or are rather due to possible disease heterogeneity, but with the procedural aspects identified here accounted for in future research, we will be closer to a true gold standard.</s><s>Of note, the study was neither designed nor powered for the presented analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">| Conclusion</head><p><s>There is no methodology to assess the accuracy and other diagnostic characteristics of blinded food challenges directly.</s><s>We demonstrated differences between centers of the multicenter EuroPrevall project in terms of overall reactivity to challenges, placebo reactions, and most importantly decision thresholds for assigning challenge outcomes based on physician's judgment.</s><s>Despite using the same robust, highest standard challenge protocol, these discrepancies suggest there can still be a residual influence of subjective and other non-standardized parameters, threatening valid comparison of results between centers, if challenge outcome is not based on objective signs.</s></p><p><s>We recommend centralized provision of allergens for food challenges, implementation of detailed sign and symptom quantification, and timely documentation in standardized challenge record forms and that only pre-agreed sign-and symptom-based challenge outcomes derived by unified algorithms should be relied upon.</s><s>These allow for continuous severity grading in addition to the usual dichotomous challenge outcome and provide valuable information for inter-and within-study comparisons.</s><s>The school-age follow-up (iFAAM) of the EuroPrevall project implemented these recommendations using case report forms that are publicly available (CRFs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> ).</s><s>Accounting for these recommendations will further improve the diagnostic gold standard of blinded food challenges for food allergies.</s></p></div>
