<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous population of cells that expand during cancer, inflammation and other pathological conditions, have been demonstrated to be important negative immune regulators. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> They accumulate around the germinal centers in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and are well known for their remarkable ability to suppress T-cell responses in the tumor microenvironment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>part from MDSCs, B cells might also act as negative regulators for antitumor immunity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>Although their presence is required in protective immunity against virus-induced tumors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> there is growing evidence that in B-cell-deficient μMT mice, the tumors tend to be rejected, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and adoptive transfer of B cells or serum can enhance squamous carcinogenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>These results imply that B cells are beneficial rather than inhibitory to tumor development.</s><s>Compared with the well-studied inhibition on T-cell responses by MDSCs, the effect of MDSCs on B-cell function remains unclear.</s></p><p><s>Immunoglobulin (Ig)A is well known for its prevalence in mucosal tissues and its role in mucosal immunity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>However, it is also clear that a proportion of IgA is present in the serum and hence does not participate in mucosal immunity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>The depletion of the intestinal microbiota causes deficiency in IgA production in the intestinal mucosa, but it has little effect on serum IgA levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>This result suggests that some serum IgA is produced independently of mucosal IgA through mechanisms that are unknown at present.</s><s>We frequently observed that in spleens of tumor-bearing mice, IgA + cells around the germinal centers become associated with MDSCs, prompting us to hypothesize that MDSCs might play a crucial role in the generation of IgA + cells and therefore the production of serum IgA.</s></p><p><s>Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important inflammatory cytokine and is secreted by both tumor and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>The biological functions of TNF are mediated by two receptors, TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2.</s><s>TNFR1 is expressed universally on almost all cell types, whereas TNFR2 is restricted to immune cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>As their ligand, TNF is either integrated in the plasma membrane as memTNF, where it binds mainly to TNFR2, or proteolytically released as soluble TNF, which functions as the main ligand for TNFR1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>ignaling pathways that are mediated by TNFR1 have been extensively studied.</s><s>As for TNFR2, although it was previously shown to be involved in MDSC survival and activity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> knowledge is lacking regarding its function and signaling pathways.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we revealed a novel dialog between MDSCs and B cells, which is mediated by memTNF on B cells and TNFR2 on MDSCs.</s><s>MDSCs activated by memTNF promoted splenic B cells to produce IgA.</s><s>Our results not only identify a role for MDSCs in humoral immune responses, hence influencing tumor growth, but also shed new light on the source of IgA + B cells, which have a crucial role for immunosuppression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>TERIALS AND METHODS Animals C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Weitonglihua Corporation (Beijing, China).</s><s>TNFR1 − / − mice of a mixed genetic background, including 129/Sv/Ev and C57BL/6, were kindly provided by Dr Horst Bluethmann (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland).</s><s>TNFR2 − / − mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory.</s><s>Both strains of mice were backcrossed for 12 generations onto the C57BL/6 background, and female mice aged 6-8 weeks were used.</s><s>All of the mice were maintained in a pathogen-free barrier facility at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</s><s>The animal experiments were carried out with the approval of the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>On the basis of the observation that IgA + cells at the edge of the germinal centers in tumor-bearing mouse spleens were surrounded by MDSCs, we investigated the role of MDSCs in serum IgA production.</s><s>We found that the cell-cell contactdependent activation of MDSCs was mediated via TNFR2 on MDSCs and memTNF on B cells.</s><s>As a result, activated MDSCs promoted splenic IgA production.</s><s>Our study reveals a novel dialog between MDSCs and B cells in tumor-bearing mice.</s></p><p><s>MDSCs from various pathological conditions, such as cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases, are able to suppress T-cell responses; 4 however, their effects on B cells are not well established.</s><s>MDSCs from mice with collagen-induced arthritis inhibit autologous B-cell proliferation and antibody production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>MDSCs from a retrovirus infection model also counteracted B-cell responses in vitro. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>However, aluminduced myeloid cell populations are required for in vivo priming and expansion of antigen-specific B cells, as well as for optimal antibody production in mouse models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> supporting the idea that MDSCs boost B-cell function.</s><s>Similarly, we found that MDSCs from MCA205 tumor-bearing mice promoted B-cell proliferation and IgA production.</s><s>As murine MDSC populations are typically heterogeneous, exhibiting various phenotypes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> it is possible that different MDSC subsets elicit different effects on B-cell functions.</s><s>However, further studies are required to address this question.</s></p><p><s>The well-studied source of IgA is gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which is responsible for the generation of IgA-secreting cells in response to commensals and pathogens, against which IgA acts as a first-line barrier. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>In our system, IgA production was detected in a co-culture system of MDSCs and nonadherent spleen cell fractions containing B cells.</s><s>Currently, B cells are subdivided into at least three subtypes, namely B1 cells, follicular B2 cells and marginal zone B cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>1 cells are mainly enriched in the peritoneal and pleural cavities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>Follicular B2 cells and marginal zone B cells constitute the majority of splenic B cells, and they are found in B-cell follicles and the marginal zone, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>By culturing purified B-cell populations, a related study reported that enhanced IgA class switching occurred in mouse splenic marginal zone B cells relative to follicular B2 cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>In agreement with these earlier results, we found that MDSCs were co-localized with B220 + marginal zone B cells in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice; however, little is known about the function of IgA from non-intestinal tissues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>ntestinal IgA that is induced by commensals does not act as a pro-inflammatory factor; instead, it regulates intestinal homeostasis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s>IgA levels are elevated in the presence of various tumors; therefore, such changes can be used as parameters to monitor disease and/or to establish a prognosis, including IgA that is specific for an Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients; <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> IgA that is specific for Helicobacter pylori in patients with gastric cancer; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> and serum IgA in head, neck and prostatic carcinomas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref></s><s>IgA-deficient individuals have a higher risk for autoimmune disorders, but not for cancer development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref></s><s>This close relationship between IgA and cancer frequency prompted us to investigate the role of IgA in tumor development.</s><s>As the IgA production from splenic B cells was increased in the presence of MDSCs, we hypothesized that the IgA produced upon stimulation by MDSCs could facilitate tumor growth by inhibiting antitumor immunity; however, its effect needs to be clearly demonstrated through further experimentation.</s></p><p><s>The role of B-cell function during tumor immunity remains under debate.</s><s>On one hand, B cells impair tumor development by facilitating T-cell-mediated responses.</s><s>Additionally, depletion of CD20 + B cells enhanced the tumor burden in the lungs of a B16-F10 melanoma model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s>However, syngeneic tumors progress poorly in B-cell-deficient μMT mice unless they are replenished with B220 + B cells, as a non-protective humoral immune response is induced in the presence of B cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>dditionally, it has been described that splenectomy can inhibit tumor growth in certain cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref></s><s>IgA + plasmocytes suppressed the antitumor immunity in a mouse prostate cancer model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>owever, several questions remain to be addressed before the mechanism of how IgA + plasmocytes suppress antitumor immunity is clear.</s><s>In particular, the point of whether the suppression can be attributed to the role of IgA + plasmocytes or IgA alone needs further study.</s><s>Here, we found that MDSCs in the spleen of tumor-bearing mice preferentially induced the production of IgA, rather than IgG or IgM.</s><s>This result suggests that the effects of B cells on tumor immunity might be attributed to the Ig-subtype composition, with IgA having negative and IgG or IgM having supporting effects on immunity against tumors.</s><s>TNF signaling affects MDSC differentiation and activation on different levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref></s><s>TNFR2 is a crucial factor for splenic MDSC accumulation and activation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>We found that the lack of this receptor on MDSCs abrogated the ability to promote B-cell responses, whereas the lack of TNFR1 exhibited no such effect.</s><s>Different from TNFR1, TNFR2 is highly regulated, resulting in low expression levels only on immune cells under physiological conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref></s><s>The ligand involved in MDSC activation via TNFR2 is memTNF, but not soluble TNF. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> In the spleen, B-cell-TNF signals are important for maintaining the structure of follicular dendritic cell clusters and germinal centers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref></s><s>Additionally, memTNF supports the formation of germinal centers during autoimmune inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref></s><s>In agreement with these earlier results, we showed here that splenic B cells are the major source of memTNF, the ligand for TNFR2-dependent MDSC activation.</s><s>However, memTNF not only transmits signals to target cells as a ligand, but also acts as a receptor that transmits outside-to-inside (reverse) signals back to the cells after binding to its native receptors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref></s><s>hether the reverse signaling is involved in IgA synthesis in B cells still requires investigation.</s></p><p><s>The role of TNF in tumor immunity is complex.</s><s>Previous data reported that TNF promotes antitumor responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47</ref></s><s>owever, contrary evidence is becoming more and more abundant, which shows that TNF has tumor-promoting effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref></s><s>The opposing effects of TNF in tumor immunity are closely related to its different temporal and spatial expression patterns.</s><s>Targeting TNF is becoming a treatment option in both immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref></s><s>However, anti-TNF therapy is still in its early stages, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> and therefore further studies will be required to identify the precise mechanisms of this targeted therapy in different organs and immune system.</s><s>Together, our study provides the first evidence that in tumor-bearing mice, MDSCs activated via TNFR2 by memTNF on B cells promote splenic IgA production, hence suggesting a potential beneficial contribution of anti-TNF therapy to treat inflammatory diseases, which may also have suppressive effects on cancer progression.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure
