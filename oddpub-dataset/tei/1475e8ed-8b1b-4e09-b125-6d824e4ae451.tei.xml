<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The valid prediction of haemodynamics after aortic valve and vascular surgery opens up several opportunities for individualized pre-treatment planning, decision making and optimisation in patients with AVD.</s><s>We were able to successfully perform the virtual procedure in ten patients with varying types of AVD and to use model-based therapy planning for accurate prediction of post-operative haemodynamic outcome after AVR.</s><s>Thus, a fully operational virtual valve treatment procedure with all its challenges described was shown to be applicable in a first disease-specific study cohort of AVD patients.</s></p><p><s>Based on a fully non-invasive MRI assessment, treatment can be simulated prior to the actual procedure and entirely free of risk to the patient.</s><s>Pursuing the aim of physiological flow condition restoration after AVR, the prediction of flow profiles can be helpful for decision making concerning (1) valve type, (2) size, (3) position, and (4) modifications to the ascending aorta.</s><s>The avoidance of alterations in secondary flow and WSS can already help to limit several risk factors associated with long-term morbidity and mortality after AVR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, recent publications focusing on post-operative haemodynamic outcome after aortic valve surgery have shown significant differences between different types of valve prostheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>In our patient population a high standard deviation for all examined parameters was observed, reflecting such high inter-individual variability after surgical treatment, as well as in its virtually predicted counterpart.</s><s>While high variance is a strong motivator for improving treatment planning in the future it was accepted in the validation study as it replicates current clinical practice.</s><s>There is still a marked eccentric flow pattern seen post-operatively in the majority of patients, which has Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</s><s>The comparison of aortic geometries (example).</s><s>The accuracy of the vascular geometry is verified in order to ensure accurately set boundary conditions (A) The virtual anatomy is automatically overlaid with the actually resulting anatomy, providing mean differences between both measures and the Hausdorff distance.</s><s>(B) shows the surfaces distance between geometries.</s><s>been predicted correctly.</s><s>The degree of eccentricity has been shown to be associated with the degree of growth rate of the ascending aorta in patients with bicuspid aortic valves <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Regarding WSS it has been described, that elevated localized WSS was associated with typical patterns of ascending aorta dilation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>In our patient population we have found regions of increased WSS leading to a higher value of averaged WSS along the ascending aorta.</s><s>However, in order to possibly predict a none-eccentric flow pattern or a normalized WSS pattern along the ascending aorta, the validated procedure needs to be applied to patient specific geometries in combination with different types of devices or different surgical techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>The opportunity to test a diverse set of surgically implantable devices in a given patient-specific anatomy carries the potential for additional decision support regarding procedure types -potentially reducing the risk for recurrent interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>In the majority of patients Bland-Altman plots showed sufficient agreement and regression plots showed good correlations for maximal velocity across the aortic valve, SFD and WSS in the ascending aorta, which already promotes confidence in the models' explanatory power and outputs.</s><s>The prediction of the maximal velocity across the aortic valve may play a role in individual prediction of prosthesis-patient mismatch, which has been described to be present in 19-70% of cases and was shown to impact mortality and morbidity after aortic valve replacement <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Maximal velocity can be converted to maximal gradient across the aortic valve and a difference of below 1.5 m/s would be a difference of mean gradient of approximately 4-5 mmHg, which was not considered to be a clinically relevant difference.</s><s>The Bland-Altman plot shows only 1 patient with a value of &gt;1.96 standard deviations for maximum velocity and show statistical comparability.</s><s>Potentially, even lower differences could be of clinical relevance.</s><s>However in clinical practice current imaging modalities used for assessing peak velocity (echo, MRI) also carry a similar risk for uncertainty in their measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>The clinical importance of differences found for surface averaged WSS values and SFD still need to be closer investigated in future clinical outcome-oriented studies.</s><s>Nevertheless, in the literature WSS associated with normal endothelial function is defined as range between 1 and 15 Pa 35 or even higher, the difference of 7-10 Pa would be considered as clinically acceptable.</s><s>In 90% of the cases the Bland-Altman plot shows difference within this range.</s><s>In regard to SFD it is described that elevation of SFD is present in the ascending aorta of patients with bicuspid aortic valves and associated with dilation of the ascending aorta <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>In our 10 cases SFD varied between 0.2 and 1.2.</s><s>In bicuspid aortic valve disease SFD of 2.5 has been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Thus, differences of 0.2 we considered as clinically acceptable.</s><s>In our patient cohort 80% of cases showed differences below 0.2.</s></p><p><s>The correctness of the prediction is limited by the accuracy of the boundary conditions.</s><s>The personalisation of all simulations was achieved by adapting the model as closely as possible to individual anatomical and haemodynamic data.</s><s>We used two anatomical parameters (averaged surface distance and Hausdorff distance) to verify the correctness of the geometrical boundary conditions.</s><s>Instead of an idealized flow profile patient-specific LVOT-inflow profiles used were based on 4D MRI data assessed before treatment.</s><s>By combining the patient's pre-treatment imaging data with a database of aortic valve geometries a valid model of the interplay of LVOT specific flow and the open valve characteristics is provided, and was shown to correctly simulate the impact on post-operative flow in the ascending aorta <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>As described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> we also observed disturbances in flow profiles and slightly elevated post-surgical flow velocities across biological and mechanical heart valves.</s><s>As it was shown before we were able to confirm good agreement of blood flow patterns and velocity fields between 4D flow and CFD <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>The present study contains data of a small patient cohort where the intent was to establish a virtual treatment workflow and validate its results in a first cohort of N = 10 patients.</s><s>Further validation in larger cohorts will be required before considering its routine clinical application.</s><s>Follow-up MRI were performed between 5-277 days after surgical treatment, thus, in few patients remodelling of the left ventricle could already have taken place and could have influenced the post-operative outcome parameters, which would not be predictable.</s><s>However, good comparability of the predicted and post-operative parameters suggests that possible effects generated by remodelling processes might have only played a minor role.</s><s>The predictive modelling in general is unable to take into account all possible changes in boundary conditions due to the real treatment procedure which can be considered a general limitation of all predictive models.</s></p><p><s>In a growing population of digitally represented patients the conduct of entirely virtual studies can be another prospect.</s><s>Without any risk for the patient, inhomogeneity between treatment groups or carry-over bias, major challenges of interventional studies as well as conventional single case design trials could be overcome.</s><s>In a virtual intervention cohort patients can safely undergo numerous different treatment methods under identical conditions.</s></p><p><s>Although cardiovascular models based on imaging data were demonstrated to produce results comparable to clinical diagnostic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , their combination with interventional study designs remained challenging and complex in heart valve disease.</s><s>A technically and clinically oriented approach has recently helped to identify anatomical and functional target parameters in degenerative mitral valve disease with potential use for treatment planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , and Kassab et al. recently highlighted the capabilities of new modelling technologies and quantitative approaches to surgical decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>It will, however, highly depend on the skills of the surgeon or interventional cardiologist to transfer such decisions to the patient.</s><s>Additionally, haemodynamic outcome covers only one aspect of a treatment procedure.</s><s>Several other non-haemodynamic problems can arise in patients undergoing AVR, affecting the overall morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Despite other risks nearly 50% of AVR procedures are linked to coronary artery bypass surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , representing an influence on the treatment group that has not yet been incorporated into the modelling simulations.</s></p><p><s>Future research should address these limitations in upcoming clinical trials.</s><s>As aortic flow patterns were demonstrated to be consistent with post-operative patient data future in-silico studies will already be able to iteratively explore a variety of treatment options.</s><s>The overall concept of a CFD-based virtual treatment and the validation methodology are not exclusively limited to AVD and could be of value in other structural heart valve disease, and in complex cases of congenital heart disease.</s></p><p><s>Computational modelling is desirable to bridge the gap between the existing situation and the emerging paradigms of precision medicine, in which patient-specific quantitative metrics and data guide therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Such individually targeted interventions are likely to have an impact on clinical practice and the decision-making process.</s><s>Our findings already support the potential benefit of clinical application of model-based predictions in aortic valve disease in near future.</s><s>They open up the unprecedented opportunities for improvements in patient care, device selection, surgical strategy, and consequently the reduction of risk.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2
