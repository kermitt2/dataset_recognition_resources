<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This was a prospective observational study, involving five European centres.</s><s>The ethics committees of each participating centre approved the study protocol.</s><s>Patients selected for the study were informed in detail about aims, procedures and follow-up, and gave written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient selection and assessment</head><p><s>Patients were enrolled consecutively from a pool of subjects with faecal incontinence referred to specialist centres between June 2011 and December 2013.</s><s>Patient selection was based on data collected from the patient's history, physical examination, continence diary (recorded for 14 days, including episodes of incontinence to gas, liquid and solid stool, postevacuation soiling episodes, inability to postpone defaecation, and time to postpone defaecation), Cleveland Clinic Faecal Incontinence Score (CCFIS; ranging from 0 to 20) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , Vaizey score (ranging from 0 to 24) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , American Medical Systems (AMS) score (ranging from 0 to 120) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , QoL questionnaires (Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL) Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and Short Form 36 (SF-36 ® ; Quality Metric, Lincoln, Rhode Island, USA) Health Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ), and endoanal ultrasonography (EAUS).</s><s>All data were collected prospectively in a specially designed data sheet booklet.</s></p><p><s>The following selection criteria were used: patients aged between 18 and 80 years; FI onset at least 6 months previously; faecal incontinence episodes (soiling or incontinence to liquid and/or solid stool) occurring more than once a week and resistant to other conservative treatments (pharmacological and behavioural); EAUS evaluation showing intact anal sphincters, or a lesion only of the internal anal sphincter (IAS), with a maximum circumferential extension of 60 ∘ .</s></p><p><s>Patients were excluded when any of the following criteria were encountered: EAUS evidence of an IAS lesion larger than 60 ∘ or any external anal sphincter (EAS) lesion; previous anal surgery for faecal incontinence (including injection or implantation of another bulking agent); active Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Device for THD Gatekeeper™ implantation, including both the delivery system and dispensers in which a single prosthesis is placed  positions in the perianal area, 2 cm from the anal verge, for the implantation of six Gatekeeper™ prostheses.</s><s>A specially designed delivery system (THD Gatekeeper™ Delivery System; THD SpA) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) was used during the implantation procedure.</s><s>The introducer was tunnelled from each skin incision to the intersphincteric margin and introduced into the intersphincteric space.</s><s>All prosthesis placement steps were checked by digital palpation, direct vision (using the Eisenhammer anal dilator) and EAUS.</s><s>At the end of the procedure, EAUS was used to show the location of all six prostheses.</s><s>Antibiotics were prescribed for 3 days.</s><s>Patients were advised to avoid any anal trauma and distress, as well as sexual intercourse during the first 48 h after implantation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Postoperative evaluation and follow-up</head><p><s>Clinical evaluation (including symptoms and physical examination) and EAUS were scheduled 1, 3 and 12 months after surgery.</s><s>All patients included in the study attended all follow-up appointments, so that none was lost to follow-up.</s><s>For each follow-up visit, patients kept a 14-day continence diary, and CCFIS, Vaizey and AMS scores were determined; FIQL and SF-36 ® questionnaires were also repeated.</s><s>All adverse events occurring during the follow-up period were recorded.</s></p><p><s>The clinical success of the Gatekeeper™ was measured using strict criteria, requiring an improvement of 75 per cent or more in all the following faecal incontinence parameters: total number of faecal incontinence episodes per week; number of episodes of soiling per week; number of episodes of incontinence to gas per week; number of episodes of incontinence to liquid per week; number of episodes of incontinence to solid stool per week.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Fifty-four patients (17 men and 37 women; median age 66 (range 41-80) years) were enrolled in the study between June 2011 and November 2013.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows baseline history, clinical and QoL data.</s><s>EAUS demonstrated no sphincter injury in 48 patients (89 per cent) and an isolated IAS defect (range 30-60 ∘ ) in six (11 per cent).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The protocol design of the present study was aimed primarily at investigating the efficacy of Gatekeeper™ implantation in the anal canal of patients with faecal incontinence.</s><s>The procedure was used in patients with faecal incontinence with no sphincter lesion or with a very limited IAS gap, where the use of injectable bulking agents is mostly effective.</s><s>Injectables are usually comprised of microparticles, which are diluted and then injected.</s><s>This is considered a safe procedure; the adverse events are described to be uncommon, minor and self-limiting, the commonest being proctalgia and/or local pain, local bruising, inflammation, and expulsion of the agent.</s><s>However, migration and/or degradation of injected agents occurs quite frequently, as demonstrated in a recent study by Guerra and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , which evaluated 19 patients variously 'injected' for idiopathic faecal incontinence.</s><s>These authors found that, on average, only 14 per cent of the originally injected volume was still detectable at EAUS performed at a median follow-up of 7 years, and the clinical improvements achieved in the short term had declined significantly.</s></p><p><s>Indeed, the displacement of bulking agents should be considered as the main cause of the possible progressive decline in therapeutic effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>In 2010, a systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> of the efficacy and safety of injectables for passive faecal incontinence included 14 heterogeneous series (420 patients); the conclusions drawn were not definitive, although the procedure appeared safe and the improvements significant.</s><s>A further systematic review <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> analysed 31 published studies and eight meeting abstracts (1070 patients in total).</s><s>Pooled analysis showed improved continence in 69⋅7 per cent of patients in the postoperative period, but in only 45⋅2 per cent at the 12-month follow-up.</s><s>In 2013, in a Cochrane review <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> of five randomized studies (all but 1 with uncertain or high risk of bias) that included 382 patients, the authors noted that: 'No longterm evidence on outcomes was available and further conclusions were not warranted from the available data.</s><s>None of the studies reported patient evaluation of outcomes and thus it is difficult to gauge whether the improvement in incontinence scores matched practical symptom improvements that mattered to the patients'.</s></p><p><s>In a multicentre trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , 206 patients were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio between submucosal injection of dextranomer in stabilized hyaluronic acid gel or sham injection.</s><s>In the treatment arm, 82⋅5 per cent of patients required a double injection to stabilize the results.</s><s>Adverse events were more frequent in the treatment group.</s><s>At 6 months, 52 per cent of patients obtained at least a 50 per cent reduction in faecal incontinence episodes; however, surprisingly, the sham injection group showed a 31 per cent success rate (P = 0⋅009).</s><s>Results from 112 of 132 patients in the treatment arm were updated in 2014; the same success rate (52 per cent) was observed at the 36-month follow-up, with significant improvement of both faecal incontinence severity and QoL scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>La Torre and de la Portilla 18 used the same material (dextranomer in stabilized hyaluronic acid gel) in 115 patients with faecal incontinence and an intact EAS.</s><s>At 24 months, 32 patients were withdrawn from the study, mostly owing to withdrawal of consent (17 patients), reducing the number of those with 24-month follow-up to 83.</s><s>Of these, 63 per cent were considered responders because they experienced at least a 50 per cent reduction in faecal incontinence episodes; significant improvement was documented for both the faecal incontinence severity score and QoL.</s><s>Although the long-term results from these two series, following the injection of dextranomer in stabilized hyaluronic acid gel, seem interesting, the injectable is comprised of diluted microparticles, and thus the stability of the material at the site of injection needs to be confirmed.</s><s>Moreover, in these studies, the success rate was also calculated using the criterion 'at least 50 per cent reduction in faecal incontinence episodes', which is of debatable value.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to the injectables, the Gatekeeper™ consists of solid prostheses of polyacrylonitrile biocompatible material, self-expandable when in contact with body fluids, with a significant increase in prosthetic volume (owing to its highly hydrophilic property), maintaining memory of their shape, without further material deterioration.</s><s>Prostheses are implanted into the intersphincteric space in a safe and accurate procedure.</s><s>They attain the increased volume within 48 h, then self-fix in the desired position, preventing, in the vast majority of patients, any significant displacement.</s><s>Prostheses are clearly visualized and defined by EAUS during both surgical implantation and followup.</s><s>Preliminary results obtained by implanting four prostheses in 14 patients have highlighted the significant improvement in faecal incontinence episodes, soiling, faecal incontinence severity scores and patients' QoL, during follow-up approaching 3 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In the present study, patients complained of a high number of episodes of soiling, gas and liquid incontinence.</s><s>The difficulty of managing this kind of incontinence using the available procedures is well known.</s><s>The majority of the other therapeutic options (including injectables) usually result in a high proportion of failure, even when using a poor cut-off for success (at least 50 per cent improvement in either faecal incontinence episodes or severity scores) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>However, even when successful, residual soiling or incomplete control of gas or liquid stool may represent the leading reason for dissatisfaction.</s><s>In contrast, in the present study, the clinical efficacy of the Gatekeeper™ was investigated not by using the usual 'at least 50 per cent improvement' cut-off of a single parameter, but much stricter criteria.</s><s>The treatment was considered successful only when all of the faecal incontinence parameters reached at least 75 per cent improvement compared with baseline values.</s><s>This approach in evaluating therapeutic success, even though unusual, is presumed to be much more reliable.</s><s>In this context, obtaining such high performance in the majority of patients (56 per cent had at least 75 per cent improvement, and 13 per cent became fully continent) seems significant.</s><s>If 'at least 50 per cent improvement' had been used as the cut-off for success in the present study, 38 (70 per cent) of the 54 patients would have been classified as responders.</s><s>In particular, the detailed patient diaries showed a significant decrease in soiling and all types of faecal incontinence; these improvements remained stable over the 1-year follow-up.</s><s>It is worth highlighting the results for soiling and incontinence to gas and liquid stool, which decreased significantly in the present study (P &lt;
