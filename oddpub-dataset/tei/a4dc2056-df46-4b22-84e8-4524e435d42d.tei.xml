<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Around 7 % of Europeans suffer from chronic neuropathic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>This is characterized as a spontaneously occurring, burning pain with increased sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>It often develops following peripheral nerve injury as a result of trauma or disease such as herpes virus or diabetes mellitus, and only 40-60 % of sufferers gain relief from treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>The systemic administration of classical opioids such as morphine might be an effective treatment in some neuropathic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The use of these drugs remains controversial, however, due to the high dosage required and the central side effects, including sedation, respiratory depression, cognitive impairment, and dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>The obvious and numerous drawbacks of the current treatment highlight the need for new, more effective therapeutic strategies and mechanistic insights into neuropathic pain control.</s><s>There is evidence that activation of opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons results in effective analgesia devoid of central adverse effects.</s><s>This can be achieved through the injection of exogenous opioids in small, systemically inactive doses into peripheral injured tissue or via endogenous opioid peptides, including Met-enkephalin, dynorphin A (1-17) (dynorphin), and β-endorphin released from locally accumulating immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>During the inflammation which occurs as a result of nerve injury, macrophages are recruited to the site of damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Since the leukocyte influx coincides with pain, earlier studies focused on pro-nociceptive actions of macrophages.</s><s>Strategies based on general depletion of these cells resulted in either complete blockade, moderate reduction, or no changes in neuropathyinduced hypersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, macrophages are characterized by phenotypic diversity, including pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>In previous studies, the macrophage function was modified by using agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), which promote the polarization toward the M2 phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>Application of a PPAR-γ agonist into incised paws increased M2 macrophage numbers and mRNA levels of their markers, including the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10), which was associated with the attenuation of postoperative pain.</s><s>This analgesic effect was mimicked by a local transfer of PPAR-γ agonist-treated peritoneal macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, PPAR-γ or toll-like receptor 4 activation in inflamed paws elevated nociceptive thresholds, which was reversed by local application of an opioid receptor antagonist, indicating the involvement of endogenous opioid peptides in the carrageenan or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) inflammatory pain models <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The role of polarized macrophages in neuropathic pain has not been as extensively studied.</s><s>Injured nerves following partial sciatic nerve ligation were found to be infiltrated by M1 and M2 macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and perineural transplantation of the PPAR-γ agonist-treated macrophages attenuated neuropathy-induced mechanical hypersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Another study found that injection of IL-4 at the nerve injury site shifted the macrophage phenotype to the M2 anti-inflammatory state, which was associated with decreased mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and elevated mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and correlated with amelioration of tactile and thermal hypersensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Together, studies examining the role of phenotypically different macrophage populations in neuropathy are sparse and exclusively focused on the actions of macrophage-derived cytokines.</s><s>Notably, immune cells accumulating at damaged nerves also contain opioid peptides, which upon release activate local neuronal opioid receptors and attenuate neuropathy-induced hypersensitivity in animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>However, the potential role of opioid peptides derived from different macrophage populations in neuropathy has so far not been assessed.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we investigated the relative contribution of M0, M1, and M2 macrophages to the modulation of neuropathic pain using an adoptive transfer strategy, in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) mouse model.</s><s>To this end, we cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice, inducing a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype using IL-4.</s><s>The unstimulated M0 phenotype represented a low activation state.</s><s>Surface marker analysis by flow cytometry and cytokine release by cytokine bead array (CBA) were used to distinguish activation phenotypes.</s><s>The opioid peptide content and release were measured using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA).</s><s>Finally, the relevance of polarized macrophages in modulation of mechanical and heat sensitivity in vivo was examined using von Frey and Hargreaves tests, respectively.</s></p></div>

group)</s></p><p><s>injected polarized macrophages could be detected in the nerve.</s><s>Thus, the total number of injected macrophages (F4/80 + CFSE + ) was significantly increased particularly after the second injection of M0, M1, and M2 cells compared to DMEM application, while the number of endogenous macrophages (F4/80 + CFSE − ) was not substantially altered across the treatments.</s><s>This finding also suggests that the equivalent increase in the total number of all leukocytes (CD45 + cells) in the nerve was brought about by the injected macrophages.</s><s>However, the numbers of injected cells isolated from nerves were lower than expected, since we injected 5 × 10 5 macrophages twice, but found around 5-6 × 10 5 of M0 and M1 cells and about 4 × 10 5 of M2 cells after the second injection.</s><s>This might be related to technical reasons since isolation of cells from the nerve 15 and 16 days following CCI is difficult due to a buildup of scar tissue, which can lead to loss of cells.</s><s>Another possibility is that some injected cells were removed/phagocytosed by endogenous cells, and it remains to be clarified why M2 cells were the most affected.</s><s>Analysis of the surface marker profile of the injected (CFSE + ) M0, M1, and M2 macrophages following perineural injection showed that these cells retained their phenotype in vivo; their CD163 and MHC II expression at both time points following transfer closely resembled the CD163 and MHC II expression profiles seen in our in vitro culture experiments.</s><s>However, the phenotype of endogenous (CFSE − ) macrophages showed some modifications.</s><s>Although their CD163 and MHC II expression profile was not altered following the first injection of M0, M1, and M2 cells, the second injection of these cells resulted in a decreased percentage of endogenous macrophages expressing CD163 when compared to the DMEM control.</s><s>In contrast, the percentage of MHC II + endogenous macrophages was higher following the second injection of M1 cells, with no significant alterations induced by injected M0 and M2 macrophages compared to the DMEM control.</s><s>Taken together, these results demonstrate that a fraction of injected polarized macrophages remain at the injured nerves and generally preserve their original phenotype.</s><s>Additionally, the injected cells seem to have an effect on the endogenous macrophages, with injected M1 cells appearing to increase the M1 phenotype of endogenous macrophages based on the elevated MHC II profile.</s><s>The effect on CD163 expression is less clear since it was decreased by all injected cells irrespective of their phenotype, and therefore, the data must be interpreted cautiously as characterization of macrophage phenotypes in vivo is challenging and analysis of a broad spectrum of markers would be required <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Recapitulating the findings of our in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo experiments, it can be concluded that the ability of M2 cells to produce and secrete the highest levels of opioid peptides and to preserve their M2 phenotype following perineural transfer underlie their analgesic effects in vivo.</s><s>The fact that their numbers ex vivo were lower than expected may explain the observation that the neuropathy-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was not completely reversed to the pre-injury thresholds.</s><s>There is also a clear agreement between in vivo and ex vivo experiments showing that two M2 cell injections were more effective than the single one.</s><s>The need for multiple macrophage injections was also demonstrated for recovery from spinal cord injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</s><s>Although the numbers of M0 cells were higher compared to M2 cells following the perineural transfer, the finding that they released lower amounts of opioid peptides may account for their inability to attenuate neuropathy-induced hypersensitivity.</s><s>On the other hand, the M1 cells did not enhance sensitivity following either CCI or sham operation, despite the fact that they secreted the lowest amounts of opioid peptides and the highest levels of proinflammatory cytokines, preserved their M1 phenotype following perineural injection and seemed to enhance the M1 phenotype of endogenous macrophages, and were detected ex vivo in higher numbers than M2 cells.</s><s>Though somewhat unexpected, the findings regarding M0 and M1 cells are in line with earlier studies suggesting a limited role of macrophages in the generation of pain.</s><s>Hence, a general depletion of macrophages often resulted either in moderate elevations or no changes in the nociceptive thresholds in models of neuropathic, inflammatory, and postoperative pain <ref type="bibr">[15-17, 64, 65]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, injection at the nerve or into a hind paw of non-polarized peritoneal or bone marrow-derived macrophages or of IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages did not induce pain in sham-operated animals and did not enhance hypersensitivity induced by neuropathy or paw incision <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Although Abbadie et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> reported decreased macrophage infiltration and amelioration of neuropathic pain in mice lacking C-C chemokine receptor 2, indicating pain-promoting actions of macrophages, a recent study found increased numbers of neutrophils as a compensatory change in these mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, which makes the data interpretation difficult since neutrophils can decrease hypersensitivity via opioid peptides <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, the paper by Ghasemlou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> suggested that not proinflammatory monocytes, but subset(s) of CD11 + myeloid cells (e.g., dendritic, Langerhans, natural killer, and/or mast cells) may mediate postoperative and inflammatory hypersensitivity.</s><s>Together, the role of macrophages, including pro-inflammatory M1 cells as drivers of pain might be smaller than generally assumed, and the investigation of a relative contribution of macrophages vs. other cells such as fibroblasts, endothelial, and Schwann cells is warranted <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, our findings highlight the favorable actions of M2 macrophages in neuropathic pain.</s><s>In previous studies, macrophage depletion enhanced pain due to impaired actions of opioid peptides or IL-10 in the CFA and carrageenan inflammatory pain models, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>.</s><s>The analgesic effects of anti-inflammatory cytokines derived from M2 cells in response to a PPAR-γ agonist or IL-4 application have been suggested by showing a correlation between the attenuation of pain and enhanced mRNA levels of IL-10 in postoperative and neuropathic pain models; the direct contribution of IL-10, however, has not been examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, promoting the anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype in response to PPAR-γ activation resulted in naloxone-reversible attenuation of carrageenan or CFA-induced inflammatory pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, accumulating evidence demonstrates the beneficial actions of macrophages in pain control, and our findings define the M2 phenotype as the most relevant macrophage source of opioid peptides to attenuate neuropathy-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, in our experiments, M2 macrophages did not ameliorate heat hypersensitivity resulting from neuropathy.</s><s>Few studies reported attenuation of both mechanical and heat hypersensitivity by activation of macrophage PPAR-γ or toll-like receptor 4 in incisional and CFA-induced inflammatory pain models <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Several other reports, however, found that a phenotypic shift to M2 in response to a PPAR-γ agonist or morphine did not improve heat, but attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity following hind paw incision or inflammation induced by carrageenan or CFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>.</s><s>While the reasons for the differences among these studies and the mechanisms underlying the role of immune cells in the modulation of different pain modalities remain to be elucidated <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>, our findings add to those which suggest that promoting an M2 phenotype might be particularly beneficial in improving mechanical hypersensitivity.</s></p><p><s>Although we focused on analgesic actions of in vitro polarized, and in vivo transferred M2 macrophages, the role of endogenous M2 macrophages should also be addressed.</s><s>Our data indicate that endogenous M2 macrophages do not substantially contribute to the constitutive control of neuropathic pain.</s><s>Hence, although endogenous M2 cells were present in injured nerves (DMEM groups in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9a,  b</ref>), mice experienced substantial mechanical and heat hypersensitivity following CCI in vivo.</s><s>Our earlier studies suggest that endogenous immune cells which accumulate at the injured nerve do contain opioid peptides, but need to be stimulated to release them and ameliorate neuropathic pain in animals, for example, by corticotropinreleasing factor or opioid receptor agonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>These endogenous cells included macrophages, but with previous approaches, it was not possible to distinguish their phenotypes.</s><s>Thus, it is conceivable that endogenous macrophages need to be activated/polarized toward M2 phenotype in vivo to exert opioid-mediated analgesia, which would constitute a separate project.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>As we have employed the macrophage transfer as a tool to delineate their pain-modulating properties, other researches have utilized this strategy as a therapy for nervous system disorders such as spinal cord injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73]</ref>.</s><s>Since the injection of macrophages might result in their own <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, or endogenous cell phenotypic changes (this study), future work will be needed to verify the utility of the adoptive cell transfer in improving the disease outcome.</s><s>Our data suggest that macrophages might be less relevant to the generation of pain since polarizing these cells to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype did not exacerbate mechanical or heat sensitivity.</s><s>In fact, our findings emphasize the need to focus on the production of M2-inducing therapeutics.</s><s>For the first time, we have provided robust analysis of opioid peptide content and release from M0, M1, and M2 macrophages.</s><s>We have shown that M2 cells can be manipulated in vitro to produce an opioid-mediated analgesic effect in neuropathy in vivo.</s><s>The next step will be to define the most effective strategy to promote the opioid-mediated M2 responses for the better control of pathological pain.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3</head><label>123</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Analysis of surface markers on cultured macrophages following polarization.</s><s>a Representative dot blots showing cell populations expressing F4/80 and CD163.</s><s>The blots represent the CD163 FMO-negative control (far left), M0-polarized cells (second left), M1 cells (third left), and M2 cells (far right).</s><s>The percentage of macrophages negative for CD163 (F4/80 + CD163 − ) are shown in top left quadrants, while macrophages expressing CD163 (F4/80 + CD163 + ) are shown in top right quadrants.</s><s>b Representative dot blots showing cell populations expressing F4/80 and MHC II.</s><s>The blots show the MHC II FMO-negative control (far left), the M0 cells (second left), the M1 cells (third left), and the M2 cells (far right).</s><s>The percentage of macrophages negative for MHC II (F4/80 + MHC II − ) are shown in top left quadrants, while macrophages expressing MHC II (F4/80 + MHC II + ) are shown in top right quadrants.</s><s>c Percentage of polarized M0, M1, and M2 macrophages expressing CD163.</s><s>d Percentage of polarized M0, M1, and M2 macrophages expressing MHC II.</s><s>The data were analyzed using flow cytometry and FlowJo software.</s><s>In c and d, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001 (one-way RM ANOVA, Bonferroni's test).</s><s>Data show the mean ± SEM (n = 8 samples per group)</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
