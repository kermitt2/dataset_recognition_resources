<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p><s>Study design: Cross-sectional study Study setting: Outpatient department (OPD)/inpatient department (IPD)/intensive care unit (ICU)/nursing stations/operating theatres (OTs) at a tertiary care hospital in Central India where stethoscopes were being used Study participants: Faculty members, resident doctors, medical students and paramedical personnel who were working in clinical care settings at a tertiary care setting.</s><s>The medical personnel who use stethoscopes regularly in their clinical practice and those who consented were recruited in the study.</s><s>Since the study was conducted in a new institutional set-up where the staff strength was lower, universal sampling was carried out and all the doctors/staff nurses engaged in clinical care were approached.</s></p><p><s>Sample size: All the doctors (faculty members and residents), nurses and medical students engaged in active patient care who use their individual stethoscopes in the various areas of the hospital were eligible to participate in the study.</s><s>The eligible candidates were approached by two final-year medical students and were explained about the study in detail.</s><s>None of the approached staff denied consent and 100% response rate was achieved.</s><s>The students distributed the questionnaire and collected it from the participants.</s><s>These students also collected the swabs from the stethoscopes.</s><s>A total of 62 participants were included.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exclusion criteria</head><p><s>The stethoscopes shared by multiple personnel in the common area were excluded.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics issues</head><p><s>Written informed consent was obtained from the participants at time of the survey and all the information was kept confidential.</s><s>The Institute Human Ethical Committee reviewed and approved our study protocol.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>In order to assess the knowledge and cleaning practices regarding the disinfection of stethoscopes, the healthcare personnel were administered a questionnaire at the same visit while collecting samples from their stethoscopes.</s><s>The stethoscope diaphragm (D) and bell (B) were divided into two equal parts and the initial samples (labelled S 0 D and S 0 B, respectively) were collected using sterile swabs moistened with sterile saline from one half of the stethoscope to document the baseline microbial load on the diaphragm.</s></p><p><s>The stethoscope was then cleaned by alcohol-based disinfectant (Sterillium), commonly used as hand disinfectant in the hospitals.</s><s>After cleaning and allowing the stethoscope to dry for 30 s, two samples were further collected using sterile swabs (labelled S 1 D and S 1 B) from the other half of the stethoscope's diaphragm and bell.</s><s>This division of the stethoscope into two parts was done to obviate the effect of physical removal of microbes by the first swab, thereby affecting the assessment of reduction in microbial load after cleaning, if any.</s><s>In order to eliminate confusion and maintain uniformity, one of the researchers collected the samples from the stethoscopes whereas another researcher cleaned the stethoscope and administered the questionnaire.</s><s>Both the swabs were labelled with the date and time of collection along with the clinical area of work of the participant.</s><s>The participants were assigned a unique identification number.</s><s>The collected samples were immediately transported to the microbiology laboratory and were cultured on Nutrient agar medium and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Out of 62 participants, 87% believed that the stethoscope is a potential source of carrying infections from one individual to other.</s><s>Thirty-three individuals (53.22%) had never cleaned their stethoscopes, 15 (24.2%) cleaned their stethoscopes &gt; 8 weeks previously, two (3.2%) cleaned their stethoscopes 5-8 weeks previously, six (9.6%) cleaned their stethoscopes 1-4 weeks previously and only six (9.6%) individuals had cleaned their stethoscopes &lt; 1 week ago.</s><s>None of the participants cleaned their stethoscopes after seeing each patient.</s><s>Among the individuals who cleaned their stethoscopes, only one participant cleaned his/her stethoscope daily.</s><s>Among the individuals who cleaned their stethoscopes, the majority (86.2%, 25/29 participants) used alcohol-based disinfectant (Sterillium), followed by a plain cloth (10.3%, 3/29 participants) and soap and water (3.5%, 1/29 participants).</s></p><p><s>All the initial swab samples taken from the 62 stethoscopes showed bacterial growth.</s><s>The samples taken from 35 stethoscope bells and 31 stethoscope diaphragms showed mixed growth.</s><s>On the stethoscope bells, 96 organisms were isolated which comprised of eight different genera.</s><s>Out of the 96 organisms isolated from stethoscope bells, 80 were Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and 16 were Gram-negative bacilli (GNB).</s><s>Among the 96 isolates, 25 were potentially pathogenic and the rest were skin commensals.</s><s>On the stethoscope diaphragm, a total of 92 organisms were isolated comprising eight different genera.</s><s>Out of the 96 organisms isolated from stethoscope diaphragm, 79 were GPC and 13 were GNB.</s><s>Among the 92 isolates, 22 were potentially pathogenic and the rest of the isolates were skin commensals.</s><s>Potentially pathogenic isolates were S. aureus, Acinetobacter spp.</s><s>and K. pneumoniae.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the frequency of stethoscope bells and diaphragms of the healthcare personnel with bacterial isolates.</s></p><p><s>After cleaning with an alcohol-based disinfectant, K. pneumoniae was isolated from one of the stethoscope bells used in an ICU, while on the diaphragm of the stethoscope used in an ICU, two strains of K. pneumoniae and one Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) were isolated and two strains of CoNS were isolated from the stethoscopes of medical students.</s></p><p><s>Out of 62 stethoscopes, 25 had potentially pathogenic bacterial growth before cleaning stethoscopes with alcoholbased disinfectant.</s><s>However, after cleaning the stethoscopes, only two had pathogenic growth of isolates.</s><s>This finding is statistically significant with P &lt; 0.01.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows the relationship between the stethoscope cleaning practices and the presence/absence of potentially pathogenic isolates.</s><s>An odds ratio (OR) of 4.7 (1.58-15.01)</s><s>indicates that there is significant correlation between the presence/absence of potentially pathogenic isolates and cleaning practices.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> depicts the relationship of stethoscope cleaning frequency with the presence of potentially pathogenic isolates.</s><s>It was seen that the stethoscopes that were never cleaned had the maximum numbers of polymicrobial growth.</s></p><p><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> shows the bacterial load on the stethoscopes before and after cleaning with alcohol-based disinfectant.</s><s>There was a marked reduction in the number of colonyforming units of all isolates after cleaning with alcoholbased disinfectant.</s></p></div>
