<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>A number of studies have demonstrated the cytoprotective effects of H 2 S in myocardial, liver, brain, pulmonary, and renal IRI (reviewed by Nicholson and Calvert) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Most of these studies utilized Na 2 S/NaHS as exogenous H 2 S donors and PAG as a non-specific CTH inhibitor.</s><s>To

<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>In our study, we investigated the pathophysiological roles of CTH in renal IRI using one of those Cth −/− mice and their littermate Cth +/− and Cth +/+ mice as controls; all were the offspring from the mating between Cth +/− males and Cth +/− females that had been backcrossed over 10 generations onto a C57BL/6 background <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>We found that the lack of CTH does not cause aggravated immediate renal functional impairments after IRI as assessed by serum creatinine levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) and renal expression of sensitive AKI markers, Lcn2 and Havcr1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B,C</ref>).</s><s>Our histological examinations rather identified a moderate amelioration in renal tubular damage in Cth −/− mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D,E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>While our study was underway, Bos et al. published findings with their Cth −/− mice (on a mixed strain background; the sex of mice used is not indicated) investigating the role of CTH-derived H 2 S in renal IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>They found that CTH deficiency aggravated kidney damage after IRI, which was associated with increased mortality 17 however, we did not observe such severe systemic damage after renal IRI.</s><s>The reasons for this discrepancy are possibly multifaceted.</s><s>First, their Cth −/− mice display age-dependent hypertension (15-20 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure vs Cth +/+ mice only after 7 weeks of age) and sex-related hyperhomocysteinemia in which females have six times the plasma homocysteine levels (120 vs 20 μ M) in males <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> , both of which are caused by unknown mechanisms.</s><s>Hypertension per se has deleterious effects on renal IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> nevertheless, hypertension was not properly treated in their studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>This affair makes it difficult to assess the impact of reduced renal H 2 S production over elevated blood pressure on the outcome of IRI; fortunately, our Cth −/− mice display systolic normotension <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>This fact may, at least in part, underlie differences between their and our findings.</s><s>It should be noted that our Cth −/− males and females display similar serum levels of homocysteine (104-151 μ M) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> the reasons for this difference are yet unknown but may depend on differences in genetic backgrounds and/or nutritional conditions.</s><s>Second, Bos et al. performed renal ischemia by clamping both (right and left) renal arteries for 30 min, whereas we performed uninephrectomy by clamping the renal artery of the remnant left kidney for 20 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Despite the differences in surgical protocols, serum creatinine levels at 24 h after IRI were equivalent.</s><s>But, importantly, all mice that underwent surgery survived in our study while Bos et al. observed 35% mortality only in Cth −/− mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Third, we used a temperature controller with heating pads to maintain a stable core temperature (which was measured continuously during surgery by a rectal probe) whereas Bos et al. used only heating pads and lamps <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>It is well known that fluctuations in core body temperature contribute to variability in IRI and the way of maintaining body temperature during ischemia has a major impact on the outcome of IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Fourth, their Cth −/− mice showed a massive (91%) reduction in renal H 2 S production compared to Cth +/+ mice 17 while our Cth −/− mice showed only 50% reduction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>Although the methods used for H 2 S measurement substantially differ between the two studies and this precludes the direct comparison, &gt; 90% reduction is surprising per se, considering the facts that (i) Cth −/− kidney still expresses CBS and MPST, (ii) (increased/activated) CBS could compensate for H 2 S production when CTH is inhibited or abrogated (though we did not observe compensatory Cbs mRNA induction; (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) and (iii) renal

reduction in CBS (rather than CTH) activity may serve as the major contributor for endogenous H 2 S level reduction during renal IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Despite such differences, we also found some agreement with previous studies by Bos et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>First, renal expression (either gene or protein) of both CTH and CBS were suppressed after renal IRI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>).</s><s>It might be noteworthy that the partial or complete loss of CTH did not cause compensatory induction (or reduced repression of expression) of CBS (or MPST) during IRI (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B,C</ref>) at least on mRNA level.</s><s>Second, both Bos et al. and we did not find significant differences between Cth genotypes in the numbers of granulocyte infiltrated into injured kidneys of IRI mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A-C</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>We also counted the numbers of F4/80-positive macrophages infiltrated into injured kidneys of IRI mice and found that macrophages behave similar to granulocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, renal expression of Tnf, Il1b, Icam1, and Vcam1 after IRI were lower (though overall ANOVA was just P = 0.099 and 0.088 for Tnf and Icam1, respectively) in Cth −/− mice compared to Cth +/− mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-D</ref>).</s><s>TNF-alpha was initially discovered as a LPS-induced macrophage product <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>It is also released during IRI and acts as a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , and in line, the blockade of TNF-alpha signaling is a novel promising therapeutic target in renal IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Although intrinsic renal cells also secret TNF-alpha upon injury, monocytes/classically activated macrophages are considered as the main source of TNF-alpha in early renal IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>We found that CTH deficiency alters Tnf expression in LPS/IFN-gamma-stimulated BM-derived macrophages that intrinsically differ from LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>However, the supernatant TNF-alpha concentrations did not differ between both groups, which questions the physiological relevance of this finding.</s><s>Meanwhile, renal expression of other cytokines that are known to play a role in renal IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> (Il6, Cxcl2, and Ccl2) were not distinguishable between Cth genotypes (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Our findings are in contrast to previous results by others who use PAG for CTH inhibition.</s><s>Tripatara et al. found that single intraperitoneal administration of PAG (50 mg/kg, 1 h before ischemia) prevented the renal recovery from IRI (45-min ischemia/72-h reperfusion) in a rat bilateral ischemia model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>More recently Han et al. showed similar deteriorative effects of PAG in renal IRI (50 mg/kg daily (i.p.), beginning 2 days after ischemia) in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>However, PAG (5 mg/kg (i.p.), twice a day for 4 successive days) exhibited nephroprotective effects in the cisplatin model of AKI in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Similar protective effects of PAG (50 mg/kg (i.p.) at 2 h after adriamycin injection) have been observed in adriamycin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Whereas these kidney injury models differ, they point out that PAG treatment can have multiple effects depending on the renal injury models.</s><s>Moreover, the specificity of this widely used CTH inhibitor and relatively late time points after reperfusion are a matter of concern.</s><s>Our model is of particular interest because we used a genetic approach to abrogate CTH specifically and investigated acute renal post-ischemic injury after 24 h, a time point where serum creatinine levels are the highest and renal Cth/Cbs expression levels are the lowest <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Numerous studies have revealed cytoprotective/anti-oxidative/anti-inflammatory roles of H 2 S, but some studies also have identified pro-inflammatory roles of H 2 S that accelerate inflammatory responses; for example, Ang et al. previously reported that caerulein-induced acute pancreatic damage as well as its associated lung injury was ameliorated in Cth −/− mice compared to Cth +/+ 40 .</s><s>It is possible that CTH-produced H 2 S may act as a pro-inflammatory factor in renal IRI.</s><s>In addition, further studies should also clarify the impact of high levels of cystathionine and homocysteine and low levels of taurine that are common in Cth −/− mice 11 on the outcome of renal IRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> .</s><s>In conclusion, the systemic loss of CTH in mice caused approximately 50% reduction in renal H 2 S levels but did not influence immediate outcomes of ischemic AKI; however, it reduced tubular damage moderately and suppressed the renal expression of inflammatory cytokines.</s><s>Future studies should clarify the role of CTH on the long-term outcome of renal impairment in AKI.</s></p></div>
