<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The oesophageal leak pressure is defined as the pressure which breaks the seal between the cuff of a supraglottic airway and the peri-cuff mucosa, allowing penetration of fluid into the pharynx and the oral cavity.</s><s>As a consequence, a decrease in this variable increases the risk of reflux and can lead to pulmonary aspiration.</s><s>The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of cuff overinflation and pressure on the neck on the oesophageal leak pressure of seven supraglottic airways.</s><s>Methods: Three laryngeal masks, two laryngeal tubes, and two oesophageal-tracheal tubes were tested in an experimental setting.</s><s>In five human cadavers, we simulated a sudden increase in oesophageal pressure.</s><s>To measure baseline values (control), we used an intracuff pressure as recommended by the manufacturer.</s><s>The first intervention included overinflation of the cuff by applying twice the amount of pressure recommended.</s><s>A second intervention was defined as external pressure on the neck.</s><s>Results: The oesophageal leak pressure was decreased for laryngeal masks (control, 28 cm H 2 O; overinflation, 9 cm H 2 O; pressure on the neck, 8 cm H 2 O; P&lt;0.01) and for laryngeal tubes (control, 68 cm H 2 O; overinflation, 37 cm H 2 O; pressure on the neck, 39 cm H 2 O; P&lt;0.01) and was unaffected for oesophageal-tracheal tubes (control, 126 cm H 2 O; overinflation/pressure on the neck, 130 cm H 2 O; n.s.).</s><s>Conclusions: Cuff overinflation and pressure on the neck can enhance the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux when using supraglottic airways.</s><s>Therefore, both manoeuvres should be avoided in clinical practice.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cadaver model</head><p><s>The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Charité University Hospital -Universitätsmedizin Berlin (trial registry number: EA1/195/06).</s><s>Given that it is impossible to determine the protection from aspiration afforded by airway devices in clinical conditions in patients, we used an experimental setting based on investigations in human cadavers.</s><s>Five unfixed human bodies (three female, two male) were dissected within 24 h after their natural death.</s><s>The mean age at death was 82 yr (range, 77-88 yr).</s></p><p><s>The bodies were prepared to provide exposure of the trachea and the oesophagus in the neck.</s><s>The distal end of the trachea was connected to a test lung for respirators and secured by a suture.</s><s>The distal end of the exposed oesophagus was connected to a vertical flexible tube with a diameter of 2 cm and a height of 130 cm, using a tight suture.</s><s>By filling this flexible tube with water, orally directed oesophageal pressure was simulated and precisely measured using a centimetre division scale applied on the outside of the tube.</s></p><p><s>The oesophageal leak pressure, or as synonymously mentioned, regurgitation pressure, was first described by Brimacombe and Keller. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> Oesophageal leak pressure was defined as the pressure which breaks the seal between cuff and peri-cuff mucosa, allowing penetration of water into the oral cavity and the pharynx.</s></p><p><s>After placement of the supraglottic airway, the tube was completely filled with water to a level of 130 cm (resulting pressure, 130 cm H 2 O) while the oesophageal tube was clamped.</s><s>After removal of the clamp, the height of the water column remaining after 60 s was measured.</s><s>The water that penetrated the barrier between the oesophagus and hypopharynx was collected, but we did not differentiate reflux and pulmonary aspiration in this experimental approach.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a schematic illustration of the experimental procedure.</s></p><p><s>All devices were applied in a randomized sequence using a computerized random-number generator.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Airway devices</head><p><s>Devices with an oesophageal drainage tube were tested with a closed drainage lumen.</s><s>The study was carried out using laryngeal mask airways (Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway™, Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSeal™, and Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway Fas-trach™), laryngeal tubes (Laryngeal Tube™ and Laryngeal Tube LTS II™), and oesophageal-tracheal dual-lumen tubes (Easy-tube™ and Combitube™).</s><s>The sizes of the supraglottic airways were selected for the bodies to establish a representative seal (Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway, Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSeal, Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway Fastrach, Laryngeal Tube, and Laryngeal Tube LTS II, size 4 or 5; Combitube and Easytube 37 or 41 Charrière).</s></p><p><s>The Combitube and Easytube were inserted into the oesophagus using distal tube placement.</s><s>All devices were inserted by the same experienced anaesthetist (&gt;1000 extraglottic airway device applications).</s><s>The correct placement of all supraglottic airway devices was evaluated by performing the following tests.</s><s>Initially, sufficient ventilation of the test lung was checked by delivering 10 consecutive breaths (maximal inspiratory pressure, 15 cm H 2 O).</s><s>A correct position was assumed when there was no audible air leakage during this manoeuvre and the pressure could be maintained.</s><s>Thereafter, a constant airway pressure was built up by pressing the ventilation bag with 15 cm H 2 O for 60 s without any pressure loss and no detectable bubbles in the water column, indicating an oesophageal leak.</s></p><p><s>In devices with an incorporated oesophageal drainage tube, the correct position of the oesophageal point was verified by inserting a gastric tube through the oesophageal lumen and moving it forward until it became visible at the oesophageal end.</s><s>As the last step, the correct position was checked by means of fibreoptic pharyngoscopy.</s><s>If necessary, the position of the extraglottic airway was corrected or the size changed until all baseline tests performed were passed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interventions</head><p><s>Subsequently, two interventions were analysed to evaluate their effect on the oesophageal leak pressure.</s><s>For each supraglottic airway, three test scenarios were investigated, two respective interventions (overinflation and pressure on the neck) and one control, using the five anatomical models.</s><s>Each measurement was repeated 10 times.</s><s>This implies that 150 individual measurements were performed using each device.</s></p><p><s>The primary outcome measure was the difference in oesophageal leak pressure of the individual supraglottic airway between the baseline value (control) and the value after overinflation and after pressure on the neck.</s><s>6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Accordingly, a power analysis was performed to determine the number of experiments required (estimated average value for the difference in oesophageal leak pressure, 20 ( 11) cm H 2 O).</s><s>A difference of 10 cm H 2 O was considered to be clinically relevant.</s></p><p><s>During the control measurements, we applied the intracuff pressure as recommended by the manufacturer (60 cm H 2 O for laryngeal masks, laryngeal tubes, and oesophageal-tracheal duallumen tubes).</s><s>In the first intervention, the intracuff pressure of the device was adjusted to double the recommended intracuff pressure (120 cm H 2 O).</s><s>In devices with two cuffs, both were inflated up to the same pressure.</s><s>The intracuff pressure was controlled using a manometer.</s><s>The second intervention was defined as external manual counterpressure by pushing the extraglottic airway 2 cm further into the hypopharynx for the entire duration of the tests.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p><s>The distribution of oesophageal leak pressure measurements was shown with boxplots, separated by intervention for each airway device.</s></p><p><s>To compare the oesophageal leak pressure between devices and interventions, a linear mixed model was used to take into Protection from aspiration by airway devices | 291 account the cluster structure resulting from the design of the study.</s><s>To take into account the fact that with every human cadaver each device was tested with every intervention, these repeated measurements per cadaver were included as a random effect to model the potential variability of human cadavers.</s><s>Additionally, the interaction between device and intervention was included as a fixed effect.</s><s>Using the likelihood-ratio test, the significance of this interaction was tested.</s><s>If this test was nonsignificant (P&gt;0.05), the interaction was excluded, and only the main effects were modelled.</s></p><p><s>With the resulting model tests on individual cadavers contrasts were performed; Scheffe-adjusted P-values (and 95% confidence intervals for differences) were reported to account for multiple comparisons (Supplemental material, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Results were described and shown graphically using the model-based marginal means and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the fixed effects.</s><s>These analyses were conducted with StataCorp 2015 (Stata Statistical Software, release 14; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).</s><s>A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be significant.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>It can be concluded from our results that cuff overinflation and external pressure on the neck can impair the sealing capabilities of supraglottic airways during sudden increases in oesophageal pressure.</s><s>Although we did not study pulmonary aspiration, our findings permit the conclusion that both manoeuvres can substantially increase the risk of reflux, particularly with laryngeal masks and laryngeal tubes.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> Occurrence of reflux, in turn, represents a risk factor for pulmonary aspiration.</s><s>However, it is impossible for ethical reasons to provoke a sudden increase in oesophageal pressure in clinical conditions in patients in order to test the sealing capabilities of supraglottic airways.</s><s>Therefore, we consider the results of our experimental study as clinically very meaningful.</s><s>The significant differences that were seen between control conditions and pressure on the neck and between control conditions and cuff overinflation of up to 50 cm H 2 O, which implies a reduction by 70% of the baseline value, underline this statement.</s></p><p><s>Reviewing the literature regarding tightness characteristics of supraglottic airways, a distinction must be made between the oesophageal leak pressure on the one hand and the oropharyngeal leak pressure on the other.</s><s>While the oesophageal leak pressure describes the pressure which breaks the seal between the cuff and peri-cuff mucosa, allowing retrograde passage of gastric content into the pharynx, the oropharyngeal leak pressure is a measure of sealing the upper airway by a cuffed supraglottic airway device. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>Accordingly, both leak pressures differ, because their force vector is different, reflecting a pressure from above or below the cuff of the supraglottic airway.</s><s>A lower oropharyngeal leak pressure can be associated with an incomplete mask seal, which in turn can cause air leakage and insufflation of air into the stomach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>If gastric air insufflation occurs, the risk of gastro-oesophageal reflux is increased.</s><s>Thus, there is a close interaction between oesophageal leak pressure and oropharyngeal leak pressure, but the two measures are not identical.</s><s>2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> Those studies were mostly performed in clinical conditions in patients.</s><s>In contrast, studies dealing with oesophageal leak pressure are based on experimental investigations. <ref type="bibr">5-7 13 14 24</ref></s><s>Apart from our investigation, there is only one other experimental study with an intubating laryngeal mask reflecting the relationship between oesophageal leak pressure and intracuff pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>The results of that study are in line with our findings.</s><s>However, our study is the only one to test other supraglottic airways in this field and the first one to have investigated the influence of pressure on the neck.</s></p><p><s>In order to interpret the results of our study, it might be helpful to take the design and function of each airway device into account.</s><s>With regard to oesophageal-tracheal dual-lumen tubes, the positioning of a blocked cuff directly inside the oesophagus seems to provide a certain amount of protection against reflux and aspiration even in the event of cuff overinflation or pressure on the neck.</s><s>For laryngeal masks, it is conceivable that the overinflation results in a changed anatomical position of the cuff.</s><s>An orally directed movement of the laryngeal mask and an impaired function of the upper oesophageal sphincter could be the result.</s><s>For laryngeal tubes, a redistribution of air volume between the proximal and the distal cuff is possible as a result of the intervention.</s><s>The upwardly directed movement of the proximal cuff can prevent a better seal of the oesophageal cuff.</s><s>Another explanation has been provided by Licina and colleagues 9 using paediatric laryngeal mask airways.</s><s>They assumed that an increased cuff volume is associated with a growing rigidity of the cuff, a decreased compliance, and subsequently, with a reduced barrier between mucosa and cuff.</s></p><p><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Although unfixed human bodies which sufficiently represent patient anatomy were used, they cannot carry out possible swallowing and retching movements or respond to influences associated with respiration.</s><s>Also, pharyngeal soft tissue of anatomical models might differ from that of patients.</s><s>Besides, it should be considered that protection from aspiration using secondgeneration devices, such as Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSeal, is a dynamic process.</s><s>In clinical practice, this would depend on a variety of factors, including the alignment of the leading edge of the device onto the upper oesophageal sphincter and the ability to have a properly functioning gastric tube inserted into the stomach.</s><s>With pressure on the neck or overinflation of the cuff, although the peri-laryngeal seal of supraglottic airways may be altered, aero-digestive separation may still be possible because the gastric tube may allow for suctioning of liquid from the stomach.</s></p><p><s>As cuff overinflation and pressure on the neck are typically performed by clinicians in the prehospital setting and are unlikely to be performed by anaesthetists, it should be considered that these manipulations are ineffective and can enhance the risk of aspiration, particularly in the field of preclinical emergency medicine. <ref type="bibr">12 26-28</ref></s><s>That is why these manoeuvres should generally not be used, principally in view of possible oesophageal injury.</s></p></div>
