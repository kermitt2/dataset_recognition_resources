<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Reproduction in placental mammals relies on potent control of the mother's immune system to not attack the developing fetus.</s><s>As a bystander effect, pregnancy also potently suppresses the activity of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS).</s><s>Here, we report that T cells are able to directly sense progesterone via their glucocorticoid receptor (GR), resulting in an enrichment of regulatory T cells (Tregs).</s><s>By using an MS animal model, we found that the presence of the GR in T cells is essential to increase Tregs and confer the protective effect of pregnancy, but not for maintaining the pregnancy itself.</s><s>Better understanding of this tolerogenic pathway might yield more specific therapeutic means to steer the immunological balance in transplantation, cancer, and autoimmunity.</s></p><p><s>mechanism shaping the T-cell compartment.</s><s>By targeted GR deletion in T cells, we show a selective disruption of pregnancyinduced protection from autoimmunity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Treg Dynamics During Pregnancy.</s><s>We first characterized the relative abundance and phenotype of Tcons and Tregs throughout pregnancy and postpartum time points (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>Because the presence of fetuses that genetically differ from the mother is a prerequisite of robust induction of immune tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, we performed allogeneic matings of C57BL/6 females with BALB/c males.</s><s>We analyzed cells from paraaortic lymph nodes (LNs), inguinal lymph nodes, and spleen to get insight into local, regional, and systemic changes, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</s><s>The acquired data indicated that Treg expansion was most pronounced in the paraaortic lymph nodes that drain the fetomaternal interface.</s><s>Frequencies of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs started to increase from middle to late pregnancy (embryonic days, E10.5-E18.5)</s><s>and stayed at elevated levels as long as postpartum day 30 (PP30) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> C and D).</s><s>We observed two proliferative bursts of Tregs in early (E2.5) and late (E18.5)</s><s>pregnancy by Ki67 staining, coinciding with the first contact to paternal sperm antigen and the systemic challenge with fetal antigen following placental perfusion, respectively.</s><s>In line with this observation, the first expansion was limited to the local paraaortic lymph nodes, whereas the second was also detectable in regional inguinal lymph nodes and systemically in the spleen (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, late pregnancy Tregs consistently showed increased expression of the immunosuppressive molecule CTLA-4 in all assessed organs, rendering them potentially more effective in controlling effector responses (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>).</s><s>CD4 + Foxp3 − conventional T cells (Tcons) showed only one proliferative burst in early pregnancy (E2.5) that was accompanied by increased CTLA-4 expression, whereas their proliferative activity appeared to be tightly controlled at later time points (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Together, the Treg response commenced in early gestation with a local proliferative burst and generalized toward systemic compartments in late gestation.</s><s>Late gestational Tregs showed increased expression of CTLA-4, potentially supporting their suppressive function.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T-Cell Intrinsic Sensing of Progesterone Mediates Treg Enrichment in</head><p><s>Vitro.</s><s>Progesterone is an essential steroid hormone for successful pregnancy outcome that peaks at late gestation <ref type="bibr">(18-21, 38, 39)</ref>,  shortly before we observed a substantial Treg expansion (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, progesterone has been shown to have beneficial effects in EAE <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref> and to expand Treg frequencies upon in vivo treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we tested the ability of progesterone to influence the ratio of Tregs and Tcons in splenocyte cultures.</s><s>Indeed, treatment with progesterone at doses close to late gestational serum levels (∼90 ng•mL -1 ) readily increased the frequency of Foxp3 + Tregs among live CD4 + T cells from ∼5% in vehicle-treated cultures to ∼15% after 48 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> A and B).</s><s>We could inhibit this effect by the steroid hormone receptor antagonist mifepristone (RU486), suggesting a defined receptor-mediated rather than a pleiotropic effect.</s><s>Importantly, RU486 alone as well as the pregnancy hormone estradiol had no effect on Treg frequencies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2A</ref>).</s><s>At the same time, we observed increased cell death in progesterone-treated cultures paralleling the enrichment of Tregs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> A-C and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2B</ref>).</s><s>Prolonged cultivation amplified the effect (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>), whereas 1 μg•ml -1 RU486 was under most conditions sufficient for a complete blockade (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>).</s><s>Because splenocyte cultures contain different immune cell types that could in principle be involved in sensing progesterone and mediating this finding, we sought to define the target cells of   progesterone.</s><s>To get a first impression, we repeated the assay with purified CD4 + T cells.</s><s>Because the progesterone-induced enrichment of Treg cells was preserved in these experiments (P = 0.0003, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E</ref>), we concluded a direct action of progesterone on CD4 + T cells.</s></p><p><s>Because cell death was increased in progesterone-treated cultures, we further analyzed Annexin V and activated caspase 3 (aCasp3) to test whether CD4 + T cells were specifically driven into apoptosis.</s><s>Indeed, both markers showed an increase in apoptosis after progesterone treatment, which was abolished in the presence of RU486 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2F</ref>).</s><s>More importantly, treatment with the caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK reduced Treg frequencies in progesterone-treated cultures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2G</ref>), indicating that apoptosis was directly driving Treg enrichment.</s></p><p><s>Thus, T-cell-intrinsic sensing of progesterone via a RU486blockable receptor resulted in a shift of the immunological balance in favor of Tregs.</s><s>This effect was driven by the induction of apoptosis and consecutive cell death in the CD4 + T-cell compartment.</s></p><p><s>Progesterone Acts via Promiscuous Binding to the Glucocorticoid Receptor.</s><s>Our data suggested the existence of a RU486-blockable receptor in T cells that is engaged by progesterone and induces an enrichment of Tregs in vitro.</s><s>To explore potential molecular targets of progesterone, we next performed gene expression analyses of different steroid receptors in isolated Tregs and Tcons throughout pregnancy, including the progesterone receptor (PR encoded by Nr3c3/Pgr), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR encoded by Nr3c1) and the estrogen receptor α (ER encoded by Nr3a1/Esr1).</s><s>Notably, Pgr mRNA was practically absent in all conditions, whereas Nr3c1 and Esr1 mRNA could be reliably detected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>).</s><s>Because steroid hormones are known to possess promiscuous binding activity to other steroid receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, we reasoned that progesterone might signal via the GR as an alternative receptor.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we challenged splenocytes with either norgestrel (NOR) or dexamethasone (DEX), possessing high affinity to the PR or GR, respectively.</s><s>Although applied at lower concentrations, DEX treatment showed a much stronger enrichment of Tregs than NOR treatment (P = 0.0009, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>), supporting our hypothesis.</s><s>To definitely pinpoint a contribution of GR engagement to the observed Treg enrichment, we made use of a T-cell-specific GR knockout mouse.</s><s>In these GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre mice the T-cell-restricted lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) promoter drives the expression of a Cre recombinase, which leads to the excision of the essential exon 3 from the GR locus, thereby disrupting GR function specifically in T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>.</s><s>After ruling out a priori differences in their immune cell composition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C</ref>), we cultured splenocytes from GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre knockout and GR fl/fl control animals in the presence of either progesterone or DEX.</s><s>Strikingly, Treg enrichment and cell death induction were completely abolished in the GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre knockout cultures, regardless of treatment with either progesterone or DEX (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3 D and E</ref>).</s><s>This complete rescue in the GR knockout cultures also applied to the induction of apoptosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref> A and B), whereas Treg enrichment by both progesterone and DEX was still readily observed in progesterone receptor knockout cultures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3C</ref>).</s><s>In line with our previous experiments, these data support a direct action of progesterone on the GR in T cells to mediate Treg enrichment in vitro.</s><s>To test the effect of GR engagement on T cells in vivo, we treated wild-type animals with a single i.p. injection of 100 μg DEX and analyzed lymph nodes and spleen 24 h later.</s><s>Markedly, Treg frequencies were strongly increased by DEX in all assessed organs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4A</ref>), whereas this effect was blocked in the GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We conclude that Treg enrichment upon steroid challenge was mediated via the GR in T cells, whereas we found no indication for an involvement of the PR.</s></p><p><s>Tregs Are More Resistant to GR Challenge than Tcons.</s><s>Because progesterone treatment was paralleled by increased cell death in CD4 + T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> A and B), the increased Treg-to-Tcon ratio observed in vitro could be explained by an increased steroid sen-sitivity of Tcons in comparison with Tregs.</s><s>For example, it is conceivable that Tcons are more sensitive to glucocorticoid-induced cell death, whereas Tregs are in comparison steroid resistant and hence accumulate.</s><s>This notion was supported by our observation that cell death dye-positive cells were exclusively present in the Tcon but not in the Treg compartment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4A</ref>).</s><s>To further substantiate this hypothesis, we isolated Tregs and Tcons and cultured them separately in the presence of increasing doses of DEX as a potent GR stimulus.</s><s>Whereas we observed more robust proliferative responses of Tcons at low concentrations of DEX (P = 0.0380), increasing GR stimulation resulted in a proliferative advantage for Tregs (P = 0.0017, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4B</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, induction of cell death was more pronounced in Tcons than in Tregs when cultured under nonproliferating conditions (P &lt; 0.0001, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4C</ref>).</s><s>These findings support the idea that differential steroid sensitivity in the CD4 + T-cell compartment accounts for an enrichment of the

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additionally, progesterone was shown to drive naïve human cord blood cells but not adult peripheral T cells into suppressive Tregs while impeding their differentiation into T H 17 cells (25).</head><p><s>Thus, we addressed the questions of whether progesterone is capable of shifting the balance in the T-cell compartment in favor of Tregs and whether we could set up a stable assay to decipher the underlying molecular mechanism.</s><s>Indeed, we observed a robust increase of Treg frequencies after treating splenocyte cultures for 48 h with 300 ng•mL -1 progesterone, which corresponds to approximately three times the serum level present at E16.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>.</s><s>We consider this level close to the physiological range, as we would anticipate similar local levels close to the fetomaternal interface.</s></p><p><s>To our surprise however, we found no evidence for PR expression in CD4 + T cells on the mRNA level, representing the primary progesterone target.</s><s>This finding is in agreement with data from the Immunological Genome Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref> providing Pgr expression levels that do not exceed the detection background.</s><s>By a series of experiments, we could finally attribute the effect to a cross engagement of the GR in T cells.</s><s>The strongest piece of evidence in this regard is the complete abrogation of Treg enrichment in cultures from T-cell-restricted GR knockout mice (GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre).</s><s>This evidence suggests that T cells sense progesterone via their intracellular GR, leading to an increase of Treg frequencies.</s><s>Being engaged in times of increased steroid serum levels, this finding represents a so-far unrecognized tolerogenic pathway that might shape the immunological balance during pregnancy.</s><s>Clearly, this mechanism is not restricted to progesterone, but rather includes the action of corticosterone and other steroid hormones with agonistic potential on the GR that equally increase during the course of gestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(55)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Mechanistically, we found that Tregs are more resistant to steroid challenges in comparison with Tcons, thus possessing a survival advantage in times of increased steroid levels.</s><s>Hence, the observed enrichment of Tregs is likely the result of a selection of resistant Tregs, whereas sensitive Tcons succumbed to glucocorticoid-induced cell death.</s><s>This interpretation is also in agreement with increasing rates of apoptosis and cell death in CD4 + cells paralleling the Treg enrichment in dose and time-course experiments.</s><s>Importantly, targeted inhibition of apoptosis reduced the Treg enrichment, further supporting this notion.</s><s>Whereas apoptosis induction in leukocytes by DEX is well established (56), there have only been incidental reports for progesterone <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(57)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we observed increased Gilz expression in Tcons isolated from pregnant animals, indicating that GR activity is induced during pregnancy in these cells, but to a lesser extent in the more resistant Tregs.</s></p><p><s>To investigate the relevance of this mechanism for the amelioration of autoimmunity during in vivo pregnancy, we established a mouse model in which pregnant animals are protected from EAE until delivery.</s><s>Strikingly, whereas the protection conferred by pregnancy is among the strongest beneficial regulators of autoimmunity, this effect was completely abrogated in GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre knockout animals, supporting a central role of GR signaling in ensuring proper maintenance of pregnancyrelated CNS-autoantigen tolerance.</s><s>Accordingly, the Treg expansion in paraaortic LNs present in pregnant controls was diminished in pregnant GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre knockout animals during EAE.</s><s>Our results extend previous evidence supporting the crucial role of intact GR signaling in T cells for the control of neuroinflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(58)</ref>.</s><s>It has been also reported that deletion of the GR in T cells abolishes the therapeutic effect of dexamethasone in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">60)</ref>, whereas overexpression of the GR in thymocytes ameliorates EAE in a rat model <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(61)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we show that pregnancy endogenously employs this pathway to exert its protective effects on maternal autoimmunity.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, we provide evidence that the GR in T cells is of particular importance for mediating amelioration of maternal autoimmune responses but not for ensuring fetomaternal tolerance as deletion of the GR in T cells completely abrogated the protective effect of pregnancy on EAE but had no impact on any assessed measures of reproduction.</s><s>Notably, also Treg expansion found to be disturbed in GR fl/fl ;Lck-Cre knockout animals in EAE pregnancy was unaltered in mid term pregnancy without EAE.</s><s>These findings likely reflect the high stability of reproduction and Treg expansion, which are ensured by redundant mechanisms in the absence of inflammatory challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>.</s><s>In line with this redundancy, it usually takes more than one hit to cause severe reproductive failure, as evidenced by a number of mutant mice with largely unaltered reproductive success (1).</s><s>This result is likely due to high evolutionary pressure on successful species propagation via reproduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, controlling chronic inflammation in autoimmune diseases seems to be a more fragile side effect that requires all reproductive tolerance mechanisms to fully operate.</s><s>Some limitations of this study have to be considered.</s><s>Whereas our data clearly demonstrate that GR signaling in T cells is indispensable for pregnancy protection from EAE, this does not rule out additional protective mechanisms of pregnancy exerted by other factors such as estrogens, which have shown promise in clinical trials in MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(63)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(64)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(65)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, because we show that successful reproduction does not critically rely on GR signaling in T cells, it needs to be further elucidated on what basis differential effects on reproductive and autoimmune tolerance are mediated.</s></p><p><s>Summarizing our findings, we provide evidence that differential steroid sensitivity of Tregs and Tcons represents a so-far unrecognized tolerance mechanism that might be engaged in times of high steroid levels, as present during gestation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>).</s><s>We show that this pathway works via promiscuous binding of progesterone to the GR in T cells and is able to enrich Tregs in vitro.</s><s>Furthermore, we found evidence that GR signaling is in fact operative in Tcons during pregnancy in vivo, whereas T-cell-specific GR deletion resulted in a loss of pregnancy-induced protection from EAE and reduced Treg frequencies in uterus-draining LNs.</s><s>However, further work is needed to disentangle the molecular basis of the differential sensitivity of Tregs and Tcons.</s><s>Better understanding the T-cell
