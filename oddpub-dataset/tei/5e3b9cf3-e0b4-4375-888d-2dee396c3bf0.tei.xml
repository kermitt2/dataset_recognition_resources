<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>A total of 767 consecutive Japanese patients with cerebral infarction or cerebral haemorrhage who were transferred from an acute hospital and admitted to a Kaifukuki Rehabilitation Ward (KRW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(15)</ref> in Tokyo Bay Rehabilitation Hospital within 60 days after onset from March 2007 to October 2009 were enrolled in the study.</s></p><p><s>Inclusion criteria for analysing discharge disposition were: (i) first stroke; and (ii) unilateral cerebral lesion.</s><s>Exclusion criteria were: (i) incomplete echocardiographic findings due to inability to follow instructions; (ii) measurement difficulties due to severely irregular heartbeat; and (iii) missing echocardiographic findings and/or admission FIM (16) score because of early discharge.</s><s>In addition to these criteria, the following exclusion criteria for selecting the patients for the analyses regarding functional outcomes were adopted: (iv) transferred to an acute hospital before the completion of rehabilitation due to medical conditions; and (v) insufficient data regarding impairments and functional outcomes.</s><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tokyo Bay Rehabilitation Hospital.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the longitudinal influence of LVEF on ADL level represented by FIM score in patients with subacute stroke.</s><s>The patients in the low LVEF group tended to be transferred to acute hospitals more frequently.</s><s>The low LVEF group had significantly lower cognitive and total FIM scores on admission than the preserved LVEF group.</s><s>However, the total score on discharge FIM, FIM gain, and FIM efficiency showed no significant difference between the 2 groups.</s><s>Kevorkian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(13)</ref> and Milionis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(14)</ref> reported the relationships between LVEF at the acute phase and subsequent outcomes in patients with stroke.</s><s>Kevorkian et al. investigated the LVEF in 262 patients admitted to a private tertiary acute general hospital.</s><s>The patients were classified into 2 groups: low LVEF (≤ 35%) group (36 patients, 13.7%) and high LVEF (&gt; 35%) group (226 patients, 86.3%).</s><s>Total FIM score, FIM gain, and FIM efficiency on admission and discharge after a mean of 13.7 days from admission were assessed.</s><s>No significant difference in admission FIM score between the groups was noted; however, patients with low LVEF had a lower discharge FIM score, lower FIM gain, and lower FIM efficiency than patients with high LVEF.</s><s>Discharge disposition was evaluated by comparing home with other situations; the high LVEF group was more likely to be discharged to home.</s><s>Similarly, Milionis et al. investigated the association of low LVEF with long-term outcome of patients with acute ischaemic stroke.</s><s>A total of 119 patients (4.9%) were categorized into the low LVEF (≤ 35%) group and the remaining 2,320 (95.1%) into the preserved LVEF (&gt; 35%) group based on echocardiographic assessment at the time of hospitalization or on a recent (within 12 months) evaluation.</s><s>Patients with low LVEF were more likely to be male, older, and having higher rates of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.</s><s>Mortality rate and modified Rankin scale at 7 days, 3 months, and 12 months were higher among patients with low LVEF.</s><s>Thus, patients with LVEF at the acute stage subsequently tended to have lower ADL.</s><s>Discharge disposition was evaluated by comparing home/short recovery with any institution/ hospital; the high LVEF group was more likely to be discharged to home/short recovery.</s><s>In the present study, all the patients were in the subacute phase, and the lower admission FIM score in the low LVEF group could be attributed to the decline in ADLs due to low cardiac function at the acute phase, which is consistent with the findings in previous reports.</s><s>Regarding the discharge disposition, the finding in the present study that the low LVEF group tended to be more likely to be discharged to acute hospitals compared with the preserved LVEF group, is also consistent with the findings in previous reports.</s></p><p><s>Our findings differed from those of previous studies in some aspects.</s><s>Firstly, the number of patients with severely low LVEF (≤ 35%) was relatively lower in this study (1.4%) than in previous ones (13.7% and 4.9%).</s><s>Selection bias is the most likely explanation.</s><s>Patients in a poor condition in the acute phase, such as severe heart failure, might not survive until the subacute phase, or indication of rehabilitation in KRW may not be appropriate for a patient in a severely deteriorated condition, as the physical condition has to be sufficient for the patient to tolerate intensive rehabilitation.</s><s>Secondly, total score on discharge FIM, FIM gain, and FIM efficiency showed no significant difference between the low LVEF group and the preserved LVEF group, although total FIM at admission was significantly lower in the low LVEF group.</s><s>This suggests that the ADL decline due to decreased LV function during the acute phase could improve up to almost the same level of ADL as that in patients without LV dysfunction.</s><s>This could be supported by the fact that mildly or moderately low LVEF does not necessarily restrict therapeutic exercise from the viewpoint of cardiac rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>, and the metabolic cost of a comfortable speed of level walking is not extremely high in hemiplegic patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the physiatrist, nurse, and therapist possibly considered the heart load sufficiently and thus provided rehabilitation carefully by taking into account the LVEF.</s></p><p><s>This study has several limitations.</s><s>Firstly, the study was conducted at a single institution; therefore, our patients might not accurately reflect the entire stroke population in subacute rehabilitation wards.</s><s>Secondly, we used data for healthy individuals aged 70-79 years as a reference for patients aged ≥ 80 years because data for healthy Japanese people in this age group are unavailable; hence, overestimation of echocardiographic abnormalities is possible.</s><s>Thirdly, the reference value used for determination of the abnormal values in LVEF was provided by using the data of healthy Japanese people <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>.</s><s>The traditional reference values by the American Society of Echocardiography in conjunction with the European Association of Echocardiography <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref> were established from the data of American and European populations; thus, the values cannot be applied to a Japanese population, who are physically and racially different.</s><s>This is one of the strengths of our report, as we used the data obtained from normal values of Japanese people.</s><s>On the other hand, this is also what makes it difficult to compare our data with the data obtained from previous studies.</s><s>Lastly, unlike previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">14)</ref>, we failed to analyse the effect of severely low LVEF on ADLs because there were only 6 cases with LVEF ≤ 35%.</s><s>Further studies with a large sample size are warranted to clarify the effect of severely low LVEF on ADLs in the subacute phase.</s><s>Despite these limitations, the finding that rehabilitation of stroke patients with low LVEF in the subacute phase could result in almost the same outcomes as those in patients with preserved LVEF is a valuable piece of information for the patients as well as practitioners.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the general medical conditions in patients should be considered carefully, because discontinuation of rehabilitation due to medical complications tended to be higher in the low LVEF group than in the preserved LVEF group.</s><s>However, the finding of low LVEF did not pose a barrier to successful rehabilitation after stroke.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>ventricular ejection fraction;
