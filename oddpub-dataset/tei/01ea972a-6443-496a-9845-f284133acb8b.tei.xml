<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The current study represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first report in humans linking higher brown fat-like composition of newborn supraclavicular fat depot (a primary location of brown fat) with a smaller increase in infant total body fat from birth till 6 months of age (a key indicator of increased childhood and adult obesity risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>).</s><s>This effect persisted after adjusting for other potential determinants of newborn and infant %BF and change in %BF.</s><s>The magnitude of the effect translates to an ~20% reduction of the average increase in %BF gain from 0 to 6 months of age per SD decrease in newborn BAT FF.</s><s>We suggest that the magnitude of this effect is substantial, particularly for a single factor, considering that in a recent publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> a combined set of several factors including race, gestational weight gain, pre-pregnancy BMI, feeding patterns, gestational age at birth, and sex accounted for 19% in the variance of adiposity (% body fat) at birth.</s></p><p><s>Lower BAT FF values are believed to reflect a more BATlike composition of fat depots and have been associated with lower obesity risk in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>.</s><s>The effect observed in the current study may therefore be mediated by the capacity of the more brown-like fat composition to facilitate energy expenditure via lipid metabolism and thermogenesis pathways during the first month of life, thereby reducing white fat deposition from 0 to 6 months of age.</s></p><p><s>In the current study BAT FF was not associated with newborn %BF.</s><s>This may be due to the relatively short duration of ex utero thermal exposure at the time of scan (average 26 days after birth) or the relatively limited interindividual variability in newborn fat stores.</s><s>Whereas BAT and WAT deposition occurs in utero, non-shivering thermogenesis (that is necessary for stimulating BAT) does not begin until the neonate is born and exposed to the relatively cold ex utero environment.</s><s>Therefore, the effective exposure time to ex utero conditions, and its consequences on BAT lipid content, are minimal in the newborn period.</s></p><p><s>The limitations of this study include the use of a dual-echo acquisition rather than a multiecho acquisition and the lack of a measure for BAT activity.</s><s>This acquisition method lacks the multiple echo points needed for full characterization of the complex lipid profile.</s><s>In theory, this limits the measurement by having an imperfect water-fat separation within the BAT depots.</s><s>However, the utility of the dual-echo approach has been demonstrated in previous in vivo human BAT MRI <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>, and it has been shown that the use of a dual-echo, vs. a multiecho, acquisition primarily adds a uniform bias relative to MR spectroscopic measurement of hepatic fat fraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, it should be noted that because of the spatial resolution limits of MRI and the interspersed distribution of brown fat cells found in humans, all of the depots measured in this work may contain a partial volume average of brown/beige and white fat cells.</s></p><p><s>The issue of the physiological relevance of BAT FF within these depots warrants further study.</s><s>First, while the supraclavicular region has demonstrated functional plasticity through positive UCP1 expression in both BAT-active and -inactive adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, our current method is unable to determine whether the neonatal supraclavicular depot exhibits the same physiological properties.</s><s>Prior evidence suggests a distinct second type of human BAT found in the interscapular region of newborn humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s>Second, we note that this is a measure of BAT composition and not activity.</s><s>The FF can then be thought of as either reflective of BAT capacity for future energy expenditure (lower FF is due to greater mitochondrial density) or suggestive of past lipid metabolism (lower FF is due to lipid stores having been utilized) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Certainly, these two physiological properties are not uncoupled, and future work is needed to gain a better understanding of the physiological underpinnings of BAT FF.</s><s>Future studies also are warranted that incorporate measures of BAT characteristics at 6 months of age, as well as concurrent measures of energy expenditure and metabolic function, and also perform longitudinal follow-up to quantify changes in BAT characteristics from birth to infancy, childhood, and beyond, along with the concurrent characterization of other infant and child phenotypes of interest in healthy as well as clinical (e.g., SGA) populations.</s></p><p><s>Our findings may provide the basis for important clinical applications.</s><s>BAT may provide a pharmacological target in the context of the growing problem of obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, potentially altering (optimizing) the initial amount of BAT or BRITE tissue in newborns, and its subsequent rate of
