<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>GCs suppress ALI via the GR dimerization in myeloid cells.</s><s>ALI was induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration followed by application of oleic acid (OA;

Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), and it was similarly affected by LPS treatment in both strains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Concomitantly, GR LysMCre and control wild-type (GR flox ) mice responded to LPS with a strong cellular infiltration and inflammation in the lung (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-d</ref>).</s><s>Treatment of LPS-challenged GR flox mice with Dex (LPS þ Dex) reduced EB accumulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) and decreased leukocyte infiltration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-d</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to control mice, LPSchallenged GR LysMCre mice were refractory to Dex treatment.</s><s>EB accumulation was not reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), cellular infiltration was persistent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b,c</ref>) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell numbers were unaltered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Accordingly, the histological score reflecting the severity of ALI <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> was reduced after Dex treatment in GR flox control mice but not in GR LysMCre mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the GR in myeloid cells is required for the suppression of ALI pathology by GCs.</s></p><p><s>GR deficiency in GR LysMCre mice affects both macrophages and neutrophils.</s><s>To exclude the possibility that the GR in neutrophils makes a major contribution to lung endothelial stability, GR loxP mice were crossed with Nr3c1 tm2Gsc Tg(Itgax-cre)1-1Reiz (hereafter referred to as CD11cCre) mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>The resultant GR CD11cCre mice did not show any recombination of the GRloxP allele in neutrophils, but there was efficient recombination in blood monocytes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, GR CD11cCre mice were resistant to Dex treatment during ALI in comparison with wild-type littermates (GR flox ) in terms of vascular leakage (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), indicating that loss of the GR in monocytes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) is sufficient to confer resistance to Dex treatment in ALI (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we tested whether an intact GR dimerization interface is required for the anti-inflammatory activity of GCs during ALI.</s><s>To this end, Nr3c1 tm3Gsc (hereafter referred to as GR dim ) mice were subjected to ALI and treated with Dex.</s><s>This treatment failed to reduce EB accumulation in the lung (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>), cellular infiltration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>), the histological score (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>) and cell numbers in the BAL fluid (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>) in GR dim mice.</s><s>The extent of the LPS-induced lung injury assessed by endothelial permeability, histological score and cell numbers in the BAL fluid was similar in wild-type and mutant mice (no significant differences; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e,g,h</ref>).</s><s>This implies that a functional GR dimerization interface is required for the repression of inflammation in ALI by GCs.</s></p><p><s>Of note, absolute numbers (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) of major leukocyte subpopulations in the blood were similar in mice of both genotypes.</s><s>The only exception was the abundance of neutrophil granulocytes, which was elevated by Dex application in wild-type mice, while it was diminished in GR dim mice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dex elevates circulating S1P dependent on GR in macrophages.</head><p><s>A primary mechanism of ALI pathogenesis is severe impairment of endothelial barrier integrity in the lung.</s><s>A critical role for the sphingolipid S1P in maintaining lung endothelial barrier function has been well demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, we hypothesized that plasma S1P levels might be influenced by Dex treatment in  ALI.</s><s>No change in circulating S1P levels was detectable in LPSinduced ALI;

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>) and mice with deletion of the GR in myeloid cells (GR LysMCre ; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>) displayed no change in plasma S1P levels.</s><s>LPS-induced ALI did not cause a significant change in plasma S1P levels between GR LysMCre mice and littermate control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>We conclude that GCs elevate plasma S1P levels only if GR dimerization and the GR in macrophages are intact.</s><s>Specific activation of S1PR1 with SEW2781 strengthened the endothelial barrier in GR LysMCre mice.</s><s>SEW2781 was as effective as Dex in reducing EB accumulation in LPS-challenged wild-type mice, and it rescued the failure of GR LysMCre mice to respond to Dex's beneficial effect on endothelial barrier integrity in the lung (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c,d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Macrophage SphK1 is crucial for anti-inflammatory GC actions.</s></p><p><s>As mice lacking GR expression in macrophages failed to upregulate S1P levels, we tested the contribution of SphK1 in these cells to S1P generation and its involvement in the observed anti-inflammatory effects of GCs.</s><s>To this end, conditional myeloid cell-specific SphK1 knockout mice (SphK1 tm2Cgh Lyz2tm1(cre)lfo/J; hereafter referred to as SphK1 LysMCre ) were generated and analysed.</s><s>In these mice, expression of SphK1 in isolated macrophages was diminished (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, circulating leukocytes were not altered in SphK1 LysMCre mice in comparison with SphK1 flox (SphK1 tm2Cgh ; hereafter referred to as SphK1 flox ) controls (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b,c</ref>).</s><s>In SphK1 LysMCre mice subjected to ALI, Dex did not increase circulating S1P levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>This indicates that myeloid-specific SphK1 expression is responsible for the GC-induced increase in S1P levels during ALI.</s><s>In accordance, Dex treatment of SphK1 LysMCre mice during ALI did not prevent endothelial leakage, as indicated by EB accumulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b,c</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, SphK1 LysMCre mice suffered from persistent inflammation and cellular infiltration during ALI even in the presence of Dex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d,e</ref>).</s><s>The extent of the LPS-induced lung injury assessed by endothelial permeability and cell numbers in the BAL fluid was similar in wild-type and mutant mice (no significant differences;
