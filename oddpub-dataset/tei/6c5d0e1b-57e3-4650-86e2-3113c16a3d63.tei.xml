inactivity where ambulatory movement is eliminated and energy balance can be rigorously controlled.</s><s>Bed rest provides a physiological context to interrogate the relationships between changes in muscle mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, metabolic rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and can provide valuable insights into the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.</s></p><p><s>There has been much focus on nutritional countermeasures to mitigate the negative effects of bed rest by inducing protein synthesis and preventing muscle loss through using amino acids alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or combined with exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and whey protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>However, results to date are equivocal.</s><s>Resistance exercise has shown potential by increasing muscle protein synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, mitochondrial enzyme activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and mitigating muscle mass loss during bed rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Vibration exercise, with high frequency, improves insulin sensitivity in animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> but has little effect on muscle atrophy during bed rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>However, when combined, resistance and vibration exercise have shown additive benefits on muscle and bone during bed rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>These data support resistive vibration exercise (RVE) as a novel therapeutic countermeasure that may also provide mechanistic insight into the relationship between mitochondrial function and insulin resistance.</s></p><p><s>When investigating the mechanisms underpinning insulin resistance and muscle loss induced by physical inactivity it is critical that energy balance is maintained.</s><s>Otherwise, lower physical activity leads to a positive energy balance (as reviewed in Bergouignan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) that increases fat mass, decreases insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and accelerates muscle loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>When energy balance is maintained, muscle mass alone decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>Positive energy balance and elevated fat mass can cause mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle, which confounds the study of bed rest-induced insulin resistance per se.</s><s>However, a recent report indicated that skeletal muscle lipid content was not changed when energy balance and fat mass were preserved during a 7 day bed rest intervention, even though there was a significant decrease in insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>If intramyocellular lipotoxicity is not mediating the changes in insulin sensitivity during bed rest per se, the implication is that alterations to mitochondrial function may be responsible.</s></p><p><s>Skeletal muscle mitochondria play a critical role in regulating cellular energy homeostasis and have been implicated in insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> and the regulation of muscle mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>It has been suggested that a decrease in mitochondrial lipid metabolism causes insulin resistance and it is a matter of debate if changes are due to dysfunctional mitochondria or a reduction in content <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>While proteomic and transcriptomic analysis following bed rest demonstrate decreased expression of oxidative pathways and enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, there is a need for more detailed investigations.</s></p><p><s>The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of 21 days of bed rest on mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle, insulin resistance and metabolic rate.</s><s>We hypothesised that bed rest-induced physical inactivity would decrease mitochondrial respiration and that this reduction would be associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure.</s><s>In addition, we hypothesised that these changes would be mitigated by a novel RVE intervention.</s></p></div>

fat-free mass.</s><s>While there are many integrated cascades contributing to insulin resistance, this study suggests that a decrease in mitochondrial respiration may mediate some Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Aerobic capacity and isokinetic strength before (pre) and after (post) 21 days of bed rest.</s><s>V ⋅ O 2peak is presented in absolute values (ml/min) (a) and relative to fat-free mass (ml kgFFM −1 min −1 ) (b).</s><s>Peak heart rate (c) and peak power (d) were also determined.</s><s>Maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MVC) was determined using isokinetic strength measurements during ankle flexion (e) and extension (f) and knee flexion (g) and extension (h).</s><s>Black bars, CON; grey bars, RVE.</s><s>Data are presented as mean ± SE. *p &lt; 0.05 vs before bed rest as an effect of time of the changes linked to physical inactivity.</s><s>Importantly, many of the negative effects of bed rest were mitigated by completing five sessions RVE.</s><s>Given the increasing evidence that periods of immobilisation may contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes, these data provide novel mechanistic insights into the detrimental metabolic and physiological effects of bed rest.</s></p><p><s>The decrease in insulin sensitivity following 21 days of bed rest was similar to previously reported bed rest studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>This decrease was not evident following the RVE trial, indicating that the exercise protocol was sufficient to maintain insulin sensitivity.</s><s>In addition, the correlation between insulin sensitivity and aerobic capacity supports the association between these variables in healthy young men <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>We report an 8-10% decrease in RMR and a 10-15% reduction in V ⋅ O 2peak following the CON and RVE trials, consistent with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>It is clinically important to note that the changes in insulin sensitivity occurred despite maintaining energy balance and support the importance of physical activity in any preventive strategy.</s></p><p><s>It is well established that mitochondrial content and enzyme activity increase in response to exercise training <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, independent of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> or type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>However, the impact of physical inactivity on mitochondrial content or function has received little or no attention.</s><s>In this study, we found a global decrease in skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration following 21 days of bed rest.</s><s>This is in contrast to a  recent report following 10 days of bed where no differences were reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>It may therefore take a period of time greater than 10 days for mitochondrial respiration to decrease.</s><s>There is a need for careful time course studies of mitochondrial adaptations to bed rest to provide the next level of evidence.</s><s>Importantly, the changes observed in our study following bed rest were not evident following the RVE protocol, indicating a protective role of RVE on mitochondrial respiration.</s><s>These findings may have important implications for managing people during hospitalisation and support a role for physical activity in the recovery of metabolic health following periods of immobilisation.</s><s>While preserved mitochondrial function is evident with RVE, these findings do not translate to whole body aerobic capacity.</s><s>This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that V ⋅ O 2 is influenced by both central (pulmonary diffusing capacity, stroke volume, heart rate and systemic oxygen extraction) and peripheral factors (oxygen carrying capacity, partial pressure of oxygen , capillary density and mitochondrial enzyme level) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>While many variables can impact whole body aerobic capacity, the measurement of mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle permeabilised muscle fibres gives us a more direct and informative readout of the capacity of skeletal muscle to consume oxygen.</s></p><p><s>The changes observed in mitochondrial respiration were evident when expressed relative to tissue wet weight, but most were not present when data was expressed relative to citrate synthase activity.</s><s>A similar pattern has been reported when mitochondrial respiration has been normalised to content following limb immobilisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, in older individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> or in people with metabolic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, indicating that the changes are possibly due to reduced mitochondrial content.</s><s>In addition, the relative contribution of substrate use remained the same following bed rest and there were no differences in Complex IV activity, as measured by the addition of TMPD and ascorbate.</s><s>Collectively, these data suggest that the decrease in mitochondrial respiration observed following bed rest was proportional to a reduction in mitochondrial density.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">.4 ± 0.2 1.2 ± 0.1 ‡ 1.3 ± 0.1 1.2 ±

be out.</s></p><p><s>One of the most interesting findings from this study was the significant decrease in LEAK respiration.</s><s>LEAK respiration is an indicator of mitochondrial uncoupling and refers to the transport of protons from the inner mitochondrial space to the matrix without producing ATP <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Reduced LEAK persisted in the CON trial when the carbohydrate, but not lipid, substrate data was normalised for a number of mitochondrial markers, including citrate synthase activity and OXPHOS protein content.</s><s>The carbohydrate LEAK respiration correlated with aerobic capacity, RMR and insulin sensitivity suggesting a partial contribution of decreased LEAK to these physiological outcomes.</s><s>It has been reported that ∼50% of respiration in skeletal muscle is proton leak and ∼14% of the metabolic rate could be attributed to this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>However, further research is needed to determine if the decrease in LEAK respiration is causative, or a consequence, of the decreased energy demand and metabolic rate.</s><s>These associations were not evident for the FA SUIT and suggest that the regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1) may be more important for determining the impact of lipids on mitochondrial respiration <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The LEAK control ratio (LEAK/ETS) normalises LEAK respiration to the ETS capacity and the ratio increases with uncoupling <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>In the CHO SUIT, we found a decrease in LEAK/ETS indicating a decrease in mitochondrial uncoupling following bed rest in the CON group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, an increase in the respiratory control ratio (OXPHOS/LEAK) was only found in the CON group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>).</s><s>The respiratory control ratio is an indicator of ADP-coupled respiration, also referred to as state 3/state 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Collectively, these ratios suggest that, in response to bed rest, the mitochondria favour coupled respiration instead of LEAK respiration and this may be a compensatory mechanism to maintain normal mitochondrial function.</s><s>These data are supported by reports of decreased LEAK respiration following 2 weeks of limb immobilisation in young and elderly men <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>These results may be significant when examining the impact of decreased physical activity on the process of ageing as LEAK respiration is significantly lower in elderly individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, but there are no reported differences associated with type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>As there was no reduction in LEAK in the RVE trial, these data reinforce the importance of physical activity as a long-term decrease in LEAK respiration is associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and oxidative damage.</s><s>While this study was conducted in young healthy adults, the results identify some of the early metabolic changes associated with physical inactivity but further studies will be required to demonstrate the long-term impact on the processes of ageing.</s></p><p><s>We wanted to determine if there was a cellular mechanism that could account for the decrease in LEAK respiration following bed rest; therefore, we measured the levels of uncoupling proteins.</s><s>UCP3 is the most widely studied skeletal muscle uncoupling protein but we did not observe a change in UCP3 levels in the CON trial.</s><s>Interestingly, we did find a decrease in UCP3 levels following the RVE trial.</s><s>In skeletal muscle, UCP3 accounts for a small proportion of total LEAK respiration and UCP3 knockout mice have unchanged  respiration rates and proton conductance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> suggesting an alternative regulatory system.</s><s>A second type of mitochondrial carrier that can inducible proton or uncoupling, is ANT.</s><s>We found a significant decrease in ANT1/2 levels in the CON but not the RVE trial.</s><s>In ANT1 knockout mice there is a significant decrease in state 4 respiration, accounted for by a 50% decrease in proton leak kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, UCP3 knockout mice display increased proton conductance but no change in maximal LEAK respiration after undergoing 2 weeks of energy intake restriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>The role of ANT in proton conductance is not fully understood but it does not depend on the function of ANT as a nucleotide translocase, FA compositional changes or the inner membrane bilayer surface area.</s><s>It may depend on a change in the properties of proton conductance at the ANT and phospholipid interface or be indirectly correlated with the ATP demand of the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, a change in the expression of ANT could be an important factor in regulating uncoupled respiration in human skeletal muscle and may explain the decrease in LEAK respiration observed following bed rest.</s><s>While studies such as this are highly controlled human experiments they have limitations that should be acknowledged.</s><s>Given the resources required and the need for careful and detailed investigation of participant phenotype it is not possible to include a large number of individuals.</s><s>In addition, this was a crossover study and while it allows for a comparison of the same participants, there is a risk of variability between trials.</s><s>There were no differences in the baseline physiological variables suggesting the 4 month washout period was sufficient but there were differences in some of the skeletal muscle variables and we used within-group analysis; for these data.</s><s>Finally, bed rest studies cause fluid shifts and increase diuresis and these changes may influence the fat-free mass measured by DEXA.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we provide evidence for reduced mitochondrial respiration after 21 days of bed rest.</s><s>The reduction in cellular respiration was associated with decreased insulin sensitivity and metabolic rate and it is possible that these changes are inter-related in response to physical inactivity.</s><s>The decline in mitochondrial respiration may be due to reduced mitochondrial content as evidenced by the decrease in citrate synthase activity; however, further studies are required and other mechanisms cannot be excluded.</s><s>There were no declines in mitochondrial function observed after the RVE trial suggesting that the mode and frequency of exercise had a partially protective effect.</s><s>After the CON trial, CHO SUIT LEAK respiration was reduced and this was consistently evident when normalised to other mitochondrial variables.</s><s>The reduction in the LEAK control ratio and the increase in the respiratory control ratio suggest that the mitochondria are adapting to maintain normal function during bed rest.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Changes in body weight and body composition.</s><s>Body
