The finding that azithromycin inhibits IL-1β</head><p><s>secretion upon LPS stimulation without affecting the production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggested an inhibitory effect of the drug on IL-1β maturation, since the first step of cytokine induction (NF-κ B activation) would also affect the production of other cytokines.</s><s>Furthermore, the restriction of the effect to LPS stimulation suggested that the mechanism either included the NLRP3 inflammasome or directly involved LPS recognition.</s><s>In order to assess whether a disturbance of intracellular LPS sensing might be responsible for azithromycin's effects, we measured whether there is an uptake of LPS into intracellular compartments of human monocytes in the doses utilised in our cytokine assays.</s><s>To this end, we made use of FITC-labelled LPS to detect internalisation of this compound after quenching of extracellular fluorescence.</s><s>Here, we were able to detect a significant increase in fluorescence in FITC-LPS treated cells, when compared to both LPS-stimulated (37 °C) and/or FITC-LPS treated (4 °C) cultures, thus indicating internalisation of the compound (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>Since we had detected intracellular LPS, a disturbance of LPS sensing by azithromycin was a feasible option.</s><s>Inflammatory caspase-4, a human homologue of murine caspase-11, has recently been identified to function as an intracellular LPS receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>When analysing the impact of azithromycin on the induction of this caspase, we found a significant down-regulation after treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref> Values are expressed as mean ± SEM from 3 independent experiments.</s></p><p><s>was not affected by azithromycin treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>Once we identified that azithromycin's effects were mediated by interference with inflammatory caspase signalling, we wondered whether other cytokines regulated by this axis were also affected by azithromycin treatment.</s><s>Therefore, we analysed the induction of IL-1α and IL-18, and found an intense and dose-dependent down-modulation of IL-1α production upon LPS stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, Suppl.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, we were not able to detect IL-18 in cell culture supernatants (data not shown).</s><s>With these experiments, we were able to identify an impact of azithromycin on inflammasome formation, which involves the inhibition of intracellular LPS sensing mediated by caspase-4.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Azithromycin affects IL-1β secretion in vivo.</head><p><s>In order to further substantiate our findings, we assessed the impact of azithromycin on cytokine induction in a murine model of LPS sepsis.</s><s>In line with our in vitro observations, we found a selective down-modulation of IL-1β levels in the course of endotoxin sepsis whereas other pro-inflammatory cytokines remained unaffected by the treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a-c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although the results did not reach statistical significance, probably due to the high variability in this model, the specificity of azithromycin's effects on cytokine production is remarkable.</s><s>These findings substantiate the potential impact of our findings for an in vivo situation which might be of relevance in clinical conditions as well.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Several clinical studies addressing the impact of macrolides on inflammation-driven diseases found a therapeutic benefit of macrolides which was not exclusively attributable to their antimicrobial properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>These findings have stimulated a debate about whether a long-term macrolide regimen should become part of treatment guidelines in patients with chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD and cystic fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the impact of macrolides on the inflammasome axis, which was recently identified as a central regulator of respiratory diseases, a major field of clinical macrolide application.</s><s>We have shown that azithromycin selectively inhibits IL-1 production in vitro and in vivo.</s><s>Azithromycin did not affect NF-κ B signalling in monocytes, but impaired the induction of the inflammatory caspase-4, which is an early regulator of the inflammasome pathway and an intracellular LPS sensor.</s><s>In contrast, clarithromycin and roxithromycin did not exhibit any cytokine modulating effects in human monocytes.</s><s>Experiments interfering with Ca ++ -dependent uptake indicated a role of intracellular accumulation of azithromycin in its cytokine-modulatory effects.</s><s>Although a plethora of work analysing the immune-modulating properties of macrolides has been performed 1 , studies on the cytokine-modulating properties of these drugs on primary human innate immune cells are limited.</s><s>Similar to our results, Vrančić et al. found no alterations of TNF-α and IL-6 production of IFN-γ /LPS stimulated human monocytes when co-treated with azithromycin <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Kikuchi et al. studied the impact of clarithromycin on IL-8 secretion of adherence-purified monocytes and the THP-1 monocytic cell line.</s><s>In contrast to our findings, these authors were able to detect inhibition of IL-8 secretion.</s><s>Since we utilized highly purified CD14 + cells, the inconsistency might be explained by the different cell isolation procedures and cell treatment.</s><s>Furthermore, Kikuchi et al. used higher amounts of LPS (1 μ g/ml vs 100 ng/ml in our study) for stimulation, which might influence the outcome as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The only other study assessing potential differences in the cytokine-modulating effects of azithromycin and clarithromycin in primary human monocytes was performed by Khan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Similar to our findings, differing modulating properties of the drugs were observed.</s><s>However, in this study, slight reductions also in IL-6 and TNF-α levels were observed when the cells were treated with clarithromycin.</s><s>Intriguingly, similar to our results, azithromycin potently inhibited IL-1α secretion in this study.</s><s>Nevertheless, since the regulation of IL-1 secretion by the inflammasome axis was then unknown, the inflammasome could not be deduced to be the molecular target of azithromycin.</s></p><p><s>Macrolides are known to accumulate in leucocytes, and their intracellular concentrations are about 100-fold higher than that in plasma <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>The doses utilized in this study mirror tissue concentrations determined by pharmacokinetic studies which range from 5 to 10 μ g/ml <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Azithromycin is known to accumulate intracellularly to a much higher extent than clarithromycin or roxithromycin <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>The dibasic structure of azithromycin, which is unique among macrolides, causes enrichment in acidic phagosomal compartments due to ion-trapping and a rather slow release from intracellular compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Transport through the plasma membrane is known to be mediated by a Ca ++ -dependent mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In this study, we have utilised two strategies known to inhibit macrolide accumulation in leucocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>The observation that interruption of azithromycin's transmembrane transport can abolish its IL-1β modulating effects suggests a role of azithromycin's intracellular accumulation in the mediation of its effects.</s><s>Taking into account the established differences in intracellular accumulation among macrolides, the varying ability of macrolides to inhibit the inflammasome axis due to differential intracellular presence is conceivable.</s><s>Nevertheless, additional experiments are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the diverging immune-modulatory properties of macrolides.</s></p><p><s>Several molecular targets have been implicated in azithromycin's immune-modulating effects 1 .</s><s>However, our observations in human monocytes narrowed down the spectrum of potential targets to the pathways involved in IL-1β secretion, NF-κ B-and inflammasome signalling.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to previous reports on azithromycin's impact on the NF-κ B pathway in monocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , we were not able to detect an inhibition of NF-κ B signalling in our model.</s><s>Since previous reports utilised dual stimulation models in their assays (Vrančić et al. utilised an IFN-γ /LPS-stimulation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , Kobayashi et al.</s><s>PMA priming prior to LPS stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> ), varying effects might be due to differences in signalling cascades induced in the respective models.</s></p><p><s>Recent advances have identified the inflammatory caspase-4 and the murine homologue caspase-11 as central upstream regulators of the "noncanonical inflammasome" cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>These caspases were found to be crucial regulators of endotoxin-induced immune responses.</s><s>In particular, they mediate LPS-induced lethality in endotoxin sepsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Sollberger et al. elegantly showed that caspase-4 is an upstream regulator of caspase-1 activity, and, additionally, has intrinsic IL-1β processing abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>The findings by Shi et al., who identified caspase-4 as a direct receptor for LPS, shed further light on the role of this enzyme in the mediation of endotoxin-induced immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>Since azithromycin's effects were observed after endotoxin, but not flagellin stimulation, we focused on this inflammatory caspase in the search for azithromycin's target in inflammasome activation.</s><s>We were able to show an impairment of caspase-4 induction after azithromycin treatment, which provides a coherent explanation for the specificity of its effects.</s><s>Additionally, we found a dose-dependent down-modulation of another caspase-processed cytokine, IL-1α , which provides further evidence for azithromycin's impact on this pathway.</s><s>Although the induction of IL-1β maturation by caspase-4 is consistent in literature, the involvement of downstream mediators of this effect, particularly caspase-1, is controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>Future studies might clarify this issue and help to further elucidate the detailed mechanism of azithromycin's action.</s></p><p><s>The specific inhibition of IL-β production by azithromycin in a murine endotoxin sepsis model, points towards a similar effect on caspase-11, the murine homologue of human caspase-4.</s><s>In the setting of endotoxin sepsis, these inflammatory caspases are not only known to mediate IL-1β secretion, but also, and more importantly, are crucial regulators of lethality in endotoxemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>The accordance of our in vitro data with the findings in this in vivo model expands our observations to pathologically relevant situations and might encourage research on the impact of azithromycin on this axis in similar conditions in humans.</s><s>Furthermore, clinical research needs to assess whether our observations gained in a short term stimulation model are reproducible in long-term treatment regimens with different macrolides in the therapy of clinical conditions.</s></p><p><s>We herewith provide the first evidence of azithromycin's specific inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β in human innate immune cells by impairing intracellular LPS sensing of the inflammatory caspase-4.</s><s>Furthermore, we have shown that there are fundamental differences between macrolides in targeting the inflammasome axis.</s><s>Therefore, our findings suggest that azithromycin might be the macrolide of choice in the treatment of diseases involving deregulated inflammasome activation.</s><s>However, since this pathway plays an important role in microbial clearance as well, additional studies are required in order to assess whether the
