<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">MP29-02</head><p><s>A new treatment option for AR, MP29-02 (Dymista Ò ; Meda, Solna, Sweden) (Box 1) has recently been developed, with the aim of overcoming many of the shortcomings observed with current first-line AR treatments as described above.</s><s>MP29-02 draws on the best from both worlds, incorporating an antihistamine (AZE) and an INS (FP) in a novel intranasal formulation, delivered in a single device.</s><s>It thus has the potential for broad AR pathologic coverage, and it is also likely that the formulation of MP29-02 is superior to other marketed intranasal sprays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>The deposition in the nasal cavity with MP29-02 appears to be influenced by several distinct properties including a larger spray volume with MP29-02 (i.e., 137 vs 100 µl; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), a finer droplet size distribution and lower viscosity compared with marketed FP comparator products.</s><s>These formulation characteristics may contribute to spray pattern improvements, including superior dispersion, larger spray pattern diameter and larger total area covered as compared with a marketed FP product <ref type="bibr">[63]</ref>.</s><s>These formulation and device characteristics may be associated with pharmacokinetic (PK) differences and improved efficacy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Pharmacokinetics</head><p><s>Two PK studies were conducted to determine whether there were any drug--drug interactions between the active components of MP29-02, and to evaluate the bioavailability of these components versus commercially available formulations of AZE and FP <ref type="bibr">[63]</ref>.</s><s>Both studies had a randomized, 3-period, 6-sequence 3-treatment crossover design and were conducted in healthy subjects after a single dose (2 sprays/nostril twice a day).</s></p><p><s>No interactions of AZE and FP were found in the MP29-02 formulation.</s><s>AZE bioavailability was similar for the MP29-02 formulation and marketed AZE (Astelin Ò ).</s><s>However, FP bioavailability differed between the marketed and MP29-02-FP-mono formulations.</s><s>Maximum and total FP exposure was higher for the MP29-02-FP-mono compared with marketed FP indicating a difference due to formulation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>This unique PK profile of the FP component within the MP29-02 formulation suggests that MP29-02 is more than just two molecules in the same device <ref type="bibr">[63]</ref>.</s><s>FP levels were generally very low with all investigational products and unlikely to suggest clinically meaningful differences concerning systemic safety.</s></p></div>
