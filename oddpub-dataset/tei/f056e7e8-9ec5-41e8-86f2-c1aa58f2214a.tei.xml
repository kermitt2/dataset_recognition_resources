<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We assayed the effects of ATM activity on neutrophil functions by incubating cells with various inflammatory stimuli in the presence of KU-55933, a highly-specific small-molecule inhibitor of ATM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Neutrophils express functional ATM, which is phosphorylated in response to irradiation-induced DNA damage, and this activation is abrogated in the presence of KU-55933 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>We found that this inhibitor caused a strong dose-dependent increase in the secretion of IL-8 and MIP-1a in response to LPS, a component of bacterial outer membranes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>The specificity of this effect was confirmed using a second inhibitor of ATM, KU-60019 (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>We observed an increase in cytokine production in the presence of KU-55933 not only in response to LPS stimulation, but also in response to opsonized zymosan, flagellin, and heat-killed L monocytogenes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>An increase in the production of IL-6 in response to LPS and heat-killed Listeria was similarly observed (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, ATM inhibition in peripheral blood monocytes significantly increased the production of IL-1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor in response to LPS stimulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine whether genetic deficiencies in ATM affect neutrophil cytokine production in patients, we measured IL-8 production from primary peripheral blood neutrophils isolated from 11 different patients with AT (mean age, 16 years).</s><s>One of these patients participated twice on separate occasions (n 5 12).</s><s>All patients were free of infections and malignancy at the time of blood donation.</s><s>AT diagnoses were confirmed by ATM gene sequencing (supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Neutrophils isolated from 12 sex-matched healthy donors were used as controls (mean age, 28 years; n 5 12).</s><s>Neutrophils were isolated and experiments performed with one AT patient and one control concurrently.</s><s>Neutrophils from patients with AT produced significantly more IL-8 (mean, 1.73 ng/10 6 cells) in response to LPS than healthy controls (mean, 0.69 ng/10 6 cells) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>These data, complemented by our experiments with ATM inhibitors, show that cytokine production is increased in the absence of ATM activity.</s></p><p><s>Because neutrophil apoptosis is regulated by p53, which can be induced by ATM activation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> we asked whether ATM deficiency affects neutrophil lifespan.</s><s>Cell viability was assayed by flow cytometry over an 18-hour time course by staining with PE-labeled Annexin V (which binds exposed phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells) and propidium iodide (PI, a vital DNA dye), at the indicated time points.</s><s>We found that neutrophils from AT patients lived significantly longer than controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed this result by measuring viability with the Sub-G1 assay (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these data show that primary neutrophils from AT patients overproduce inflammatory cytokines and delay constitutive apoptosis.</s></p><p><s>In response to LPS stimulation, MAP kinases are activated by phosphorylation, whereas IkBa, an inhibitor of the transcription factor NF-kB, is degraded.</s><s>To determine whether ATM regulates the activation or duration of these signaling pathways, we measured their activation in response to LPS stimulation by Western blot.</s><s>In a 3-hour time course of LPS stimulation, we observed phosphorylation of ATM and histone H2A.X.</s><s>Phosphorylation of ATM, but not H2A.X, in response to LPS was abrogated by the addition of KU-55933, where p38 phosphorylation was increased (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A-B</ref>).</s><s>We observed increased ERK phosphorylation and degradation of IkBa, but only at later time points (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>We then used inhibitors of p38 and ERK to determine whether IL-8 overproduction in the absence of ATM activity is dependent on these MAP kinases.</s><s>P38 inhibition blocked IL-8 production in controls and abrogated the overproduction of IL-8 in response to ATM inhibition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Increased MAPK activation in the absence of ATM activity led to increased cytokine transcription.</s><s>We observed an increase in both IL-8 and MIP-1a transcripts in the presence of KU-55933 compared with the housekeeping gene b 2 -microglobulin by qPCR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s><s>Correspondingly, we observed an increase in IL-8 protein in neutrophils stimulated in the presence of KU-55933, as shown by intracellular antibody staining and analysis by flow cytometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next used a panel of small-molecule inhibitors targeting specific kinases involved in the DNA damage response to determine whether other members of this pathway influence cytokine production.</s><s>Inhibition of ATR, DNA-PK, and Chk2 increased IL-8 production in response to LPS, similar to ATM inhibition and consistent with their partially redundant roles in the DNA damage response (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>In line with this, ATM and ATR inhibition synergistically increase cytokine production above the level of either inhibitor alone (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, inhibiting p53 drastically prolonged neutrophil life span (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>) but did not affect IL-8 production (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Thus, increased cytokine production in the absence of DNA damage signaling is not strictly linked to prolonged lifespan.</s></p><p><s>These data suggest that DNA damage signaling downregulates neutrophil cytokine production.</s><s>To directly test this hypothesis, we preincubated neutrophils for 1 hour with cisplatin or etoposide, 2 chemical inducers of DNA damage, or exposed them to 10 Gy of g-irradiation before stimulating them with LPS.</s><s>These treatments induced DNA damage and activated ATM, as shown by Western blot analysis of histone g-H2A.X and phospho-ATM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>), and significantly reduced the production of IL-8 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, treatment with etoposide or irradiation strongly activated ATM and reduced cytokine production without large effects on cell viability after 8 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>).</s><s>Together, these results show that activation of the DNA damage response suppresses cytokine production and contributes to neutrophil apoptosis.</s></p><p><s>Because ROS can cause oxidative damage to DNA, we hypothesized that the oxidative burst mounted upon stimulation may activate the DNA damage response in neutrophils.</s><s>We tested this by using PMA and opsonized zymosan, 2 potent inducers of the oxidative burst (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>In response to PMA, we observed an accumulation of phospho-ATM staining in the nuclei of stimulated neutrophils (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>We tested the ROS dependence of this activation using pyrocatechol (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>), a cell-permeable ROS scavenger capable of neutralizing the oxidative burst as shown in supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>.</s><s>In the presence of pyrocatechol, activated neutrophils showed less phosphorylation of ATM compared with controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed the activation of DNA damage signaling by Western blot analysis in neutrophils stimulated with PMA and opsonized zymosan (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>Stimulation caused a strong induction of phospho-ATM, phospho-BRCA-1 (a substrate of ATM), and g-H2A.X in control cells, but not in the presence of pyrocatechol.</s><s>Phosphorylation of ATM and H2A.X in response to irradiationinduced DNA damage, however, was not affected by ROS scavenging.</s></p><p><s>To test whether the oxidative burst is the endogenous source of ROS activating the DNA damage response, we similarly evaluated ATM activation in neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).</s><s>CGD is a genetic disorder in which neutrophils fail to mount an oxidative burst because of deficiencies in NADPH oxidase (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, we could show that ATM is effectively activated in neutrophils isolated from CGD patients in response to irradiation, but not in response to ROS-inducing stimuli (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>).</s><s>This confirms that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are required for activating the DNA damage response in stimulated neutrophils.</s></p><p><s>Our results predict that CGD neutrophils, similar to AT neutrophils, would produce more cytokines as a result of impaired activation of ATM and the DNA damage response.</s><s>We confirmed this by comparing cytokine production from patients with the 2 deficiencies: neutrophils isolated concurrently from both a CGD and an AT patient produced more IL-8 than cells from a healthy control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>).</s><s>We obtained similar results when incubating neutrophils with ROS scavenger pyrocatechol or ATM inhibitor KU-55933 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>).</s><s>3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> Furthermore, we could rescue the IL-8 overproduction phenotype of ROS-scavenged cells by exogenously inducing DNA damage (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>).</s><s>Etoposide treatment potently decreased IL-8 production from pyrocatechol-treated neutrophils back to levels similar to control cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to examine primary innate immune cells from AT patients.</s><s>We show that ROS-mediated activation of DNA damage signaling in neutrophils suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines and activates apoptosis.</s><s>Accordingly, we report that deficiencies in the DNA damage response, similar to deficiencies in the oxidative burst, result in the overproduction of cytokines and delayed apoptosis.</s><s>We demonstrate a key role for ATM and show that cytokine production and apoptosis are dysregulated in neutrophils from patients with AT.</s><s>These results further our understanding of the ROS-mediated regulation of inflammation and indicate an interesting link between 2 diverse diseases, AT and CGD.</s><s>Moreover, our results suggest that innate immune dysfunction may drive inflammation in AT.</s></p><p><s>The specific mechanisms by which ATM and the DNA damage response contribute to the regulation of cytokine production are not completely clear.</s><s>The effect is at least partially mediated by modulating well-described MAPK signaling pathways.</s><s>Our data demonstrate an important role for p38 and suggest one for ERK as well.</s><s>It has previously been reported that ATM and other members of the DNA damage response can affect the activation of MAP kinases and NF-kB, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> which are important regulators of cell survival and inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref></s><s>onsistent with our findings, several lines of evidence have recently emerged that point to ATM having a major role in suppressing inflammation.</s><s>In human dendritic cells ATM was shown to be a negative regulator of IL-23 production. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref></s><s>Furthermore, pharmacologic induction of the DNA damage response reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increases survival in septic mice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref></s><s>This protective effect was shown to be partly mediated by ATM activation, although the researchers conclude that this is a lung-specific mechanism not mediated by blood cells.</s><s>Similarly, Härtlova et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> reported that ATM deficiency in macrophages increases production of type I interferon.</s><s>The authors, however, do not suggest a direct role for ATM in interferon regulation.</s><s>Rather, they propose that unrepaired DNA lesions in AT cells activate Stimulator of IFN Genes (STING) and prime the type I interferon system.</s><s>This mechanism and the ROSmediated one proposed by our study are not mutually exclusive.</s><s>It would be interesting to examine whether other cytokines, including IL-8, are also upregulated in AT macrophages.</s></p><p><s>Our data indicate that ATM is not the sole member of the DNA damage response that regulates neutrophil function.</s><s>Inhibition of DNA damage sensors ATR and DNA-PK, as well as Chk2, a substrate of ATM, also increased cytokine production.</s><s>These sensors are often described as each recognizing a specific type of damage to DNA and executing parallel but discrete responses through different downstream mediators.</s><s>In reality, there is much overlap and crosstalk between these pathways and substrates, meaning they may be partially redundant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref></s><s>Indeed, we observe that simultaneous inhibition of ATM and ATR synergistically increases cytokine production more than either inhibitor alone (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Chk2 has been shown to  affect MAP kinase activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> and can also be activated by ATR, though less efficiently than by ATM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref></s><s>Thus, these kinases may converge on Chk2 to regulate cytokine production.</s></p><p><s>Neutrophil cytokine production and lifespan are closely linked and may affect each other.</s><s>Secretion of IL-8 can increase lifespan by autocrine signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> and is one possible mechanism causing increased viability in  AT cells.</s><s>We can, however, conclude that the regulation of cytokine production by the DNA damage response can be uncoupled from its regulation of apoptosis.</s><s>Inhibiting p53 dramatically prolonged neutrophil lifespan, but did not increase IL-8 production.</s><s>Furthermore, normalizing cytokine production to viable cells at an earlier time point clarifies that when ATM is inhibited, the production of IL-8 increases in magnitude and is not only a result of an increased lifespan (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, inducing DNA damage by treatment with etoposide, or irradiation, reduced cytokine production, but had no effect on apoptosis in the time span under investigation.</s></p><p><s>One of the most prominent neutrophil responses to activating stimuli, in addition to cytokine production, is the oxidative burst.</s><s>Production of superoxide and its derivatives hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid is thought to contribute to microbial killing and also serve important signaling functions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>ROS are known to induce DNA damage and to activate ATM directly by oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> and were thus prime candidates for triggering ATM activity in activated neutrophils.</s><s>By comparing neutrophil responses in AT and CGD patients, we identified the oxidative burst as an activator of ATM important for regulating cytokine production.</s><s>A side-by-side comparison of IL-8 production in control, CGD, and AT neutrophils reveals that ROS and ATM deficiencies phenocopy each other in this respect.</s><s>Exogenous induction of DNA damage can rescue the cytokine overproduction phenotype of ROS-scavenged neutrophils and further supports this model.</s><s>It is not yet clear whether the activation of ATM by ROS is directly mediated by oxidation of ATM, or via oxidative damage to the DNA.</s><s>Phosphorylation of H2A.X in response to LPS when ATM is inhibited indicates that this activation is via DNA damage and may be increased in ATM deficiency as a result of inefficient repair.</s></p><p><s>Our results thus suggest the following model for the initiation and resolution of inflammation by myeloid cells: (1) neutrophil activation leads to activation of MAP kinases and initiation of oxidative burst and cytokine production; (2) NADPH oxidase-derived ROS, in addition to contributing to microbial killing, also activate ATM; and (3) ATM signaling participates in initiating the resolution phase by limiting cytokine production and promoting antiinflammatory neutrophil cell death.</s><s>Thus, augmented cytokine production coupled with decreased apoptosis rates could result in a synergistic increase in the magnitude and lifespan of neutrophil inflammatory responses in AT patients.</s><s>Furthermore, our model suggests a potential mechanistic link between the pathologies observed in 2 completely different diseases: AT and CGD (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).</s><s>ROS are ubiquitous and promiscuous molecules, playing a role in signaling and regulation of many pathways.</s><s>In neutrophils, the oxidative burst is known to regulate antimicrobial responses, apoptosis, autophagy, hypoxia and oxidative stress responses, chemotaxis, and NETosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>CGD is the result of dysregulation of all of these responses, which causes immunodeficiency and hyperinflammation.</s><s>Similarly, AT is the result of dysfunctions in many pathways involving ATM.</s><s>We propose that the ROS-mediated activation of ATM is an important response that is dysregulated in AT that affects cytokine production, a dysregulation that is shared by patients with CGD.</s><s>Though these diseases are very different, they may have an inflammatory common denominator.</s></p><p><s>Chronic inflammation, granuloma formation, and elevated risk of autoimmune disorders in CGD are attributed to increased cytokine production and delayed apoptosis of neutrophils and macrophages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref></s><s>e observe similar dysregulation of neutrophil functions in AT patients and believe this may also drive chronic inflammation and disease in AT.</s><s>In agreement with this, several authors have reported instances of nonresolving, sterile skin granulomas in AT patients.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> Prolonged inflammatory responses could drive and exacerbate the inflammatory symptoms of AT and even contribute to neurodegeneration and high rates of cancer.</s><s>Several reports have suggested excessive inflammatory responses in a mouse model of AT, resulting in increased susceptibility to colitis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> as well as inflammatory tissue damage in the lung. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51</ref></s><s>here is currently no treatment available for AT other than palliative care.</s><s>Interestingly, Chessa et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52</ref> found that treatment with the antiinflammatory steroid betamethasone improved neurological symptoms for AT patients, though it remains to be seen whether this effect was mediated by the immunosuppressive properties of the drug.</s><s>Our work further strengthens the argument that targeting inflammation may be a promising clinical intervention for some of the symptoms of this devastating disease.</s></p></div><figure
