Malina 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The employees of these hospitals were tried in 1946 at the national court in Vienna and asked among other things how it had technically been possible to use the therapeutic machine for murder.</s><s>Holzer, the inventor of the original Elkra II, was appointed as an expert at court. 35</s><s> A technical explanation was indeed needed.</s><s>After all, it had been the declared aim of all the inventors of the electroshock apparatuses to find a construction which would make ''accidents and damages with this new method of treatment impossible''; so that even if ''the apparatus is used by someone inexperienced or in a bad condition'', there would be no damage for the patient or the treating person <ref type="bibr">(Cerletti &amp; Bini 1941: 212)</ref>.</s><s>Notwithstanding Bini's criticism of the SRW apparatus, the Konvulsator also had been praised for its ''extensive safeguards disabling any damage of the patient or treatment staff by electric current, as far as possible in human terms'' <ref type="bibr">(Stolze 1943: 100)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In order to be able to use the available Elkra II for the quiet continuance of patient murder, Gelny had pins and forks made from metal at the locksmith belonging to Gugging. 36</s><s>Gelny connected the pins to one of the electrodes of the electrode holder from the Elkra II in each case so as to divert the current from each of the two sides in the cable connected to it which branched out at a later point of time.</s><s>The ends of the diverting cables were connected to the forks just as the ends of the continuing cables.</s><s>Provisionally wrapped with bandaging material, the forks as substitute electrodes were placed at the hands and feet of the sick person selected for murder.</s><s>Thus the current was no longer limited to flow among the head electrodes through the brain, as planned for therapeutic use.</s><s>Through the additional electrode construction, veins, muscles and particularly the heart was streamed from hand to hand and foot-to-foot.</s><s>Hence death occurred, as Holzer explained to the court, ''after the previous electroshock with its known phase of unconsciousness'', ''due to a combined effect on vital centres and on the heart''. 37</s><s> Those were anything but ''slight'' changes in a device that Holzer had by no means developed to ''inflict torture'' <ref type="bibr">(Friedlander 1995: 169)</ref>, 38 but based upon the preliminary Italian works to serve as a modern electro-medical therapy free of the side effects of pharmacological convulsion therapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>A material history of electroshock therapy at the level of construction plans, electrodes and patents shows the ways in which the conditions of Fascism, National Socialism and World War II shaped the introduction of electroshock LARA RZESNITZEK AND SASCHA LANG in a different perspective than the hitherto prevailing 'histories of ideas', 'social' or 'entangled' histories.</s></p><p><s>Evidently, the idea of electroshock therapy did not come from the slaughterhouse (cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Szasz 1971;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kalinowsky 1980</ref>).</s><s>However, within the material history of electroshock therapy and all its technical details, the slaughterhouse story or more exactly the debate about the Deutsche Reichspatent for ''the forceps form of the anaesthesia device'' for animals to be slaughtered, provides a remarkable example for the recesses of the medical technology business.</s><s>The transfer of the ''anaesthesia electrode forceps'' patent from the veterinary technical field to the medical sphere of electroshock therapy enabled SRW to resume a leading position on the European electroshock market.</s></p><p><s>During the early 1940s, the construction of electroshock devices was remarkably little hindered by national frontiers or the fronts of World War II; it was mostly conditioned by material shortages.</s><s>Yet, technical improvisation allowed the construction of an electroshock apparatus even in Auschwitz; it even helped its reconstruction as a device for ''euthanasia'' murder.</s></p><p><s>Which models were constructed, built, promoted and sold in the German Reich and Europe was historically relative and resulted, for instance, from the forced emigration of Jewish scientists following the Nazi rise to power.</s><s>Another factor were the changes in patent legislation made by the National Socialists.</s></p><p><s>The aggravated Italian racial laws following the Pact of Steel in May 1939 had forced, for example, Lothar Kalinowsky to leave the Italian exile; on his further immigration he promoted the technique in silent partnership with its inventor Lucio Bini.</s><s>Taking the blueprints of Bini's Arcioni device with him on his continued exodus, Kalinowsky encountered more technically talented psychiatrists, especially in England, whose interest in the new research of electroshock made them propose competitive designs.</s><s>For the German Reich, National Socialist patent legislation facilitated the construction and sale of a German device; Bini's application for a German patent was simply circumvented.</s></p><p><s>In England, changing the wiring principle of voltage constancy to current constancy proved to be enough modification to the initial construction to enable bypassing prevailing patent law.</s><s>Sparing the initial resistance measuring simplified the device also to the benefit of lower costs, sometimes sufficient to propose a lower and therefore more attractive sale's prize.</s></p><p><s>Adapting the make-up of the apparatuses to the changing local conditions of specific clinics or hospitals, as, for example, Holzer did for the Vienna University Clinic or Braunmu Â¨hl in Eglfing Haar, yielded still further technical solutions including even portable devices.</s></p><p><s>Differing interest of psychiatrists, industrial companies and mental health politics affected the introduction of the electroshock technique-even at the level of screws and wires.</s><s>The technical variations in electroshock therapy until 1945 were each time a different answer in the quest for the most suited technology for electroshock therapy-be it easy as possible applicability or the extent of side effects, be it the matter of low production and acquisition costs, or even the possible use as a method for ''euthanasia''.</s><s>Financial interest of the involved industrial companies was a major reason to challenge the details of the therapeutic technique as the companies searched for alternative techniques primarily to circumvent fees due to protective patent rights.</s><s>In doing so considerations of business competition outdid clinical medical interests several times.</s></p><p><s>In this process, the electroshock therapy technique was so adaptable to diverging interests that it was even reversed from a medical therapy into a method of ''euthanasia''; an alienation whose possibility is not attributable to the special suitability of electroshock therapy as such, but to the contextual adaptability of every technology.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Italian manual Apparecchio per l'elettroshock-brevetto Prof. Bini 1939 (Collection Dolhuys, museum van de geest, Haarlem, The Netherlands)</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,93.54,59.53,226.80,311.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
