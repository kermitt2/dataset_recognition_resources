coincides with gastric cancer development <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>The majority of sporadic gastric tumors belong to the intestinal type of gastric cancer, a histological entity characterized by expansive growth that retains a glandular structure.</s><s>Despite the histological coherence however, no central common molecular pathway has been convincingly shown as aberrantly regulated in intestinaltype gastric cancer development.</s><s>This is in contrast to another type of stomach cancer coined diffuse-type gastric cancer Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00109-016-1447-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</s></p><p><s>that is characterized by scattered growth and associated

molecular changes in intestinal-type gastric cancer are enhanced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and diminished expression of the mucous-associated protein trefoil factor 1 (TFF1).</s><s>Altered expression of both proteins is associated with cancer progression, although no recurrent mutations have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, TFF1 knockout and COX2-overexpressing mice develop gastric tumors, highlighting the importance of the abnormal expression of these proteins for cancer development <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, CCAAT enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is also frequently overexpressed in intestinaltype gastric cancer and associated with both enhanced COX2 expression and loss of TFF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>C/EBPβ is a transcription factor that belongs to the C/EBP family.</s><s>C/EBPβ plays a central role in cell differentiation and cell lineage definition, as well as in inflammation control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>C/EBPβ has been implied to play a pro-oncogenic role in several other types of cancer, including mammary, skin, intestinal, and bladder cancer, as well as in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and lymphoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Although C/EBPβ has not been reported as

target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>In gastric cancer, it is possible that C/EBPβ activation represents an upstream event with broader implications to tumorigenesis, of which TFF1 down-regulation and COX2 overexpression are hallmarks.</s><s>Thus, a deeper insight into the role of C/EBPβ in normal and oncogenic stomach biology may help unraveling novel molecular candidates in gastric cancer development.</s></p><p><s>Here, we examined the functions of C/EBPβ in the murine stomach.</s><s>Our results show that C/EBPβ controls the balance between proliferation and differentiation in the murine stomach.</s><s>Cross-species analysis of gene expression between mouse C/EBPβ KO stomachs and human gastric cancer identified a C/EBPβ regulated gene signature in a subgroup of intestinal-type tumors.</s><s>Within this signature, repression of RUNX1t1 stood out as a potential tumor suppressor event.</s><s>Ectopic expression of RUNX1t1 reduced proliferation in gastric cancer cell lines and counteracted the repression of TFF1 by C/EBPβ.</s><s>The RUNX1t1 promoter was found to be frequently hypermethylated in human gastric cancer cases.</s><s>Our data suggest C/EBPβ activation and RUNX1t1 silencing as important events in the process of gastric carcinogenesis and suggests cross-regulation of C/EBPβ, TFF1, and
