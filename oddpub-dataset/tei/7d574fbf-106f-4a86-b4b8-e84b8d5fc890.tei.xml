<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>This study was part of a 3-y multisite prospective study aimed at developing and validating a caries risk tool for medical health care settings.</s><s>Child-primary caregiver (PCG) pairs (N = 1,325), stratified by Medicaid status and representing diverse racial/ethnic groups, were recruited primarily through 3 medical research networks: the Pediatric Research Network in Indianapolis, Indiana (IN); the Iowa Research Network in Iowa City, Iowa (IA); and Duke University's Primary Care Research Consortium in Durham, North Carolina (NC).</s><s>The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan) managed and coordinated the project.</s><s>Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at all 4 institutions.</s><s>This report conforms to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for cohort studies.</s></p><p><s>Each child was paired with his or her PCG.</s><s>"PCG" was defined as the individual consistently responsible for the child's housing, health, and safety and, for consenting purposes, was limited to those PCGs who were also the parent or legal guardian.</s><s>Inclusion criteria included the PCG being at least 18 y old or an emancipated minor, the child being 12 ± 3 mo old and generally healthy, provision of written informed consent by the PCG and for participation of the child, completion of the risk questionnaire by the PCG and a dental examination by the child, and availability for 2 follow-up study visits and multiple intermediate contacts between examination visits.</s><s>Exclusion criteria included children who were in foster care, needed antibiotic and/or sedative premedication prior to a dental examination, had uncontrolled epilepsy, had active cancer treatment, or had an unrepaired congenital heart defect.</s><s>Also, PCGs were excluded if they could not read or speak in English or Spanish.</s></p><p><s>For this study, PCGs completed a self-administered 52-item caries risk questionnaire at baseline (child, 1 y ± 3 mo of age).</s><s>The questionnaire was developed from a conceptual framework that considered dental caries a chronic disease process, with determinants both social (e.g., socioeconomic status) and biological (e.g., bacteria, diet, environment/oral hygiene), including risk indicators (e.g., caries experience), risk factors (e.g., dietary behaviors), protective factors (e.g., preventive treatments received), and social mediators associated with the child and the PCG <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fontana 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Sections of the questionnaire associated with caries experience and oral hygiene of teeth (including F in office: prescription of F supplements and/or application of varnish in health care settings) were completed only if the child had teeth (1,227 of the 1,325 enrolled child-PCG pairs).</s><s>The questionnaire included the following 2 questions about F in office: Baseline responses regarding children's history of F prescribed or applied by a health care provider were tested for association with each of the other baseline questionnaire items via logistic regression with F prescribed or applied as the outcome.</s><s>Baseline F prescribed or applied was then tested for association with the child's caries experience at ages 2.5 and 4 y (separately) via logistic regression with presence of caries as the outcome (defined as a cavitated lesion: ICDAS ≥3 or filling) and with receipt of FV and/or drops/tablets as the independent variable.</s><s>As the number of children receiving F drops/ tablets was small, the analyses were focused on children who received FV or either FV or F drops/tablets.</s><s>Analyses combining the 3 study sites used a generalized estimating equation model including study site as a cluster effect.</s><s>Because of different reimbursement policies for FV in each state (IN, IA, NC), analyses of questionnaire responses were also performed by study site.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>When fluoridated water is not available, prescription of dietary F supplements (e.g., drops or tablets) by a health care provider can be considered for children at high risk for dental caries <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rozier et al. 2010</ref>), because their use has been associated with a reduction in caries incidence, primarily in permanent teeth, although the evidence is not as compelling for deciduous teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Tubert-Jeannin et al. 2011</ref>).</s><s>However, to avoid development of dental fluorosis, testing the water is important prior to prescribing supplements.</s><s>However, FV is becoming the standard for F applications in health care settings because of its ease of application, safety, and significant body of clinical evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Marinho et al. 2013)</ref>, suggesting a substantial caries-inhibiting effect in permanent and primary teeth (caries-preventive fractions of 43% and 37%, respectively).</s></p><p><s>In support of the suggested preference for recommendation of FV, our data show that the majority (93%) of children by age 1 who received F in office received FV, with only 9% receiving drops/tablets.</s><s>Yet, only 26% of children with teeth at age 1 y in our study had received F in office from a health care provider.</s><s>The US Preventive Services Task Force's published guidelines recommend that physicians regularly apply FV on the primary   teeth of all children from initial tooth eruption to age 5 y <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moyer 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The American Academy of <ref type="bibr">Pediatrics (2008</ref><ref type="bibr">Pediatrics ( , 2014) )</ref> also recommends that FV be regularly applied in the primary care setting every 3 to 6 mo starting at tooth emergence.</s><s>Yet these recommendations contrast with some organizations, such as the American Dental Association, advocating that FV use be based on children's caries risk <ref type="bibr">(Weyant et al. 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is likely that, to be cost-effective-given the large disparities in caries experience early in life, as shown in our study-preventive services and anticipatory guidance in the toddler years need to be targeted per the risk of the child <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fontana 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Milgrom and Cunha-Cruz 2017)</ref>.</s><s>However, the US Preventive Services Task Force's decision was based in part on the fact that, although several caries risk assessment tools exist, none have been validated for use among US children <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Tellez et al. 2013)</ref> or for use in the primary care setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chou et al. 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chou et al. , 2014))</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A 2014 study assessing pediatricians' oral health attitudes and practices concluded that most respondents supported providing oral health activities in medical offices, but fewer now (vs.</s><s>2008) reported engaging in these activities with all patients.</s></p><p><s>Significantly more respondents agreed that they should apply <ref type="bibr">FV (19% in 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">FV (19% in vs. 41% in 2012))</ref>, but only 7% reported doing so with &gt;75% of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Quiñonez et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The findings from our study support these reports and show that the majority of children by age 1 y in the 3 study sites (IN, IA, and NC) had not received F in office.</s><s>However, children in our study who did receive F in office were significantly (P &lt; .001)</s><s>more likely to develop cavitated caries lesions by ages 2.5 and 4 y.</s><s>We hypothesized that receipt of F in office might be a consequence of a perceived increased caries risk and that risk factors or mediators could be alerting health care providers and/or parents, thus affecting the F recommendations.</s></p><p><s>Our data demonstrated that several of the caries risk questionnaire variables were associated with the receipt of these F modalities: factors related to low socioeconomic status (e.g., being Medicaid enrolled), etiologic factors related to cariogenic behaviors by the child (e.g., having frequent exposures to cariogenic drinks and snacks), and factors associated with a higher caries risk of the PCG (e.g., having had recent caries experience, having frequent exposure to cariogenic drinks and snacks).</s><s>This relationship between positive caries-preventive  behaviors and increased risk is not uncommon.</s><s>For example, in a recent study in Singapore, although higher frequencies of dental visits and toothbrushing were associated with lower plaque accumulation, they were also associated with increased caries risk in young children, suggesting that these caries risk factors could be a consequence rather than the cause of caries (Un <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lam et al. 2017</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Although evidence is weak for preventive care early in life that reduces dental caries experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beil et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bhaskar et al. 2014)</ref>, some data suggest that increased frequency of preventive care through medical settings can result in reduced caries experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kranz et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>In fact, limited data suggest that the setting/provider type does not influence the effectiveness of preventive services on children's caries experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kranz et al. 2014)</ref>, but more work is needed to link medical and dental offices to ensure continuity of dental care and sufficient exposure to F based on caries risk.</s><s>In our study, having frequent dental visits was associated with increased receipt of FV, as expected if the dental provider determined the child to be at risk for caries; yet, the majority of children in this study had not visited a dentist by age 1.</s><s>In contrast, a recent study based on insurance claims data in Alabama concluded that there was no evidence that preventive care before age 2 y reduces caries-related treatment visits regardless of provider, leading the authors to suggest that the current participation of primary care providers in caries prevention early in life has limited effects on caries-related treatments, while dentistdelivered care increases caries-related treatments and expenditures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blackburn et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s>However, as mentioned, it has been argued that to be cost-effective, preventive services need to targeted to the caries risk of the child <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fontana 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Milgrom and Cunha-Cruz 2017)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, evidence-based tools to facilitate risk-based anticipatory guidance, screening, and FV application could be important to enhance risk-based adoption and efficacy of preventive strategies for children at risk.</s></p><p><s>In fact, findings of our study suggest that health care providers might already be recommending F in office based on the presence of caries risk factors, as these young children did not have significant caries lesion development by age 1 y.</s><s>The association of the use of these F modalities with caries experience at ages 2.5 and 4 y could also suggest that the actual F exposure might be insufficient based on the child's caries risk level.</s><s>Our study did not obtain data on the frequency of FV application; therefore, there could have been only 1 application, thereby limiting the beneficial effect of FV <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Weintraub and Hysan 2003)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Weintraub et al. (2006)</ref> demonstrated a doseresponse effect of &gt;1 FV application in combination with oral health counseling.</s><s>In addition, the data that we obtained were self-reported from the PCG, which is a limitation to consider.</s><s>Furthermore, it is plausible that there was poor compliance with children actually taking the F supplements or using toothpaste on a daily basis and hence limited benefit from these F sources, although this was not assessed in the current study.</s><s>In a survey of &gt;200 parents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Flood et al. (2017)</ref> found that adherence to dietary F supplementation in the primary care setting was low and that the greatest barrier to compliance was parental difficulty in remembering to give F daily.</s></p><p><s>Observed differences among states in our study could be related to state-specific FV reimbursement policies.</s><s>The NC Medicaid Program has been reimbursing physicians for oral health screenings and FV applications since January 2000 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Pahel et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Through the I-Smile program, IA started reimbursing medical providers in 2001.</s><s>IN was one of last states to reimburse physicians for oral health screenings and FV application, starting January 2017.</s><s>Consequently, IN had not instituted a physician-based FV program at the time of this study, which is consistent with the minimal use of F in office seen in IN in our study.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, although the majority of children with teeth in this study did not receive F in office by age 1 y, increased F from a health care provider was associated with an increased risk for caries and with the presence of caries risk factors.</s><s>Also, the majority of children had never been to the dentist, which suggests that risk factors could be alerting medical providers and/or parents and thus affecting these F recommendations.</s></p><p><s>Differences among states at the time of this study could also be related to state-specific F reimbursement policies associated with the participation of medical providers in interprofessional caries management efforts.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Table 1
