<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Since the discovery by Yamanaka and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> in the year 2006, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are considered similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with respect to pluripotency and quality.</s><s>iPSCs are a promising ESCs alternative with similar differentiation potential, especially as a model to elucidate intractable disease mechanisms using original human cells of a patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>These cells can differentiate into the three fundamental germ layers and thus give the researcher a great opportunity to develop over 200 human cell types in a dish for studying cellular processes, development of a tissue as well as underlying disease mechanisms, especially e.g.</s><s>neurodegenerative or monogenic disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, they could be used to replace disease-damaged cells and to investigate toxicological effects of drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Unlike ESCs, development of iPSCs does not require any damage of embryos, but uses e.g.</s><s>easy accessible skin cells like fibroblast cells.</s><s>Another important advantage is that they can be generated directly from the patient's own cells, thereby circumventing the risk of rejection in case of cell replacement in patients and creating an effective treatment of each individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is noteworthy that the undifferentiated iPSCs like ESCs have the propensity to develop into non-invasive tumours after transplantation in mice due to their unlimited proliferative potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>These tumours exhibit histologically disordered structures of all three germ layers.</s><s>Recently it has been reported that ESCs can be transformed after a long period in culture and are able to form aggressive tumors, so called teratocarcinomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>As iPSCs behave similar to ESCs, it should be assumed that they possess the same propensity.</s><s>Therefore, elucidating the poorly studied cell survival signalling pathways and death signalling pathways (e.g.</s><s>apoptosis) in iPSCs is an urgent need which will provide new insight in their biological behaviour and allows us to generate an optimal autologous stem cell-replacement therapy without tumour formation.</s></p><p><s>Apoptosis failure due to multiple mutations promotes tumour development, whereas an uncontrolled excess of apoptosis is responsible for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Proapoptotic signalling pathways possess far-reaching consequences for the fate of individual cells and are counter-regulated at multiple levels.</s><s>The affected tissue is therefore well protected.</s><s>Apoptosis can be triggered by the occurrence of proapoptotic and loss of antiapoptotic signals.</s><s>Biological homeostasis and physiological functions in the tissue are based on the balance of these two regulatory limbs.</s><s>The proteins of the Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma oncogene 2) family are important decisive regulators of apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>For many cellular systems, it is assumed that the molar ratio between proapoptotic (BAX, BAK, BCL-X S , BAD, PUMA, and others) and anti apoptotic (BCL-2, Bcl-X L , MCL-1, A1, etc.) members of the Bcl-2 family can decide on the susceptibility to apoptotic signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to these, caspases, a family of cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteases, are central mediators of apoptotic and inflammatory processes.</s><s>They conduct death signals and are capable to cleave a number of proteins known as death substrates to enhance the apoptotic signals and to complete the apoptotic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Surprisingly both, the apoptotic initiator caspase-8 and the effector caspase-3 are essential for iPSC reprogramming <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The cell survival signaling PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway plays a crucial role for mitogenesis, proliferation, prevention of apoptosis, maintenance of multipotency in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pluripotency in ESCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>It can be activated exogenously by growth factors and cytokines and endogenously by the constitutively active Ras protein.</s><s>Both apoptosis and survival of cells can be controlled by proteins such as AKT/PKB (protein kinase B) involved in the PI3K pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Phosphorylated AKT enhances survival and inhibits apoptosis by phosphorylation and inactivation of several target proteins including the proapoptotic BAD and the tumour suppressor p53, a regulator of bcl-2 and bax genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, several studies have recently reported that the AKT/PKB signaling pathway is involved in cell survival in various cancers such as colon carcinoma, glioma, melanoma, breast and liver carcinoma due to the abnormal activation of the downstream gene AKT <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Several sudies demonstrated that the PI3K signalling pathway is essential and crucial for proliferation, survival and maintance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To date the role of the PI3K-AKT signalling pathway and its cellular response in human iPSCs have been poorly defined.</s><s>Known is, however, that PI3K-AKT signalling is involved in early steps of the reprogramming process in order to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>PI3K signalling parallel to upregulation of glycolytic gene expression during reprogramming processes shows in particular that AKT activates two key glycolytic regulators, AS1060 and PFKB2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Another study reported that PS48, an activator of PI3K-AKT, is able to enhance reprogramming by upregulating glycolytic genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Also in this context, Chen et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> demonstrated an enhancement of somatic reprogramming in mice by application of LY294002, another PI3K inhibitor.</s><s>Therefore, understanding of PI3K-AKT signalling in iPS cells, especially regarding their similarity to cancer cells, is of great importance.</s></p><p><s>In this study we used the small molecule PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 to investigate the molecular consequences of this prominent target signalling pathway in three different iPSC lines which were derived from skin fibroblasts of an Alzheimer patient, from normal human fibroblasts and from human foreskin fibroblasts, respectively.</s><s>The three iPS cell lines used in this study were generated by three different reprogramming approaches.</s><s>Additionally, we controlled four other relevant pathways using three small molecule inhibitors and one apoptosis inducer.</s><s>All of these pathways are dysregulated in cancer due to mutations of the genes involved.</s><s>The Pan-RAF inhibitor L-779,450 which suppresses cell proliferation in melanoma cell lines both with mutated B-Raf and with wild-type B-Raf <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, BMS-345541, an IKK-2 inhibitor that addresses the NF-kappaB pathway and has antiinflammatory properties and Aurora kinase an inhibitor MLN-8237 (AKA-I), which inhibits a member of the novel family of Aurora serine/threonine kinases crucial for cell cycle control <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>As apoptosis inducer we used Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) which is important for the immune system.</s><s>TRAIL belongs to the TNF / TNFR (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor) superfamily.</s><s>Its mission is to inactivate target cells by the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, but most cancer cells are resistant to this agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore we tested the p53 pathway using pifithrinalpha (PFT-alpha), a pharmacological inhibitor of p53 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences regarding the apoptotic behaviour on the cellular and molecular level between generated iPSCs, parental fibroblast cells and iPS derived neurons after treatment with different inhibitors of crucial signalling pathways involved in cancer.</s><s>Overall, striking differences could be shown in the reaction of the iPS cell lines to small molecules versus the original skin fibroblasts they were derived from or versus terminally differentiated neurons derived form these iPSCs.</s></p></div>

apoptotic response by wortmannin using PFT-alpha in all iPSCs, but we could not detect any inhibiton of apoptosis.</s><s>Wortmannin did not change the ratio of the pro-and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members BAX, BAK to BCL-2, BCL-X L in AD-iPSCs, which remained at its high level.</s><s>Several reports demonstrated that the ratio of proapoptotic to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins determines cell fate in cancer cells, whether cells can stay alive or die after treatment with apoptotic stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>.</s><s>Based on our findings and other studies, we have hypothesized that the iPSCs should be sensitive to TRAIL treatment, but we did not detect apoptosis on a morphological or biochemical level.</s><s>Probably the TRAIL-induced apoptosis signaling pathway is not sufficiently developed in our iPSCs and they could behave like tumor cells with resistance to apoptosis.</s><s>It would be interesting to check further anti-apoptotic proteins such as inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and others.</s><s>Further protein analysis revealed that after short incubation times with wortmannin phosphorylated AKT began to decrease with increasing time in AD-iPSCs, underlined by consistent AKT expression.</s><s>Phosphorylation of AKT provides survival and blocking of apoptosis.</s><s>Interestingly, AD-iPSCderived neurons behaved similarly (on a higher initial level), but after 24 hours P-AKT increased again and we observed no relevant apoptosis induction after treatment with wortmannin.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our results indicate the importance of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and of caspase-3 activity in our AD-iPSCs derived from skin fibroblasts, concerning survival and apoptosis.</s><s>As far as we know, we were the first to efficiently reduce basal cell death using QVDoph, to avoid spontaneous differentiation over two weeks and to highlight the role of the PI3K pathway for (AD-derived) iPSCs.</s><s>The specificity of action could also be shown with low levels of wortmannin.</s><s>Different responses and expression levels of the three cell types, the original cells, AD-iPSCs and AD-iPSC-derived neuronal cells suggest changes in the epigenetic background.</s><s>Regarding iPSC-based therapies with the risk of tumour development, apoptotic elimination of remaining undifferentiated iPSCs using wortmannin could be a suitable solution for tumour prevention.</s><s>Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate the apoptotic effect of wortmannin in vivo after injection of iPSCs in mice.</s><s>Interestingly, the Alzheimer and Alzheimer-free iPSC lines showed no differences in apoptotic behaviour mediated by wortmannin treatment.</s><s>Since the iPSCs research is growing rapidly and gets enormous importance for the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis and on the other side valuable insight for stem cellbased therapy, we hope that these findings are helpful for understanding the mechanisms of survival and apoptosis.</s></p></div>
