Hoge, 1990)</ref>.</s><s>This model argues that treatment can be effective in reducing reoffending rates if it is matched to the characteristics of individual offenders.</s><s>The model specifies who should be treated <ref type="bibr">(high-risk offenders)</ref>, what should be treated (criminogenic needs; factors that were shown related to future reoffending), and gives direction to how offenders should be treated (in line with, for example, their motivation, intelligence, and learning style; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Andrews &amp;

Harrison, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>For example, a national study conducted in the United States has found that only 34.2% of correctional agencies use a standardized risk assessment instrument to place offenders in substance abuse treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Taxman et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Second, risk assessment is often conducted using unstandardized, nonvalidated, poorly designed, and/or outdated instruments (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Matthews, Hubbard, &amp; Latessa, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Latessa et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Taxman &amp; Marlowe, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>And third, if standardized and validated risk assessment instruments (such as a fourth generation tool; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Andrews et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Andrews et al., , 2006) )</ref> are used, outcomes are frequently ignored <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Latessa et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Taxman &amp; Bouffard, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>Taken all into consideration, some scholars have proclaimed a one-size-fitsall approach to referring offenders to services <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Taxman &amp; Marlowe, 2006)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This supposed one-size-fits-all approach, which goes against existing policies based on knowledge on effectiveness as demonstrated by previous research, is not unique for correctional rehabilitation programming.</s><s>In fact, policies are often not being performed in practice, as they were designed, caused by the actions of public service employees in many (governmental) organizations; a phenomenon often referred to as street-level bureaucracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lipsky, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>This study aims to address if this is also the case in a prisonbased rehabilitation program applied in the Netherlands.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prison-Based Rehabilitation in the Netherlands</head><p><s>In the Netherlands, rehabilitation efforts were embedded within the Prevention of Recidivism program: a prison-based rehabilitation program designed for detainees with a prison sentence of at least 4 months, implemented nationwide in 2007.</s><s>In line with the RNR model, the Prevention of Recidivism program aims to reduce reoffending rates among participants by focusing on two focal points: (a) assessing risk for recidivism and criminogenic needs by use of a standardized, validated risk assessment instrument, and (b) applying criminogenic need-specific treatment programs in line with risk assessment outcomes ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Van der Linden, 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To attain the first objective, assessment of risk for reoffending and criminogenic needs, the Dutch-language Recidivism Assessment Scales (RISc) was developed, an instrument based on and highly comparable to the British Offender Assessment System (OASys; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Howard, Clark, &amp; Garnham, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>).</s><s>Studies have demonstrated the intraclass reliability, internal consistency, and predictive validity of the RISc to be satisfactory (Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Knaap, Leenarts, Born, &amp; Oosterveld, 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In light of the second objective, criminogenic need-specific treatment modules were developed and implemented.</s><s>To ensure program quality, implemented programs had to be accredited by an accreditation committee However, research has shown that these were only applied sparsely <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bosma, Kunst, &amp; Nieuwbeerta, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Program manuals prescribe that risk assessment outcomes determine qualification for each correctional program.</s><s>For example, a moderate to high overall risk to reoffend (evidenced by a risk assessment score of at least 32) and cognitive deficits (evidenced by a weighted score on the risk assessment scale, thinking and behavior, of at least 4) qualifies an offender for cognitive skills training (Ministry of Justice, 2007), while substance-and or gambling-abuse problems (evidenced by a score on the risk assessment scales, drug misuse, of at least 3, and/or alcohol misuse of at least 2, and or financial management and income of at least 5, with a minimal score of 2 on Item 5.4) qualifies an offender for lifestyle training <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(SVG Verslavingsreclassering, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>If an offender has no criminogenic needs, offenders can enter the Prevention of Recidivism program without having to engage in specific treatment modules.</s></p><p><s>Although the guidelines for treatment referrals may be clear, in practice, such guidelines are not always carried out as prescribed.</s><s>This was exemplified by previous studies, indicating that risk assessment instruments aren't always used to allocate offenders to treatment (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Latessa et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>If risk assessment instruments were leading to refer offenders to trratment in the Netherlands, was assessed by the current study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Considerations</head><p><s>Several factors can contribute to policies not being performed in practice, as they were prescribed.</s><s>In Street-level Bureaucracy: Dilemmas of Individuals in Public Services, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lipsky (1980)</ref> sets forth a bottom-up approach to understanding public policy implementation by arguing that a successful implementation of public policy is not solely determined by the quality of policy measures, but instead is for a large part dependent on the actions of those who carry out government policy, so-called frontline workers, or street-level bureaucrats.</s><s>To understand how street-level bureaucrats have such a large influence on policy implementation, there are five characteristics that need mentioning (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Maynard-Moody &amp; Portillo, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>First, street-level bureaucrats are public service employees who are de facto frontline workers, meaning that they often function at the bottom of the organizational hierarchy <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lipsky, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>Traditional examples of frontline workers are teachers and social workers.</s><s>Other officials such as correctional officers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Guy, Newman, &amp; Mastracci, 2008)</ref> can, however, also be considered street-level bureaucrats.</s><s>Second, street-level bureaucrats often interact directly (face-to-face) with clients and citizens <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lipsky, 1980)</ref>.</s><s>In many cases, these individuals are nonvoluntary clients (such as a citizen stopped by a police officer), who did not choose the service of the specific governmental agency and cannot seek alternative services elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Maynard-Moody &amp; Portillo, 2010)</ref>.</s><s>A third keycomponent of frontline workers relates to the fact that, although their work can be considered highly scripted, public service employees are allowed to vary in the extent to which they impose the rules and laws assigned to them.</s><s>This discretion, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lipsky (1980)</ref>, is a result of the complex decisions that street-level bureaucrats have to make in which they have to interpret and apply general policies in specific situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lipsky, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Lipsky, , 2010))</ref>; Fourth, related to this discretion, they also have considerable autonomy in making decisions, and often their activities are unsupervised.</s><s>For example, a teacher is almost always alone in a classroom, with little to no direct management supervision.</s><s>A fifth and final key characteristic of frontline workers is that, on paper, they are never considered part of the policy process, when in fact they are perhaps the ultimate policy makers <ref type="bibr">(Weatherly, 1979)</ref>; they are the final policy makers, and perhaps have the greatest influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Maynard-Moody &amp; Portillo, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The work of street-level bureaucrats can be difficult and demanding; they often have to deal with working under great time pressure, with limited resources, and have to cope with expectations from both clients and their employer.</s><s>To be able to do their job as efficiently as possible, it is argued that public service employees develop coping strategies.</s><s>In coping, a frontline worker basically accepts work pressure as a given and tries to make the best of it <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lipsky, 1980)</ref>, usually by trying to decrease demands for services.</s><s>Scholars have distinguished various types of coping strategies such as making standardized or routine decisions for groups of clients (routinizing; which is often based on stereotypes), redefining tasks and priorities in which priority is given to decisions that involve easier and manageable clients and cases (creaming); a frontline worker may also try to make services less attractive for clients (rationing), for example, by creating longer waiting times <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ellis, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Lehmann Nielsen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lipsky, 1980</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lipsky, , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Tummers, Bekkers, Vink, &amp; Musheno, 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Coping frequently results in deviating from prescribed standards, biases the implementation of public policy, and often negatively influences policy goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Winter, 2002)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Lipsky (1980, p. xvii)</ref> refers to this phenomenon as "a gap between policy as written, and policy as performed."</s><s>As put in Lipsky's words, ". . . the decisions of street-level bureaucrats, the routines they establish, and the devices they invent to cope with uncertainties and work pressure, effectively become the public policies they carry out."</s><s><ref type="bibr">(Lipsky, 1980, p. xii)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although perhaps never before considered as such, prison staff members who make decisions about the allocation of offenders to treatment can be deemed to function as street-level bureaucrats.</s><s>That is to say, prison employees who make these decisions (a) are operational staff members, (b) are in direct contact with prisoners (a nonvoluntary client), (c) make the decisions with a considerable amount of discretion, and (d) have relative autonomy; consequently, they can be considered (e) the ultimate (as final) policy makers in Dutch prison-based treatment implementation.</s></p><p><s>As prison staff members who decide upon the referral of offenders to treatment are considered street-level bureaucrats, they are expected to act accordingly.</s><s>First, it is therefore expected that prison staff members apply considerable discretion when making treatment referral decisions, resulting in treatment referrals not (fully) in line with risk and need assessment outcomes.</s><s>This may result in limited access to care for a (perhaps selective) group of offenders.</s><s>Second, based on street-level bureaucracy theory, it is hypothesized that prison staff members, caused by (a) a gap between resources and demands and (b) as a result of a number of coping mechanisms, do not always allocate offenders to appropriate treatment programs (i.e., treatment based on their risk and need assessment scores).</s><s>Instead, as theory predicts, prison staff members are expected to resort to standardized referrals of offenders to programs, with priority given to either the most manageable offenders who are expected to remain and actively engage in treatment, or to those who are considered to be most in need of treatment, and for whom the best outcomes are expected.</s><s>As at the moment of making treatment referral decisions prison staff members do not have access to in-depth information regarding, for example, an offender's criminal history, or court documentation on every aspect of their current offense <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Inspectorate of Security and Justice, 2010)</ref>, they typically have to rely on risk assessment outcomes to assess an offender's condition.</s><s>To make attributions on who should (or should not) be referred to treatment, prison staff members are expected to rely on the broad range of risk assessment outcomes, as assessed by the Recidivism Assessment Scales (scores regarding the following domains: offending history; current offense and pattern of offenses; accommodation; education, work, and training; financial management and income; relationships with partner and relatives; relationships with friends and other acquaintances; drug misuse; alcohol misuse; emotional well-being; thinking and behavior; and attitudes/orientation), with a more serious (or severe) risk and need assessment outcomes leading to either less or more treatment referrals.</s><s>In addition, in line with street-level bureaucracy theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lipsky, 1980)</ref>, nonconformity with prescribed policies is expected to increase if there is a larger gap between the earlier mentioned resources and demands.</s><s>Therefore, it is expected that certain organizational circumstances influence treatment referral decision-making processes.</s><s>First, concerning the expected sentence length, it is hypothesized that a longer prison sentence will make it easier to get an offender enrolled in treatment.</s><s>As research has shown that turnaround times for treatment programs can be extensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Inspectorate of Security and Justice, 2010)</ref>, it may be expected that a long expected sentence leads to an increase in treatment referrals.</s><s>Second, it may be hypothesized that overcrowding and staff shortages will serve as an organizational constraint, limiting time and recourses to be spent on an individual detainee, thereby negatively influencing treatment referrals.</s><s>It may therefore be expected that prison crowding-the number of detainees imprisoned versus the maximum prison occupation-as well as staff detainee ratios-the number of detainees versus the number of rehabilitation staff members-will influence treatment referrals.</s><s>Finally, not every treatment program is on offer in every prison, so sometimes, referring an offender to a treatment program means the offender has to be relocated to another prison.</s><s>It could be the case that this will be viewed as a disadvantage, decreasing the number of treatment referrals.</s><s>Consequently, it may be hypothesized that treatment availability will positively influence treatment referrals.</s></p><p><s>In summary, based on street-level bureaucracy theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Lipsky, 1980)</ref>, it is hypothesized that (a) prison staff members deviate from prescribed policies in referring offenders to treatment programs.</s><s>In doing so, it is expected that (b) they are influenced by offenders' risk and need assessment outcomes and a set of relevant organizational circumstances.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Previous Studies</head><p><s>Street-level bureaucracy theory was subjected to an immense body of empirical studies, which have found substantial empirical evidence for its applicability (for a summary, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brodkin, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Maynard-Moody &amp;

Hill, 2016)</ref>, can make policies much more meaningful to clients, and can make a street-level bureaucrat more willing to implement a policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Tummers &amp; Bekkers, 2014)</ref>, and can, however, also lead to unwanted consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gulland, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Lindhorst &amp;
