vessels, and platelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bedi and Arora 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Edmondson and Cohen 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, exaggerated catecholamine release in response to stressful circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Otte, Neylan et al. 2005</ref>) leading to higher concentrations of circulating catecholamines may also contribute to autonomic imbalance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Edmondson and Cohen 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Apart from PTSD, major depression is also an independent risk factor for CVD and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Whooley and Wong 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, major depression is often comorbid with PTSD and has also been associated with altered catecholamine function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gold and Chrousos 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Otte, Neylan et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Goddard, Ball et al. 2010</ref>).</s><s>In our study, the association between PTSD and norepinephrine remained stable after controlling for depressive symptoms.</s><s>Thus, increased norepinephrine seems to be characteristic of PTSD and not merely an artifact of comorbid depression.</s><s>However, it remains unclear whether elevated norepinephrine is a consequence of PTSD or a pre-existing risk factor.</s><s>High norepinephrine levels likely contribute to PTSD symptomatology at different stages: at the time of trauma high norepinephrine might facilitate memory consolidation and fear conditioning (van Stegeren 2008), while later high catecholamine activity might be associated with symptoms of hyperarousal and consequent development of CVD.</s></p><p><s>With regard to cortisol secretion, lower cortisol output has been proposed in patients with PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Yehuda and Seckl 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Morris, Compas et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>However, the literature is far from being consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Meewisse, Reitsma et al. 2007</ref>).</s><s>In our sample, we did not find lower cortisol in patients with current PTSD.</s><s>The picture seems to be more complicated: participants with lifetime PTSD had the lowest cortisol levels, which differed significantly from those who had never PTSD, whereas participants with current PTSD diagnosis had cortisol level between the two other groups.</s><s>Again, depressive symptoms, which have been found to be associated with higher cortisol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Parker, Schatzberg et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pariante and Lightman 2008)</ref>, did not influence the results.</s><s>Interestingly, it has been proposed that lower basal cortisol might be a pre-existing risk factor for developing PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Zoladz and Diamond 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, individuals with lower cortisol levels immediately after trauma have been found to have a greater risk for later developing PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Yehuda, McFarlane et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Delahanty, Raimonde et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ehring, Ehlers et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McFarlane, Barton et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The time course of cortisol release during treatment of PTSD has not been investigated extensively.</s><s>Two case studies suggested that symptom improvement is accompanied by a normalization of HPA axis functioning in PTSD, e.g.</s><s>basal cortisol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Heber, Kellner et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kellner, Yehuda et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it has been shown that responders to psychotherapy demonstrate an increase in cortisol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Olff, de Vries et al. 2007</ref>).</s><s>Again, only very small samples have been investigated and prior studies have not included control groups without PTSD.</s><s>Furthermore, it is still unclear whether HPA axis dysregulations are related to PTSD diagnosis or to trauma exposure per se, as suggested by some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Seedat, Stein et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">de Kloet, Vermetten et al. 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Our results, though cross-sectional, support the hypothesis that low cortisol levels might be a risk factor for developing PTSD in response to trauma, as both groups of patients, those with current and those with lifetime PTSD, exhibited lower cortisol levels than participants that never had PTSD.</s><s>However, alternative explanations cannot be ruled out.</s><s>For example, it is possible that lower cortisol results from chronic enhanced negative feedback and glucocorticoid receptor hypersensitivity that has been shown to develop after childhood trauma and (later) PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yehuda 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McGowan, Sasaki et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wingenfeld and Wolf 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">van Zuiden, Kavelaars et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, patients with current PTSD might have experienced more stress during the assessments, which might contribute to the higher cortisol levels in comparison to the lifetime PTSD group.</s></p><p><s>Our study had two major strengths: the large sample size and measurement of catecholamines and cortisol as an integrated measure over 24 hours within the same participants.</s><s>For example, a recent meta-analysis of daily cortisol output yielded only 262 traumatized and 320 non-traumatized controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Morris, Compas et al. 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, we were able to control for potential confounding variables, including age, sex, medication use, and perhaps most importantly depressive symptoms.</s></p><p><s>However, several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings.</s><s>More than 90% of our participants are men and the mean age was over 50 years.</s><s>Therefore, it is not known whether our results are applicable to women and younger populations as well.</s><s>An additional "healthy" control group was not recruited, which might be a limitation.</s><s>However, it might also be a strength of the study to examine a "real-world" sample of medical outpatients who did not differ markedly in terms of the measured health parameters, which could help isolate the effects of PTSD status.</s><s>The use of an above-average healthy control sample with no physical or somatic health problems might have lead to an overestimation of assumed PTSD effects.</s><s>Furthermore, we did not have information about the duration of current PTSD and the time between prior PTSD and remission in the lifetime PTSD group.</s><s>In addition, though PTSD and several comorbidities were assessed with structured clinical interviews, some important conditions, such as substance abuse, were measured with selfreport questionnaires.</s><s>Finally, it would be informative to investigate not only basal cortisol and catecholamine release but also the acute reactivity of the HPA axis and SNS to traumaand non-trauma related stressors.</s></p><p><s>In summary, our results support the hypothesis of a disturbed interplay of HPA axis and SNS activity in PTSD, demonstrated by lower cortisol and exaggerated norepinephrine release.</s><s>Prospective studies involving measures of HPA axis functionality, SNS activity, and cardiovascular health are needed to establish whether these alterations contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with PSTD.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic
