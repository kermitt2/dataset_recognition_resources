<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Under most conditions cortical pyramidal neurons are strongly biased to initiate action potentials in the distal part of the axon initial segment (AIS) rather than in the dendrites, where the excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude is largest.</s><s>This feature is widely attributed to the axonal presence of the lowthreshold Na + channel subtype Na v 1.6.</s><s>Here, using electrical and high-speed Na + imaging recordings from Na v 1.6 null pyramidal neurons, we demonstrate that the presence of this subunit is neither critical for positioning the spike initiation site within the AIS nor for the spike backpropagation to the dendrites.</s><s>We also find that one of the most important features of axonal Na + channel kinetics, the lower activation threshold, is not entirely dependent on the Na + channel subtype.</s></p><p><s>including cortical pyramidal cells, using the well-established NEX-Cre knockin mouse line <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>While previous studies were based on somatic electrical recordings alone, in the present work we used a combination of electrical current-and voltage-clamp recordings with direct measurements of axonal Na + fluxes using high-speed fluorescence imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We found that the L5 pyramidal cell axons of the adult NEX cre/wt /Scn8a fl/fl mice [referred to hereafter as Na v 1.6 conditional knockout (cKO)] are deficient in Na v 1.6 channels, which apparently fail to replace the Na v 1.2 channels in a course of postnatal maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>Surprisingly, APs elicited in cortical pyramidal neurons from Na v 1.6-cKO mice had a rapid onset and biphasic upstroke, indicating that Na v 1.6 is not critically important for positioning the AP initiation site in the AIS.</s><s>Imaging experiments revealed that Na + fluxes in the AIS of L5 cortical pyramidal neurons associated with single or multiple APs were not significantly different in Na v 1.6-cKO and control animals.</s><s>Although the magnitude of the axonal persistent Na + current in Na v 1.6-cKO mice was reduced, its activation was still leftward shifted compared with the persistent current recorded in the soma, indicating that the axo-somatic difference in I NaP activation voltage is not solely dependent on the difference in Na + channel subtype.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Cell-specific conditional Scn8a knockout mice were generated by crossbreeding NEX-Cre (Neuro D6) mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> with floxed Scn8a mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</s><s>Since NEX promoter activity is largely restricted to the principal excitatory neurons of the forebrain <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, including L5 pyramidal neurons, Cre DNA recombinase expression and Scn8a gene inactivation in NEX cre/wt -Scn8a fl/fl animals is expected to be confined to this neuronal population.</s><s>Indeed, unlike mice with nonconditional Scn8a ablation, that do not live more than 3 wk (24), the homozygous cell-specific conditional knockout (Na v 1.6-cKO) mice had a normal life span and did not developed any obvious brain or behavioral abnormalities.</s></p><p><s>To characterize the subcellular distribution of Na + channel subtypes in L5 pyramidal neurons, cortical sections from 1-mo-old male control and Na v 1.6-cKO mice were stained with Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 antibodies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 A-D</ref>).</s><s>AISs were identified by costaining of the cytoskeletal protein, ankyrin-G (AnkG) that is present only in the AIS and in nodes of Ranvier of myelinated cortical fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s><s>Quantitative evaluation of the immunofluorescent signals revealed a complete loss of Na v 1.6 expression in the AISs of the Na v 1.6-cKO neurons.</s><s>Interestingly, this loss was compensated for by complementary expression of Na v 1.2 channels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 E and F</ref>).</s><s>This subunit exchange, however, did not affect the gross structural organization of the AIS as no differences in the pattern of AnkG expression could be detected in Na v 1.6-cKO and control neurons.</s><s>AIS length, measured by the immunofluorescent signal for AnkG, revealed no significant difference (29.6 ± 2.7 μm in control mice vs. 30.0</s><s>± 3.7 μm in cKO, P = 0.7237, Mann-Whitney U test, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>Measuring AIS length using the functionally more relevant Na v immunofluorescence, in both Na v 1.6-cKO and control neurons, produced highly variable results, because of low signal intensity at the distal AIS.</s></p><p><s>In young control mice (P25), most AnkG-positive AISs of L5 neurons (n = 423) contained only Na v 1.6 channels (91.3 ± 12.3%), whereas Na v 1.2 presence was detected in a few cells (14.4 ± 9.5%, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>).</s><s>In sections from brains of Na v 1.6-cKO mice, however, most of the analyzed AISs (n = 210) were Na v 1.2positive (83.7 ± 12.0%).</s><s>At this age, only 0.32 ± 0.45% of AISs expressed Na v 1.6.</s><s>In adult control mice [postnatal day 60 (P60)], 82.9 ± 13.0% of all AISs (n = 3385) were Na v 1.6-positive while only 1.8 ± 1.6% were positive for Na v 1.2.</s><s>In adult Na v 1.6-cKO mice, however, only 1.26 ± 0.8% of all AnkG-positive AISs (n = 3913) contained Na v 1.6, while the large majority of the AISs (61.9 ± 11.5%) contained Na v 1.2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1I</ref>).</s><s>We concluded that failure of up-regulation of Na v 1.6 expression during the maturation of L5 pyramidal cells results in retention of the juvenile channel subtype, Na v 1.2, in their axons.</s></p><p><s>Na v 1.6 Deficiency Has a Minor Effect on AIS Spike Initiation.</s><s>To characterize the functional consequences of the Na v 1.6 deficiency, whole-cell somatic current-clamp recordings were obtained from large L5 pyramidal neurons in coronal brain slices from 4-to 5-wkold Na v 1.6-cKO mice and control littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Since damage to the proximal axon during preparation of the tissue slice might significantly influence firing properties of pyramidal cells, we made sure that the axons were preserved by filling the cells with the fluorescent Na + indicator sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI) and directly visualizing the thin neuronal processes emerging from the cell body.</s><s>Axons were distinguished by their distinctive shape and by the magnitude of their spikeelicited Na + transients <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Data from cells in which the axons were cut at a distance of less than 150 μm from the soma were not included in the analysis.</s><s>The resting membrane potential and passive membrane characteristics of Na v 1.6-cKO neurons were not significantly different from those of controls (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>Current and voltage spike thresholds, however, were slightly elevated in the Na v 1.6-cKO neurons compared with controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>If the presence of low-threshold Na v 1.6 channels in distal AIS was indeed critical for AP initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>, loss of these channels would be expected to exert a significant change in the pattern of AP generation in response to orthodromic stimuli.</s><s>Therefore, we compared the phase plots of somatically recorded APs in L5 pyramidal neurons from Na v 1.6-cKO and control mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s><s>The phase plot of the upstroke of the somatic spike describes the rate of change of the membrane potential (dV m /dt) as a function of the instantaneous membrane potential (V m ).</s><s>It is typically biphasic, with the first phase generated predominately by the lateral current from the AIS, and the second phase generated by the local, somatic Na + channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32)</ref>.</s><s>Surprisingly, all features of the AP dynamics, including biphasic shape, rapid onset, voltage, and time dependence of the rate of rise were preserved in Na v 1.6-cKO mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the role of Na v 1.6 channels in creating conditions for AP initiation in the distal AIS seems not to be critical, as deletion of these channels is almost completely compensated for by the retained Na v 1.2 channels.</s></p><p><s>Pattern of AP-Associated AIS Na + Influx Is Not Altered by Na v 1.6</s></p><p><s>Deletion.</s><s>We considered the possibility that the somatic AP dynamics might be preserved in Na v 1.6-cKO neurons because of some compensatory change in AIS length or position relative to the cell body <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</s><s>Morphometric analysis of the AnkG immunosignal, however, revealed a difference in neither AIS position nor in its mean length (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>To characterize the Na + channel distribution and density in proximal axons more directly, neurons were filled with the Na + indicator SBFI.</s><s>We first focused on Na + signals elicited by single APs, as the peak amplitude of these signals should be almost unaffected by lateral diffusion and therefore can be used as a measure of local Na + entry <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s><s>Single APs elicited rapidly rising, fast-decaying Na + transients that were prominent only in the AIS and were poorly or not at all detectable in soma and dendrites <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Measurements of peak amplitude of the averaged ΔF/F transients over the 20 μm of distal AIS length revealed no significant difference between the two groups of neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, 0.50 ± 0.20%, n = 4, Na v 1.6-cKO neurons vs. 0.70 ± 0.14%, n = 4 control neurons, P &gt; 0.05).</s><s>Comparison of the axonal Na + transients elicited by trains of five APs, each evoked by a 2-ms-long current step, yielded qualitatively similar results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 B and C</ref>), with no significant difference in per spike Na + elevation between Na v 1.6-cKO and control neurons.</s><s>Trains of five spikes also elicited Na + elevations in the somata and proximal apical dendrites of Na v 1.6-cKO and control cells.</s><s>These transients, which were presumably generated by activation of the prevailing somato-dendritic channel subtype Na v 1.2 (6), were not affected by the Na v 1.6 deletion.</s></p><p><s>Since the comparison of ΔF/F proportional to spike evoked [Na + ] i elevations is based on the assumption that the axonal surface-to-volume ratio, tissue autofluorescence, and other parameters are unchanged, we also compared the axo-somatic ΔF ratios in Na v 1.6-cKO and control neurons.</s><s>Peak ΔF, a parameter that is roughly proportional to the Na + influx per unit of membrane area <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>, was measured in the soma and the AIS following trains of five APs evoked by brief current steps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>The axo-somatic ΔF ratio in the Na v 1.6-cKO neurons (1.91 ± 0.32, n = 10) was not significantly different from the ratio in control cells (2.65 ± 0.63, n = 9, P &gt; 0.05) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Na v 1.6 Deficiency Has a Minor Effect on Repetitive Spike Firing and Dendritic Backpropagation.</s><s>We next sought to determine whether the Na v 1.6 channel loss would affect the ability of L5 neurons to fire repetitively during prolonged depolarizing current pulses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>Under this stimulation protocol, most control and Na v 1.6-cKO neurons were identified as "regular-spiking" cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>In

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Na v 1.6, the dominant Na + channel subtype in the AIS of mature neocortical pyramidal cells, is widely believed to play an essential role in positioning the AP initiation site within the proximal axon.</s><s>Our evidence, however, demonstrates that the presence of this subunit is not critical.</s><s>We also find that one of the most important features of the behavior of axonal Na + channels, the leftward shift of their activation threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>, is not entirely dependent on the Na + channel subtype.</s><s>Instead, it probably reflects local protein-protein interactions.</s></p><p><s>In contrast with previous studies in rat and human cortex (6, 8), we found that the large majority of AISs of pyramidal neurons in adult control mice is Na v 1.2 immuno-negative, whereas the AISs of the adult Na v 1.6-cKO neurons are almost exclusively populated by this channel subtype.</s><s>The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear.</s><s>It may reflect the species or age difference or pathological alterations in human tissue samples.</s><s>Highly sensitive immunogold labeling (38) revealed low, but significant, densities of Na v 1.6 channels in soma and apical dendrites of control pyramidal neurons.</s><s>Uncompensated loss of these channels in Na v 1.6-cKO cells would be expected to reduce dendritic excitability.</s><s>Our evidence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) that Na v 1.6 deletion has no obvious effect on the fidelity of spike backpropagation indicates that the dendritic Na v 1.6 loss is compensated for by expression of  other Na + channel subtypes.</s><s>The exact molecular identity of the channels that substitute for Na v 1.6 in the dendrites remains elusive, however, because conventional immunofluorescence localization technique is not sufficiently sensitive.</s></p><p><s>Relatively subtle differences in excitable properties of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of conditional Na v 1.6 knockout and control mice, as described above, could be related to a difference between the Na v 1.6 and Na v 1.2 channels in their propensity to enter the noninactivating gating mode and to produce persistent current <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>Several groups have tried to determine the role of Na v 1.6 channels in axonal excitability by using mice that bear the recessive muscle endplate disease mutation in the Scn8a gene.</s><s>This mutation causes the expression of a truncated nonfunctional form of Na v 1.6 by altering mRNA splicing due to insertion of a LINE element in exon 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>The functional consequences of Na v 1.6 deletion varied in different neuronal types, probably reflecting differences in Na v 1.6 subcellular localization and time course of developmental appearance, as well as mechanisms compensating for the lack of its expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the amplitude and voltage dependence of both transient and persistent Na + currents in dissociated globus pallidus neurons were not affected by Na v 1.6 deletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>By contrast, transient Na + current in dissociated Purkinje neurons and in subthalamic nucleus neurons from mutant mice

1.6 KO mice, and the voltage dependence of activation of the transient current was shifted to more depolarizing potentials by ∼5 mV <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</s><s>Current-clamp recordings from these cells in slices revealed a significant elevation of the somatic spike threshold in Na v 1.6 KO mice as well as a shortening of the estimated delay  between spike initiation at the AIS and its arrival at the soma <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</s><s>These earlier studies were based on somatic electrical recordings alone.</s><s>Here, using a more direct approach, Na + imaging from axons of current-and voltage-clamped layer 5 cortical pyramidal cells, we found that neuron-specific deletion of Na v 1.6 causes significant reduction in I NaP generation by AIS Na + channels.</s><s>Similarly, a heightened tendency to generate I NaP was found in studies of heterologously expressed Na + channels, which consistently show that the noninactivating component is largest in Na v 1.6 channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>Because of the pivotal role of I NaP in setting the AP threshold, the reduction in this current amplitude alone could be sufficient to explain elevation in current and voltage threshold and the lower instantaneous firing rates observed in Na v 1.6-cKO cells.</s></p><p><s>Based on the similar pattern of Na + influx in Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 containing AIS of the Na v 1.6-cKO and control neurons, we presume that the underlying channel densities are not dramatically different.</s><s>The precise relationship between Na + influx and Na + conductance (gNa) is not simple, as it depends not only on channel kinetics but also on the shape of the AP.</s><s>In an extreme example, the relationship could be quite flat in a spherical compact cell if all of the Na + conductance is inactivated by the time the AP reaches its peak.</s><s>However, as has been shown experimentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51)</ref>, rapidly rising, narrow APs such as those of the AIS at 22 °C have considerable Na + conductance during the repolarization phase.</s><s>In this case, the influx more closely mirrors gNa.</s><s>Kole et al. ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) used models with different Na + channel densities to show that the influx-gNa relationship is expected to be nearly linear for a fairly broad range of gNa.</s><s>The Na + influx-gNa relationship could be significantly distorted if the inactivation kinetics of Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 channels differs.</s><s>Our imaging data, however, suggest that this is not the case, as the kinetics of cumulative inactivation of axonal Na + flux during high-frequency trains of spikes was roughly similar in cKO and control cells.</s></p><p><s>A common supposition is that the leftward shift in voltage dependence of Na + channel activation in the AIS is due to the presence of the molecularly distinct Na + channel subtype, Na v 1.6.</s><s>The comparison of the voltage dependence of the heterologously expressed Na v 1.6 channels to other subtypes, however, has produced conflicting results: there are reports of leftward shifted <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>, rightward shifted <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and unaffected <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> voltage dependence of activation of Na v 1.6 compared with Na V 1.2 channels.</s><s>Our evidence-that the leftward shift of activation of the Na + channels is preserved within the Na v 1.2-containing AIS trigger zone of Na v 1.6-cKO neurons-indicates that the leftward shift is not associated with a unique channel subtype.</s><s>Rather, it probably reflects interactions of Na + channels with the proteins that characterize the AIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the binding of one of the AIS cytoskeletal proteins, ankyrin G <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53)</ref>, to sodium channels can regulate their inactivation gating <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In good agreement with our data, excitatory cell-specific deletion of Na v 1.6 has recently been shown to produce convulsive seizure resistance due to cortical circuit hypoexcitability <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref>.</s><s>Examination of heterozygous Na v 1.6 mutant mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref> and humans (57) revealed a much more complex phenotype than we observed, including cognitive deficits, emotional instability, sleep-wake architecture, and other neurohumoral derangements.</s><s>Although these phenomena could be related to a mild decrease in neuronal excitability of various neuronal populations, it is more likely that they reflect a difference in susceptibility of different Na + channel subtypes to neuromodulation.</s><s>For example, while somatodendritic Na v 1.2 channels are very sensitive to regulation by protein phosphorylation via the PKA and PKC pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>, the Na v 1.6 channels are largely refractory to such neuromodulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>It is therefore likely that compartmentalization of Na v 1.2 and Na v 1.6 channels in mature cortical neurons contributes to the selectivity of neuromodulation of the excitable properties of the axonal and somatodendritic membrane.</s></p></div>
