<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic correlation</head><p><s>In addition to height, we examined the genome-wide genetic overlap between intracranial volume and other anthropometric traits, cognitive function, and neurodegenerative diseases (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>).</s><s>We found a strong genetic correlation with child head circumference (ρ genetic = 0.748), which validates intracranial volume as a measure of brain growth during early development.</s><s>Given that this high correlation indicates that the genetic determinants of intracranial volume and child head circumference are largely shared, we aimed to leverage this information by performing a meta-analysis of both traits.</s><s>The meta-analysis (combined N = 37,345) led to the identification of four previously unknown loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">9</ref>).</s><s>Weaker correlations were found with birth length and weight (ρ genetic &lt; 0.3), which attenuated after adjusting for height.</s><s>In addition, intracranial volume was genetically correlated with cognitive function in childhood (ρ genetic = 0.277, P = 2.2 × 10 −3 ), as well as general cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults (ρ genetic = 0.202, P = 6.3 × 10 −4 ).</s><s>Furthermore, we found a positive genetic correlation with Parkinson's disease (ρ genetic = 0.315, P = 6.6 × 10 −7 ), but there was no significant genetic overlap with Alzheimer's disease, white matter lesions and psychiatric traits.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enrichment analyses</head><p><s>Next, we assessed whether particular subsets of genetic variants were enriched for association with intracranial volume using partitioned heritability and pathway analyses (Online Methods).</s><s>Overall, we found that common variants genotyped from across the whole genome explained 25.42% (s.e.m., 2.73%) of the variation in intracranial volume.</s><s>Partitioning heritability by chromosome revealed that chromosome 22 contributed twofold more to variation in intracranial volume than would be expected by its size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>), which was not seen for any of the other complex traits from the genetic correlation analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Partitioning by functional elements showed an enrichment for introns and several histone codes that are found in actively transcribed promoters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>).</s><s>The enrichment for intronic variants was specific to intracranial volume, whereas the other functional classes were also enriched in other complex traits (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>).</s><s>We also found that loci associated with intracranial volume cluster around genes involved in specific pathways, with 94 pathways being significantly enriched (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c</ref>; full list in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">10</ref>).</s><s>These pathways included all of the cell cycle components-the M, G1, S and G2 phases-and various growth factor signaling pathways, including PI3K-AKT.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Head growth trajectories</head><p><s>Although intracranial volume reflects brain development until maturation, and we identified influences of many growth-related processes contributing to its variation, all of the loci were still discovered via cross-sectional associations in adults.</s><s>Thus, we tested whether a polygenic score of the seven loci could predict head growth in a longitudinal cohort of 2,824 children of European ancestry followed prenatally until 6 years of age (Online Methods).</s><s>We found that a higher polygenic score, representing a genetically larger intracranial volume in adults, was also associated with a larger child head circumference (β = 0.031 per s.d., P = 0.010).</s><s>Furthermore, the effect of the polygenic score was age dependent and more prominent in older children (β = 0.0080 per s.d.</s><s>polygenic score per year age, P interaction = 0.0091).</s><s>When investigating the individual loci separately, we found significant associations between both 17q21 and 12q14 and child head circumference, but they influenced the trajectories of head growth differently (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>).</s><s>For 17q21, the negative effect of the G allele on head circumference became apparent postnatally and increased toward 6 years of age, whereas the 12q14 locus exerted an effect from early pregnancy to 1 year of age, but was less prominent later in life.</s></p></div>

weaker and decreased further after adjusting for height, so a similar phenotypic correlation between head size and body size at younger age may drive these correlations.</s><s>Intracranial volume was also genetically associated with cognitive function in childhood, as well as general cognitive function in middle-aged and older individuals.</s><s>This indicates that variation in   a r t I C l e S

disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>There were no correlations with other neurological or psychiatric traits, indicating that this finding might be specific to Parkinson's disease.</s><s>However, it is important to note that there is a certain extent of variation in the sample size and power of these studies, and a larger GWAS might reveal genetic correlation with other traits as well.</s><s>For schizophrenia, we also tested the latest GWAS (36,989 cases and 113,075 controls), but here too there was no significant correlation (ρ genetic = 0.01, P =

extremes of the distribution, size can matter, as in disorders such as microcephaly or macrocephaly.</s><s>Here we found evidence for a shared genetic background between intracranial volume and

consortium.</s><s>Briefly, the CHARGE consortium is a collaboration of predominantly population-based cohort studies that investigate the genetic and molecular underpinnings of age-related complex diseases, including those of the brain.</s><s>The ENIGMA consortium brings together numerous studies, mainly with a case-control design, which performed neuroimaging in a range of neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases, as well as healthy normative populations.</s><s>Studies participated in either the discovery cohort of European ancestry, the replication in European ancestry, or the generalization to other ethnicities.</s><s>An overview of the demographics and type of contribution for each cohort is provided in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</s><s>Each study was approved by the respective institutional review board or local ethics committee.</s></p><p><s>genetics.</s><s>Genotyping was performed using a variety of commercial arrays across the contributing sites.</s><s>Both samples as well as variants underwent similar quality control procedures based on genetic homogeneity, call rate (less than 95%), minor allele frequency (MAF &lt; 0.01), and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE p-value less than 1 × 10 −6 ).</s><s>Good quality variants were used as input for imputation to the 1000 Genomes reference panel (phase 1, version 3) using validated software packages (MaCH/minimac, IMPUTE2, BEAGLE, GenABLE).</s><s>Variants that were poorly imputed (R 2 &lt; 0.5) or uncommon (MAF &lt; 0.5%) were removed before meta-analysis.</s><s>Full details on the site-specific genotyping and quality control may be found in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Imaging.</s><s>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained from scanners with a diversity of manufacturers, field strengths, and acquisition protocols.</s><s>Images were used to estimate milliliters of intracranial volume from automated segmentations generated by freely available or in-house methods that have been described and validated earlier.</s><s>Most sites measured intracranial volume for each participant by multiplying the inverse of the determinant of the transformation matrix required to register the subject's MRI scan to a common template by the template volume (1,948,105 mm 3 ), using the FreeSurfer software.</s><s>Visual inspections were performed to identify and remove poorly segmented images.</s><s>Either all scans were visually inspected, or sites generated histogram plots to identify any outliers, which were defined as individuals with a volume more than 3 s.d.</s><s>away from the mean.</s><s>Statistical outliers were only excluded if the segmentations were deemed improper.</s><s>More site-specific information related to the imaging is available in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. gwAS.</s><s>GWAS of intracranial volume were performed for each site separately, controlling for age, sex, and, when applicable, age 2 , population stratification variables (MDS / principal components), study site (for multi-site studies only), diagnosis (for case-control studies only).</s><s>Studies of unrelated individuals performed a linear regression analyses whereas studies of related individuals (ASPSFam, BrainSCALE, ERF, GeneSTAR, GOBS, NeuroIMAGE, NTR-Adults, OATS, QTIM, SYS) used linear mixed models to account for familial relationships.</s><s>Summary statistics, including the effect estimates of the genetic variant with intracranial volume under an additive model, were exchanged to perform a fixed-effects meta-analysis weighting for sample size in METAL 47 .</s><s>After the final meta-analysis, variants were excluded if they were only available for fewer than 5,000 individuals.</s><s>Meta-analyses were stratified by race and done separately for discovery, replication, and generalization samples.</s><s>Beta coefficients were recalculated from Z-scores, allele frequencies, and the sample, as described earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">48</ref> Site-specific quantile-quantile plots were generated to inspect the presence of genomic inflation.</s><s>The variance explained by all variants in the GWAS was estimated using LD score regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">49</ref> .</s><s>Sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding patients.</s></p><p><s>Functional annotation.</s><s>All tracks of the regional association plots were taken from the UCSC Genome Browser Human

(http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg_v3.php).</s><s>genetic correlation.</s><s>The genetic correlation analyses were also performed using LD score regression.</s><s>The GWAS meta-analysis of intracranial volume, as well as the height adjusted and height subset meta-analyses, were correlated with published GWAS of the following traits: child head circumference <ref

certain types of genetic variants, we employed two strategies: partitioned heritability and pathway analyses.</s></p><p><s>Partitioned heritability was calculated using a previously described method <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">49</ref> .</s><s>This was done by partitioning variants by chromosome and by 28 functional classes: coding, UTR, promoter, intron, histone marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac5 and two versions of H3K27ac, open chromatin DNase I hypersensitivity Site (DHS) regions, combined chromHMM/Segway predictions, regions that are conserved in mammals, super-enhancers and active enhancers from the FANTOM5 panel of samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">49</ref> .</s><s>Multiple testing thresholds were calculated accordingly: P thresh = 0.05/(22 chromosomes) = 2.27 × 10 −3 for the chromosomes and P thresh = 0.05/(28 classes) = 1.79 × 10 −3 for the functional classes.</s></p><p><s>Pathway analyses were performed using the KGG2.5 (ref.</s><s>53) and MAGENTA 54 software packages.</s><s>LD was calculated based with the 1000 Genomes Project European samples as a reference (see below).</s><s>Variants were considered to be within a gene if they were within 5 kb of the 3′/5′ UTR based on chromosome positions (hg19) coordinates.</s><s>Gene-based tests were done with the GATES test <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">53</ref> without weighting P values by predicted

pathways tested resulting in a significance threshold of P thresh = 0.05/(671 pathways) = 7.45 × 10 −5 .</s></p><p><s>Head growth trajectories.</s><s>Head growth trajectory analyses were done within the Generation R study, a longitudinal cohort study situated in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</s><s>For this analysis we included 2,824 children of European ancestry followed prenatally until 6 years of age.</s><s>Head size was measured at the following points: prenatally (using echo) during the first, second, and third trimester, and postnatally (measuring head circumference) at 0-2 months, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5-10 months, 10-13 months, 13-17 months, and 5 years of age.</s><s>We tested whether a polygenic score of the 7 loci, as well as the 7 loci themselves separately, were related to head growth using linear mixed models and included an interaction term between time and the genetic score/variant (SAS software).</s><s>Next, the predicted values were calculated for each person and plotted over time, stratified by genotype (0/1/2 risk alleles) using the R software package.</s></p></div>			</div>
