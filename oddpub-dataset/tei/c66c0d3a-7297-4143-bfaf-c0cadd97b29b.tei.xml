<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients</head><p><s>We analysed retrospectively the medical records of pregnant patients receiving neurological consultation due to acute headache from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016 at the Charité hospital in Berlin, Germany.</s><s>Acute headache was defined as the presence of a new or known headache beginning during the current pregnancy in a previously respectively interictally pain free patient that led to medical consultation.</s><s>We included women older than 18 years with acute headache as a major symptom who presented to the emergency department or received neurological consultation during an in-patient stay.</s><s>We excluded consultations of women who left the hospital against their physicians' advice before completing recommended diagnostic procedures.</s><s>We did not include women in the post-partum period.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical evaluation</head><p><s>Using the clinical electronic documentation system, we reviewed the data of these patients in detail per chart review.</s></p><p><s>The collected data included details of the present pregnancy as well as prior pregnancies and potential complications within both.</s><s>We also gathered information about prior headache diagnoses and other pre-existing neurological, psychiatric, and further medical conditions.</s><s>We further assessed family (specifically headache) and smoking history.</s><s>We characterized the current headache based on following features: altered characteristics compared to possible prior headache diagnoses, duration, localization, sudden onset, subjective intensity of the pain (on a verbal rating scale 1-10), pain quality, and dynamics of the pain before the diagnostic procedure.</s></p><p><s>Associated symptoms included vegetative symptoms, neurological and further autonomic symptoms.</s><s>Vegetative symptoms were nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia.</s><s>Further autonomic symptoms included conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation, nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhoea, eyelid oedema, miosis and/or ptosis.</s><s>Neurological symptoms included visual and sensory disturbance, dizziness and/or vertigo, language and motor impairment, and changes of consciousness both quantitative and qualitative.</s><s>Furthermore, we documented epistaxis and facial paralysis.</s></p><p><s>We included neurological examination findings in our data compilation and added information given by other departments like gynaecology, internal medicine and otolaryngology.</s><s>Possible abnormalities documented in the report were further classified based on their causal association to the acute headache.</s><s>For example, ptosis would be classified as an abnormal finding in neurological examination not related to the acute symptoms when the patient stated that the condition has been preexisting in this way.</s></p><p><s>Other physical examination findings included fever and elevated blood pressure.</s><s>Fever was defined as a body temperature ≥ 38.5 °C or subjective statements of patients about fever.</s><s>Elevated blood pressure was defined by a single measurement of the systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg or of the diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg.</s></p><p><s>Diagnostic means were analysed and included laboratory findings, medical imaging and lumbar puncture.</s><s>A headache expert (LN) confirmed final headache diagnosis after reviewing the collected data based on the classification of the International Headache Society <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s></p></div>

third trimester.</s><s>The majority of our sample was diagnosed with primary headache disorders, most frequently migraine with aura, without aura and tension type headache.</s><s>However, 42% of the women were found to have a secondary headache, most commonly headache attributed to infections and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</s><s>Infectious diseases occurred more frequently during the second trimester of pregnancy, while hypertensive disorders were more common during the third.</s></p><p><s>Pregnant women with secondary headache presented more often with pregnancy complications, positive secondary headache history, progressive pain dynamic, seizures, abnormal medical examination, elevated blood pressure, fever and abnormal neurological examination.</s><s>In blood lab tests, abnormal thrombocytes, elevated transaminases and CRP were associated with a secondary headache diagnosis.</s><s>Furthermore, proteinuria, pathologic findings in the cerebrospinal fluid and pathologic neuroimaging results correlated with a secondary headache.</s><s>In multivariate logistic regression analysis, secondary headache history, elevated blood pressure, fever and an abnormal neurological examination resulted as independent risk factors for secondary headache.</s></p><p><s>Pregnant women with primary headache reported more frequently a history of primary headache, a side predominance of pain as well as visual and sensory disturbance, likely driven by migraine and migraine aura <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, the most commonly described visual and sensory deficits were typical aura symptoms, such as scintillating scotoma and slowly spreading unilateral hypoesthesia.</s><s>Only few previous studies focused on the clinical evaluation of headache in pregnant women.</s><s>Robbins et al. characterized demographic and clinical features of pregnant women presenting with acute headache in a predominantly Hispanic and Afro-American population <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Ramchandren et al. evaluated medical imaging results in pregnant women with emergent headache.</s><s>Multiparous Afro-American women constituted the majority of their cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess headache features in pregnancy in a primarily Caucasian population.</s></p><p><s>Besides the differences in ethnicity, the study group assessed by Robbins et al. had more prior pregnancies and live births.</s><s>The number of final secondary headache diagnosis was slightly lower than in our study.</s><s>The most common primary headache disorders coincided with our reported results, namely migraine and tension type headache <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Within the secondary headache group, the authors found a higher number of hypertensive disorders of pregnancies.</s><s>This is probably due to the fact that Afro-American ethnicity is a known risk factor for the development of hypertensive disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</s><s>In the study by Ribbins et al., final diagnosis of primary headache correlated with history of headache <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Our results extend this finding by showing that only a previous primary headache correlated with a primary headache diagnosis, whereas a known secondary headache could be considered as a risk factor for a current secondary headache.</s><s>A detailed differentiation of previous headache history could lead to a better differential diagnostic assessment.</s></p><p><s>MR imaging is the preferred imaging method for evaluating headache in pregnant women, as it involves no exposure to ionizing radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In the study of Robbins et al., neuroimaging was performed in almost 90% of the cases, with a 18% rate of pathological imaging findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>In the analysis of Ramchandren et al., only pregnant women receiving neuroimaging were considered and an underlying headache etiology was revealed in 27% of pregnant women suffering from acute headache <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, only 50% of the patients had neuroimaging and 38% of them had pathologic results.</s><s>The higher rate of pathologic results despite lower neuroimaging incidence could indicate a more detailed clinical preselection of cases.</s><s>Considering the limited assess to 24 h MRI-imaging in some areas and the economic costs, further research should examine which anamnestic and clinical aspects are crucial in determining the decision to order neuroimaging procedures in pregnant women.</s></p><p><s>Our study is the first one to demonstrate a possible association between laboratory findings and secondary headache during pregnancy.</s><s>Low thrombocytes and elevated transaminases, especially during the third trimester, were significantly associated with secondary headache.</s><s>Such laboratory abnormalities are common in pregnancy-associated hypertension und increase with disease severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Multiple abnormal values, as occurring in HELLP syndrome, are also associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, abnormal CRP values as marker for infections were also more common within the secondary headache group.</s></p><p><s>One of the main strengths of our study is the large sample size, the broad variety of analyzed clinical details and confirmation of headache diagnosis by a headache specialist.</s><s>However, our study has some limitations.</s><s>We characterized cases of acute headaches in a mainly Caucasian sample, yet we cannot provide specific information about the ethnic background of our patients since this information is not routinely acquired in our institutional records.</s><s>Still, we can assume that our study provides adequate information about an urban population in Europe.</s><s>About 70% of Berlin's population are ethnic German, other ethnic influences come mainly from Southern Europe and the Middle East <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Further limitations include the retrospective character of the study and, due to that, some missing details of headache features.</s><s>Moreover, the study was underpowered to detect differences between groups in rarely occurring features, e.g.</s><s>pregnancy complications.</s><s>As we analyzed only headaches, we did not consider isolated auras, which may also represent an issue in pregnant women.</s><s>In fact, migraine aura is the most frequent condition leading to a focal neurological deficit during pregnancy and visual deficits during pregnancy are almost in two third of the cases related to a migraine aura <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Due the crosssectional nature of the study, we were not able to follow up the headache development during the remaining pregnancy.</s><s>We cannot exclude that some headache diagnosed as a primary form over the course revealed as a secondary headache, especially in those women without additional diagnostic procedures.</s><s>Furthermore, we were not able to provide information about delivery and child outcome, as most women did not give birth at our hospital.</s><s>The index headache was the first headache attack during pregnancy that led to a neurological consultation in our hospital.</s><s>We cannot completely exclude previous consultations at other hospitals and cannot provide additional information about previous attacks in the same pregnancy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Headache is a common complaint in pregnant woman.</s><s>Distinguishing benign headache from ominous secondary changes is of great importance, and can be challenging especially in an emergency setting.</s><s>We could show that secondary headaches are common during pregnancy, occurring in over one third of pregnant women presenting to the hospital with acute headache.</s><s>Our findings show that clinical features of secondary and primary headache do not necessarily differ and are in many cases not sufficient to rule out a possible threat to the mother or unborn child.</s></p><p><s>Diagnostic vigilance should be highlighted in presence of previous history of secondary headache, progressive pain, seizures, fever, high blood pressure and pathological findings in neurological examination.</s><s>These symptoms can be considered as predictors for secondary headache in pregnant women.</s><s>However, attack features alone cannot adequately discriminate between primary and secondary headache.</s><s>Additional diagnostic tests leading to final diagnosis include blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid examination as well as neuroimaging.</s><s>In presence of the above mentioned "red flags", low thresholds for additional diagnostic procedures are justified.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Demographics, pregnancy characteristics and medical history of pregnant women receiving neurological consultation due to acute headache</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Characteristic</cell><cell>All headache</cell><cell>Primary headache</cell><cell>Secondary headache</cell><cell>p value</cell></row><row><cell>No.</cell><cell>151</cell><cell>87 (57.6%)</cell><cell>64 (42.4%)</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Age,years</cell><cell>30.1 (±6.5)</cell><cell>30.4 (±6.3)</cell><cell>29.6 (±6.7)</cell><cell>0.977</cell></row><row><cell>Gestations</cell><cell>2.1 (±1.7)</cell><cell>2.3 (±1.9)</cell><cell>1.7 (±1.2)</cell><cell>0.389</cell></row><row><cell>Deliveries</cell><cell>0.7 (±1.2)</cell><cell>0.9 (±1.3)</cell><cell>0.5 (±0.9)</cell><cell>0.424</cell></row><row><cell>Gestational age, weeks</cell><cell>22.2 (±10.1)</cell><cell>22.5 (±10.3)</cell><cell>21.8 (±9.9)</cell><cell>0.861</cell></row><row><cell>Trimester</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>First</cell><cell>32 (21.2%)</cell><cell>19 (21.8%)</cell><cell>13 (20.3%)</cell><cell>0.821</cell></row><row><cell>Second</cell><cell>63 (41.7%)</cell><cell>35 (40.2%)</cell><cell>28 (43.8%)</cell><cell>0.665</cell></row><row><cell>Third</cell><cell>56 (37.1%)</cell><cell>33 (37.9%)</cell><cell>23 (35.9%)</cell><cell>0.802</cell></row><row><cell>Complications during current pregnancy</cell><cell>29 (19.2%)</cell><cell>11 (12.6%)</cell><cell>18 (28.1%)</cell><cell>0.017*</cell></row><row><cell>Any medical history</cell><cell>51 (33.8%)</cell><cell>27 (31%)</cell><cell>24 (37.5%)</cell><cell>0.406</cell></row><row><cell>History of hypertension</cell><cell>5 (3.3%)</cell><cell>2 (2.3%)</cell><cell>3 (4.7%)</cell><cell>0.418</cell></row><row><cell>History of venous thromboembolism</cell><cell>3 (2.0%)</cell><cell>2 (2.3%)</cell><cell>1 (1.6%)</cell><cell>0.749</cell></row><row><cell>History of autoimmune disease</cell><cell>22 (14.6%)</cell><cell>14 (16.1%)</cell><cell>8 (12.5%)</cell><cell>0.536</cell></row><row><cell>History of preeclampsia</cell><cell>4 (2.6%)</cell><cell>2 (2.3%)</cell><cell>2 (3.1%)</cell><cell>0.775</cell></row><row><cell>History of gestational diabetes</cell><cell>2 (1.3%)</cell><cell>1 (1.1%)</cell><cell>1 (1.6%)</cell><cell>0.826</cell></row><row><cell>Any neurological history</cell><cell>8 (5.3%)</cell><cell>3 (3.4%)</cell><cell>5 (7.8%)</cell><cell>0.237</cell></row><row><cell>Any headache history</cell><cell>57 (37.7%)</cell><cell>39 (44.8%)</cell><cell>18 (28.1%)</cell><cell>0.036*</cell></row><row><cell>Any primary headache history</cell><cell>51 (33.8%)</cell><cell>39 (44.8%)</cell><cell>12 (18.8%)</cell><cell>0.001*</cell></row><row><cell>History of migraine without aura</cell><cell>29 (19.2%)</cell><cell>21 (24.1%)</cell><cell>8 (12.5%)</cell><cell>0.076</cell></row><row><cell>History of migraine with aura</cell><cell>14 (9.3%)</cell><cell>12 (13.8%)</cell><cell>2 (3.1%)</cell><cell>0.026*</cell></row><row><cell>History of tension type headache</cell><cell>8 (5.3%)</cell><cell>6 (6.9%)</cell><cell>2 (3.1%)</cell><cell>0.307</cell></row><row><cell>Any secondary headache history</cell><cell>12 (7.9%)</cell><cell>3 (3.4%)</cell><cell>9 (14.1%)</cell><cell>0.017*</cell></row></table><note><p><s>* = statistical significant (p &lt; 0.05).</s><s>Subgroup proportions were compared using χ 2 test</s></p></note></figure>
