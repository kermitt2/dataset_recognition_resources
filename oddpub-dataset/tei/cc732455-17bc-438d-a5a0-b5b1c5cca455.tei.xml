<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basic assessments</head><p><s>We assessed basic demographic data including type of motor complication, Hoehn-Yahr score <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>, UPDRS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The UPDRS motor score (part III) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> was assessed during the inpatient period in the defined Off state after drug free period and STN-DBS turned off for at least 12 hours, and best possible motor On state.</s><s>Patients underwent a diary training session for the PD motor diary introduced by Hauser and colleagues with four different motor states (asleep, motor Off, On without dyskinesia, and On with dyskinesia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>During the training session, patients were instructed as to how the different functional states are defined and how the diaries have to be completed (placing a tick mark on a daily diary card every 60 minutes reflecting their predominant status over the prior hour period; for time asleep, the diary was completed upon awakening).</s><s>Patients then completed diaries on 6 consecutive days (5 days for analysis plus first day for PKG calibration) without a specific reminder function.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PKG motor state measurement</head><p><s>The PKG measures acceleration of the wrist and was worn between 6 am and 10 pm on the most severely affected side.</s><s>The new algorithms designed for the present study are using the continuous variables BKS and DKS arising out of the analyzing technique of the spectral power of the low frequencies of accelerometer data developed by Griffith and colleagues in 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>These new algorithms convert each hour of the continuous variables BKS/DKS into one of the five categories (asleep, motor Off state, On state or On state with dyskinesia [also: dyskinetic state], not wearing PKG) used in the PD home diary.</s><s>Note that subjects without PD also have BKS and DKS, but their medians are lower than PD subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>For each hourly diary entry, the probability that the BKS or DKS in that hour were higher than 75 th percentile was estimated.</s><s>This was done in the following manner: The 75 th percentiles of BKS and DKS of normal subjects were used from data of the study by Griffith and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and the probability that more BKS or DKS was greater than the 75 th percentile of controls in each hour was estimated using the Chi 2 test.</s><s>There are 30 two minute epochs in an hour and in normal subjects, 1 in 4 will be over the 75 th percentile of controls.</s><s>Thus in patients, if 15 or more BKS or DKS are greater than 75 th percentile of controls in the hour then the χ 2 test provides a p&lt;0.05.</s><s>This was treated as the objective assessment of "Off" or "dyskinesia", respectively.</s><s>These data are referred to herein as raw data.</s></p><p><s>All hour-time-periods between 6 am and 10 pm were analyzed for the three motor categories (motor Off, On or On with dyskinesia) states, but hour-time-periods were excluded from analysis if there was no response (sleeping time or PKG logger not on wrist for 30 or more minutes in the hour) or if the patient in the diary or the PKG recorded more than one of the three motor categories for that hour.</s><s>Analysis of PKG data was performed by raters without contact to patients and blinded for diary entries (LC, MH).</s><s>Only diary entries of the first day of recordings were conveyed to the PKG analyzers for calibration (see below).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration of PKG data</head><p><s>As well as correlating scores with the consistent threshold (the 75 th percentile), we also attempted to model the thresholds used by the patient and thus obtain better correlations.</s><s>To achieve this, raw PKG data were tuned to model the first day of diary entries by each patient (referred herein as calibrated PKG data) so as to establish their individual thresholds for Off and dyskinetic state.</s><s>Calibration from that first day was then applied to the subsequent 5 days, with PKG analyzers blinded to diary entries.</s><s>Calibration was achieved by modifying two parameters: The first was altering the threshold (i.e. the percentile) for achieving the Off state or On state with dyskinesia and the second entailed shifting the hour in which the PKG was analyzed forwards (+) or backwards (-) relative to the diary.</s><s>Take for example the hour between 9:00-10:00.</s><s>If the patient appeared to be switching between Off and On at threshold that best correlated with the 65 th percentile then this threshold was used for this patient, instead of the 75 th percentile.</s><s>As well, the diary should have been filled in at 10:00 to reflect an assessment of motor state of the whole of the previous hour.</s><s>If the PKG data in the period 9:30-10:30 was found to correlate better with the diary entry then the PKG was moved forward in time (+ 30 mins) compared to the diary.</s><s>In each patient time shift and change in threshold was then applied to all subsequent days.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>Statistical comparisons of data were calculated using χ2, McNemar test, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon test, or paired t-test as appropriate.</s><s>Percentage agreement and Cohen's κ were used to determine inter-rating agreement between assessment methods on the single-hour-level, Pearson's correlation test was used for correlations on the total-hours-per-day-level (κ or Pearson's correlation coefficient |r|&lt;0.3 was considered a weak, κ/|r| = 0.3-0.59 a moderate, κ/|r|0.6 a strong agreement/correlation).</s><s>Multiple linear regression modeling was used to test predictive value of depression and diary data for the PKG results as the dependent variable.</s><s>To estimate the median difference between PKG values for the relevant hour (in calibrated data) when the diary scored the hour as On compared to when the diary was scored as Off (dyskinetic in the case of DKS), a clustered median regression analysis with the binary diary record ("On"/"Off") for the hour as an input and the PKG values for that hour as an output, with hour-specific values clustered within the patients was used.</s><s>In addition, to estimate the between-subject variability as the proportion of total variability in diary entries, a random-effect multi-level logistic regression model with PKG score at a given point of time as an input, the respective diary entry as an output, and the patient as the random effect level variable was developed.</s><s>The proportion of between-subject variability was estimated using the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC).</s><s>Since this is a pilot study and no data on PKG movement assessment were available at the time of the study start, we were not able to perform a sample-size calculation and thus aimed for 100 suitable full-day datasets from 20 patients.</s><s>Pairwise deletion was applied to missing data.</s><s>Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Stata IC 13 (Stata-Corp, College Station, TX).</s><s>If not mentioned otherwise, all data are displayed as means±SD [range] or numbers (%), significance level was set at P&lt;0.05 (two-tailed test).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Factors that influenced calibration</head><p><s>Calibration of the PKG data was achieved by modifying two parameters: The first was altering the threshold for achieving the Off or dyskinetic state and the second entailed shifting the hour in which the PKG was analyzed forwards (+) or backwards (-) relative to the diary (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Calibration of the timing was not needed in 12/24 subjects, but did require a shifting forward of the PKG relative to the diary in 9/12 subjects.</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> shows the extent to which the threshold for the Off state was increased or decreased from 26 BKS units and for the dyskinetic state changed from 4 DKS units (50 th percentiles of normal subjects).</s><s>In approximately half the patients, the BKS threshold was not changed and in the other cases, the BKS threshold was usually reduced (i.e. less bradykinetic).</s><s>Note that a reduction in 8 BKS units brings the threshold to the mean of normal subjects.</s><s>In the case of DKS, almost all subjects required an increase in threshold (19/24 did not consider themselves to be dyskinetic when objective measures would have).</s><s>Based on the median regression analysis, the median within-patient difference between the BKS values in hours when the diary is "On" and when the diary is "Off" is 2.37 (95%CI: 0.49-4.25;</s><s>P = 0.014), while the similar difference for DKS ("On" vs dyskinetic hours) is 5.24 (95% CI: 1.18-9.3;</s><s>P = 0.012), illustrated in (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>The values of median within-patient differences range from -4.78 to 10 for BKS values and from -1.01 to 14.57 for DKS.</s><s>Thus about half of the patients required a change in BKS or DKS of &gt;4 to identify the respective motor state (approximates a UPDRSIII &gt;4 and mAIMS &gt;3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The median differences correlated modestly with the number of changes in motor state (r 2 = 0.3), suggesting that those who were non-fluctuators were able to detect a smaller change in bradykinesia or dyskinesia to detect the Off or On with dyskinesia state.</s><s>Random-effect multi-level logistic regression analysis demonstrated that when investigating the association between diaries and bradykinesia within-patient variability is stronger (ICC = 16%) whereas the between-patient differences dominated dyskinesia (ICC = 78%).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Our study revealed moderate-to-high concordance of quantitative motor state assessment using the Parkinson's kinetigraph (PKG) with patient's diary data when analyzed on a daily basis (total hours per day), but limited concordance on the single-hour-level.</s><s>In general, raw PKG data showed weak agreement rates, but calibration of PKG data to diary entries from an index day led to higher correlations of PKG data with diary entries on both the daily level and higher inter-rating scale agreement on the single-hour-level.</s><s>There was a strong correlation of total daily hours in the state with a correlation coefficient &gt;0.6.</s></p><p><s>Comparing objective measurement devices to subjective assessments such as patient diaries implicates several limitations which might be-at least partially-responsible for their limited agreement.</s><s>Firstly, the PKG measures movements continuously and classifies them into the motor states for every hour, while the hourly diary completion not only leads to large recall bias, but potentially also due to diary fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>However, the amount of incomplete diary entries was similar to the missing number of classifications by the PKG, but diary fatigue might also lead to limited diary entry accuracy fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>The assumption of diary fatigue is supported by decreasing agreement rates over days in the present study, but notably we did not directly assess diary fatigue.</s><s>Secondly, PKG outcomes correlate well with clinical ratings by physicians such as UPDRS or mAIMS suggesting a more objective rating of motor performance, while diary completion is potentially confounded by non-motor symptoms or their fluctuations, particularly psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, fatigue and depression.</s><s>However, persistent depression measured by the BDI was not a relevant confounder for the correlations of diary and PKG data.</s><s>Whether or not mood or other non-motor symptom fluctuations that are known to appear in conjunction with motor oscillations fluctuations <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref> influence the diary ratings needs to be addressed in future studies.</s><s>Another limitation of the present study is that ratings derived from PKG and patient diaries were not compared to clinical assessments performed by trained clinicians.</s><s>This would have required continuous presence of a rater during the observation period, which was not part of the protocol.</s><s>Maybe simultaneous video monitoring would be a way to acquire this supplementary information in future studies.</s><s>We finally point to the fact that the limits of the use of patient diary information as a gold standard in clinical studies were not focus of our study.</s><s>The strong correlation of PKG measures with objective ratings (UPDRS and mAIMS) using the same recording paradigms as in the recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> also implies that the fact that the PKG was placed on one limb only (wrist on most affected side) is not an important reason for a lack of correlation.</s><s>In addition, PKG might not be able to reliably distinguish between volitional rest and immobility in Off state.</s><s>In order to minimize these factors, only inpatients under continuous surveillance were enrolled and trained rigorously in completing the diaries correctly.</s><s>Therefore, the PKG should be combined with a patient activity protocol similar to Holter ECG monitoring.</s></p><p><s>Another important consideration in this comparison potentially limiting the agreement between diary and PKG data is that the clinical scales and the PKG scores are continuous whereas diaries typically have either a three point scale (Off, On or dyskinetic).</s><s>Ideally, there should be a specific point on the continuous scale and when this point is exceeded the subject is deemed "Off" or dyskinetic.</s><s>However with diaries each patient selects their own (possibly varying) threshold.</s><s>Thus a comparison between the PKG (and any other objective continuous rating scale) with diary entries will require that first some threshold level is chosen and second that an attempt is made to establish what idiosyncratic threshold each subject has chosen.</s><s>To further add more variability to the patient ratings, the finding that the within-patient variability is stronger for the association between diaries and PKG for bradykinesia, whereas the betweenpatient differences dominated dyskinesia, might be interpreted as meaning that individual patients are more variable in the way they score Off and On, whereas with dyskinesia, the patients are intrinsically more consistent in their scoring.</s><s>These factors which were partially eliminated by data calibration during data processing leading to much better agreement rates between PKG and diary data.</s><s>Indeed, a closer look at the ratings of the different motor states conveys that the calibrated PKG data agree with the diaries classification of the Off state and dyskinetic states for a high proportion of hours (see S5 and S6 Tables).</s><s>However, it also provides an explanation for why the Cohen's κ would have been low in many of these patients: That reason is that for many patients, while there was high agreement, it was for being in the On state, with a very small proportion in the bradykinetic or dyskinetic state.</s><s>Cohen's κ test and other categorical tests to do not handle this type unbalanced distribution of values in cells.</s></p><p><s>Calibration of the PKG data consisted of either shifting the time or the threshold.</s><s>In about a third of subjects, there was a forward shift, meaning that events happening in the PKG at the time of filling in the diary led to better correlations than those of an hour earlier.</s><s>One explanation might be that the patient's current state was likely to be more influential than the memory of the last hour.</s><s>On the other hand, almost half the patients (11 out of 24) required a lowering of the bradykinesia threshold.</s><s>The objective threshold for the PKG was set at 8 BKS units above "normal", which is roughly equivalent to a UPDRSIII score of around <ref type="bibr">10 [7]</ref>.</s><s>This implies that for half the patients this threshold is too high and that they are detecting lower thresholds.</s><s>The regression analysis showed that about half of the patients required a change in BKS &gt;4 (UPDRS III ~4) to qualify for a change from On to Off state.</s><s>In the case of dyskinesia, an increase in threshold was required in 19 out of the 24 subjects.</s><s>The PKG threshold was set at 4 DKS, which is equivalent to an AIMS = 0.</s><s>If the threshold had been set at the 75 th percentile of controls (equivalent to an AIMS ~10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, then most subjects would have required a lowering of threshold.</s><s>The random effect logistic regression model implies that between-patient differences dominated the variability between PKG and diaries in scoring dyskinesia.</s><s>This may indicate that individual patients are intrinsically more consistent in their scoring of being dyskinetic than in their scoring of bradykinesia.</s></p><p><s>The improvement of correlations between PKG and diary data by calibrating the PKG data as well as the discussed differences of the correlation strengths between diary and PKG data for motor fluctuations and dyskinesia might not only support the notion that low correlation levels were mediated by individual differences or thresholds in diary entries by the patients, but might also point to potential limits in the algorithm used to classify continuous PKG data into motor states based on upper extremity motor function.</s><s>The finding that the median BKS and median DKS closely correlate with the UPDRS III and mAIMS support the contention that the original algorithms can classify motor symptoms as rated by an objective observer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and can distinguish between fluctuating and non-fluctuating patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Thus the mismatch seems more likely to be between the objective and subjective observer.</s><s>However, future threshold-free and adaptive technologies might be utilized to improve categorization of continuous PKG data into categorical diary data and/or other patient ratings.</s></p><p><s>Together, the PKG is a valuable tool to measure total motor state hours per day particularly for the dyskinetic motor state.</s><s>Future studies in larger patient cohorts-at best under controlled prospective conditions-are warranted to confirm our data and to evidence the PKG as a suitable trial endpoint.</s></p><p><s>Investigation: CO FG MF CB GE
