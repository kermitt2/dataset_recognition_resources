<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>We demonstrate here for the first time in large studies that lymphocytosis commonly occurs after treatment with dasatinib, but not imatinib.</s><s>Analyses of 3 large clinical trial populations (n 5 1402) in different stages of CML who received treatment with a variety of different doses of dasatinib and were followed for as long as 7 years, demonstrate that lymphocytosis develops in a minimum of 32% of patients and persists for 1 year in at least 50% of such patients.</s><s>Although immunophenotyping was not done, it is very likely that this represents expansion of a T/NK-cell population, given the findings from smaller studies that have characterized this proliferation in dasatinib-treated patients.</s></p><p><s>Lymphocytosis was demonstrated in a similar proportion of patients in all clinical phases and occurred relatively rapidly, with most cases identified within 3 to 5 months after the initiation of dasatinib treatment.</s></p><p><s>It is also likely that the 32% to 35% incidence of lymphocytosis represents an underestimate, because 2 consecutive blood samples with an elevated count were required.</s><s>The case study in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> indicates that occasional lymphocyte counts were in the normal range, suggesting that lymphocytosis in some patients may have been missed because of the use of a somewhat conservative definition.</s><s>Some of these fluctuations may be related to the temporal relation between the ingestion of dasatinib and the acquisition of the blood sample, as reported in a recent study demonstrating that increased numbers of T/NK cells can be detected within 1 to 2 hours after dasatinib administration, even in normal individuals, with a correlation between peak blood levels and T/NK counts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>t is noteworthy that higher rates of CCyR were observed in dasatinib-treated patients who had lymphocytosis in all phases of CML, as were the rates of MMR and deeper MRs (MR <ref type="bibr">4.5</ref> ) in patients with CML-CP.</s><s>For the first time, we demonstrate that PFS and OS are significantly longer in patients with imatinib-resistant/intolerant CML-CP who have longer follow-up, which might be expected if an "immunologic" effect were operative.</s><s>This is consistent with other immune-mediated therapies in which positive effects on longer term outcomes are often the most prominent findings.</s><s>Given the substantial impact of subsequent therapies and the somewhat shorter follow-up, it is perhaps not unexpected that there was no significant impact on OS in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP.</s><s>It is somewhat disappointing that there was no difference in either PFS or OS in the overall population with more advanced stages of CML, given the previous suggestions regarding unexpectedly long responses from the many cases and anecdotal observations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</s><s>However, it may be difficult for any putative immunomodulatory effect to overcome the proliferative thrust of active disease in patients with CML-MBP, although longer term benefits may occur in patients who can maintain  dasatinib treatment.</s><s>More detailed studies of the immunologic activity of cells from "exceptional" responders would be of interest.</s></p><p><s>Interpretation of these retrospective data may have been affected by other considerations.</s><s>For example, the lymphocyte cutoff we used would not detect lower levels of T/NK proliferation, which may also influence clinical outcome.</s><s>Nonetheless, given the clear correlation between the occurrence of lymphocytosis and the development of pleural effusions, the effects on response rate for all stages of CML, and the significant increase in PFS and OS in patients with previously treated CML-CP, it appears that our definition enabled us to capture clinically relevant associations.</s><s>Certainly, lymphocytosis after dasatinib treatment is a consistent and potentially clinically important biologic phenomenon, and it is hoped that several of these questions can be addressed with prospective evaluations of lymphocyte subpopulations in future studies.</s></p><p><s>The mechanism by which dasatinib induces these changes is unclear.</s><s>Lymphocytosis has not been noted after CML treatment with other TKIs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> and we convincingly confirm this observation here through analysis of patients with CML-CP who were treated on a randomized study of dasatinib versus imatinib.</s><s>A few trials evaluating dasatinib in patients with solid tumors have been conducted in which lymphocytosis has not been reported, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35</ref> although it could have been missed, because it is not a typical focus of toxicity assessments.</s><s>Although primarily targeted against BCR-ABL1 in CML, dasatinib has effects on multiple kinases and signaling pathways. 2,4-6</s><s>Indeed, there had been some initial concern about lymphopenia and immunosuppression because of the effect of dasatinib on SRC signaling.</s><s>Clinical reports have documented mutations in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and STAT5B among patients with large granular lymphocytic leukemia, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37</ref> a pathway that may be of interest for patients with CML who have dasatinibinduced lymphocytosis.</s><s>Finally, a recent publication evaluating dasatinib-treated patients with CML documented increases in the numbers of functionally active memory CD4-positive and CD8-positive Th1-type T-helper cells capable of producing interferon-c, suggesting potential for an immunomodulatory effect that is undetected in patients who are taking imatinib or nilotinib. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38</ref></s><s>n summary, lymphocytosis occurs frequently with dasatinib treatment, persists for 1 year and is associated with higher response rates, increased PFS and OS in patients with CML-CP who are refractory to or intolerant of imatinib, and the development of pleural effusions.</s><s>Prospective studies can better characterize the functional activity of these lymphocytes and assess whether an immunologic effect against CML cells is detectable, perhaps focusing on patients with CML-AP or CML in blast crisis who have unexpectedly long responses to treatment and those with deep molecular responses who are considering treatment discontinuation.</s><s>Given the frequency of the effect on lymphocytosis in CML, trials using dasatinib to treat other diseases, possibly in combination with other immunomodulatory agents, would be of interest.</s><s>Two trials are currently evaluating dasatinib postautologous and postallogeneic transplantation, with the aim of augmenting the NK proliferation that frequently accompanies bone marrow reconstitution (NCT01609816 and NCT01643603).</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Abbreviations: CA180-034,
