radical hysterectomy required for different tumor extension, with variable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>In 2009, Höckel et al. proposed total mesometrial resection (TMMR), developed by open surgery, as an alternative to radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer of stages IB-IIA and selected cases of IIB <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>TMMR is based on the ontogenic compartment theory, which states that malignant tumor growth is confined to permissive compartments derived from a common primordium in embryonic development <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>It completely removes the Müllerian compartment except for the distal parts, where the resection is performed intracompartmentally to preserve a functional vaginal vault <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>Current evidence shows that TMMR can be standardized for all patients with locally defined tumors and appears to reduce morbidity, improve outcome and

Campus, Berlin, Germany.</s><s>Institutional Review Board approval was obtained under registration number EA1/174/14.</s></p><p><s>From April 2012, 34 patients with cervical cancer FIGO stages IA-IIB were treated by laparoscopic TMMR and total pelvic lymphadenectomy.</s><s>Laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed in cases of FIGO stage IIB and by positive sentinel lymph nodes from the common iliac region at frozen section.</s></p><p><s>All patients who underwent laparoscopic radical surgery were informed of the risks of the procedure (including conversion to laparotomy if necessary) and gave written informed consent.</s><s>The same surgeon (MZM) performed all the laparoscopic interventions.</s></p><p><s>The inclusion criteria were body mass index (BMI) ≤35 kg/m 2 , histopathological confirmed diagnosis of cervical carcinoma (via biopsy or conization), and no evidence of potential extra-pelvic disease (FIGO IA-IIB).</s><s>Data were obtained retrospectively from medical and pathology records.</s><s>The following criteria were analyzed: Tumor-related characteristics: Histological type, stage, TNM staging, tumor size and resection margins; operative criteria: Operative time, number of lymph nodes removed, intraoperative blood loss and complications; perioperative morbidity: Hemoglobin drop and postoperative complications (early and late).</s><s>The principles of the surgical steps, described by Höckel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, were systematically translated to laparoscopic surgery to guarantee the same radicality whilst maintaining the advantages of minimally invasive surgery.</s><s>From April 2012, all TMMR procedures were performed using the laparoscopic technique as follows.</s></p><p><s>Step 1: Surgical access is gained through five disposable 10/12 mm-trocars (ENDOPATH ® XCEL™ Bladeless Trocars, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA).</s><s>An Optic trocar is inserted umbilically, two lateral trocars about 2 cm above the anterior superior iliac spines bilaterally, a medial trocar 2 cm in the midline above the symphysis pubis, and a trocar at Palmer's point on the right (3 cm below the right costal margin in the mid-clavicular line).</s></p><p><s>Step 2: The pelvic and mid-abdominal retroperitoneum is opened by incising the peritoneum at the psoas muscles, paracolic gutters, between the two leaves of the broad ligament and along the mesenteric root.</s></p><p><s>Step 3: The infundibulopelvic ligaments and ureters are exposed.</s><s>The cecum, and sigmoid colon are mobilized.</s><s>With the exception of the rectosigmoid colon, all bowel organs are retracted ventrally and placed in the right upper abdomen.</s></p><p><s>Step 4: Para-rectal spaces are developed with the hypogastric nerves adhering medially to the mesorectum.</s><s>This maneuver is carried out down to the level where the pelvic splanchnic nerves join the hypogastric nerves to form the inferior hypogastric plexus but not further dorsally.</s></p><p><s>Step 5: The sigmoidal colon is elevated with the attached hypogastric plexus to the anterior abdominal wall.</s><s>Lymph nodes in the common iliac region are dissected and examined under frozen section intraoperatively.</s><s>Para-aortic lymph node dissection is performed in cases of FIGO stage IIB, or in any FIGO stage with positive nodes at frozen section.</s><s>In cases of negative nodes, a systematic dissection of pelvic lymph nodes is performed.</s><s>The parietal nodes of the anterior pelvic compartments (external, internal iliac and obturator) are removed by completely stripping the external and internal iliac artery and vein, exposing the proximal pelvic obturator nerves and the lumbar rami of the sacral plexus and removing the para-visceral pelvic fat pads.</s><s>The obturator nerve, artery and vein, the arcus tendineus, and proximal sciatic nerve are also exposed.</s></p><p><s>Step 6: The round ligaments are transected.</s><s>The anterior and posterior leaves of the broad ligaments are incised.</s><s>If the adnexae are to be removed with the TMMR specimen, the infundibulopelvic ligaments are ligated and cut, otherwise the adnexae are separated from the uterus.</s></p><p><s>Step 7: Anteriorly, paravesical spaces are developed with the umbilical arteries adhering medially to the bladder, down to the pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus muscles, exposing the complete anterior side of the urogenital mesentery.</s></p><p><s>Step 8: The peritoneum of the vesico-uterine pouch is incised and the bladder is separated from the anterior cervix and the proximal vagina by dissection of the loose and dense sub-peritoneal connective tissue.</s></p><p><s>Step 9: The umbilical artery together with the superior bladder mesentery is separated from the anterior mesometrium.</s></p><p><s>Step 10: The uterine arteries and veins are coagulated and cut at their origins.</s></p><p><s>Step 11: The peritoneum of the recto-uterine pouch is incised and the anterior mesorectum is separated from the posterior vaginal wall down to the mid vagina.</s><s>Laterally, the mesorectum is separated from the dense subperitoneal connective tissue ('uterosacral ligaments') to the level of the inferior hypogastric plexus.</s></p><p><s>Step 12: The proximal inferior hypogastric plexus is mobilized from the lateral surface of the dense sub-peritoneal connective tissue, which encases the rectum for 1-2 cm enabling the transection of the latter without nerve damage.</s></p><p><s>Step 13: Immediately above the superior margin of the inferior hypogastric plexus, the dense sub-peritoneal connective tissue ('rectouterine ligaments', 'uterosacral ligaments') is stepwise transected.</s></p><p><s>Step 14: The operation proceeds in the anterior compartment.</s><s>The mesometrium is mobilized from its origin at the site of the already transected uterine artery and veins towards the uterus beyond the superior surface of the ureter.</s></p><p><s>Step 15: The vesicovaginal venous plexus together with the dense subperitoneal connective tissue above the pre-vesical segment of the ureter is coagulated and divided.</s><s>After cutting the remaining dorsal attachments the ureter can be completely mobilized laterally.</s></p><p><s>Step 16: The vaginal wall is incised 2 cm beneath the cervical tumor thus completing the colpotomy.</s><s>The TMMR specimen is removed through the vagina and the vaginal stump is closed with laparoscopical sutures.</s></p><p><s>Perioperatively, all patients received once-off intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis (1.5 g cefuroxime plus 500 mg metronidazole) at induction and low molecular weight heparin (0.4 ml Fraxiparin/24 h) subcutaneously 12 h before the operation.</s><s>Intraoperative blood loss was estimated by subtracting the volume of the irrigation fluid from the total amount of fluid in the suction apparatus.</s></p><p><s>Endpoints of this study were status of the surgical margins, number of lymph nodes removed, short-term postoperative complications (within 30 days of the procedure), long-term postoperative complications (more than 30 days after the procedure), length of hospitalization, median follow-up duration, and recurrence rate.</s></p></div>
