<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Stratification and Variables.</head><p><s>Patients were stratified according to grading, localization (skull base, falx/ parasagittal, and convexity), predicted perioperative risk/operability, tumor size, and sequence of therapy.</s><s>Two groups were defined: group 1 encompasses all grade I meningiomas, as well as all meningiomas with no histology available (grade 0).</s><s>Group 2 encompasses all grade II and III meningiomas.</s></p><p><s>The tumor location was divided into 3 groups: skull base, falx/parasagittal, and convexity.</s></p><p><s>Follow-up examinations, including MRI as well as clinical and neurologic examinations, were performed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 9 months, and 15 months after treatment and then annually.</s></p><p><s>We distinguished between primary radiation treatment and postoperative radiotherapy.</s><s>Acute toxicity in the first 90 days after FSRT was graded using a modified version of the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0).</s></p></div>
