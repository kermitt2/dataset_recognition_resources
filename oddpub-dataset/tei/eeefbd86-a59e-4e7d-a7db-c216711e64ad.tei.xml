<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Purpose: To investigate the effect of warmup by application of the thermal agent Deep Heat (DH) on muscle mechanical properties using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) at 3T before and after exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD).</s><s>Materials and Methods: Twenty male participants performed an individualized protocol designed to induce EIMD in the quadriceps.</s><s>DH was applied to the thigh in 50% of the participants before exercise.</s><s>MRE, T 2 -weighted MRI, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), creatine kinase (CK) concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and after the protocol to assess EIMD effects.</s><s>Five participants were excluded: four having not experienced EIMD and one due to incidental findings.</s><s>Results: Total workload performed during the EIMD protocol was greater in the DH group than the control group (P &lt; 0.03), despite no significant differences in baseline MVC (P 5 0.23).</s><s>Shear stiffness jG*j increased in the rectus femoris (RF) muscle in both groups (P &lt; 0.03); however, DH was not a significant between-group factor (P 5 0.15).</s><s>MVC values returned to baseline faster in the DH group (5 days) than the control group (7 days).</s><s>Participants who displayed hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images had a greater stiffness increase following damage than those without: RF; 0.61 kPa vs. 0.15 kPa, P &lt; 0.006, vastus intermedius; 0.34 kPa vs. 0.03 kPa, P 5 0.06.</s><s>Conclusion: EIMD produces increased muscle stiffness as measured by MRE, with the change in jG*j significantly increased when T 2 hyperintensity was present.</s><s>DH did not affect CK concentration or soreness; however, DH participants produced greater workload during the EIMD protocol and exhibited accelerated MVC recovery.</s></p></div>

identification of the main sites of muscle damage produced by an EIMD protocol of this type.</s><s>1]<ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> Future studies, whether imaging-based or not, need to take into account the fact that the principal site of damage produced using this EIMD protocol is likely to be the RF and VI, and not the VL.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of the MRE data revealed that the magnitude of shear stiffness, jG*j, was significantly increased in the RF muscle in both groups.</s><s>jG*j was also increased in the VI muscle in the DH group, although the difference compared to the control group was not significant.</s><s>Hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images was more often present in the DH group than the control group (71% vs. 50%), although the difference was not significant.</s><s>Analysis also showed that jG*j of the RF and VI was significantly increased in the present of T 2 hyperintensity.</s><s>This indicates the presence of edema and potentially highlights an association between edema and increased stiffness measured by MRE.</s></p><p><s>The present study is the first in which MRE has been applied to investigate EIMD of the quadriceps muscles after eccentric exercise.</s><s>A previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> focused on the lower leg muscles, namely, the medial gastrocnemius and soleus and reported a significant 21% increase in storage modulus (G 0 ) of the medial gastrocnemius 48 hours postexercise.</s><s>The soleus muscle group showed no significant increase after 48 hours but a 9% increase was detected 1 hour after exercise, indicating a short-term effect.</s><s>In future studies it will be interesting to investigate whether the EIMD protocol can produce short-term responses in the muscles of the thigh, perhaps due to increased muscle perfusion following exercise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref></s><s>he values of jG*j obtained predamage in this study were found to vary between 1-1.3 kPa over the thigh cross section which is in good agreement with Green et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> who reported values for shear stiffness of 1 kPa.</s><s>Other studies using similar techniques include Klatt et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and Barnhill et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> who reported values for the storage modulus (i.e., G 0 ) in the ranges of 0.7 to 2 kPa, and 1.0 to 1.9 kPa, respectively.</s><s>These data, however, refer to a single frequency acquisition.</s><s>G 0 values in the present study were derived from multifrequency data and ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 kPa.</s><s>Multifrequency inversion will produce lower values due to the frequency dependence of the measurements and the contributions from acquisitions at frequencies lower than 50 Hz (i.e., 25 Hz and 37.5 Hz).</s><s>This is the first study to measure u in muscle following exercise.</s><s>The baseline values are in good agreement with a previous study measuring u of the quadriceps at rest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s>Phase angle, u, was found to decrease in the quadriceps in the DH group, with no significant change found in the control group.</s><s>A reduction in u may signify degradation of the structural matrix in the low-level tissue architecture, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> perhaps indicating a greater destruction of actin and myosin cross-bridges due to strenuous exercise.</s><s>This finding points to the DH group damaging more fibers during the EIMD protocol, a distinct possibility considering the significantly greater workload produced by the DH group.</s><s>The lack of change in the RF, the site of most change in jG*j, may be due to the small size of the RF muscle and hence the ROIs used, with scattering effects producing more heterogeneous results.</s><s>These scattering effects are reduced in the jG*j measurement due to the magnitude of both G 0 and G 00 being measured.</s><s>Several previous studies have investigated EIMD of the quadriceps muscle using techniques other than MRI.</s><s>For example, Crenshaw et al 65 used a Biodex system to produce EIMD in eight healthy participants and showed that MVC was reduced by an average of 45%.</s><s>Torres et al 66 also used a Biodex system to produce damage in the quadriceps muscle in 10 participants via eccentric contractions.</s><s>The authors measured muscle stiffness using a Wartenberg pendulum test, whereby increased muscle stiffness was identified by reduced range of motion and a slower angular velocity of the pendulum.</s><s>Since the magnitude of the stiffness increase was similar to that found in the present study this suggests that the increased stiffness measured by Crenshaw et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> is directly related to changes in the muscle belly and not to contributions from tendons and ligaments.</s></p><p><s>The physiological mechanism underlying the muscle stiffness increase in EIMD has not been fully elucidated.</s><s>Allen et al 67 postulated that the forcible lengthening of muscle fibers in EIMD leads to disruption at the level of the sarcomeres and which is exacerbated by repeated repetitions of the eccentric movement.</s><s>This muscle fiber damage leads to release of Ca 21 into the cytoplasm in sufficient quantities that homeostasis is disturbed and contraction of fibers occurs.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> However, Chleboun et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> have shown that, whereas stiffness may increase immediately following damage, swelling does not become significant until after 24 hours.</s><s>In the present study participants in whom hyperintensity was observed on T 2 -weighted images were found to show greater increase in muscle stiffness than participants who exhibited no increased T 2 signal.</s><s>This may be interpreted to suggest that an increase in fluid volume associated with inflammation and edema produces increased muscle tension.</s></p><p><s>In future work we propose to use recent developments in MRE techniques including high SNR, high-resolution data acquisition sequences such as spiral MRE, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> and state of the art super-resolution MRE based on data acquisition at multiple frequencies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s>We will also incorporate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of fiber orientation along with anisotropic inversion algorithms to correct for muscle fiber orientation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref></s><s>Another consideration is whether the type of eccentric contraction has an effect on the distribution of damage within the muscle.</s><s>For example, Takahashi et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> induced EIMD via an eccentric movement based on lowering the body down to a sitting position while balanced on one leg.</s><s>Takahashi et al did not observe hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images of the RF following this eccentric movement; however, the VI, VM, and VL muscles did display hyperintensity.</s><s>The movement utilized by Takahashi et al is a CKCE, and hence the vasti muscles are expected to be preferentially effected compared to the OKCE used in the present study.</s></p><p><s>There are several limitations of the study that should be discussed.</s><s>First, the inversion step used in the analysis of MRE data assumes that the tissue is isotropic and homogeneous, but this is not strictly valid owing to the anisotropic orientation of the muscle fibers.</s><s>Recent advances in MRE have led to the development of anisotropic inversion methods that utilize DTI to identify the primary fiber direction in the muscle and which has been incorporated into MRE data analysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref></s><s>A recent study has also employed a threeparameter inversion method to measure the anisotropic shear elastic parameters of skeletal muscle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref></s><s>In addition, it should be noted that the EIMD protocol was designed to produce muscle damage regardless of the strength of the individual participants on account of a personalized workload having been set based on peak eccentric and concentric forces measured over three trials.</s><s>However, if the participant did not fully engage with the experiment a sufficiently challenging workload may not be set and so the protocol may not produce EIMD.</s><s>Each participant performed a familiarization session 48 hours prior to the EIMD protocol that aimed to reduce the former effects; however, perhaps further motivation and/or familiarization may be required for some participants.</s><s>MRE data were only obtained on two occasions, at baseline and 48 hours after the EMD protocol, at which time muscle damage was suggested to peak. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref></s><s>Therefore, detailed knowledge of the time course of the stiffness response is limited.</s><s>An interesting further development will be to obtain more detailed information on the changes in the mechanical properties of the muscle via pixel-by-pixel analysis of the MRE data for data obtained at intervals over a longer time period, and also to replace the qualitative assessment of signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images with computation of T 2 relaxation time maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> coregistered with the elastograms.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MRE has the ability to detect skeletal muscle mechanical property changes in the quadriceps as a result of a personalized OKCE EIMD protocol.</s><s>Complementary physiological and biochemical measurements enabled the confirmation of EIMD.</s><s>DH participants were found to perform significantly more work during the EIMD protocol, yet recover MVC force faster.</s><s>No significant difference in jG*j was observed between groups; however, u was significantly decreased in the quadriceps of the DH group.</s><s>ROI analysis revealed that RF and VI muscles are preferentially affected by the eccentric contraction, with associated increased muscle stiffness and frequent T 2 hyperintensity.</s><s>Muscles displaying T 2 hyperintensity were found to have an elevated stiffness change following damage compared to those which did not.</s><s>The information obtained in this study suggests that DH rub may benefit participant force production during activity and facilitate accelerated return to normal activity after strenuous exercise.</s><s>Further studies incorporating alternative exercise strategies are needed to determine if this outcome holds true following diverse exercise patterns.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1:
