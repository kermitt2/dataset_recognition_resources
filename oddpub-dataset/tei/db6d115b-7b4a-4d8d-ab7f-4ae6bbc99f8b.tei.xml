<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>We investigated SOD2 gene expression and protein content in monocytes of CKD patients.</s><s>Also, in hemodialysis patients, a population with reportedly high all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, we analyzed the relation between SOD2 protein content and mortality.</s><s>The major findings in our study are the following: (1) SOD2 protein content showed a J-curve pattern with significantly lower values compared to healthy controls and a progressive reduction until CKD stage 4 followed again by higher SOD2 protein content in CKD stage 5 and patients with hemodialysis treatment.</s><s>(2) The SOD2 gene expression was not significantly different between the groups.</s></p><p><s>(3) Higher than median SOD2 protein content was associated with higher mortality in patients with hemodialysis therapy.</s></p><p><s>Both, the results on protein content and gene expression of SOD2 in our study, are interesting.</s><s>In an earlier study our group investigated gene expression and protein content of the cytosolic superoxide dismutase isoform (SOD1) in monocytes of patients with CKD.</s><s>In contrast to SOD2, the SOD1 protein was reduced in CKD showing the lowest protein content in patients with hemodialysis therapy; and SOD1 gene expression was increased in CKD, with a high significance in patients with hemodialysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>These results are supported by the literature.</s><s>In peripheral blood mononuclear cells of hemodialysis patients a significant increase of SOD1 mRNA compared to healthy controls was reported while SOD2 mRNA did not differ significantly from control <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The different gene expression of SODs in CKD could be explained by the multiple differences in gene regulation between SOD1 and SOD2 (for review see Miao and St. Clair  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>).</s><s>With respect to the reduced SOD2 protein content found in CKD stages 3 and 4 in our present study different explanations are suggested by the literature.</s><s>Two factors in CKD can contribute to an enhanced degradation of proteins: oxidative stress and uremia.</s><s>Oxidative modification of SOD2 proteins has been described.</s><s>Our own Western blot analyses did not suggest tyrosine nitration of SOD2 in CKD although refined analysis requires mass-spectrometric analyses of SOD2 protein from CKD patients and healthy subjects.</s><s>While some authors using recombinant SOD2 protein showed tyrosine nitration and tyrosine oxidation upon treatment with peroxynitrite <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, protein biochemical analyses of SOD2 protein species from medulloblastoma cells showed tryptophan oxidation and histidine oxidations but no tyrosine nitration <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it will be necessary to analyze oxidative SOD2 modifications for each pathogenic condition individually.</s><s>Further insights could be revealed by adjacent analyses of SOD2 protein degradation and SOD2 enzymatic activity.</s></p><p><s>Our own results in the current study point to an involvement of reactive oxygen species in the regulation of SOD2 protein content since we observed a PMA-induced decrease of SOD2 protein in mononuclear cells that could be abolished by treatment with the SOD-mimetic Tempol.</s><s>Furthermore, increased SOD2 protein degradation in the uremic environment may be involved.</s><s>SOD2 protein was shown to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>In CKD protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway is enhanced <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>Generally, posttranslational protein modifications known for SOD2 from other cell types should also be considered for monocytes.</s><s>These are tyrosine nitration and tyrosine oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, histidine and tryptophan oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, acetylation (for review see Zou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>), and ubiquitination <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Numerous studies have shown that the correlation between gene expression, quantified by messenger RNA (mRNA) analysis, and quantification of protein content is often limited (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, for changes in protein content but unaltered mRNA levels a regulation of translation or regulatory changes of protein degradation can be underlying mechanisms.</s></p><p><s>The following conditions for instance have been described: reduced mRNA levels but constant protein content <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, constant mRNA levels but reduced protein content due to increased protein degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and constant mRNA levels but increased protein content due to decreased protein degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, our own group showed for superoxide dismutase 1 in monocytes from chronic kidney disease patients an increased mRNA level together with reduced superoxide dismutase 1 protein content <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The mechanisms underlying the increase of SOD2 protein in advanced CKD (CKD5 with and without hemodialysis) compared to CKD 3 and 4 that we observed and that resulted in a J-shape of SOD2 protein content are not known.</s><s>In this respect it is of interest that an upregulation of SOD2 protein that was reported in uremic rats could be reversed by vitamin D receptor agonists <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Since advanced uremia is a state of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency but also of vitamin D receptor deficiency and dysfunction, vitamin D receptorrelated uremic effects could be involved in the J-shape of SOD2 protein that we observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, we observed a better survival in hemodialysis patients with a SOD2 protein content below the median of this patient group compared to those with SOD above the median.</s><s>The underlying mechanism for this observation is not known but considering the above discussed connection to vitamin D metabolism an association of higher content of SOD2 protein with more severe uremic disturbance of vitamin D receptor signal transduction could be involved.</s></p><p><s>In future experiments it will be necessary to identify underlying SOD2 protein modifications using 2 DE, massspectrometry and immunoblotting.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our study shows significant changes of SOD2 protein content with increasing degree of renal function impairment.</s><s>We also proof, in line with our own previous research but also with many other groups, that in clinical-experimental research a parallel investigation of gene expression and protein content is indispensable.</s><s>And finally, we provide the first report of SOD2 protein content together with its association with survival in CKD patients with hemodialysis therapy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1: (a) Detection of
