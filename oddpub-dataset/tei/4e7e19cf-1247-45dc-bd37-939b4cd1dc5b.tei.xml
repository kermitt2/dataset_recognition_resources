<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Since an objective description is essential to determine infant's postnatal condition and efficacy of interventions, two scores were suggested in the past but weren't tested yet: The Specified-Apgar uses the 5 items of the conventional Apgar score; however describes the condition regardless of gestational age (GA) or resuscitative interventions.</s><s>The Expanded-Apgar measures interventions needed to achieve this condition.</s><s>We hypothesized that the combination of both (Combined-Apgar) describes postnatal condition of preterm infants better than either of the scores alone.</s><s>Methods: Scores were assessed in preterm infants below 32 completed weeks of gestation.</s><s>Data were prospectively collected in 20 NICU in 12 countries.</s><s>Prediction of poor outcome (death, severe/moderate BPD, IVH, CPL and ROP) was used as a surrogate parameter to compare the scores.</s><s>To compare predictive value the AUC for the ROC was calculated.</s><s>Results: Of 2150 eligible newborns, data on 1855 infants with a mean GA of 28 6/7 ± 2 3/7 weeks were analyzed.</s><s>At 1 minute, the Combined-Apgar was significantly better in predicting poor outcome than the Specifiedor Expanded-Apgar alone.</s><s>Of infants with a very low score at 5 or 10 minutes 81% or 100% had a poor outcome, respectively.</s><s>In these infants the relative risk (RR) for perinatal mortality was 24.93 (13.16-47.20)</s><s>and 31.34</s><s>(15.91-61.71),</s><s>respectively.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>An objective assessment of infant's postnatal condition in the delivery room is essential for clinical care and scientific purposes.</s><s>To describe the postnatal condition of groups of infants or to compare effects of interventions in a research setting a numerical score, which represents the sum of several objective findings is required.</s></p><p><s>To describe the condition of a newborn, Virginia Apgar developed a system that scores the postnatal condition by converting clinical observations into quantifiable scientific data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is no general agreement on how to score infants with a low gestational age or those receiving interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>To overcome that problem, we suggested to specify the items of the conventional Apgar and to score infant's condition regardless of gestational age and interventions (Specified-Apgar) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>According to the rules of the Specified-Apgar, the full score with a maximum total of 10 points can either be allocated to the healthy term or preterm infant without any problems in postnatal adaptation, but also to an infant receiving resuscitative or supportive interventions with an adequate response to those interventions (good chest expansion during ventilation, pink skin colour due to supplemental oxygen, etc.).</s><s>To better differentiate between both conditions, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggested to also score and document the interventions that are required to achieve the condition (Expanded-Apgar) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Consequently, an infant without any interventions would have a higher Expanded-Apgar than the one who requires interventions.</s><s>It can be assumed that an infant's condition is better described using both scores (Combined-Apgar) simultaneously than one score alone.</s></p><p><s>Up until now, both scores are not used in clinical practise mainly because of not being validated yet.</s></p><p><s>The multicenter, international TEST-Apgar study ("Trial to Evaluate a Specified Type of Apgar") aimed to answer the question, whether the Combined-Apgar describes infant's postnatal condition better than either the Specified-Apgar or Expanded-Apgar alone.</s><s>Since no "gold standard" was available, we decided to use prediction of mortality and morbidity as a proxy for testing.</s><s>That outcome criterion was only used as a surrogate parameter for the purpose of testing the scores.</s><s>It was not the aim to develop a new tool which predicts mortality or morbidity, but to test that the Combined-Apgar provides a good numerical description of infant's postnatal condition.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, the primary hypothesis of the TEST-Apgar study was as follows: the Combined-Apgar is a better predictor of poor outcome in preterm infants (defined as either death or any major morbidity during the first hospital stay) than either the Specified-Apgar or Expanded-Apgar alone.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>In an observational study data were collected prospectively in 20 academic neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in 12 countries from March 2008 to June 2009.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</head><p><s>Infants were eligible if they were born at any of the study sites prior to 32 completed weeks of gestation.</s><s>The exclusion criteria were: 1.) lack of informed consent, 2.) outborn, 3.) any major congenital malformation, or 4.) death in the delivery room.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data</head><p><s>After birth, the following data were collected by the attending neonatologist: gestational age, birth weight, mode of delivery and a description of the infant at 1, 5 and 10 minutes of life according to the definition of the Combined-Apgar, which consists of the Expanded-Apgar and Specified-Apgar as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1:</ref> 1. Specified-Apgar <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> supplementation, bag and mask ventilation, intubation and ventilation, chest compression, administration of surfactant, epinephrine (drugs).</s><s>If an intervention was performed it was scored 0, if absent it was scored 1.</s><s>The best possible score was 7 (no intervention) and the worst 0 (all interventions performed).</s><s>Intubated and ventilated infants were scored 0 for CPAP as well as for bag and mask ventilation; infants on bag and mask ventilation were scored 0 for CPAP as well.</s><s>3. Combined-Apgar: In clinical routine, the Combined-Apgar will consist of two numbers, such as 7-10 for the Expandedand Specified-Apgar, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For the purpose of the present study, the Combined-Apgar was calculated as the sum of the Specifiedand the Expanded-Apgar.</s></p><p><s>At discharge the following outcome measures were recorded: mode of discharge (death, transfer to another hospital, or home), length of stay, corrected GA, weight, and the presence of either of the four major morbidities: moderate/severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, intraventricular haemorrhage grade 1-4 (IVH), cystic periventricular leukomalacia (CPL), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data management and statistical analyses</head><p><s>Participating doctors were instructed regarding definitions and study forms prior to the start of the study at the individual center.</s><s>Data collected at participating sites were transmitted to the principal investigator and analyzed for the primary outcome criterion consisting of death or either one of the major morbidities (BPD, IVH, CPL, ROP).</s><s>To test the hypothesis, the predictive values of the scores were compared by calculating the areas under the curve (AUC) and their co-variances of the receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC), based on an algorithm given by DeLong and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The comparisons of AUCs base on WALD tests.</s><s>The significance of differences between estimated risks was tested by Chi-square tests; p-values are unadjusted for multiple testing.</s><s>For sample size calculation a difference in AUC means of 0.01 and a SD in matched pairs of 0.1 were assumed.</s><s>To detect a significant difference at a level of p = 0.01 with a power of 0.9 data of 1490 infants were required.</s><s>Assuming a dropout rate of 30%, it was planned to recruit 2000 patients.</s><s>For secondary data analysis, the AUC was calculated for each individual component of poor outcome.</s><s>Data on mortality were analyzed for "death at any point" and "perinatal mortality".</s><s>Furthermore, for each outcome criteria the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%-CI) were calculated.</s><s>To do so, scores were categorized as follows: Specified-Apgar: poor (0-3 points), fair (4-6 points) or good (7-10 points) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Expanded-Apgar: low (0-2 points), moderate (3-4 points), high (5-6 points) or no intervention (7 points); Combined-Apgar: very low (0-5 points), low (6-9 points), moderate (10-13 points) or high <ref type="bibr">(14-17 points)</ref>.</s><s>The respectively highest category of each score was used as reference value.</s><s>All analyses were performed by using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, version 9.2).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>A numerical score that represents the sum of objective findings is a prerequisite to describe the postnatal condition or to compare effects of interventions in the delivery room for groups of infants.</s><s>Since the infant's condition is affected by medical interventions, it seems mandatory to describe not only the clinical status but also the interventions needed to achieve this condition.</s><s>During the last centuries, various attempts have been made to describe the infant's condition after birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Virginia Apgar developed a scoring system that now bears her name and is widely used <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Since improvements in neonatal care demanded a recalibration of the Apgar score <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, the Specified-Apgar was introduced.</s><s>Using the same items as the original score, it allows detailed descriptions for the infant's condition regardless of GA or interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>To account for medical interventions required to achieve this condition the AAP and ACOG suggested an expanded reporting form for concurrent resuscitative interventions (Expanded-Apgar) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Both scores together give an objective measure of the postnatal condition; however this Combined-Apgar has not been used in clinical studies yet.</s><s>The multicenter international TEST-Apgar study tested both scores for the first time in a clinical setting.</s><s>The data show that the Relative risk for perinatal mortality The description of the postnatal condition is incomplete without considering administered interventions.</s><s>The Expanded-Apgar adds seven items as a measure for medical interventions needed to achieve the infant's condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>This extension seems long needed, because care of the newborn has changed significantly and an infant's condition often depends on medical interventions used to support postnatal transition.</s><s>In the present study, the majority of infants showed a good clinical condition at 10 minutes of life, however, the number of interventions needed to achieve that condition increased with decreasing gestational age.</s></p><p><s>The seven items of the Expanded-Apgar represent medical interventions that are clearly defined.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first prospective clinical study to show a direct relationship between the number of interventions administered postnatally and subsequent survival.</s><s>The more interventions were given the more likely the infant died within the first postnatal week.</s><s>All infants with a Combined-Apgar below 6 for at least 10 minutes had a bad outcome.</s><s>However, at this moment it remains unclear whether all interventions were clinically indicated or rather done as a result of current practice in individual institutions.</s><s>More detailed analyses will have to analyze if there are differences in the predictive power of individual items of the Combined-Apgar.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical implications</head><p><s>In the past, the 1-minute Apgar score was used to guide further treatment and the 5-minute score was a useful index of the effect(iveness) of resuscitation efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>However, it remained unclear how infants were scored during resuscitation.</s><s>It was suggested to interrupt resuscitation for evaluation purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> but this approach seems not practical.</s><s>The Specified-Apgar describes the condition without interrupting intervention and the Expanded-Apgar adds the required information concerning the interventions.</s><s>Thus, the Combined-Apgar evaluates both, infant's condition and resuscitative efforts and can be used to guide postnatal interventions.</s></p><p><s>A Combined-Apgar of 7-10 represents an infant without any clinical interventions (Expanded-Apgar of 7) and good clinical signs (Specified-Apgar of 10).</s><s>In contrast a Combined-Apgar of 0-10 represents an infant with full resuscitative interventions (Expanded-Apgar 0) and a good clinical response (Specified-Apgar of 10).</s><s>Finally, a Combined-Apgar of 0-0 represents an infant with full resuscitative interventions but no clinical response.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the study</head><p><s>It has been previously shown that not all items of the conventional Apgar score are of equal importance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s>However, Virginia Apgar did not differentially weigh or remove individual items since it was her intention to have a score that can be "determined easily and without interfering with the care of the infant" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The Combined-Apgar never intended to replace but rather to specify the score that has been used worldwide for almost 60 years.</s><s>Therefore, items were neither changed nor omitted.</s><s>Furthermore, definition of skin color was not changed despite its poor correlation with oxygen saturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Questions that were not answered by the present study</head><p><s>Since there is no other objective measure to describe postnatal condition, poor outcome was used as a surrogate parameter to test the value of the scores in preterm infants.</s><s>It has already been noted by Virginia Apgar that her score cannot be used to predict survival in an individual infant, but only for a group of infants <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>For a better prediction of outcome in individual infants other more reliable scores should be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>But it remains unclear, whether this higher predictive value in individuals is of relevance in clinical routine.</s></p><p><s>Whereas virtually every newborn is evaluated by the Apgar score today, recent studies suggest problems concerning its reproducibility in individual infants <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>A study, comparing conventional Apgar scores assigned by observers of resuscitation videos to those given by the staff attending the delivery, revealed a poor interobserver reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, a poor reliability was found when Apgar scores were assessed for written case descriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In clinics where case descriptions were scored low, preterm infants received lower Apgar scores as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>It was speculated, that this variability "could also be due to variations in the application of the scoring system" <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>To overcome its poor reproducibility, the Specified-Apgar was introduced, which gives more detailed descriptions of the infant's condition regardless of GA or interventions needed to achieve this condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Strict definitionsas given by the Specified-Apgarare needed to minimise variability in the description of infant's condition.</s><s>However, subsequent studies have to test, whether reproducibility is actually improved by using the Specified-Apgar.</s></p><p><s>Another important practical aspect of the Combined-Apgar is its applicability for every newborn.</s><s>The present study has only tested the predictive power in very preterm infants, but the Apgar score is also of importance in resuscitated infants (e.g. it is used as an inclusion criterion for hypothermia) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Considering the large variation in the conventional Apgar score for an individual infant depending on the care givers opinion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, it could be assumed that the Combined-Apgar will be a better discriminator.</s><s>However, the predictive power of the Combined-Apgar for subsequent neurological impairment has to be tested in asphyxiated infants.</s></p></div>
