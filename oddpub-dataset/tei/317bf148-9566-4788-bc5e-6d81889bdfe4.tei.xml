<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), also known as Kala Azar, is a vector borne disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, L. donovani-L.</s><s>infantum complex, which are transmitted through the bite of an infected sand fly (mainly genus Phlebotomus, old world, and Lutzomya, new world), Leishmaniasis infection in humans presents as cutaneous, muco-cutaneous and visceral.</s><s>The visceral form is fatal if untreated.</s><s>VL progressively affects the immune system of the patient, and opportunistic infections are frequently the final cause of death <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>VL is endemic in around 80 countries, with over 90% of cases found in India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The Fulbaria district of Bangladesh reported an average annual VL incidence rate of 17.8 per 10,000 people between 2008 and 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>This far exceeds the government's goal of one reported case per 10,000 habitants by the year 2015, as set in the Bangladesh VL Elimination Program in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Until 2010, VL was treated in Bangladesh with Sodium Stibogluconate (SSG) or Miltefosine.</s><s>SSG is given by intramuscular (IM) injections daily for 28 days.</s><s>This course of treatment is painful, toxic, cumbersome for patients, and costly for the health system.</s><s>In 2008, the national protocol for VL treatment in Bangladesh shifted to first line treatment with oral Miltefosine for 28 days.</s><s>Miltefosine has gastro-intestinal side effects, is teratogenic (requiring 5 months of effective contraception for women of child bearing age, continuing for 3 months post-treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>), and is prone to poor adherence if not administered under direct observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In 2013, AmBisome single dose (10mg/kg) was adopted as first line treatment, and this regimen is currently being rolled out across the country.</s></p><p><s>Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has run a VL control project in Bangladesh since 2010 by agreement with the Ministry of Health (MoH).</s><s>In May 2010, MSF introduced an innovative first line therapy for primary VL comprising 15mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) intravenous infusion, divided into three doses of 5 mg/kg given over a 5 day period, with only one night of hospitalization.</s><s>Such a regimen had shown good efficacy and safety in a small clinical trial in India <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>MSF introduced this regimen because the Bangladesh national VL guideline <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> allowed its use as second line treatment, although its effectiveness and safety had not been evaluated in routine clinical practice in south Asia.</s><s>It was considered at that time that introduction of other regimens, such as a single dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>[10], would require further evidence from clinical trials.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of a short course AmBisome regimen of 15 mg/kg for primary VL under routine program conditions in Bangladesh, and to investigate predictive factors for relapse, with a 12 month follow-up period to assess final outcomes.</s><s>Clinical studies in VL typically use a follow-up period of 6 months to establish final cure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is some evidence that most relapses occur later than 6 months posttreatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> [13], and wetherefore adopted a 12 month follow-up to allow the assessment of relapse rates up to 12 months post-treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>This retrospective analysis used routine patient data from the MSF VL clinic in Fulbaria, Bangladesh, collected from January 2010 to April 2014.</s><s>We included all patients diagnosed with primary VL who received AmBisome 15 mg/kg in three separate doses (5mg/kg), and who were not referred to other institutions for treatment or follow-up.</s><s>Relapse VL cases require treatment with a higher total dose of AmBisome, and were excluded from our analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VL Protocol</head><p><s>In accordance with the MoH protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, primary VL was suspected in patients with fever &gt;2 weeks duration, weight loss, splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy, and no history of previous VL.</s><s>VL was confirmed by rK39 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (IT-LEISH, Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).</s><s>The performance of rK39 RDTs in South Asia has been shown to be consistently very high <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In a setting with a 50% prevalence of VL among clinical suspects this results in a very high positive predictive value.</s><s>The patient's general clinical condition, height, weight, spleen size and hemoglobin level (checked with HemoCue, HemoCue AB, Sweden) were recorded on admission to the clinic and when the patient was assessed for discharge (one month after admission).</s><s>Pregnancy testing was done on admission.</s><s>As the prevalence of malaria in this part of Bangladesh is extremely low, screening for malaria was restricted to vulnerable groups: age &lt;2 or &gt; 60 years and pregnant women, and to suspected malaria cases: patients with acute high fever (&gt;39°C) or low hemoglobin (&lt;8 g/dL).</s><s>Routine HIV testing was not conducted due to the very low prevalence of HIV infection in this population.</s></p><p><s>Patients with confirmed primary VL were treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome, Gilead Pharmaceuticals, Foster City, CA, USA) using a total dose of 15mg/kg divided into three individual doses of 5 mg/kg: at admission (day 0); 24 hours after this dose, and five days after the first dose.</s><s>Patients were routinely hospitalized for one day, or longer if severely ill.</s><s>Patients showing a good clinical response (feeling well, resolution of fever, regression of spleen, and improvement of Hb <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>) were discharged from treatment after an assessment at 1 month.</s><s>If there had not been a good clinical response, the possibility of treatment failure was checked by test-of-cure.</s><s>Test-of-cure was by microscopy of Giemsa-stained smear of splenic aspirate.</s><s>Patients who had missed any of the three doses were registered as "defaulted".</s><s>No parasitological test of cure was done routinely for primary VL cases.</s><s>Patients presenting with VL relapse were treated with AmBisome (3 doses of 15mg/kg if their primary VL had not been treated with AmBisome, 5 doses of 25mg/kg if previously treated with AmBisome) followed by a test-of-cure after 28 days.</s><s>Clinical presentation of relapse VL tends to be less severe but, in non-HIV-infected relapse patients, signs and symptoms remain typical (prolonged undulating fever, splenomegaly, anemia, weight loss).</s><s>Diagnosis of VL relapse was confirmed parasitologically (by microscopy of Giemsa-stained smear of splenic aspirate).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up</head><p><s>All patients were invited to attend a clinical follow-up appointment at 6 and 12 months after treatment or if ill health occurred.</s><s>At each follow-up appointment a general clinical examination was done, including recording of temperature, spleen size and hemoglobin level.</s><s>Outcome at each visit was recorded as: clinically cured (no signs or symptoms of systemic disease); sick but not VL (patients that were sick at the moment of the follow-up, but did not present signs and symptoms or clinical history suggestive of VL relapse); relapse (all patients with signs and symptoms of VL, confirmed by spleen aspirate microscopy if there were no contra-indications for splenic aspiration: spleen size &gt;3cm below left costal margin, signs of active bleeding, increased bleeding and clotting time, severe anemia, jaundice, pregnancy, patient unable to remain still); or death.</s><s>If not attending for follow-up, community health workers actively searched for the patient; if unsuccessful, the patient was classified as "lost to follow-up".</s><s>Deaths during the follow-up period were determined by health staff using verbal autopsy to gather information on the cause of death and whether it could be related to VL.</s><s>Molecular methods were not available for typing Leishmania strains in order to differentiate relapse from reinfection.</s><s>PKDL was systematically looked for during follow-up, but was not considered a VL treatment failure.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>For the measurement of effectiveness we classified treatment outcome at one month as 'initial cure' for patients whose fever had subsided and who presented with spleen regression, increased hemoglobin level and weight, and improved general condition.</s><s>Treatment outcomes at 6 and 12 months were categorized as: 'cured' (patients without sign and symptoms of VL); and 'treatment failure' (patients who had symptomatic VL relapse or who had died).</s><s>For the measurement of safety we analyzed the frequencies of reported clinical complications that could be caused by VL treatment (vomiting, bleeding, and other).</s><s>Severe adverse events (SAE) were defined as events leading to suspension or the cessation of VL treatment.</s><s>Potential determinants of relapse for which there was evidence of an association in univariate analysis were carried forward to a multivariable logistic regression model that was adjusted (as a priori confounders) for age and sex.</s><s>Predictive factors measured at discharge (one month after initiation of treatment) were adjusted for their values at baseline (admission) and all variables were added one by one to the final model.</s><s>Continuous variables measured in adults versus children, and on admission versus discharge, were compared using Student's t test.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Data</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethical approval</head><p><s>This analysis met the Médecins Sans Frontières International Ethics Review Committee criteria for a study involving the analysis of routinely collected program data.</s><s>The program utilized a recognized treatment for VL in Bangladesh, and was run in coordination with the Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare through a memorandum of understanding, which is the usual procedure for NGOs operating in this context.</s><s>All electronic data were analyzed anonymously.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>After applying the inclusion criteria, a total of 1521 patients who completed the treatment were included in our study (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The first and last admissions occurred on May 17 th 2010 and January 12 th 2013, respectively.</s><s>The last patient to complete their 12 month follow-up attended the clinic on February 10 th 2014.</s><s>Of the 1653 patients diagnosed with primary VL during this period, 40 complicated cases were transferred to tertiary care at Mymensingh Medical College.</s><s>Of the 1613 patients treated at Fulbaria during the study period, 89 received other regimens: 18 patients with 5 x 3mg/kg had (suspected) impaired renal function and were treated with a lower dose more frequently over a longer period in accordance with protocol; 61 patients were treated with a single 10mg/kg dose as a new national protocol began to be introduced in 2013; and 10 patients were treated outside protocol for reasons which were not recorded in the database.</s><s>The proportions of patients whose status was known at 6 and 12 months follow-up were 84.0%</s><s>(1278/1521) and 77.5% (1179/1521), respectively.</s><s>Data with which to analyze factors associated with risk of relapse at 12 months were available for 1106 patients.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline characteristics</head><p><s>The population was young (58.2% were &lt;18 years old) and had similar age distributions in both sexes.</s><s>The male:female ratio was approximately 1:1 across all age groups except among patients age 40+ years (3:1).</s><s>The study population appeared to be under-nourished relative to WHO standards, with a mean BMI of 17.5kg/m 2 for patients age 18 years, and a mean weight-for-height Z-score of −1.8 for patients &lt;121 cm tall (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>).</s><s>No differences in baseline characteristics were observed between patients from different geographical areas.</s><s>Adult and pediatric patients presented with similar Hb levels and spleen sizes, and were analyzed as a single patient group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p><s>During the treatment period, complications were registered as follows: bleeding 3.4% (52/ 1521); vomiting 9.5% (144/1521); and other complications (including fever, diarrheas, abdominal pain and local rash at the site of the injection) 0.4% (6/1521).</s><s>Serious adverse events (SAE) were recorded for 7 patients (0.5%).</s><s>The remainder had no SAE data, because there was no zero-reporting of adverse events.</s><s>We cannot analyze the specific details of the SAE because no extra information was recorded in patient files.</s><s>One of the SAE patients died before attending their first follow-up; of the remainder, none relapsed after 12 months of follow-up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness</head><p><s>Improvements in key clinical parameters were noted at the one month follow-up: mean Hb levels increased from 8.99 to 10.87 g/dL (mean difference 1.90 g/dL (95% CI 1.80 to 1.95),  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>A 'best case scenario' sensitivity analysis, in which we coded all patients lost to follow-up as 'cured' (16% (243/1,521) at 6 months, 22.5% (342/1,521) at 12 months), yielded a 6 month cure rate of 98.9% and a 12 month cure rate of 97.2%.</s></p><p><s>At 6 months follow-up, a total of 13 patients were diagnosed as relapse and 3 deaths were registered.</s><s>After completing the 12 month follow-up, a total of 39 patients were diagnosed as relapse (including the previous 13 cases): 29 with parasitological confirmation; 10 without (because splenic aspiration was contra-indicated).</s><s>Of these 10, none presented with lymphadenopathy.</s><s>Local staff were not trained to perform bone marrow aspirates hence, lymph or bone marrow aspirates were not taken.</s><s>No further deaths were registered.</s></p><p><s>Patients followed-up at 12 months did not differ in age, sex and clinical measures on admission and at discharge compared to patients not lost to follow-up, but patients lost to follow-up were more likely to reside in further away sub-districts, which we classified as "distant subdistricts" (27.5% versus 5.9%).</s></p><p><s>The three deaths occurred among male patients age &gt;45 years: one entered treatment with a diagnosis of complicated advanced tuberculosis that was probably the main cause of death (after completing VL treatment he remained as an inpatient and died before the first followup); one died between the second and third follow-up from social violence (according to information provided by family members); and one suffered a severe adverse event (registered as acute jaundice) after he completed treatment and died at home before the first follow-up.</s><s>This was the only case where the death could probably be attributed to VL and/or its treatment.</s></p></div>
