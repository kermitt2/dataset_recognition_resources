<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Cardiovascular diseases, including aortic aneurysms, currently represent the main cause of death in Western societies.</s><s>Especially the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is steadily increasing, especially in the last 20 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>One of the main factors for this increase in incidence is the progressive aging of the general population.</s><s>Currently the incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms is estimated to be around 5% in the general population older than 50 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>The development of abdominal aortic aneurysms is associated with different causes, which include aortic infection, disorders of connective tissues and traumatic events <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>However, in most cases, the exact initiating event and pathophysiology, underlying the development is not fully understood yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In most cases, abdominal aortic aneurysms are associated with a progressive dilation of the aortic lumen.</s><s>If this process continues, abdominal aortic rupture with fatal consequences can be the result <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In clinical practice, the screening for and the evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms can be performed using different imaging modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>These imaging modalities include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US).</s><s>Each imaging technique is associated with specific advantages and disadvantages.</s><s>MRI is unique in a sense that it enables the high-resolution 3D visualization of the aorta without the need for contrast agent or ionizing radiation.</s><s>The main disadvantage of MRI is the relatively long scan time, compared to e.g.</s><s>CT.</s><s>The main advantage of CT is that imaging can be performed with a relatively high spatial resolution in a short time, however CT angiography is dependent on the use of iodinated contrast agents.</s><s>Ultrasound has the advantage, that it is a widely distributed imaging technique available in most clinical centers.</s><s>One of its main disadvantages is the operator dependence, which is especially relevant in the context of follow up examinations.</s></p><p><s>In magnetic resonance imaging, different techniques can be used for the visualization of vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>As MR contrast agents have been recently linked to side effects such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), non-contrast enhanced techniques are gaining in popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In an experimental setting with small animals, such as mice, non-contrast enhanced techniques have several advantages.</s><s>The main advantage is that imaging can be repeated longitudinally at limitless timepoints in a single animal without the need for intervention.</s></p><p><s>Experimental mouse models are the most widely used animal models for the preclinical investigation of diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>These models enable researchers to investigate the development of diseases and the influence of genetic modulation or pharmacological therapies on disease development.</s><s>Additionally, most novel drugs are initially tested and validated in animal models prior to clinical trials.</s><s>For most preclinical studies, histological analysis is performed to evaluate and quantify in vivo changes.</s><s>However, noninvasive imaging techniques are gaining in importance.</s><s>The main advantage of such an approach is that the number of required animals for a study is dramatically reduced.</s></p><p><s>In this context morphological as well as molecular imaging methods, including PET (positron emission tomography), SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography), MRI, CT and ultrasound are the most frequently used techniques.</s><s>In this group of modalities, MRI has several advantages including a unique soft tissue contrast in combination with the 3D acquisition of morphology and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>The majority of MRI studies in mice are performed with dedicated preclinical scanners with an ultra-high field strength (4.7-16.4</s><s>Tesla).</s><s>Many institutions do not have these kind of preclinical imaging systems available as it usually requires dedicated personnel, including MR physicists, to run and maintain these systems.</s><s>Advantages in hardware development and sequence design have made it possible to perform small animal imaging in clinical MRI scanners.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we evaluated the potential of a widely available clinical 3T the MRI system for the assessment of aortic aneurysm development in a mouse model.</s><s>We used the most frequently investigated and best validated mouse model, which is based on the ApoE-/-mouse in combination with angiotensin II infusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Such a mouse model is highly relevant as abdominal aortic aneurysms represent a cardiovascular disease with severe complications.</s><s>Many aspects of this experimental model are comparable to human disease including an increased incidence of hyperlipidemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Besides hyperlipidemia, other factors such as hypertension and cystic necrosis of the aortic wall also play an important role during the development of aortic aneurysms.</s><s>Especially in the context of thoracic aortic aneurysms, a potential association with cystic medial necrosis has been described by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to test the potential and reliability of a clinical 3T MRI system for the performance of MR-angiography in a mouse model of aortic aneurysm, compared to a dedicated preclinical high resolution ultrasound imaging system.</s><s>Histological analysis was used as reference standard.</s></p></div>
