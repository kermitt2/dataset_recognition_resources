novo PTVs, but not inherited PTVs, in known CHD-associated genes, consistent with recent findings8.</s><s>Conversely, in NS-CHD we observed significant enrichment of PTVs inherited from unaffected parents in CHD-associated genes.</s><s>We identified three novel genome-wide significant S-CHD disorders caused by DNMs in CHD4, CDK13 and PRKD1.</s><s>Our study reveals distinct genetic architectures underlying the low sibling recurrence risk in S-CHD and NS-CHD.</s></p><p><s>We evaluated the burden of high confidence DNMs within S-CHD and NS-CHD trios separately (N S-CHD = 518, N NS-CHD = 847).</s><s>We classified DNMs into three distinct categories: PTVs (nonsense, frameshift and splice-site variants); missense variants (including in-frame indels); and silent mutations.</s><s>We compared the observed numbers of DNMs to those expected under a null mutational model9, across a set of manually curated CHD-associated genes, non-CHD developmental disorder associated genes and all

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>De novo enrichment analysis</head><p><s>Gene-specific mutation rates for different functional classes of single nucleotide variants (missense, silent, nonsense, canonical splice site, loss of stop codon) were computed using the methodology proposed by Samocha et al.9 and as described in Fitzgerald et al.6.</s><s>We computed the mutation rates by selecting the longest transcript in the union of transcripts overlapping the observed DNMs in that gene.</s><s>This results in conservative estimates of enrichment where the (unknown) functionally active transcript can be considerably shorter than the longest overlapping transcript in Ensembl gene build 76.</s></p><p><s>We evaluated the gene-specific enrichment of PTV and missense DNMs in the S-CHD cohort by computing its statistical significance under a null hypothesis of the expected number of mutations given the gene-specific mutation rate and the number of considered chromosomes9.</s><s>For every protein-coding gene we modeled the expected number of DNMs of consequence class j as:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_4">DNM exp, j ∼ Poiss( λ j ) λ j = μ j c</formula><p><s>with μ j being the gene-and consequence-specific mutation rate and c being the number of considered chromosomes.</s><s>For autosomal genes, c = 2n with n being the total number of S-CHD trios.</s><s>For genes on the X-chromosome c = 2n f + n m , and for genes on the Ychromosome =n m , with n f and n m being the number of trios with female and male probands respectively.</s><s>We computed the probability under this null model of finding an equal or more extreme number of de novo mutations of consequence class j, compared to the observed number in the S-CHD cohort.</s></p><p><s>We analyzed de novo missense mutations to detect clustering of mutations within genes, indicating potential gain-of-function mechanisms.</s><s>We did this by selecting the longest transcript available that contained all the source de novo variants and calculating simulated dispersions of the observed number of mutations within the gene.</s><s>The probability of simulating a mutation at a specific codon was weighed by the trinucleotide sequence-context6.</s><s>For each gene, we simulated the locations of the observed number of de novo mutations 1 million times.</s><s>We then computed, for the observed mutations and the simulations, the geometric mean of the distance between each pair of mutations as a metric of clustering.</s><s>This allowed us to estimate the probability of the observed degree of clustering given the null model of random mutations.</s></p><p><s>Fisher's method was used to combine the significance testing of mutation enrichment and mutation clustering.</s><s>This combined p-value was only generated for significance testing of all missense mutations and was not used for significance testing for de novo PTVs.</s><s>The intuition behind this is that genes enriched for PTVs will be predominantly operating by a mechanism of haploinsufficiency, which does not predict significant clustering of mutations, whereas genes enriched for other classes of functional mutations, predominantly missense mutations, could be operating by dominant negative or activating mechanisms, which are likely to be clustered at particular sites within the coding sequence of the gene.</s><s>We then declared a gene as significantly enriched for DNMs if the minimum p-value between the PTV p-value and the combined missense p-value, was below the genome-wide significance threshold.</s><s>Given the large number of tests, we assumed genome-wide significance when the probability was lower than 1.31x10 -6 , which represents a Bonferonni corrected p-value of 0.05 adjusted for 2x19,252 tests (consequence classes tested multiplied by the number of protein coding genes).</s></p><p><s>We performed the de novo enrichment analysis three times.</s><s>Firstly, we performed the analysis on the complete S-CHD cohort (as this cohort was shown to have a high burden of de novo PTVs in our previous analysis) to demonstrate the power of the approach by detecting known syndromic CHD-associated genes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">8</ref>).</s><s>Secondly, we performed the analysis on the NS-CHD cohort, not detecting any genome-wide significant hits (in accordance with the lack of genome-wide burden of DNMs in non-syndromic CHD).</s><s>Thirdly, we performed the enrichment analysis on a subset of S-CHD probands that did not carry a de novo mutation in any known mono-allelic developmental disorder gene (unresolved S-CHD, n=398).</s><s>By focusing on these "unresolved" cases with no likely diagnosis in known genes, we enrich for cases with novel causes of S-CHD, potentially increasing our power to discover novel genes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">9</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Integrated De novo and inherited variation analysis</head><p><s>To study genes which had a simultaneous enrichment of de novo mutations and rare inherited variants we performed an integrated analysis using a hierarchical Bayesian model as described and implemented in the TADA tool by He et al. 22. Hyperparameters were set according to TADA's guidelines (Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">27</ref>, Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">13</ref>).</s><s>The TADA tool ultimately outputs Bayes Factors (BFs) for each source (de novo, case/control) and consequence class.</s><s>These BFs represent the odds ratio of a given gene being a CHD risk gene versus the null hypothesis of it not conferring a risk to CHD.</s><s>BFs can simply be combined to generate a global score by multiplying them respectively.</s><s>Based on the observation that known CHD-associated genes only showed signal for either PTVs or missense variants exclusively (very few genes showed moderate signal in both), we only combined BFs (for de novo and case/control signal) within each consequence class.</s><s>We then computed Bayesian False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimates as described by He et al. 22 We finally categorized candidate genes as having strong (FDR &lt; 1%), intermediate (1%&lt; FDR &lt; 5%) and weak (5%&lt; FDR &lt; 10%) levels of confidence (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">13-14</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">28</ref>).</s><s>We annotated these genes with mouse embryonic cardiac expression, presence of a cardiac phenotype in animal knockout models, the observed cardiac phenotypes in our cohort, known associated developmental disorders, known associated cardiac phenotypes and the described inheritance mode in the literature (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">15</ref>).</s></p></div>
