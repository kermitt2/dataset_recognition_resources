[2015]</ref>).</s><s>Specifically, neurophysiological evidence primarily from non-human primates supports the involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor areas (SMA), and prefrontal cortices in the separate coding of serial order <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Amiez and Petrides, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Averbeck et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Clower and Alexander, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Ninokura et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Nieder, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Procyk and Joseph, 2001]</ref>.</s><s>There is, however, sparse evidence with regard to the neural mechanisms for serial-order coding during the learning of auditory-motor associations in the context of music performance and singing.</s><s>Here we hypothesize that in these types of behavior, dedicated neural mechanisms should monitor both the auditory and motor sources of information with regard to the serial order of the produced actions, particularly during the initial learning.</s><s>To date, this hypothesis has remained largely untested.</s></p><p><s>The primary goal of our study was to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the monitoring of serial order during sensorimotor sequence learning as revealed by alterations of auditory feedback (AAF).</s><s>To that aim, we recruited 21 participants whose task it was to explicitly learn short movement sequences on a digital piano while listening to the corresponding auditory feedback.</s><s>At the behavioral level, we hypothesized that AAF would have a different impact on the ongoing performance depending on whether AAF activated incorrect serial positions within the sequence.</s><s>Data from previous behavioral studies on this matter are contentious.</s><s>Some studies focusing on piano performance show a disruption in the accuracy of sequencing due to serial shifts of feedback (pitch error rates increase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Pfordresher and Palmer [2006]</ref>).</s><s>However, other studies using random pitch alterations, including manipulations with serial shifts of feedback, have not found changes in the error rates or other types of behavioral adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[Maidhof et al., 2010]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the extent to which auditory-feedback-based alterations of the serial order of actions disrupts learning remains to be understood.</s><s>To further clarify this matter, the present study used AAF of two kinds: AAF simulating serial order errors (alterations of serial order or ASO) and AAF with pitch values that were unrelated to the sequence contents (unrelated auditory feedback or UAF).</s></p><p><s>Until now almost all neuroimaging studies investigating the effects of AAF did not use pitch alterations that interfered with the serial order of the actions in the sequence <ref type="bibr">[Chang el al, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Maidhof et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tourville et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Zarate and Zatorre, 2008]</ref>.</s><s>One notable exception is the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study by <ref type="bibr">Pfordresher and colleagues (2014)</ref>, which used six different kinds of AAF after their pianist subjects undertook initial training on piano melodies.</s><s>This study revealed an involvement of the premotor cortex in processing delayed auditory feedback (temporal shift), and an engagement of the cerebellum and ACC in processing serially shifted feedback.</s><s>In addition, the superior temporal gyrus was involved in processing both kinds of AAF.</s><s>What remain to be investigated, however, are the neural mechanisms that update the mapping of the sensorimotor representations following serial shifts in auditory feedback during initial learning.</s></p><p><s>Elucidating the neural mechanisms involved in monitoring the acquisition of the serial order of actions during sensorimotor learning requires a time-resolved technique with a millisecond resolution.</s><s>This high temporal accuracy is relevant in the context of the fast movement rates that characterize music or singing performance (e.g., eight notes per second, Herrojo <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ruiz et al. [2009]</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to track the fast changes in neuronal oscillatory activity following AAF and to assess the neural generators engaged in monitoring the different kinds of AAF.</s></p><p><s>Two strong candidates for a neurophysiological signature of processing auditory-feedback alterations during sensorimotor learning are theta (4-7 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations.</s><s>Oscillatory activity in the theta frequency range across medial frontal or cingulate regions has been consistently associated with the processing of correct or incorrect feedback signaling an error in the performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[Cavanagh et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Luft, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, Nieuwenhuis et al., 2004]</ref>.</s><s>The main factor influencing frontal midline theta might be outcome probability, which is primarily associated with the non-phase-locked (induced) portion of theta oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[Hajihosseini and Holroyd, 2013]</ref>.</s><s>Beta oscillations are crucial during sensorimotor learning and performance, as reflected in their involvement in processing self-produced pitch errors in piano performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[Herrojo Ruiz et al., 2011]</ref>, or in sensorimotor adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[Tan et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Torrecillos et al., 2015]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, there is vast evidence linking changes in beta oscillations to the processing of different aspects of movements, such as movement-related cues, boundary elements of sensorimotor sequences or temporal intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Bartolo et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Herrojo Ruiz et al., 2014a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Iversen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Leventhal et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Oswal et al., 2012]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our specific hypotheses at the neural level were (see aforementioned references for anatomical candidates): (1) theta-band oscillations are engaged in monitoring alterations of auditory feedback of any kind (ASO and UAF); (2) beta-band oscillations specifically reflect the processing of auditory feedback alterations of the serial order; and (3) a potential dissociation between the spectral content of oscillatory activity induced by processing AAF of the ASO or UAF kind is reflected in different patterns of neuronal sources located in the temporal, cingulate, prefrontal, SMA, and cerebellar regions</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Twenty-one participants (10 females, median age 27 [ranging from 22 to 34] years; data after exclusion of 1 participant, see below) who had no intensive piano training (accumulated lifetime practice experience below 500 h) participated in the study.</s><s>All participants were right handed (Handedness score median 100, range 60-100; Oldfield 1971), had no history of neurological or psychiatric disease and received remuneration for their participation.</s><s>One participant was discarded from further analysis due to artifacts in MEG signals of the study.</s><s>Written informed consent was obtained from each participant before the experiment that was approved by the local ethics committee.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and Apparatus</head><p><s>Six different piano sequences of length between four and five notes and with isochronous timing (1 keystroke every 300 ms) were used for this study.</s><s>The pitch content for each sequence was limited to the pitch values available in the MEG-compatible keyboard, which were B, C, C # , and D; these pitch values corresponded to MIDI note numbers 60, 61, 62, and 63 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>The sequences were designed to enable different combinations of transitions between successive finger movements.</s></p><p><s>Participants had to perform the piano sequences with their dominant (right) hand on a custom-made keyboard, which was formerly part of an actual acoustic Grand Piano keyboard.</s><s>Auditory feedback was delivered following standard procedure in MEG recordings through airconducting plastic ear tubes.</s><s>The keyboard had been stripped off any ferromagnetic component and tested for MEG and MRI compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Bangert et al., 2006]</ref>.</s><s>It was connected via optical fibers to an electronic processor outside the MEG room, where the signal was A/D-converted and translated into a standard serial interface protocol (Musical Instrument Digital Interface, MIDI).</s><s>Performance information as provided by the MIDI device included time onsets of keystrokes relative to the previous event (interonset-interval or IOI [ms]), MIDI note numbers that correspond to the pitch, and MIDI velocities (in arbitrary units, a.u.).</s><s>Alterations of auditory feedback (AAF) and behavioral data acquisition were conducted using the software Visual Basic (MIDI libraries) on a Windows Computer.</s><s>The time delay between keystrokes when registered as MIDI data and the corresponding trigger in the MEG recording was in the range of 20-25 ms.</s><s>This delay was corrected in the subsequent MEG analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>Participants were explicitly taught the sequence contents and the (most comfortable) digit-to-tone mapping they should use.</s><s>Before recording of the performance or MEG data, participants had to briefly practice each sequence until an error-free performance was achieved at a selfdefined tempo for five consecutive renditions.</s></p><p><s>There was a familiarization (training) and subsequent performance session.</s><s>Both these sessions can be considered to relate to the early stage of motor skill learning as described in previous studies.</s><s>The hallmarks of the early motor skill learning stage are the rapid improvements in performance (i.e., improved timing and reduced error rates; <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dayan and Cohen [2011]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>During the familiarization session, participants completed one training block consisting of three trials of 23 s duration for each sequence type.</s><s>In each trial, participants continuously practiced a given sequence type while listening to the corresponding auditory feedback.</s><s>Performance tempo was induced by using a synchronizationcontinuation paradigm, that is, the tempo was paced prior to each trial by a metronome at 200 beats per minute (bpm, 1 keystroke every 300 ms; Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>The metronome was turned off before the trial onset.</s><s>The aim of this training condition was to ensure that participants knew the correct serial order of the actions for each sequence type to be able to play them from memory in the subsequent session of MEG recording.</s><s>In addition, we expected that this session (lasting less than 1 minute of practice per sequence type) would lead to rapid improvements in performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[Dayan and Cohen, 2011]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the performance session, one block of 15 trials of 23 s duration had to be completed for each sequence-type (5-6 min per sequence type).</s><s>Prior to each trial, the tempo was again induced by a metronome at 200 bpm.</s><s>During performance, participants listened to the auditory feedback associated to the key presses.</s><s>They were instructed to play repeatedly the sequence several times during the trial without pause.</s><s>In this session, we recorded MEG during performance.</s><s>Participants were instructed to focus their eyes at a central fixation point on the screen during playing and, in between-trials, to focus on the visual cues at the center of the screen.</s></p><p><s>The control condition was constituted by trials 1, 6, and 11, in which the auditory feedback corresponding to each key press was not modified.</s><s>Alterations of auditory feedback (AAF) were introduced in the remaining trials, and they were dissociated into two types of alterations corresponding to two experimental conditions.</s><s>Auditoryfeedback-based alterations of serial order (ASO) were introduced in trials 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14.</s><s>AAF with pitch values that did not correspond to the sequence contents (unrelated auditory feedback or UAF; with pitch values A # or D # , and MIDI note numbers 59 and 64; Note that these pitch values were one semitone lower or higher than the lowest or highest pitch values contained in the sequences, respectively; see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) were introduced in trials 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, and 15.</s><s>In the experimental conditions, the AAF was introduced randomly between every 4 th and 14 th produced note (every 8.37 [0.05] keystrokes on average).</s><s>We used this design because lower AAF rates do not lead to Experimental paradigm.</s><s>(A) Scheme of one trial of the experimental paradigm.</s><s>Time course of the presentation of the initial visual cue with the image of the piano and the block-specific sequence content, followed by the auditory cues.</s><s>The auditory cues reproduced the sequence elements for two renditions at a rate of one tone every 300 ms (200 bpm) prior to the go signal.</s><s>Participants had to begin playing the sequence renditions after the last metronome cue at the presentation of the go cue (green ellipse).</s><s>Within-trial performance was characterized by a concatenation of approximately 10 sequence renditions without large pauses.</s><s>The end of the trial after 23 s of performance was signaled by a visual cue with a red ellipse.</s><s>(B) The pitch content (and corresponding MIDI note numbers) of our custom-made MEG-compatible keyboard is displayed at the bottom.</s><s>During the experiment we used three kinds of auditory feedback.</s><s>(i) Normal auditory feedback associated with the keystroke (NAF, denoted here by the black quaver) was present in the control trials <ref type="bibr">(1, 6, and 11)</ref>.</s><s>(ii) Alterations of auditory feedback sounding as a serial order error (alterations of serial order or ASO, denoted by the blue quaver) were introduced in trials 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 14. (iii) Alterations of auditory feedback with a pitch content unrelated to the sequence (unrelated auditory feedback alterations or UAF, with pitch values A # or D # and corresponding MIDI note numbers 59 and 64; denoted by the red quaver) were introduced in trials 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, and 15.
