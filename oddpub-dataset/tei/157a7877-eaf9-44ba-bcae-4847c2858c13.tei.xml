the biological but also medical relevance and potential of human saliva <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , a comprehensive and structured analysis of salivary and pellicle proteome was needed, too.</s></p><p><s>The present study used such approach, combining a systematic review with bioinformatic analyses.</s><s>We found specific differences between pellicle and the salivary proteins, but also confirmed that proteomes were rather similar in many aspects (as one could expect given that pellicle proteome constituting a subgroup of the salivary proteome).</s></p><p><s>Surprisingly, the proteomes did not differ significantly regarding their physico-chemical properties, molecular organization or solvent accessible surface; the only difference in this regard was molecular size distribution, with pellicle proteins being significantly smaller and shorter.</s><s>The latter might be, as recruiting of salivary proteins to the enamel surface is a selective process <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> which is influenced by protein weight and shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>This selectivity might be increased by further post-translational modification and process-regulation (for example by phosphorylation of Serine, increasing the protein bond strength to hydroxyapatite 28 ).</s><s>We observed higher grade of phosphorylation (and glycosylation) in our analysis supporting the aforementioned selective regulation of molecular affinity to tooth enamel.</s><s>This finding could be relevant for potential therapeutical applications.</s><s>Additionally, the pellicle proteins showed a higher net charge under extreme pH-conditions, which leads to a higher buffer capacity in very acidic (and also very alkaline) milieus.</s><s>This increases the ionic interaction strength of proteins binding to hydroxyapatite surfaces and protects the enamel against acidic attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>Saliva proteins do not need to provide such effective buffering because this is maintained by soluble ions in the saliva.</s><s>In contrast, saliva proteins need protection against uncontrolled denaturation and decreased affinity to oral surfaces, which both is likely realized by proteins being larger in the saliva (than the pellicle).</s></p><p><s>Moreover, we found the pellicle proteome to include significantly more enzymes than the salivary proteome, with higher enzymatic activity for lyases and isomerases and higher inhibitory function for proteases in the pellicle.</s><s>Functionality of the pellicle is likely to be maintained by enzymatic activity including cross-linking and amino acid side chain modifications, while destructive mechanisms via proteases/peptidases are reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>The described side chain modifications with sugar or phosphate residues may serve as dominant substrates during pellicle maturation.</s><s>The most enriched molecular function, cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity also supports this scenario: Endopeptidases are key enzymes for protein degradation in mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In a growing proteinous layer this function is counter-productive; enzyme inhibitor activity might thus be needed to manifest a stable and functional pellicle.</s></p><p><s>Beside the molecular size and enzymatic differences, the differential potential to bind to other proteins might contribute to the functionality of the pellicle.</s><s>A high cross-linking potential has been revealed for pellicle proteins, with &gt; 75% commanding the potential to bind other proteins.</s><s>This specific feature aids the construction of structured and functional protein layers, but also assists to organize dental biofilm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Such protein-protein-complexes can further serve as anti-erosive protection of the enamel <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>We identified five proteins interacting with &gt; 50 salivary and/or pellicle proteins and which represent 59% of all discovered PPIs: Alpha-enolase and Glyceralaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase are well known enzymes in glycolysis and act as mandatory proteins in metabolism in numerous tissues and body fluids.</s><s>Our analysis also identified Serum albumin and Annexin A1 as key hubs in the pellicle interactome, both are relevant for binding various ions (which could assist dental hard tissue remineralization).</s><s>The most interacting protein was 14-3-3 zeta/delta, which has been identified as
