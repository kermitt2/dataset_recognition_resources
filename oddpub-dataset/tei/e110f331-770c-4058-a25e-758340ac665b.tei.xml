<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>It was successfully demonstrated that interventional treatment of CoA resulted in a significant decrease in IHP and EHP.</s><s>Patients with higher IHP (&gt;5W) show a significant reduction after treatment while those with low IHP (&lt;5W) are likely to retain their initial IHP.</s><s>Significantly reduced EHP can be seen as positive outcome in patients as the heart pumps blood against lower afterload pressure (MAP) after the relief of stenosis.</s><s>The increase in power efficiency (EHP/IHP) in those patients with an initial IHP &gt; 5W is mostly attributed to the reduction in IHP.</s><s>Although the pressure gradient was significantly reduced in the overall study cohort, many patients remained hypertensive shortly after the procedure.</s><s>The initial pressure gradient was not associated with (a) the IHP or (b) the reduction of IHP after interventional treatment.</s><s>Current guidelines include both, a recommendation to reduce a pressure gradient and a more general stipulation of an optimal hemodynamic situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Considering this, the analysis of a cardiac energy profile in CoA shows that these two aims are not necessarily linked and could even interfere with each other.</s><s>A lack of knowledge in CoA exists regarding the exact influences on IHP and its independency of a relevant pressure gradient.</s></p><p><s>Different parameters have been described to assess heart power.</s><s>They traditionally include the pressure-volume relationship (PV loops) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> as well as derived parameters including stroke work and power efficiency, ventricular elastance and the slope of the end-systolic pressure volume diagram (E max −myocardial contractility).</s><s>Further parameters such as power loss or energy dissipation and kinetic energy obtained from a non-invasive 4D-VENC MRI were also proposed to analyze ventricle dysfunction.</s><s>Some of the proposed parameters are based on analytical considerations or computational fluid dynamics simulations.</s><s>Lee et al. recently reviewed very detailed different energy-based approaches in congenital heart diseases affecting the right ventricle <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Older patients with chronic heart failure seem to present symptoms related to an impairment of cardiac and peripheral muscle metabolism and energetic phosphate production <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>While no clear reference values exist in the assessment of heart power EHP can be easily derived from cardiac output and mean arterial pressure resulting in approximately 1 W in adults (presuming cardiac output of 5l/min and a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg).</s><s>Taking into account a normal myocardial power efficiency of 20-30% <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> normal IHP can be approximated as between 4 and 5 W.</s><s>However, further research is required to determine the exact (disease-specific) reference ranges, and allow accurate classifications.</s></p><p><s>Cardiac MRI and catheterization are used as gold standards to assess ventricular function in clinical settings.</s><s>To overcome limitations of these methods energy-based parameters (e.g.</s><s>stroke work, efficiency and energy loss) have been proposed.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lee et al. 2015</ref> discussed a set of energy based approaches based on 4D MRI analytical method or CFD to analyze the ventricle <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally to internal and external heart power kinetic energy was explored.</s><s>The method was earlier found to be able to show the impact of the treatment on the ventricular function <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>We found, however, no significant differences between pre-and post-treatment kinetic energy curves.</s></p><p><s>A major challenge of the study was the assessment of IHP after treatment due to the absence of the post-treatment LV pressure data and to a stated increase in the pressures during the treatment procedure.</s><s>To solve this problem, the systolic pressure in the aorta was calculated from the cuff pressure measured in the arm, whereas the diastolic pressures in the aorta and in the arm were considered to be equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The method of the contraction time calculation was validated using pre-treatment data of all cases-t CS was directly measured from LV pressure curves (t CS_meas ) and calculated (t CS_calc ) according to the method described in the materials and methods.</s><s>The linear regression analysis found significant correlation between calculated and measured LV contraction times t CS_calc = 1.0529</s><s>Ã t CS_meas with a linear constant very close to 1.0 and a coefficient of determination r 2 = 0.825.</s></p><p><s>The study is limited by a relatively low number of cases with both, measured catheter pressures and a complete follow-up assessment (of 52 eligible patients 25 patients undergoing interventional treatment and 20 patients with complete follow-up assessment) with data allowing calculation of the heart power.</s><s>A statistical study power calculation using a statistical test of differences between two dependent means (matched pairs) resulted in an actual power of 0.9 in a total sample size of 15 and an effect size of 0.8.</s><s>Furthermore, the study is associated with some limitations due to methodological, physiological and algorithmic uncertainties, which could have affected the measured parameters.</s><s>The follow-up period was short and does not allow any reliable conclusions about long-term effects of treatment.</s><s>As the baroreflex in patients with aortic coarctation has been described to be altered <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> it remains unknown whether the same effects apply as in other interventionally treated hypertensive patients.</s><s>Recently, blood pressure reduction in patients after renal denervation was shown to occur as a gradual decrease that extends to at least one-year follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>However, the problem of persisting hypertension in CoA at longer-term intervals has been demonstrated before and choosing longer follow-up periods in the assessment of heart power carries the risk of bias from restenosis, especially after balloon angioplasty <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The analysis of IHP and EHP is further affected by the temporal and spatial resolution of MRI imaging and the accuracy in pressure measurements.</s><s>The acquisition of the contraction time based on catheter measured pressures in the left ventricle was in most cases influenced by the double peak artefact present at the peak systole.</s><s>To overcome this, we additionally analyzed simultaneously acquired ECG signals and tested the resulting values for the contraction time by comparison with the period (time between diastole and peak systole) assessed in the ascending aorta.</s><s>This period is always shorter than the contraction time of the ventricle due to the isovolumetric contraction phase.</s></p><p><s>Conductance catheters currently serve as a reference standard to assess pressure volume loops.</s><s>Although volume flow was obtained by MRI, pressure measurements are currently typically based on invasive catheterization in order to compute pressure volume loops, carrying the risks of non-simultaneous assessment.</s><s>In order to avoid post-interventional catheterization artefacts, where the MAP is often influenced by a the treatment procedure itself due to pain and vascular response <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, cuff pressures were used for the calculation of EHP.</s><s>The integrity of the left subclavian artery was ensured by MR imaging.</s><s>By integration of the contraction time alongside the image acquisition process, additional information such as IHP and EHP will soon be available to clinicians based exclusively on non-invasive methods.</s><s>Additional longer-term follow-up studies will contribute to a better understanding of the disease progression and pathophysiology.</s><s>Subsequent dynamic disease models in CoA are highly warranted, as morbidity and mortality often remain high even years after the reduction of the actual narrowing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Pressure gradients, as the most widespread clinical parameters in CoA, did not show any correlation to IHP.</s><s>The same is true for the reduction of a gradient, which is considered a major goal in interventional treatment: In patients in whom gradients were successfully reduced no correlation to IHP was found, raising the question of whether the reduction of pressure gradients should be the only focus of CoA interventions if they (a) cannot safely reduce the risk of arterial hypertension and (b) do not necessarily lead to optimization of the energy expenditure of the heart in all patients.</s><s>The systematic assessment of internal heart power can help in identifying those patients with the greatest potential for improvements.</s></p><p><s>These findings are promising for clinical decision making and the assessment of functional myocardial remodeling in patients with CoA, and can potentially be of use in other cardiac diseases.</s><s>Parameters can already be additional input in patient and disease specific predictions.</s><s>Although reference values of IHP, EHP and power efficiency can be derived from normal cardiac physiology further studies will be required for validation and to explore the impact of abnormalities on the tissue level and on long term patient outcome.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
