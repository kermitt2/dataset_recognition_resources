<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Cardiovascular disease has reached epidemic proportions in the elderly and remains the worldwide leading cause of death.</s><s>Human aging is typically accompanied by cardiac hypertrophic remodeling and a progressive decline of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function1,2.</s><s>Abnormal diastolic function is present in &gt;20% of the population &gt;65 years of age3.</s><s>Although less than half of all patients with diastolic dysfunction show clinical signs of congestive heart failure, even patients not meeting the diagnostic criteria are at increased risk to develop heart failure4.</s><s>No treatment has yet been shown to convincingly target and prevent age-associated diastolic dysfunction or heart failure, likely because our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying progressive deteriorations in the (ultra-)structure and function of the aging heart is incomplete.</s></p><p><s>Recent studies have revealed that autophagy, a major cellular quality control mechanism, may be able to minimize the functional decline of aging cardiomyocytes by degrading and recycling long-lived proteins, which are potentially toxic if damaged, as well as cytoplasmic components and dysfunctional organelles (in particular, damaged mitochondria)5,6.</s><s>Clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria through a specific type of selective autophagy, termed mitophagy, may be beneficial for cardiac function, because mitochondria can overproduce reactive oxygen species if they are functionally impaired and ignite lethal signalling pathways if they are permeabilized.</s><s>In view of the established longevity-extending effects of enhanced cytoprotective autophagy in model organisms, it seems plausible that autophagy might also be able to counteract cardiac aging7.</s><s>We previously discovered that the natural polyamine spermidine, a dietary compound, extends lifespan and health span through induction of autophagy in yeast, flies and worms8,9.</s><s>Dietary supplementation of spermidine delayed age-associated memory impairment in flies10, prevented motor impairment in flies elicited by transgenic expression of human α-synuclein11, and protected mice from TDP-43-associated proteinopathies12, in line with a general neuroprotective action of this polyamine.</s><s>In several model organisms, the lifespan extending and neuroprotective effects of spermidine were abolished upon inactivation of essential autophagy-related genes8,10.</s><s>Here, we explored the potential cardioprotective effects of spermidine in rodent models of physiological cardiac aging (mice) and high salt-induced congestive heart failure (rats).</s><s>We also provide evidence that dietary spermidine intake in humans inversely correlates with cardiovascular disease.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spermidine extends the lifespan of wild-type C57BL/6 mice</head><p><s>In view of the life prolonging effects of spermidine in model organisms8,9, we tested the long-term survival effects of specific polyamines in C57BL/6J wild-type female mice, which had a life-long (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>) access to drinking water supplemented with distinct polyamines.</s></p><p><s>Strikingly, spermidine-or spermine-supplemented mice had a significantly extended median lifespan as compared to control (receiving normal drinking water) or putrescinesupplemented mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b, c</ref> and Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1 and 2</ref>).</s><s>To enhance the translational potential of these findings, we administered spermidine late-in-life, (a regimen more applicable to humans) to pre-aged male and female mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>Again, we found that spermidine feeding significantly prolonged median lifespan by ~10% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</s><s>Spermidine-fed animals displayed increased circulating spermidine levels, confirming its systemic bioavailability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>).</s><s>Food and water consumption, body weight and lean/fat mass composition were similar in spermidine-fed and control groups (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>), excluding the possibility that polyamine supplementation extends lifespan by inducing a calorically-restricted state13.</s></p></div>
