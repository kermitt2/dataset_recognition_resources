<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Migraine is a highly prevalent and often disabling neurological disorder affecting 10-15% of the general population worldwide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>A typical migraine attack is characterized by unilateral head pain that is throbbing in character, aggravated by routine activity, and is moderate to severe in intensity.</s><s>During an acute attack, several migraine-associated symptoms often develop, including photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and/or vomiting, and allodynia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>o of the most common classes of pharmacological interventions to treat acute migraine attacks include nonspecific abortive treatments, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and migraine-specific treatments such as triptans, which are selective serotonin agonists.</s><s>Both classes of medication have demonstrated efficacy for migraine in adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>torolac is a mixed cyclooxygenase 1/2-inhibitor.</s><s>It is FDA approved for moderate to severe pain in an oral, intravenous, and more recently, a nasal spray (NS) formulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>NS formulations in general offer several advantages to migraine patients; these include faster absorption than oral agents as well as the ability to utilize such medication formulations even when patients are nauseated and cannot or do not want to swallow a tablet or use more invasive parenteral therapies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>While data support that parenteral ketorolac may be as effective or even more effective as some triptans and other acute abortive therapies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> no study has directly compared the less invasive, intranasal ketorolac formulation to any migraine-specific therapy.</s><s>We hypothesized that the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of 31.5 mg ketorolac NS would be comparable to that of 20 mg sumatriptan NS and greater than that of placebo.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS Trial Design and Participants</head><p><s>This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo and active comparator, crossover, non-inferiority trial conducted at a single outpatient headache center in Baltimore, Maryland from March 2013 to December 2014.</s><s>Consecutive patients who sought care for headache or in response to community advertisement were screened by headache specialists (A.S.R., P.D., and B.L.P.) and enrolled by the primary investigator (B.L.P.) or research coordinator.</s><s>Participants were eligible for the Ketorolac vs Sumatripan vs Placebo Nasal Spray (KSPN) migraine study if they were ≥18 years of age, had a history of episodic migraine (according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition 3 ) for at least 1 year, and experienced 2-10 migraine attacks per month.</s><s>Participants taking migraine preventative medication were allowed to enter the study provided that their prescribed daily dose had not changed during the 3 months prior to enrollment and throughout the study period.</s></p><p><s>Participants were excluded if they had contraindications to NSAIDs or triptans, including basilar and hemiplegic migraine, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, use of any ergotamine-containing medication or monoamine oxidase inhibitor, classification as treatment resistant by the investigator, chronic pain disorders other than migraine, bleeding dyscrasias, chronic renal or hepatic impairment, substance abuse, opioid use in the past two months, chronic pulmonary disorders including nasal polyps and asthma, and a history of upper respiratory tract infection or other respiratory tract condition that could interfere with absorption or assessment of adverse effects, history of nasal surgery.</s><s>Based on the information provided, participants excluded had similar characteristics as those included for randomization.</s></p><p><s>Participants were required to be headache free for at least 48 hours prior to utilization of study drug and were instructed to administer the study medication when they experienced a migraine attack with moderate or severe pain.</s><s>Rescue medications were permitted 2 hours after study treatment and included: sumatriptan 20 mg NS, sumatriptan 100 mg oral, sumatriptan 4 mg subcutaneously, ketorolac 10 mg orally, antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine 25 mg orally) and/or dopamine antagonists (eg, metoclopramide 10 mg orally).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomization and Masking</head><p><s>Participants were randomized using computer-generated lists by a research pharmacist, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one of six sequences of ketorolac NS 31.5 mg, sumatriptan NS 20 mg, or placebo NS in blocks of 6 to treat three acute migraine attacks.</s><s>Treatment sequences were as follows: (1) ketorolac NS, sumatriptan NS, placebo NS, (2) ketorolac NS, placebo NS, sumatriptan NS, (3) sumatriptan NS, ketorolac NS, placebo NS, (4) sumtriptan NS, placebo NS, ketorolac NS, (5) placebo NS, ketorolac NS, sumatriptan NS, (6) placebo NS, sumatriptan NS, ketorolac NS.</s><s>Thus, participants switched study drugs with each attack, such that each participant received active drug for two of the three treated attacks (sumatriptan NS for one, ketorolac NS for the other active treatment) and placebo for one of the three treated attacks.</s><s>Study drug was prepared at each visit by the research pharmacy staff following the randomization sequence where the drug was prepared and delivered in a double-blinded fashion as described below.</s><s>All participants, study investigators, and study site personnel, other than the research pharmacist, were blinded to treatment allocation throughout the study.</s><s>Unblinding took place after data collection was complete.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p><s>A double-dummy design was utilized given that sumatriptan NS is administered by administering one spray in one nostril and ketorolac NS is administered by providing one spray in each nostril.</s><s>For each treated attack participants utilized two study treatments (A and B), with study treatment A being administered as one spray in each nostril and study treatment B being administered as one spray in one nostril.</s><s>Participants randomized to ketorolac NS administered ketorolac NS as treatment A and placebo NS study as treatment B. Participants randomized to sumatriptan NS administered placebo NS as treatment A and sumatriptan NS as treatment B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The KSPN migraine study was a phase 4, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover, comparative efficacy study evaluating ketorolac NS vs sumatriptan NS vs placebo NS for acute migraine therapy.</s><s>Both ketorolac and sumatriptan NS treatments were effective for acute migraine treatment.</s><s>As compared to placebo, both ketorolac NS and sumatriptan NS were superior for the primary endpoint of 2-hour pain relief, as well as several secondary endpoints including 2-hour pain freedom, 2-hour freedom from photophobia, time-to-pain relief, and 24-hour SPR.</s><s>In addition, acute abortive therapy with ketorolac NS was superior to placebo for 2-hour freedom from nausea and photophobia as well as for both the 24-hour and 48-hour SPR and pain freedom secondary end-points.</s><s>As with intranasal triptan formulations, the current findings support that ketorolac NS may be appropriate to consider in migraine patients with nausea or rapid onset of moderate to severe attacks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Additionally, this study supports that ketorolac NS may be an appropriate consideration for those patients who prefer or need a non-triptan NS abortive agent.</s></p><p><s>Although intravenous and intramuscular ketorolac have level B level of efficacy for acute migraine, nasal formulations of ketorolac for migraine are currently only level C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Only one previous study has evaluated the efficacy of an intranasal formulation of ketorolac for the acute treatment of migraine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>In this prior multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=158), Pfaffenrath et al evaluated intranasal ketorolac tromethamine, containing 6% lidocaine (ROX-828) as compared to placebo for the treatment of acute migraine.</s><s>Both studies included episodic migraine participants with a headache frequency ranging between 2-8 headache days per month in the Pfaffenrath study and 2-10 headache days per month in the current study.</s><s>In contrast to the current study, 2-hour pain freedom was the primary endpoint in the Pfaffenrath et al study, and was not different in those treated with intranasal ketorolac with lidocaine as compared to placebo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>In the KSPN study, 18.4% of those treated with placebo achieved 2-hour pain freedom, as compared to 43% of those treated with ketorolac NS (P=.004) and 37% of those treated with sumatriptan NS (P=.046).</s><s>However, in both studies 2-hour pain-relief was greater than placebo for the ketorolac NS formulation.</s><s>In the Pfaffenrath et al study, 52% of those treated with ROX-828 achieved 2hour pain relief as compared to 32% for placebo. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>In the KSPN migraine study, 72% of those treated with ketorolac NS and 69% of those treated with sumatriptan NS achieved 2hour pain relief as compared to 39% of those treated with placebo.</s><s>Both studies also demonstrated a significant reduction in nausea.</s><s>While the two studies had largely similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, it is possible that subtle differences in the study design of each of these studies contributed to the differences for 2-hour pain relief.</s><s>In the KSPN migraine study, the ketorolac formulation did not include lidocaine.</s><s>Additionally, the KSPN migraine study criteria included exclusion of opioid use in the prior 2 months before enrollment, and thus may have limited inclusion of some treatment resistant participants.</s></p><p><s>There are several limitations and strengths of the KSPN migraine study.</s><s>While the total number of participants enrolled in this single site study was relatively small (n=54), the cross-over designed allowed for evaluation of over 150 acute migraine attacks and helped to reduce participant variation, such as can occur in multicenter studies and those with parallel treatment arm designs.</s><s>Additionally although only one primary outcome was set, a wide range of important secondary outcome parameters were a priori specified and evaluated.</s><s>Finally, the most common adverse effects reported for both ketorolac NS and sumatriptan NS were nasal burning (ketorolac&gt;sumatriptan) and an unusual taste (sumatriptan&gt;ketorolac).</s><s>Both were mild to moderate for the majority of patients treated with active treatments.</s><s>Further, although 3.9% of participants reported severe nasal burning with ketorolac NS, no participants withdrew from the study due to this side effect.</s><s>In the previous trial evaluating ROX-828 vs placebo, nasal discomfort was also the most common adverse event, despite the inclusion of lidocaine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>Thus, while it is possible that research personnel and participants in the KSPN study may have been able to "guess" which treatment was utilized based on the presence of nasal burning and dysgeusia, given these symptoms were reported by both active treatment arms as well as those given placebo we do not believe it substantially affected the blinding of this study.</s></p><p><s>The KSPN migraine study demonstrates that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory NS formulation of ketorolac is superior to placebo and is non-inferior to the triptan NS formulation of sumatriptan for the acute abortive treatment of moderate to severe migraine.</s><s>As with triptan intranasal formulations, intranasal ketorolac may be particularly appropriate to consider for acute abortive migraine treatment when nausea or oral medications are not able to be used, and additionally offers an effective alternative for those who cannot or do not want to use a triptan NS.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1
