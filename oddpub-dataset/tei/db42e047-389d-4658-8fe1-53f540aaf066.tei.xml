therefore applicability to other non-Caucasian ethnicities needs to be elucidated.</s><s>In general, the molecular mechanism by which altered ACE concentrations, ACE genotype and ACE inhibitors affect glucose metabolism require clarification, as they are poorly understood.</s><s>A broadly based understanding will create the basis to elucidate the interplay between ACE and dietary fat and its impact on glucose metabolism.</s><s>Another aspect which deserves further investigation is the quality of fat.</s><s>The high fat dietary pattern in the NUGAT study was characterized by the emphasis on saturated fats (18% of 45% energy from total fat) from meat and whole-milk products.</s><s>Dairy fat intake was inversely associated with markers of glucose metabolism in a Swedish study <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, it would be important to evaluate the effects of fat quality on the gene-diet interaction.</s></p><p><s>Our data showed that markers of glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes risk were significantly influenced by interactions between the ACE rs4343 variant and dietary fat intake and suggested that homozygous carriers of the G-allele responded unfavorably to high fat diets with increased risk for altered glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes.</s></p></div>
