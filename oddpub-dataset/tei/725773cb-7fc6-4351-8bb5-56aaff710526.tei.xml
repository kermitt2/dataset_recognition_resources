<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Area</head><p><s>The study was performed in the district of Miandrivazo in Western Madagascar in 2010.</s><s>It is an area mainly of subsistence rice farming, with scattered tobacco farming.</s><s>Five villages were included that had similar socioeconomic conditions and healthcare services.</s><s>At the time of the study, the national antischistosomal treatment program had not reached the district.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Design and Population</head><p><s>A community-based cross-sectional study was performed among women 15-35 years of age.</s><s>They had lived in the villages for &gt;5 years and had not been treated for schistosomiasis in the past 2 years.</s><s>Women who were pregnant or naive to sexual intercourse were excluded.</s><s>On the basis of microscopy findings in 3 urine specimens, women were divided into the following 3 groups: women who had a mean egg count of &gt;50 ova per 10 mL urine and were from 4 villages where schistosomiasis is highly endemic (hereafter, the high-intensity group); women who had a mean egg count of &lt;20 ova per 10 mL and were from the same villages as those in the high-intensity group (hereafter, the low-intensity group); and microscopy-negative women from a village where schistosomiasis has a low endemicity (hereafter, the microscopy-negative group).</s><s>Eligible women who consented to the gynecological study were consecutively enrolled by convenience until the planned number of participants was reached (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Medical History, Gynecological Inspection, and Colposcopy</head><p><s>A female physician (F.</s><s>R.) performed a reproductive health interview in the Malagasy language.</s><s>Gynecological examination and colposcopy took place in a custom-built mobile clinic.</s><s>Women menstruating on the day of the examination were asked to come back later.</s><s>Two female physicians (E.</s><s>F.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This population study describes a lesion in the cervicovaginal mucosa that has not been reported to date.</s><s>We have named it "rubbery papule" because of its firm consistency and spherical and papulous appearance.</s><s>The rubbery papule constitutes severe eosinophilic inflammation, mostly around viable-looking ova.</s><s>Women with this lesion tested positive for Schistosoma by PCR, which is in agreement with the presence of viable ova.</s><s>The prevalence of the rubbery papules was the highest in teenagers.</s><s>This could suggest recent infection and lesions in an early stage.</s><s>Sandy patches constituted more-moderate inflammation, and not all patients had PCR-positive findings, as has been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Genital contact bleeding, rubbery papules, and sandy patches were found significantly more often in patients with urine specimens positive for S. haematobium eggs.</s><s>The sandy patches have been described in previous studies on the African continent.</s><s>To our knowledge, our study in Madagascar is the first to document rubbery papules in the genitalia.</s><s>Morphologically similar lesions were observed in the bladder by cystoscopy in Egypt in 1946 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Subsequent studies have mentioned "whitish or yellowish, occasional confluent, mucosal dots" found in the genital region of humans and primates <ref type="bibr">[16, p 442]</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that these were rubbery papules.</s><s>A review of 4000 images by some of the current authors, from previous studies in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, showed no such lesions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>It is therefore possible that local Malagasy factors might have affected the manifestations of FGS, such as the schistosome strain, the genetic differences between Malagasy and the Africa mainland human populations, or local nutritional factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The coexistence of tissue eosinophilia and viable ova indicate ongoing ova deposition from living worms, whereas the calcified ova and moderate inflammation indicate that ova were deposited some time ago.</s><s>This pattern concurs with the grading scale for bladder pathologies published by Von Lichtenberg et al in the 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>.</s><s>Although good effect of treatment has been reported for urinary bladder pathology, it has been suggested that the sandy patches are established in childhood and are a result of a chronic infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>People living in Schistosoma-endemic areas are often exposed from infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Women have had worms (and possibly also lesions) for many years by the time they undergo a gynecological investigation.</s><s>The finding of calcified ova, therefore, could indicate that the sandy patches might be a manifestation of childhood infection and that it may not be easy to treat as has been indicated previously in one report <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Women in the high-intensity group had a higher probability of having genital specimens positive for Schistosoma by PCR, rubbery papules, and sandy patches.</s><s>This might indicate contamination from the urinary tract.</s><s>However, the specimens were taken by a syringe with an extension tip in the inner third of the vagina.</s><s>Furthermore, some cases with Schistosoma-urine negative specimens (ie, women with no ova and no Schistosoma DNA in urine) were found to have Schistosoma DNA in genital specimens.</s><s>This may indicate that the 2 organs need not be affected synchronously.</s><s>The genital tests were better in diagnosing FGS than PCR or microscopy of urine specimens, although contamination between the organs cannot be precluded.</s><s>Even so, this study confirms that the genital sampling methods and PCR analysis are not sufficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Because of ethical concerns, only women with sandy patches, rubbery papules, and/or malignant-looking lesions underwent biopsy.</s><s>This posed a major limitation to the study and made Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.
