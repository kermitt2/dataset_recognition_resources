(B) The inverted conformation of the ligand. The ligand's a-carboxylate contacts the backbone amine of S654, and its g-carboxylate contacts R485. The ligand's amine is coordinated to E705. P478 has moved upward to accommodate a water molecule that also contacts the ligand's amine. (C) The two-dimensional order parameter (x 1 , x 2 ) used to characterize large-scale conformational transitions in the GluA2 LBD. x 1 and x 2 each indicate the distance between the centers of mass of the clusters of atoms shown in blue and green, respectively. (D) (x 1 , x 2 ) measures the degree of cleft closure for the LBD in apo (blue) and ligand-bound conformations. The ligand occupies either the crystallographic (orange) or the inverted (green) poses. Each point represents a snapshot taken every 120 ps from simulations of the monomer system at 3.9 mM glutamate concentration (T mon1,4-8 ). The marginal histograms indicate distribution densities.
