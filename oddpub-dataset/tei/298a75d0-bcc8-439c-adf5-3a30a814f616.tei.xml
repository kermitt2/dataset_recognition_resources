<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>of results from the 13 contributing studies (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) identified 99 genomic regions (i.e.</s><s>loci) located &gt;1 Mb apart containing at least one genetic variant associated with allergic disease at a genome-wide significance threshold of 3x10 -8 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Based on approximate conditional analysis5, 136 genetic variants in these 99 loci had a statistically independent association with disease risk (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>Henceforth, we refer to these as "sentinel risk variants", which either represent, or are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with, a causal functional variant.</s><s>These included 86 (in 50 loci) located &lt;1 Mb from risk variants reported in previous GWAS of allergic disease (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s><s>Of note, 23/86 sentinel variants were in low linkage disequilibrium (LD, r 2 &lt;0.05) with the previously reported risk variants, indicating that they represent novel associations in these loci.</s><s>The remaining 50 sentinel variants (in 49 loci) were located &gt;1Mb from previously reported associations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>), of which 17 were in low LD with nearby variants reported for other diseases or traits (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>).</s><s>Eighteen loci had multiple independent association signals (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>Altogether, we identified 73 (50+23) genetic associations with allergic disease that are new, a substantial increment over the 89 associations reported previously (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">8</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As expected from a study design that maximized power to identify shared risk variants6, we found that 130 of the 136 sentinel variants had similar allele frequencies in case-only association analyses that compared three non-overlapping groups of adults: those who reported suffering from asthma only (n=12,268), hay fever only (n=33,305) or eczema only (n=6,276) (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">9</ref>).</s><s>There was thus no evidence that these 130 variants have differential effects on the three individual diseases.</s><s>The six variants with evidence for stronger effects in one allergic disease when compared to the other two were located in five known allergy risk loci (e.g.</s><s>FLG and GSDMB, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>On the other hand, many sentinel variants <ref type="bibr">(26 or 19%)</ref> were also associated with the age at which symptoms of any allergic disease first developed (n=35,972, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">10</ref>), the allele associated with a higher disease risk being always associated with earlier age-of-onset (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>For 18 of those 26 variants, the effect on age-of-onset was not significantly different between individual diseases (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">10</ref>), suggesting that they influence the age at which symptoms first develop for all three diseases.</s></p><p><s>We then used LD-score regression analysis7 (see Methods) to quantify the liability-scale heritability of the three individual diseases that was collectively explained by the 136 top associations in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT, up to n=20,350), which was not part of the discovery meta-analysis.</s><s>This was found to be 3.2% for asthma, 3.8% for hay fever and 1.2% for eczema, respectively representing about a fifth, a sixth and a tenth of the overall heritability of each disease that is explained by common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Supplementary <ref type="bibr">Table 11)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the inheritance of risk alleles at these loci partly explains why these three conditions coexist.</s></p><p><s>To understand the biological consequences of allergy risk variants, we then identified plausible target genes of the 136 sentinel variants.</s><s>There were 5,739 transcripts annotated near (+/-1 Mb) sentinel variants, including 2,569 protein-coding genes.</s><s>For 132 of these transcripts, the nearby sentinel variant was in high LD (r 2 ≥0.8) with either a non-synonymous SNP (22 genes; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">12</ref>) or a sentinel expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) identified in relevant tissues or cell types (additional 110 genes; Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">13 and 14</ref>).</s><s>We refer to these 132 transcripts as plausible target genes, which were located in 54 of the 99 risk loci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">15</ref>).</s><s>Studies that confirm the target gene predictions and identify the underlying functional variants are warranted; genes that could be prioritized for functional follow-up include 78 identified using a more conservative LD threshold (r 2 ≥0.95;</s><s>Supplementary Table <ref type="table">15</ref>) or 61 predicted to be the likely targets based on independent evidence from publicly available functional data (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">16 and 17</ref>; see Methods for details).</s><s>Of note, 79 (60%) of the 132 plausible target genes have not previously been co-cited with allergy-related terms (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">15</ref>), and so potentially represent novel key contributors to disease pathophysiology (examples in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, based on data from the GTEx consortium8, we identified broad tissue types in which the plausible target genes were disproportionally expressed, using the Tissue Specific Expression Analysis (TSEA) approach described previously9.</s><s>We excluded genes located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or not present in the TSEA GTEx database, leaving 112 plausible target genes for analysis.</s><s>When compared to the remaining 17,671 non-MHC genes in the genome, we found that the list of plausible targets was enriched for genes specifically expressed in whole-blood and lung (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>).</s><s>Both associations remained significant (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) after restricting the background gene list to the subset of 12,804 non-MHC genes with eQTLs reported in the same studies used to identify the plausible target genes (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">13</ref>).</s><s>These results indicate that the plausible targets are enriched for genes preferentially expressed in whole-blood and lung, and that this is unlikely to arise because the plausible targets were also enriched for genes with eQTLs in those tissues.</s></p><p><s>The enrichment in whole-blood and lung expression could be a general feature of arbitrary genes located near the sentinel risk variants.</s><s>To address this possibility, we determined how often the enrichment observed with the plausible target genes was exceeded when analyzing 1,000 lists of random genes.</s><s>When genes were randomly selected from the same 98 non-MHC allergy risk loci identified in the meta-analysis, matching on the number of plausible target genes identified per locus (range 0 to 11) and in total (i.e.</s><s>112), the enrichment observed in whole-blood was not exceeded in any of the 1,000 random lists when considering results for all 25 tissues tested (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">18</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were observed for lung.</s><s>For comparison, arbitrary genes were also selected from 2 Mb loci drawn at random from the genome, or simply from all genes in the genome, and results were very similar (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">18</ref>).</s><s>Randomly selecting genes from the subset with eQTLs also had no impact on the results (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, we conclude that the enrichment in expression observed in whole-blood and lung was specific to the genes identified as plausible targets of sentinel risk variants.</s></p><p><s>To identify specific cell types that were likely to contribute to the enrichment in wholeblood, we used an orthogonal approach10 that quantifies tissue-specific enrichments in SNP heritability rather than in gene expression.</s><s>Specifically, this approach quantifies the trait heritability that is explained by SNPs that overlap cell type-specific regulatory annotations measured by the ENCODE project in 100 different cell types.</s><s>In this analysis, the strongest enrichment in SNP heritability was observed for regulatory annotations measured in helper T cells (including Th17, Th1 and Th2), regulatory T cells, CD4 + and CD8 + memory T cells, CD56 + NK cells and CD19 + B cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">19</ref>).</s><s>These results are consistent with previous findings11 and the widely documented contribution of these T cell subsets to allergic responses.</s><s>Similar results were obtained after removing the 136 top associations from our GWAS results (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">19</ref>), indicating that the observed enrichments extend beyond genome-wide significant SNPs.</s><s>These results demonstrate that genetic risk variants shared between asthma, hay fever and eczema, including but not limited to the ones that reached genome-wide significance, operate to a large extent by modulating gene expression in cells of the immune system.</s></p><p><s>To help understand how the sentinel variants might influence immune cell function, we then identified biological processes over-represented amongst the plausible target genes when compared to the rest of the genes in the genome (MHC excluded), using GeneNetwork12.</s><s>As for the analysis of tissue-specific enrichment in gene expression, for each specific biological process, we compared the enrichment observed with the list of plausible target genes with that observed with 1,000 lists of genes randomly drawn from the same allergy risk loci.</s><s>After correcting for the 3,770 biological processes tested, we found 35 pathways for which the enrichment observed with the plausible target genes was exceeded in &lt;5% of the random gene lists (Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">20</ref>).</s><s>These included biological processes related to T and B cell activation, B cell proliferation and isotype switching, interleukin (IL-) 2 and IL-4 production, confirming a key role for the sentinel variants and the likely target genes on lymphocyte-mediated immunity.</s><s>Other noteworthy enrichments were observed for pathways related to induction of cell death, lipid phosphorylation and NK cell differentiation.</s></p><p><s>Consistent with a widespread effect of allergy risk variants on immune cell function, many sentinel risk variants have been reported to associate with other immune-related traits, notably blood cell counts (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">21</ref>) and auto-immune diseases (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">22</ref>).</s><s>The genetic overlap with auto-immune diseases was not restricted to sentinel variants, as evidenced by significant positive genetic correlations with celiac disease, Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease obtained after excluding the 136 top associations from our GWAS results (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">23</ref>).</s><s>Other significant genetic correlations were observed for obesity-and depression-related traits, both previously suggested by twin studies13.</s><s>The former provides support for a role of allergy risk variants in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis.</s></p><p><s>We then investigated whether any of the plausible target genes identified could potentially represent a new opportunity for drug repositioning, as shown by others14.</s><s>We found that 29 genes have been or are being considered as drug targets, including nine for the treatment of allergic diseases (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">24</ref>), four for auto-immune diseases (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">25</ref>) and 16 for other diseases (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">26</ref>), mostly cancer.</s><s>Therefore, for 20 genes, drugs currently in development for other indications might influence biological mechanisms underlying allergic disease.</s><s>For six of these genes, the effect on gene expression of the allergy protective allele (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">27</ref>) and the existing drug matched (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), suggesting that the latter might attenuate (and not exacerbate) allergy symptoms, and so could be prioritized for pre-clinical testing.</s></p><p><s>Finally, based on data from the BIOS consortium15 (n=2,101), we found that a substantial fraction of target genes (36 or 27%) had a nearby CpG site for which methylation levels were significantly correlated with mRNA levels in blood, independently of SNP effects (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">28</ref>).</s><s>This observation raises the possibility that environmental effects on the methylation state of these CpGs might influence target gene expression and, by extension, allergic disease risk.</s><s>Well powered studies that address this possibility are warranted.</s><s>In exploratory analyses, we tested the association between five established risk factors for allergic disease (see Methods) and the methylation state of expression-associated CpGs for those 36 genes (largest n=1,221).</s><s>We observed only one significant association, between smoking and the methylation state of PITPNM2 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">29</ref>), which was reported in a previous study16.</s><s>These results indicate that smoking might influence the risk of allergic disease partly by modulating the methylation state of expression-associated CpGs for PITPNM2, a PYK2-binding protein17 potentially involved in neutrophil function18,19.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we substantially increased the number of known risk variants for allergic disease through a large GWAS of a multi-disease phenotype defined based on information from three genetically correlated diseases, asthma, hay fever and eczema.</s><s>With a few exceptions, the variants identified had similar effects on the individual disease entities.</s><s>The risk variants, and their likely target genes, are predicted to influence overwhelmingly the function of immune cells.</s><s>Novel drugs for allergy are proposed based on genomics-guided drug repositioning.</s><s>Finally, our results raise the possibility that environmental factors such as smoking might influence allergic disease risk through modulation of target gene methylation.</s></p></div>
