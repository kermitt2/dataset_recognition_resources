<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4.">Discussion</head><p><s>UC is a debilitating chronic disease that often affects young patients.</s><s>Not all patients respond to biologic therapy, which can be associated with significant side effects.</s><s>Our 12-week interim results from a large cohort of such UC patients show a treatment benefit with Adacolumn in UC patients with limited other therapeutic options.</s><s>Nearly 40% of the patients in this trial achieved remission at Week 12 and over half achieved a response; furthermore, 23% of patients achieved steroid-free remission, with 36% achieving steroid-free response.</s><s>Additional outcomes such as quality of life, CAI, and EAI also improved at Week 12 relative to baseline.</s><s>The levels of calprotectin, which serve as a marker of inflammation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> also decreased over the course of the study.</s><s>The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate intensity, and no new safety signals were observed.</s></p><p><s>The results of this interim analysis are consistent with previous studies; a pooled meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials showed that response or remission was achieved more often in UC patients treated with GMA [risk reduction 1.41; p = 0.01] than in patients treated with conventional therapy, and that after 12 weeks significantly higher remission rates were observed (risk reduction 1.22 [95% CI 1.04, 1.43]). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Another meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly improved response rate (odds ratio 2.88 [95% CI 1.60, 5.18]) and remission rate (odds ratio 2.04 [95% CI 1.36, 3.07]) as a result of GMA apheresis compared with conventional pharmacotherapy in patients with active moderate-to-severe UC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> In a systematic review of the clinical trial literature, it was shown that GMA apheresis appears to be of some benefit in moderateto-severe UC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> suggesting further randomised controlled trials are required in patients with active disease.</s><s>In a randomised controlled trial enrolling a moderate-to-severe steroid-dependent/refractory UC population, the non-inferiority of 5 and 10 Adacolumn treatments was established after 12 weeks, with clinical remission observed in 44% and 40% of patients, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>These data are in contrast to a randomised trial of Adacolumn, in which patients with moderate-to-severe active UC received either Adacolumn or sham apheresis for 9 weeks.</s><s>Clinical response was observed in 44% of Adacolumn-treated patients and 39% of sham-treated patients, a difference that was not statistically significant.</s><s>However, a post hoc analysis found significant differences in clinical remission and response in patients with modified Riley scores of 7, denoting histologically active disease with erosions or ulcerations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>This suggests   that the effect of apheresis is more apparent in UC patients with active disease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>ince other therapies such as anti-TNF-α are associated with risk of serious infections, lymphoma, and associated mortality, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> the favourable safety profile of Adacolumn as observed in the past and in present studies may therefore be of benefit in these patients.</s><s>Common fears of patients with ulcerative colitis include adverse events associated with medications, which can affect adherence to treatments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s>MA itself is not without adverse events; in previous studies, shivering, nausea, headaches, 'flushing', and fever have been reported in 5-33% of treated patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>The most common treatment-emergent adverse event observed in the present study was headache.</s><s>Due to the nature of GMA, vascular access adverse events pose a potential problem for treatment administration; in this study, 8.2% of patients experienced vascular access complications, defined as the inability to cannulate or no flow.</s><s>The events observed in this study were however mild-to-moderate; a non-drug therapy such as Adacolumn with this safety profile may be an attractive option for patients.</s></p><p><s>The ART population was composed of patients who are difficult to treat and for whom the current clinical guidelines are of less use due to a paucity of therapeutic options.</s><s>A limitation of this study was the single-arm design, meaning that statistical comparisons could not be performed.</s><s>A placebo control would have been included under ideal circumstances, but the clinical setting of the patient population provided the rationale for the ART study design, due to the difficulty of performing randomised trials in patients with urgent medical need.</s><s>Positive data have been produced from clinical trials of anti-TNF-α therapies, with long-term steroid-free remission rates of 26% and 13.3% at 12 months, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and vedolizumab every 8 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe UC which resulted in 12-month remission and steroid-free remission rates of 42% and 31%, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>owever, despite these data there still exists a sizeable population of patients that require effective treatment because of a lack of response to these drugs; results from the full 96-week ART study will provide insight into the long-term effectiveness of Adacolumn treatment.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, Adacolumn treatment provided a positive and safe clinical benefit in terms of UC remission and response after 12 weeks in a difficult-to-treat patient subgroup who have limited effective treatment options.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>ASSESSMENTSFigure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Study design [a] and participant flow [b].</s><s>AE, adverse event;
