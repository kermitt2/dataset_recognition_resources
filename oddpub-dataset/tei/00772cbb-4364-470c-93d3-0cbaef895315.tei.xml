<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III Summary</head><p><s>Phosphoinositides (PIs) are a minor class of short-lived phospholipids that serve as crucial signposts of membrane identity.</s><s>Thereby, PIs full fill important functions in cell signaling and membrane transport.</s><s>PI 4-phosphates such as phosphatitylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) and phosphatitylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P 2 ) are enriched at the plasma membrane (PM), on secretory organelles and lysosomes, while PI 3-phosphates, i.e. phosphatitylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P), are a hallmark of the endosomal system.</s></p><p><s>Directional transport between these compartments, thus, requires regulated PI conversion.</s></p><p><s>However, PI conversion in exit from PI(3)P-enriched endosomes en route to the PI(4)P-and PI(4,5)P 2 -positive PM in endosomal recycling remained unknown.</s></p><p><s>Here, we report that cargo exit from endosomes requires removal of PI(3)P by the PI(3)P 3-phosphatase myotubularin 1 (MTM1), and concomitant PI(4)P synthesis by PI 4kinase type II α (PI4K2α).</s><s>Loss of MTM1 causes endosomal accumulation of PI(3)P and PI(3)P effector proteins, i.e. sorting nexins, Kif16b-mediated outward traffic of PI(3)P containing endosomes and sub-plasmalemmal accumulation of exocytosis-deficient endosomes.</s><s>As PI4K2α associates with MTM1 and thereby facilitates membrane recruitment of MTM1, these phenotypic changes are mimicked by loss of PI4K2α.</s><s>The conversion of PI(3)P-to-PI(4)P is paralleled by a switch in Rab GTPase-identity from early endosomal Rab5 to recycling endosomal Rab11.</s><s>This conversion mechanism is driven by coincident detection of Rab GTPase and PI content as well as by reciprocal interactions among its components, including the association of exocyst with PI4K2α and PI(4)P, Rab11 and with MTM1.</s><s>Thus, distinct recycling endosomal domains, characterized by PI4K2α, its lipid product PI(4)P, MTM1 and Rab11, are created destined for exocyst recruitment and subsequent exocystdependent fusion with the PM.</s><s>A similar PI conversion mechanism involving myotubularin family members may underlie cargo exit from endosomes towards late endosomes.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, MTM1 depletion and XLCNM-patient mutations are functionally correlated as patient fibroblast are exocytosis deficient and accumulate endosomal β1-integrin.</s><s>Our data, thus, suggest that defective PI conversion at endosomes may account for the disturbed muscle morphology and impaired integrin-dependent muscle attachment in developing muscle fibres in XLCNM-patients.</s><s>These integrin localization defects can be reversed by application of a Vps34-specific inhibitor and thus offer a potential avenue to combat this devastating disease.</s></p><p><s>1 Introduction 1.1 Defective PI homeostasis and membrane remodeling might cause X-linked centronuclear myopathy X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM) is a form of congenital myopathy, characterised by generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth.</s><s>Pathologically, muscle fibers from XLCNM-patients are small and round with internally located myonuclei, surrounded by an area devoid of contractile elements and an accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria.</s><s>The gene mutated in XLCNM codes for the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) 3-phosphatase myotubularin 1 (MTM1).</s><s>The most severe forms are associated with mutations resulting in MTM1 truncations or in loss of its catalytic activity.</s><s>Resembling signs of XLCNM, MTM1 knockout (KO) mice are born below Mendelian ratio, display impaired growth and progressive myopathy leading to death within 2 to 3 months after birth.</s><s>The conditional, muscle-specific MTM1 KO in mice did not impair muscle development, but structural maintenance of muscle architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Buj-Bello, Laugel et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The latter requires constant remodeling of their plasma membrane content, regulated by intracellular and exocytic membrane traffic.</s><s>Accordingly, muscle tissue from XLCNM patients or from MTM1-deficient mice displays endosomal accumulation of major cell adhesion proteins, e.g.</s><s>integrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Ribeiro, Yuan et al. 2011)</ref>, and abnormal T-tubule morphology.</s><s>Thus, defective PI(3)P turnover by loss of MTM1 might be linked to endosomal membrane traffic.</s></p><p><s>Alternatively, defective autophagic and proteasomal degradation as well as upstream signaling events in MTM1-deficient mice were proposed to be the primary cause of the muscle pathology in XLCNM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Al-Qusairi, Prokic et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Fetalvero, Yu et al. 2013</ref>), but will be discussed only briefly in the present study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.1">Exocytic membrane transport is counterbalanced by retrograde traffic</head><p><s>Anterograde membrane transport comprises secretory traffic from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and exocytic membrane traffic from endosomes to the PM.</s><s>The latter can be roughly divided into the fast and slow recycling mode from peripheral early and perinuclear recycling endosomes, respectively.</s><s>To compensate for anterograde traffic to the cell surface, lipid and proteins are endocytosed from the plasma membrane, predominantly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME).</s><s>Homotypic fusion of endocytic vesicles with each other or with pre-existing endosomes generates the early endosomal compartment.</s><s>Early endosomes can mature to late endosomes and form multivesicular bodies (MVB) en route to lysosomes for subsequent degradation.</s><s>In addition, cargo can be transported back to the TGN, directly recycle to the PM or progress through the perinuclear recycling compartment en route to the PM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Thus, anterograde and retrograde transport is connected via a continuum of sorting stations, comprising early, late and recycling endosomes.</s><s>PIs are converted as transport occurs along the secretory and endocytic routes.</s><s>Notably, no PI species has been assigned to recycling endosomes so far.</s><s>Modified from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Behnia and Munro 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As membrane traffic occurs compartmental identity has to maintained and converted from the donor compartment characteristics to match the acceptor compartment.</s><s>One crucial determinant is membrane lipid composition, most notably the predominant phosphoinositide (PI) species (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
