<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease in genetically prone individuals where multiple environmental factors can induce the inflammatory process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">1</ref> Interestingly, the specific autoimmune response is directed against a number of different antigens modified by post-translational modifications (PTMs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">2</ref> In this context, enzymatic deimination of peptide-bound arginine to citrulline by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) is considered as a key mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">3</ref></s><s>Studies in different cohorts of RA have revealed that tobacco exposure increases the risk of anti-citrullinated protein/ peptide antibodies (ACPAs) formation, especially in carriers of the shared epitope. <ref type="bibr">1 4</ref> Another PTM that has been connected to smoking is carbamylation of lysine, creating a homologous citrulline structure that is extended by a single carbon residual, also known as homocitrulline. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">5</ref></s><s>Various carbamylations are formed by the interaction of isocyanate (HNCO) with α-amino and ε-amino groups of proteins, among them, α-carbamylation, when α-amino groups of amino acids are involved, and ε-carbamylation, which is formed by the interaction of isocyanate with the ε-amino group of lysine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">6</ref></s><s>n humans, isocyanate is formed by the decomposition of urea into ammonia and cyanate, which is transformed to isocyanate.</s><s>Thus, uraemia secondary to renal diseases is a pathological state that leads to the formation of isocyanate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">7</ref></s><s>he second key reactant for isocyanate formation is thiocyanate (SCN − ), a metabolite of cyanide that is present in cigarette smoke.</s><s>Thiocyanate increases in urine, serum and saliva with the amount of cigarette smoke. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">8</ref></s><s>Moreover, passive exposure to smoke significantly increased thiocyanate levels when compared with non-exposure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">9</ref></s><s>Neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) represents a marker of inflammation and is significantly higher in smokers than nonsmokers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">10</ref></s><s>It uses H 2 O 2 to oxidise thiocyanate to cyanate that subsequently promotes protein carbamylation at sites of inflammation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">11</ref></s><s>ice immunised with carbamylated proteins (carbP) developed arthritis and a T-cell response against corresponding antigens.</s><s>Additionally, antibodies against carbP but not ACPAs were detectable in mice with collagen-induced arthritis. <ref type="bibr">12 13</ref></s><s>It was also demonstrated that sera from patients with RA contain different antibody specificities recognising either citrulline-containing or homocitrullinecontaining antigens, <ref type="bibr">14 15</ref> and that anti-carbP as well as ACPAs are detectable even before the onset of symptoms of RA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">16</ref> These findings suggest that in addition to citrullination, carbamylation represents another crucial process in the pathogenesis of RA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">17</ref> Accumulating evidence suggests an involvement of modified vimentin and anti-modified vimentin antibodies in the pathogenesis of RA. <ref type="bibr">18 19</ref> Vimentin is one of the most widely expressed mammalian intermediate filament proteins.</s><s>The vimentin network that extends from the nucleus to the plasma membrane is believed to act as a scaffold, providing cellular mechanostructural support and thereby maintaining cell and tissue integrity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">20</ref></s><s>Therefore, we hypothesised that vimentin could serve as a substrate for carbamylation from smoking ingredients and investigated the autoantibody response against different isoforms of vimentin in patients with RA.</s></p></div>

target="#b32">27</ref> The current pathogenetic model suggests citrullination of antigens in the lungs and elsewhere as a driving process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">28</ref></s><s>However, it seems that the significance of other PTMs such as carbamylation has not been recognised sufficiently so far.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we characterised the extent and the kinetics of carbamylation of vimentin as a well-known autoantigen with close association to the pathogenesis of RA.</s><s>We provided clear evidence that carbVim and not citrVim is a strong antigen that induces a B-cell response against itself and against human IgG-Fc in an animal model, thus inducing a RF-like activity.</s><s>Almost the whole spectrum of autoantibodies characteristic of RA was induced.</s><s>Moreover, in agreement with other studies, <ref type="bibr">29 30</ref> we showed that the autoimmune response against carbVim is an early event in the pathogenesis of RA.</s><s>Additionally, we proved that vimentin, as a major and wellcharacterised autoantigen in RA, does form its own class of carbamylated antigens that could be strongly recognised by antisera induced only with the corresponding antigen in an animal model.</s><s>The cross-reactions, which have been seen in carbVim-positive RA sera as well as in antisera of rabbits immunised with carbVim, could occur in ureido group-specific manner.</s><s>Furthermore, we showed that both carbamylation and citrullination are independent processes that may happen in parallel or in sequential manner.</s></p><p><s>In a mouse model, we showed that carbamylation of vimentin can be triggered by exposure to tobacco smoke and that this antigen and potentially other modified proteins are able to induce a broad immune reaction against many variants of carbP.</s><s>Additionally, a significantly increased level of anti-carbamylated antibodies was observed in smoke-exposed mice and smoking patients with RA when compared with filtered air-exposed or non-smoking controls.</s><s>However, in agreement with other studies, <ref type="bibr">25 29</ref> no association between smoking and anti-carbamylated antibody positivity was detected in patients with RA.</s><s>These findings support the idea that carbamylation in smokers and non-smokers could be induced by additional triggering factors including even passive exposure to tobacco smoke.</s><s>Nevertheless, smoking induced increased titres of carbamylated antibodies in humans and mouse models.</s></p><p><s>In our previous study on Cuban patients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">21</ref> the prevalence of IgG antibodies against carbamylated peptides of vimentin was higher (60% and almost 80% in early and established RA, respectively) than in the present study (28%).</s><s>It has been shown that the combination of major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 1 (HLA-DRB1)-shared epitope alleles and smoking is associated with RA susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">31</ref> and different genetic associations of autoantibody-positive disease subgroups was identified in relation to the presence of DRB1*04. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">32</ref></s><s>These findings suggest that the discrepancy in the frequencies of autoantibodies between different populations could be attributed to the genetic heterogeneity, as well as different environmental and behavioural factors.</s></p><p><s>Notably, the epitope recognition patterns and the coincidences of anti-carbamylated with anti-MCV antibodies suggest a strong association between these antibodies in RA.</s><s>This is in agreement with a recently described association of anti-carbP and anti-citrVim that could not be explained by cross-reactivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">33</ref></s><s>f note, a treatment-related reduction of antibody titres was less obvious for anti-carbamylated antibodies compared with all other tested antibodies.</s><s>This indicates that anti-carbamylated antibodies are produced by a distinct B-cell subset, which appears to be more treatment-resistant.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the polyclonal immune response against modified antigens in RA is restricted to citrullinated and carbamylated autoantigens, which could be involved in the pathogenesis of disease and response to therapy.</s><s>Direct or indirect exposure to tobacco smoke could have an effect by inducing carbamylation, which could trigger a pathogenic B-cell response.</s></p><p><s>Correction
