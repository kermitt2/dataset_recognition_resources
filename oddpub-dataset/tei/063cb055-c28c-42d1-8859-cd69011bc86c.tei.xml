<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Aging is accompanied by a dysregulation of the immune response with implications for health <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Developmentally-programmed thymic involution causing reduced release of naïve T-cells in adults results in the characteristic accumulation of memory T-cells and reduction of naïve T-cells over the lifecourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Protection against new infections is impaired due to a reduced naïve T-cell repertoire, and control of previouslyencountered pathogens may be impaired by senescence of the memory cells.</s><s>Thus, accumulation of memory T-cells and reduction of naïve T-cells are commonly taken as hallmarks of immunosenescence, although they mostly reflect adaptive responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Similar shifts in proportions of memory T-cells are seen as a result of infection with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, suggesting the presence of the latter as one of the major factors contributing to this phenomenon.</s><s>Infection with this widespread β-herpesvirus is usually asymptomatic, and establishes occult latency.</s><s>Nonetheless, primary infections or re-infections with this virus can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people or newborns, indicating that CMV is a powerful pathogen requiring immune control.</s><s>Infected individuals possess serum antibodies specific for CMV and are thus referred to as CMV-seropositive.</s><s>The majority of infected people present with expanded memory phenotype CD8+ T-cell populations, and may have a higher risk of coronary heart disease associated with vascular inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> or diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Seroprevalence depends on age and socio-economic factors.</s><s>A study of 24,260 Germans yielded a seroprevalence of 46 % in the age range 18-60 years with a yearly conversion rate of 0.55 % (http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/</s><s>Merkblaetter/Ratgeber_Zytomegalievirus.html).</s><s>Hence, there is a chance of becoming infected with CMV at any time of life, and the proportion of the population that is infected thus increases with age.</s></p><p><s>Surveys of T-cell biomarkers for immune monitoring purposes commonly focus on the most prominent T-cell subset, expressing T cell receptors (TCR) for antigen composed of αβ chains and mostly either CD4 or CD8 co-receptors.</s><s>Age-associated as well as CMV-associated differences are well-recognized in both subsets, but more markedly in the CD8+ subset <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Lower frequencies of CD8+ naïve T-cells and higher proportions and absolute numbers of late-stage differentiated CD8+ T-cells expressing CD45RA (sometimes designated "TEMRA" cells) are commonly taken as keymarkers of immune aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>In the Swedish OCTOstudy of people 85 years old at baseline, an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio of &lt;1 resulting from an accumulation of large numbers of CD8+ TEMRA cells was associated with poorer survival at 2-, 4-and 6-year follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>At the other extreme, the Belgian BELFRAIL study associated a CD4:CD8 ratio &gt;5 resulting from large numbers of naïve CD4+ T-cells with poorer health and more frailty at follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and with worse 3-year survival in women <ref type="bibr">(Adriaensen et al., manuscript in preparation)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Other studies in different cohorts are also examining the influence of these αβ T-cell-based variables on health and survival in the elderly.</s><s>However, in addition to the well-described αβ T-cells, a second discrete subset of T-cells is present in the peripheral blood of all individuals.</s><s>These cells express a completely different TCR composed of γδ not αβ chains, and which are mostly CD4-and CD8-double negative (with a minor CD8+ population <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</s><s>Limited TCR polymorphism, especially in the δ chains, and lack of MHC-restriction for antigen recognition position these cells somewhere between innate and adaptive immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>In healthy adults 1-10 % of all peripheral T-cells carry this TCR.</s><s>Analogous to the presentation of peptides via MHC molecules to the αβ TCR, glycolipids are presented via CD1 to γδ T-cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s>The majority of the γδ T-cells in peripheral blood express the δ2 chain, a minority the δ1 chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and other much smaller populations express other δ-chains.</s><s>Those γδ T-cells expressing the Vδ2 isoform recognize small phosphoantigens derived from the non-mevalonate pathway or the isoprenoid biosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref> (stress, pathogen or tumorassociated), alkylamines <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or synthetic aminobisphosphonates <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, Vδ1 cells recognize stress-induced ligands such as MICA, MICB <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, or EPCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In the context of aging, there are few studies on γδ T-cells reporting that their abundance in peripheral blood is reduced in the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>A considerable increase of γδ T-cells during active CMV infection has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, which potentially associates these cells with anti-CMV immune responses, as shown by many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>As the proportion of the population infected with CMV increases with age, this could counteract the age-associated decrease.</s><s>The purpose of the present study was to survey a younger and older population to seek age-associated differences in peripheral γδ T-cells, taking this effect of CMV infection into account.</s><s>Moreover, we have analyzed the main γδ T-cell compartments (Vδ1+, Vδ2+ and Vδ1-Vδ2-) separately because CMV infection and aging result jointly in an increased pool of Vδ2-negative cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> with altered memory phenotype distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>We previously showed an association of the Vδ2-negative cells with anti-CMV IgG-titers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>This may be related to the antibodydependent anti-CMV activity of Vδ2-negative γδ T-cells dependent on their CD16 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and their recognition of other stress-induced molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>We therefore included CD16 in the present phenotypic analysis focused particularly on γδ T-cells in a younger and older population drawn from the Berlin Aging study II (BASE-II) to determine age-and CMV-associated alterations at the cellular level.</s><s>These results emphasize the impact of CMV infection on most αβ and γδ T-cell subsets, including the rarely-studied CD8+ γδ T-cells.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T-cell phenotypes in the context of age and CMV</head><p><s>Large scale surveys of the proportions and differentiation phenotypes of γδ T-cells in cross-sectional studies of younger and older populations are scarce.</s><s>Taking advantage of the Berlin BASE-II study, here we have undertaken detailed phenotyping of peripheral γδ T-cells in 73 younger and 144 older individuals, in relation to their CMV-serostatus.</s><s>At the same time, we assessed similar parameters for the αβ T-cell subset in comparison in order to confirm the expected normalcy of this population with regard to established T-cell biomarkers.</s><s>Using advanced flow cytometry and the standardized OMIP-20 panel specifically designed for accurately determining γδ T-cell phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, we analyzed a total of 217 individuals.</s><s>These data are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, which displays the distribution of all major memorydifferentiation stages (vertical columns), for each individual tested (horizontal lines).</s><s>The frequencies of each phenotype are color-coded (high being red, low blue and white absent).</s><s>The upper part of the figure depicts the effect of age on CMV-seronegative individuals, with age increasing from top to bottom, whereas the lower part of the figure shows the same for CMV-seropositive subjects.</s><s>Dominant effects of CMV-seropositivity are observed in terms of higher total frequencies of the Vδ1+ compartment and lower frequencies in the Vδ2+ compartment, whereas lower proportions of the CD8+ compartment reveal jointly the effects of the factors age and CMV-seropositivity as influences on their abundance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Notably, there are higher frequencies of the late-differentiated phenotypes (CD27-CD28-CD45RA + CD16-) in the CD8+ and Vδ1+ T-cells of CMV-seropositive individuals.</s><s>As the white-colored areas indicate, the expression of CD16 in the γδ T-cell compartment is limited only to some very early-and very latedifferentiated memory subsets.</s><s>The following sections will describe differences in phenotypic abundance and absolute cell counts in greater detail.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Composition of the T-cell compartments is associated with age and CMV-serostatus</head><p><s>The highest proportions of γδ T-cells were found in young CMV-seronegative individuals, at a median frequency of 3.8 % of all CD3+ T-cells and a median absolute count of 51 cells/μL blood.</s><s>This was significantly different in older individuals, independent of their CMV-serostatus (first lines of each section comparing young seronegative with old seropositive and seronegative individuals in Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>: p = 0.0052, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively and Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>: p = 0.0006, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively).</s><s>For reference purposes, additional tables (Additional file) show in detail the p values of the Mann-Whitney comparisons of the 4 groups and the median frequency/counts of the latter on all identified cellular populations.</s></p><p><s>γδ T-cells in peripheral blood were classified into Vδ2+, Vδ1+ or the pool of other γδ T-cells carrying neither (Vδ1-Vδ2-).</s><s>Most γδ T-cells are predominantly Vδ2+ in younger subjects, independent of their CMV-serostatus.</s><s>The same is true in older CMV-seronegatives but not in CMV-seropositives (blue sections in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>The latter have a nearly equal proportion of Vδ2+ and Vδ1+ cells (37.9 and 32.9 %, or median values of 10 and 8 cells/μL blood, respectively).</s><s>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> displays a gradual reduction of the median frequencies of the Vδ2+ compartment starting with young CMV-seronegative with the highest frequencies, then old CMV-seronegatives, young CMVseropositives and finally the older CMV-seropositive subjects who have the lowest frequencies.</s><s>There is a reciprocal increase of the Vδ1+ compartment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>; for statistical evaluation, see Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>).</s><s>As a group, young and old CMV-seronegatives were not significantly different from one another in this respect, although some of the older individuals had much higher frequencies of this cell type.</s><s>Statistical significance was achieved, however, for the comparison of the frequencies in old and young CMV-seronegatives vs old seropositives showing CMV as an enhancing factor of age-associated alterations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>: p &lt; 0.0001 for both).</s><s>Similar patterns were identified when analyzing absolute cell counts (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>), but statistical evaluation revealed a slightly different scenario: Lower counts of Vδ2+ cells were found in the old, regardless of CMV-serostatus compared to young seronegative (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>Young subjects, regardless of their CMV-serostatus, have more Vδ1+ cells than old CMV-seronegatives (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>) whereas old CMV-seropositives have the highest count of all and significantly higher counts than old seronegative individuals (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>, p &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>Relative frequencies of the double-negative Vδ1-Vδ2-compartment did not differ significantly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>), although we did find higher absolute counts in the young CMV-seronegative and old CMV-seropositive compared to old CMV-seronegative subjects (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>).</s><s>Significantly higher ratios were observed in CMV-seropositive old compared to old or young seronegative subjects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref> and Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S1 and S4</ref>, p &lt; 0.0001 for all).</s><s>About 4.9-10 % of all γδ T-cells express CD8 on the surface.</s><s>We observed a higher frequency of these in old CMV-seropositive individuals, compared to old or young CMV-seronegatives (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, p = 0.0008 and p = 0.0002, respectively).</s><s>In contrast to the entire γδ T-cell compartment, the majority of CD8+ γδ T-cells express the Vδ1 TCR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>In the elderly there were significantly higher frequencies of CD8 + Vδ2+ cells in CMV-seronegatives than in seropositives (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, p = 0.0026).</s><s>A shift in the proportions when comparing young CMV-seronegative with young CMV-seropositive, old CMV-seronegative or old CMV-seropositive individuals points towards a higher CD8 + Vδ1+ compartment as identified for the total Vδ1+ cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> vs Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>).</s><s>Highest proportions of the Vδ1-δV2pool where identified in young CMV-seronegatives, compared to old, independent of the latter's CMV-serostatus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>; Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, p = 0.0002 comparing old and young seronegatives and p = 0.0005, old seropositives with young seronegatives).</s></p><p><s>Turning to the αβ T-cell subset, young CMVseronegative subjects have a lower abundance of these compared to the old, independent of the latter's CMVserostatus (p = 0.0076 and p &lt;
