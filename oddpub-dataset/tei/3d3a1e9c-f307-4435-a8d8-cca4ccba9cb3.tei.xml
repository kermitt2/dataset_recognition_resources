<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background.</s><s>Optimal treatment and precise classification for anaplastic glioma are needed.</s></p><p><s>Methods.</s><s>The objective for long-term follow-up of NOA-04 is to optimize the treatment sequence for patients with anaplastic gliomas.</s><s>Patients were randomized 2:1:1 to receive the standard radiotherapy (RT) (arm A), procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine (PCV) (arm B1), or temozolomide (TMZ) (arm B2).</s></p><p><s>Results.</s><s>Primary endpoint was time-to-treatment-failure (TTF), defined as progression after 2 lines of therapy or any time before if no further therapy was administered.</s><s>Exploratory analyses examined associations of molecular marker status with TTF, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).</s><s>At 9.5 (95% CI: 8.6-10.2) years, no difference between arms (A vs B1/B2) was observed: median TTF (4.6 [3.4 -5.1] y vs 4.4 [3.3 -5.3) y), PFS (2.5 [1.3 -3.5] y vs 2.7 [1.9 -3.2] y), and OS (8 [5.5 -10.3] y vs 6.5 [5.4 -8.3] y).</s><s>Oligodendroglial versus astrocytic histology-but more so the subgroups according to CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and 1p/19q co-deletion status-revealed a strong prognostic value of CIMP pos with (CIMP codel ) versus without 1p/19 co-deletion (CIMP non-codel ) versus CIMP neg .</s><s>but no differential efficacy of RT versus chemotherapy for any of the endpoints.</s><s>PFS was better for PCV-than for TMZ-treated patients with CIMP codel tumors (HR B1 vs B2 0.39 [0.17 -0.92], P ¼ .031).</s><s>In CIMP neg .</s><s>tumors, hypermethylation of the O6-methyl-guanyl-DNA methyltransferase promoter (MGMT) provided a risk reduction for PFS with chemotherapy.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions.</s><s>There is no differential activity of primary chemotherapy versus RT in any subgroup of anaplastic glioma.</s><s>Molecular diagnosis is superior to histology.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov</s><s>Identifier: NCT00717210.</s><s>Keywords: 1p/19q, anaplastic gliomas, CIMP, MGMT.</s></p><p><s>Classification and treatment of anaplastic gliomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade III) are intensely debated topics in neuro-oncology.</s><s>Co-deletions of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q in the tumor tissue define a favorable prognostic group of patients with anaplastic, mostly oligodendroglial gliomas.</s><s>These patients have been shown to benefit from combined radiochemotherapy (RT) with procarbazine, lomustine (CCNU) and vincristine (PCV) in 2 independent long-term subgroup analyses from cooperative group trials (EORTC 26951 and RTOG 9402) originating in the 1990s. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>In line with these results, patients with WHO grade II gliomas with risk factors (ie, less than total resection or age .40 years benefit considerably from RT-PCV compared with RT alone, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> although molecular subgroup information from this trial is awaited.</s><s>Optimizing the standard of care for these patient groups is a major challenge given the younger age of these patient groups as well as their relatively long OS and the relevant risk of neurocognitive, functional, and quality-of-life impairment resulting from aggressive treatment of a tumor located in the brain,.</s><s>To this end, a leading hypothesis in the international scientific debates and day-to-day management of these patients seems to be reducing the initial treatment to the potentially most relevant part (ie, alkylating chemotherapy) and thereby delaying RT.</s><s>One necessary prerequisite for primary monotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) or PCV and the deferred use of RT only for salvage is demonstration of comparable OS with monochemotherapy as compared with radiochemotherapy.</s></p><p><s>Anaplastic gliomas are developing into a disease best described not solely by histopathology but rather based on biomarkers.</s><s>Mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes 1 or 2, which lead to the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) assessed by methylation analyses, allow separation into 3 separate different disease entities in which the IDH-mutant tumors show a more benign course of disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> that is biologically and prognostically further subdivided by 1p/19q status. <ref type="bibr">5 -8</ref> IDH wild-type anaplastic gliomas, in contrast, by and large share biological and clinical similarities with glioblastoma. <ref type="bibr">6 -10</ref></s><s>In these tumors, methylation of the promoter of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is predictive of benefit from alkylating chemotherapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>By adding alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) status to these biomarkers, it seems possible to subgroup IDH-mutant anaplastic oligoastrocytoma with ATRX loss into the group of anaplastic astrocytoma.</s><s>IDH-mutant anaplastic oligoastrocytomas with 1p/19q co-deletion, on the other hand, correspond molecularly and prognostically with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> thus eliminating the category of mixed gliomas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Taking this to the next level, we and others are proposing a molecularly based classification of anaplastic gliomas into 3 biologically and prognostically relevant subgroups that goes beyond the current WHO classification: (i) IDH wild-type (IDHwt -glioblastoma-like, which are called CIMP neg , to reflect biological relevance of the mutation), (ii) IDH mutant and 1p/19q intact (IDH mut/1p/19q intact -CIMP non-codel ), and (iii) IDH mutant and 1p/19q co-deleted (IDH mut/1p/19q codel-CIMP codel ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>OA-04 offers the unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that primary monochemotherapy with TMZ or PCV is superior to primary RT, specifically in the subgroup of patients with tumors harboring the IDH mutant and 1p/19q co-deleted genotype and allowing deferral of primary RT.</s><s>The trial helps generate hypotheses on the potential differential efficacy of TMZ versus PCV.</s><s>In addition, the present analysis with more events and a comprehensive molecular workup should provide mature and substantial data aiding day-to-day treatment as well as the development of new trial concepts.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Summary NOA-04 long-term data do not support a differential efficacy of primary TMZ monotherapy or PCV polychemotherapy versus RT in any of the histological or molecular subgroups of anaplastic glioma.</s><s>Specifically, the patients with the best prognosis (ie, patients with CIMP codel anaplastic gliomas) do not seem to benefit selectively from one of the therapies, (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</s><s>In light of the data from 3 randomized trials in subsets of patients with WHO grades II and III gliomas showing a superiority of chemoradiotherapy over RT alone, 1 -3 the present results of at best equal clinical outcome with chemotherapy versus RT do not support the use of primary monochemotherapy in this disease subgroup (Supplementary material, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and even suggest that TMZ monotherapy may confer a worse outcome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Also, OS in NOA-04, although not statistically different, numerically favors first-line RT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>).</s><s>Further, data from these other randomized trials 1 -3 contradict the general sentiment that monochemotherapy may be a sufficient   treatment, although prospectively controlled data are missing and the field is still divided into believers of primary monochemotherapy and combined chemoradiation and assessed in an ongoing trial (NCT00887146).</s><s>In the large retrospective analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> no difference had been reported in the median OS of patients with 1p/19q-codeleted gliomas who had been initially treated with chemotherapy alone (median: 10.5 y) versus those treated with chemoradiotherapy (median: 8.4 y).</s><s>It is interesting to speculate that the inferior outcome of TMZ in the best-prognosis patients in NOA-04 within the limitations of the small numbers is also supporting the current standard of care of chemoradiation with PCV.</s></p><p><s>The performance of TMZ/PCV in NOA-04 is not explained by obvious principal differences in the patient cohorts between EORTC 26951/RTOG 9402 and NOA-04 after focusing on the intended patient cohorts with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors of the EORTC and RTOG trials (which both demonstrated superiority of chemoirradiation with PCV over RT alone).</s><s>Despite this and despite the limitations of cross-trial comparisons, it is surprising that the RT-treated patients with CIMP codel anaplastic gliomas showed a better course of disease in NOA-04 than in the international trials (Supplementary material, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>An explanation for the relatively high RT efficacy may lay in the limitation to stringently define these patients despite molecular markers.</s><s>A limitation of NOA-04 even with this long-term evaluation (median follow up time 9.5 y [95% CI: 8.6 -10.2]) is the still-immature OS with ,50% events being observed overall and an especially low event rate in the best prognosis CIMP codel group (29% deceased).</s></p><p><s>NOA-04 allows investigation of possible differential efficacy of PCV and TMZ.</s><s>In the retrospective series reported by Lassman et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> there was a positive signal for OS for PCV in 1p/19q codeleted patients, which was supported by the PFS data in the CIMP codel patients of NOA-04 (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5 and 6</ref> and Supplementary material, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) with the TTF and OS data not yet mature for final assessments (Supplementary material, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and no difference between the 2 chemotherapies in the patients with CIMP non-codel or CIMP ne .</s><s>The current CODEL trial is conducted under the assumption that chemoradiotherapy using TMZ or PCV will have similar efficacy but a favorable safety profile and potentially other patient-related outcome measures such as neurocognitive function and health-related quality of life for TMZ.</s><s>Whereas lower toxicity has already been reported in the first report of NOA-04, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> the present long-term analysis provides the first randomized data to suggest that there might be a superiority of PCV alone over TMZ alone in the bestprognosis subset of patients, although no sign of superiority of PCV alone over RT alone was seen (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5 and 6</ref>).</s><s>In the prematurely stopped RTOG 9813 trial for anaplastic astrocytoma, RT + TMZ seemed no different for OS compared with RT + nitrosourea. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>n NOA-04, molecular diagnosis is superior to histology in terms of biological and clinical separation of different prognostic groups (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B and C</ref>).</s><s>For optimal management of patients with anaplastic gliomas, there is a clinical need for reliable information on IDH, 1p/19q, MGMT, and ATRX status. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>Of note, ATRX is not prognostic for the full dataset (Supplementary material, Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>), but ATRX loss helps to identify the better-prognosis anaplastic astrocytoma (P ¼ .02)</s><s>(Supplementary material, Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>There is accumulating evidence that the IDH mutation molecularly defines a tumor group with the molecular characteristics of low-grade or anaplastic diffuse gliomas.</s><s>On the other hand, IDH wild-type WHO grade III gliomas, specifically anaplastic astrocytomas, match the poor clinical course of glioblastoma and often exhibit methylation and mutation profiles similar to glioblastoma. <ref type="bibr">6 -10</ref></s><s>In looking at this subgroup with molecular pathology and course of disease more closely resembling glioblastoma, initial treatment may be given as if for WHO grade IV gliomas.</s><s>This is also supported by initial releases on the CATNON data (looking at patients with non-codeleted anaplastic gliomas), which advocated adding TMZ to the therapy of patients originally randomized into the arm of primary monoradiotherapy.</s></p><p><s>Other than for classification purposes, IDH mutations serve as the target for immunotherapy (IDH1 R132H) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> within the trial NCT02454634 and targeted approaches with inhibitors aiming to block the generation of 2-hydroxygutarate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>Trials with IDH inhibitors are NCT02073994 with AG-120, NCT02273739 with AG-221 and NCT02381886 with IDH305.</s></p><p><s>The 1p/19q co-deletion is predictive for a better outcome with combined chemoradiotherapy with PCV.</s><s>The ongoing CODEL trial may show whether the same efficacy with less toxicity can be achieved with chemoradiotherapy using TMZ instead of PCV (NCT00887146).</s></p><p><s>NOA-04 has also helped to better define the use of MGMT status in anaplastic gliomas.</s><s>In the first publication, we had determined the mere prognostic role for MGMT.</s><s>The present longterm analysis confirms the hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> that MGMT promoter methylation is a predictive biomarker for benefit from alkylating chemotherapy in CIMP neg .</s><s>gliomas only.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Shortcomings of the present trial are the limited number of samples for biomarker analyses, which resulted in limited patient numbers in the biological subgroups, although the results reached statistical significance.</s><s>For prognostic factors, interpretation of the impact of resection needs to be done within the limitations of an assessment, which not necessarily had to be done on the basis of an early postoperative MRI, which should be standard in today's trials.</s><s>Another limitation impacting interpretation of the data is that 50% of the patients are still alive, which obviously precludes final statements on survivalrelated questions.</s><s>This hopeful finding also indicates that many patients with anaplastic gliomas, particularly those with IDH-mutant tumors, are experiencing long-term survival today.</s></p></div>
