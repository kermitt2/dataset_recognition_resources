SMCs are highly specialized cells whose primary role is to maintain vessel homeostasis, vessel tone, blood pressure, and blood flow distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>This function is driven through expression of SMC-specific contractile and contractile-related proteins, including smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC/Myh11), α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA/Acta2), SM22α (Tagln1), and calponin (Cnn1), among others.</s><s>Unlike terminally differentiated cardiac and skeletal muscle, SMCs retain a significant degree of phenotypic plasticity and exhibit the ability to undergo extensive changes in phenotype in response to specific stimuli (i.e., dedifferentiated SMCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>SMC dedifferentiation is associated with a transition to a highly proliferative, inflammatory phenotype characterized by

categorized as nonatherosclerotic hyperplasia (NAH), atherosclerotic hyperplasia (AH), or complex plaque (CP).</s><s>NAH coronary arteries from CF-LVAD patients were compared to NAH coronaries from non-LVAD patients.</s><s>Intimal PTEN and SMC contractile protein expression was reduced compared with the media in arteries with NAH, AH, or CP.</s><s>Compared with NAH, PTEN and SMC contractile protein expression was reduced in the media and intima of arteries with AH and CP.</s><s>NAH arteries from CF-LVAD patients showed marked vascular remodeling and reduced PTEN and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) in medial SMCs compared with arteries from non-LVAD patients; this correlated with increased medial collagen deposition.</s><s>Mechanistically, compared with ApoE -/mice, SMC-specific PTEN-null/ApoE -/double-knockout mice exhibited accelerated atherosclerosis progression and increased vascular fibrosis.</s><s>By microarray and validated quantitative RT-PCR analysis, SMC PTEN

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The clinical variables for human subjects and coronary arteries used in this study are summarized in Table  Decreased PTEN and αSMA expression in human atherosclerotic coronary arteries.</s><s>Using cell culture and genetic mouse models, our previous work demonstrated that PTEN interacts with the transcription factor SRF in the nucleus of differentiated SMCs to facilitate SRF-dependent SMC gene transcription and regulation of the differentiated SMC phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s>We used a proximity ligation assay (PLA) approach to determine if this interaction is also observed in medial SMCs of nonatherosclerotic human coronary arteries.</s><s>As expected, PTEN was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas SRF was predominantly detected in the nucleus when using species-specific PLUS and MINUS PLA probes and single antigen-specific antibodies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with our previous data, using both primary antibodies and species-specific PLUS and MINUS PLA probes, the proximity interaction between PTEN and SRF was detected predominantly in the nucleus of medial SMCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A-G</ref>).</s><s>No positive interaction (PLA signal) was detected in adventitial cells</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E</head><p><s>(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), except for SMCs of adventitial vasa vasora (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>).</s><s>The percentage of medial SMCs expressing positive nuclear PLA signals was quantified in a small cohort of nonatherosclerotic vessels (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>; N = 4 vessels from N = 4 patients).</s><s>No interaction was detected when either primary antibody was omitted from the reaction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, these data in human tissues strengthen our previous findings that PTEN interacts with SRF in SMCs and functions as an essential regulator of SRF-dependent transcriptional control of SMC differentiation.</s></p><p><s>To correlate loss of PTEN expression to loss of αSMA expression (as a conventional marker of differentiated SMCs) and severity of atherosclerosis, human coronary arteries were grouped based on histology into 3 categories from less disease involvement to severe disease involvement: NAH, AH (intima &gt; 200 μm), and CP that are described in Methods and similar to 3 major classifications of coronary artery lesions previously described (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Confocal immunofluorescence imaging for PTEN and αSMA expression revealed that αSMA intensity was inversely correlated with disease progression and PTEN intensity correlated with αSMA levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Areas of PTEN and αSMA intensity in the vessel media and intima were quantified independently.</s><s>For each vessel category, areas of intimal PTEN and αSMA expression were reduced compared with the media (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, B-D</ref>).</s><s>Compared with NAH, PTEN and αSMA expression was reduced in the media of arteries with AH and CP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, B-D</ref>).</s><s>Compared with NAH and AH, αSMA expression was reduced in the intima of arteries with CP; differences in intimal PTEN expression among categories did not reach significance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, B-D</ref>).</s><s>A similar pattern was observed for SMMHC intensity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Total cell number, as assessed by total DAPI intensity, was measured to determine if decreases in PTEN, αSMA, and SMMHC intensity in the media of AH and CP vessels was due to decreased cell number.</s><s>Total medial SMC number was similar in all categories of diseased vessels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Using single-cell analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>), expression of PTEN, SMMHC, and αSMA was reduced in medial SMCs of arteries with AH and CP compared with NAH (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, D and E</ref>).</s><s>Finally, to better control for individual patient differences, single-cell analysis of paired vessel segments with and without atherosclerotic plaque from the same artery of a small cohort of patients was performed.</s><s>Compared with medial SMCs adjacent to uninvolved vessel areas, expression of PTEN and αSMA was reduced in medial SMCs adjacent to atherosclerotic plaques (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Collectively, the data support the concept that reduced SMC PTEN expression promotes SMC dedifferentiation and PTEN is depleted during atherosclerosis progression.</s></p><p><s>SMC-specific PTEN deficiency accelerates atherosclerosis progression.</s><s>Using inducible, SMC-specific PTENnull mice (PTEN-iKO), we previously demonstrated that loss of SMC PTEN exacerbates injury-induced restenosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>.</s><s>To determine PTEN's role in progression of primary atherosclerosis, PTEN-iKO mice were bred to ApoE-null mice.</s><s>Wild-type (WT; i.e., ApoE -/-) and PTEN-iKO;ApoE -/mice were injected with tamoxifen to induce PTEN deletion (injections in WT mice served to control for any direct effects of tamoxifen) and then placed on normal chow or high-fat diet (Western type, high-fat diet containing 0.15% cholesterol) for 8 weeks.</s><s>Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels and body weight following the 8-week diet are shown in Supplemental Table <ref type="table">6</ref>.</s><s>While no differences were found between ApoE -/and PTEN-iKO;ApoE -/mice fed normal chow, PTEN-iKO;ApoE -/mice fed Western diet exhibited increased plasma cholesterol levels, but reduced plasma triglyceride levels and body weight compared with ApoE -/mice fed Western diet.</s><s>By Sudan IV staining, the amount of atherosclerotic plaque in the descending aorta of PTEN-iKO;ApoE -/mice fed Western diet was considerably higher compared with plaque observed in WT mice on normal or Western diet as well as PTEN-iKO;ApoE -/mice fed normal chow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, aortic sinus plaque area in PTEN-iKO;ApoE -/mice was considerably higher than plaque observed in the other 3 groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4, B and C</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, our mechanistic data in mice are in agreement with the human coronary artery findings that selective loss of PTEN in medial SMCs exacerbates atherosclerotic plaque progression.</s></p><p><s>Medial remodeling and fibrosis in coronary arteries exposed to CF-LVAD correlate to decreased PTEN expression.</s><s>Mechanical unloading of the heart with the use of CF-LVAD alters normal hemodynamic forces due to the nonphysiologic, nonpulsatile flow patterns.</s><s>Our previous work demonstrated that aortas from CF-LVAD patients exhibited marked decreases in distensibility and increased vessel stiffness that was associated with increased collagen deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, we showed that SMC-specific PTEN depletion in mice promotes spontaneous vascular fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>.</s><s>In a separate study from the atherosclerosis analyses described above, using human NAH coronary arteries from non-LVAD compared with CF-LVAD patients, we examined the relationship between SMC PTEN expression and vessel structure and collagen deposition.</s><s>NAH vessels were chosen for this study to eliminate the confounding effects of concurrent atherosclerosis on PTEN in order to determine whether PTEN is altered in arteries exposed to CF-LVAD and whether this corresponds to enhanced vascular remodeling.</s><s>Arteries were matched for intimal hyperplasia (&lt;250 μm; Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, A and B</ref>) and showed no difference in intima/lumen ratios between the non-LVAD and CF-LVAD coronaries (not shown).</s><s>In addition, when normalized to lumen diameter to take into account vessels of differing size, no difference in medial thickness between non-LVAD and CF-LVAD arteries was observed (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3, A and B</ref>).</s><s>Please note that while we observed dramatic changes in the adventitia of CF-LVAD arteries, these findings are the focus of another manuscript (AV Ambardekar, et al., under review).</s><s>The present data related to CF-LVAD arteries is focused on the phenotypic changes of the media.</s><s>Exposure to the altered hemodynamics produced by CF-LVAD was associated with SMC dedifferentiation, as assessed by reduced crocein scarlet-acid fuchsin staining for muscle (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) and by reduced αSMA levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6, A and B</ref>).</s><s>SMC dedifferentiation and reduced αSMA expression correlated with decreased SMC PTEN expression in arteries from CF-LVAD patients compared with non-LVAD patients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, C and D).</s><s>Total medial SMC number was similar in non-LVAD and CF-LVAD arteries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref>), indicating that reduced PTEN and αSMA intensity was not due to reduced SMC number in CF-LVAD arteries.</s><s>To validate this we used single-cell analysis (as described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), and compared with arteries from non-LVAD patients, expression of PTEN and αSMA was reduced in medial SMCs of arteries from CF-LVAD patients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref>).</s><s>To determine if reductions in PTEN levels were associated with increased medial fibrosis, picrosirius red (PSR) staining combined with polarized light microscopy and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy were used to quantify collagen deposition.</s><s>Increased PSR signal was detected in the media of CF-LVAD vessels compared with non-LVAD vessels, indicative of increased collagen deposition (Figure <ref type="figure"
