interventions at the workplace aiming to reduce these factors may thus help improve the mental health of workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In this field, the predominant adverse psychosocial work factors identified in the literature stem from two internationally recognized models: the demand-control-support (DCS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref> and effort-reward imbalance (ERI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> models.</s><s>These models refer to the organizational and interpersonal factors of a workplace that

target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Available evidence suggests that it is possible to reduce workers' exposure to these adverse psychosocial work factors through

developed two voluntary standards that emphasize the reduction of adverse psychosocial work factors to improve the health of the working population <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref>.</s><s>Among these, only the Quebec standard "Prevention, Promotion and Organizational Practices Contributing to Health in the Workplace" (BNQ 9700-800/2008), commonly called the Quebec Healthy Enterprise Standard (QHES), leads to a certification <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Organizations implementing this voluntary occupational health standard must follow a comprehensive implementation process elaborated by the provincial standard association and respect certain pre-established conditions in order to be awarded certification.</s><s>In contrast with other standards, this certification process provides an objective measure of implementation through an external audit <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref>.</s><s>Interventions implemented as part of the QHES target four areas of activity to improve employees' physical and mental health: (i) Lifestyle Habits; (ii) Work-life Balance; (iii) Physical Environment; and (iv) Management Practices.</s><s>Interventions implemented within this latter area include activities that target adverse psychosocial work factors.</s><s>As such, the implementation of the QHES may help reduce these adverse occupational exposures and thus improve the mental health of workers.</s></p><p><s>The effect of this innovative occupational health standard on workers' mental health has not yet been evaluated.</s><s>In addition, and to our knowledge, no previous evaluation of the mental health effects of a standard of this type has been conducted to date.</s><s>Given the social and economic burden associated with mental health problems and the role of adverse psychosocial work factors in their development, it is pertinent to assess the impact of the QHES in reducing these adverse work factors and improving the mental health of workers.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of interventions implemented in the Management Practices area of the QHES on the prevalence of adverse psychosocial work factors and of psychological distress among workers of ten Quebec organizations.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Interventions in the Management Practices Area of the QHES</head><p><s>As one of the four areas of activity of the QHES, the Management Practices area is defined by the standard as all the managerial and organizational practices and methods of work modality <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>As suggested by the QHES <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, this can include tools and support available for workers to perform their work tasks, recognition programs, facilitating communication between superiors and workers, employee participation in decision-making and providing workers with career development and training tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s>Together with management, each organization's health and well-being committee proposes and implements interventions based on the compiled results of the aforementioned needs assessment.</s><s>As such, each organization implements interventions tailored to their needs and context.</s></p></div>

Practices area of the QHES.</s><s>This was not only demonstrated by our main results regarding the beneficial effects of to these interventions in reducing the prevalence of adverse psychosocial work factors and high psychological distress, but also by the proportion of participants that considered themselves exposed to interventions in this area of activity (between 60-88%).</s><s>These results are especially encouraging considering that the Management Practices area is one of four potential areas of intervention proposed by the QHES, aside from Lifestyle Habits, Physical Environment, and Work-life Balance.</s></p><p><s>The findings presented here show that social support and rewards improved in more exposed organizations but psychological demands and decision latitude remained unchanged.</s><s>This suggests that organizations were perhaps more willing to improve social support and rewards through a number of social activities within the organization than to change psychological demands and decision latitude; these latter psychosocial work factors inherently implicate aspects of productivity, work organization as well as employers' management rights that may not be as easily targeted for change than aspects related to the social work environment.</s></p><p><s>It is of note that the QHES is currently undergoing a revision process and that, among employers, improving the mental health of workers is an important priority given the high frequency of mental health problems and their associated costs due to loss of productivity, presenteeism, long absences from work and important compensation costs.</s><s>The current results have been presented in several knowledge transfer activities between our research team and members of the QHES revision committee.</s><s>Our findings have demonstrated that it is possible to reduce adverse psychosocial work factors and psychological distress, thereby improving the mental health of workers.</s><s>In the context of revising the QHES, our findings respond to a priority of employers and highlight the benefits of QHES implementation.</s><s>Together with the revision of the standard and the increased awareness among employers regarding the benefits of intervening in the Management Practices area, this could lead to QHES intervention activities expanding to target aspects related to psychological demands and decision latitude.</s><s>Our previous intervention studies have shown that interventions related to psychological demands and decision latitude are feasible and have been implemented in a number of work settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Very few studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[61]</ref> have attempted to evaluate the implementation process in the

target="#b67">64]</ref>.</s><s>This is especially relevant given the complex and uncontrollable nature of organization-wide interventions.</s><s>In the current study, a before and after study design with a reference group was used.</s><s>To define the reference group, post-hoc measures of intervention exposure were used so that the evaluation can take into account whether each participant was exposed or not exposed to interventions.</s><s>This allowed us to capture natural variations in exposure levels to interventions.</s><s>This type of alternative research design is particularly useful when a classic control group and randomization are not an option <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[65]</ref> and the conditions for a true experiment cannot be met <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[64]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study has several strengths.</s><s>First, the number of participants in each organization was relatively high and the sample was composed of a similar proportion of men and women.</s><s>Second, a diversity of occupations and types of organizations were represented in our sample.</s><s>Third, QHES interventions in the Management Practices area were based on validated conceptual models reflecting the four main psychosocial work factors identified by the DCS and ERI models.</s><s>Fourth, validated instruments were used to evaluate adverse psychosocial work factors and psychological distress.</s><s>Fifth, this is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, of a voluntary occupational health standard that includes a certification process.</s><s>This certification process provides an objective measure of implementation through an external audit.</s></p><p><s>This study has also limitations.</s><s>First, the absence of a completely unexposed group did not allow us to completely isolate the interventions' effect.</s><s>Indeed, the reference group was also exposed to some extent (the difference in the proportion of participants exposed to interventions was small between some organizations belonging to different exposure groups).</s><s>This might have limited our ability to observe between-group outcome differences and lead to an underestimation of the true effects.</s><s>However, analyses with intervention exposure as a continuous variable were also conducted and the results showed a similar tendency.</s><s>Moreover, sensitivity analyses conducted by using the three organizations most and least exposed to interventions also showed similar results (Tables <ref type="table">S5 and S6</ref>), although these did not reach statistical significance (likely due to diminished statistical power resulting from analyses with six organizations instead of ten).</s><s>Second, a different measure of intervention exposure was used in the T2 questionnaire for three organizations.</s><s>Given that a different exposure measure could impact the estimates, we conducted sensitivity analyses with the seven organizations that used the more complete exposure measure; the estimates obtained were similar to those of the main analyses (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S3 and S4</ref>) therefore showing that differences in questionnaire formulation did not influence the results.</s><s>Third, this study relied on self-report data on exposure to interventions.</s><s>This could lead to an underestimation or an overestimation of the true effect given that participants could erroneously consider an organizational change as part of the QHES when, in reality, it was not, or vice versa.</s><s>Fourth, given that the outcomes assessed were all self-reported, it is possible that participants' awareness of being part of an intervention study could have influenced their responses on the questionnaire.</s><s>However, both groups were subject to this potential factor as they were both part of the QHES implementation process and intervention study.</s><s>Therefore, this factor is unlikely to explain the beneficial effects observed in the intervention group.</s><s>Fifth, due to our inability to pair participants' responses between T1 and T2, we were unable to perform the analyses at the individual level.</s><s>Instead, data were aggregated at the organizational level, which resulted in diminished statistical power.</s><s>Although this could be a limitation, analyses were performed treating intervention exposure as both a dichotomized and a continuous variable using a robust estimator and all results showed the same tendency.</s><s>Aggregation of the data also limited our ability to perform adjustments for potential confounders at the individual level.</s><s>However, our repeated measures models control for baseline and time-invariant characteristics of the organizations by design.</s><s>Moreover, the estimates obtained in our analyses where adjustments were performed for potential confounders at the organizational level were very similar to those of the main analyses (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1 and S2</ref>), therefore supporting our confidence in the results observed in the main analyses.</s><s>Finally, the intervention effects could not be completely attributable to interventions in the Management Practices area.</s><s>Due to the rigorous QHES certification process, organizations had to implement QHES activities in at least two areas and were obligated to implement interventions in the Lifestyle Habits area.</s><s>It is thus difficult to isolate interventions according to the Management Practices area only.</s><s>However, among the five organizations that were considered more exposed to Management Practices, two were also more exposed to interventions in the Physical Environment area simultaneously (data not shown) and none implemented evidence-based interventions in the Work-life Balance area.</s><s>Thus, the contribution of the other QHES areas to the observed effect, if present, is likely not major.</s></p></div>
