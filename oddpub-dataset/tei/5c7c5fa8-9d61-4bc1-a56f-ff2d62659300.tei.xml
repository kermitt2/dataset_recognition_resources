<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Peripheral inflammatory arthritis is among the most common features with which patients present in clinical rheumatology.</s><s>Identifying the underlying disease can be difficult, particularly at an early stage.</s><s>In clinical practice, early inflammatory arthritis is frequently undifferentiated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">1</ref> Early arthritis can develop into established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or another definite arthropathy, can resolve spontaneously, or may remain undifferentiated for indefinite periods.</s><s>To better evaluate diagnosis and outcome in arthritis, it has been proposed to first recognise inflammatory arthritis; then search for a definite diagnosis (eg, peripheral or axial spondyloarthritis; psoriatic arthritis (PsA); systemic lupus erythematosus, etc), and finally estimate the risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis and propose an optimal therapeutic strategy. <ref type="bibr">2 3</ref></s><s>lthough the prognosis of early arthritis is still difficult to define, a combination of clinical, laboratory and radiographic parameters may help to predict patients' outcomes with acceptable accuracy.</s></p><p><s>The management of early arthritis has changed considerably in the past few years under the influence of new concepts for diagnosis and new effective therapies.</s><s>5]<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[6]</ref> Furthermore, biological (b) DMARDs have demonstrated rapid and sustained disease control associated with an arrest of joint destruction. <ref type="bibr">7 8</ref></s><s>A large body of evidence points to the usefulness of very early DMARD-start for early chronic inflammatory arthritis, preferably before the onset of erosions, in order to reduce or even prevent the risk of (further) joint damage and disability. <ref type="bibr">5 9 10</ref></s><s>Also, the assessment and tight monitoring of patients with early arthritis serves to better adapt therapeutic strategies. <ref type="bibr">9 11</ref></s><s>Beyond doubt, the treatment goal of early arthritis should now be clinical remission and prevention of joint destruction.</s></p><p><s>Patients with early arthritis should be identified and referred to rheumatologists to confirm the presence of arthritis, the ( potential) diagnosis and its prognosis and initiate appropriate treatment strategies based on these findings.</s><s>Furthermore, management of early arthritis should include more than drug treatment alone, with education, shared decision making and the role of allied healthcare professionals as important themes.</s></p><p><s>A set of recommendations for the management of arthritis should address all these different aspects.</s></p><p><s>The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of early arthritis have been published in 2007. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">9</ref></s><s>In 2010, EULAR presented recommendations for the management of RA with synthetic and biological DMARDs, which have been updated in 2013 and 2016; <ref type="bibr">12 13</ref> in addition, recommendations for the management of PsA were recently published. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6</ref></s><s>While the latter recommendations focused on the pharmacological treatments of PsA and RA, both in advanced and in early disease, the 2007 recommendations for the management of early arthritis covered the entire spectrum of management of early arthritis, including the recognition of arthritis, referral, diagnosis, prognosis, classification, information, education, non-pharmacological interventions and monitoring of the disease process as well as pharmacological treatment.</s><s>The systematic literature review (SLR) that has guided the 2007 EULAR recommendations included publications up to January 2005. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">9</ref></s><s>Between 2005 and 2015, research in early arthritis has been a major focus, and many studies have appeared in the peer-reviewed literature.</s><s>This literature includes -but is not limited to-topics such as diagnosis and classification criteria, window of opportunity, imaging, prognostication, treatments and therapeutic strategies.</s></p><p><s>These developments mandated an update of the existing EULAR recommendations on early arthritis, which is reported here.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p><s>The update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis has followed the 2014 EULAR Standardised Operating Procedures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref></s><s>The definitions (eg, management and early arthritis) of and the target populations (rheumatologists, general practitioners, medical students, healthcare professionals, patients) addressed by the 2007 expert committee <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">9</ref> were considered.</s><s>Briefly, the term 'management' was defined as 'all organisational, diagnostic, medical and educational procedures related to patients seeking help for arthritis of a peripheral joint' and 'early arthritis' was restricted to 'early inflammatory joint disease'.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The expert committee</head><p><s>The expert committee comprised 20 rheumatologists, including 2 research fellows (CID and CH), 1 healthcare professional and 2 patients, from 12 European countries.</s></p><p><s>Fifteen research questions derived from the 2007 process were proposed by the convenor (BC) and the methodologist (RL), and subsequently amended and approved by the whole committee.</s><s>The selected topics included recognition of arthritis, referral, diagnosis, prognostics, classification, information, education, non-pharmacological interventions, pharmacological treatments, monitoring of the disease process, strategy and prevention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence-based approach</head><p><s>The research questions were adjusted for further literature research if appropriate, and structured according to the Patients-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome systematic by four of the authors (CID, CH, BC, RL).</s><s>Eligible study types were also defined.</s></p><p><s>A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane library was performed, with the help of a skilled librarian (Louise Falzon, Columbia University Medical Centre, USA).</s><s>All articles published in English up to December 2015 were included.</s><s>Abstracts from the 2014 and 2015 EULAR and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) conferences were also considered.</s><s>The search was completed by a hand search and by questioning experts for additional references.</s><s>The SLR process is reported in detail in two separate articles. <ref type="bibr">15 16</ref></s><s>pert opinion approach Each member of the expert committee obtained insight into the results of the literature search and the accompanying levels of evidence before a meeting in January 2016.</s><s>During the meeting, the results of the SLR were presented to the committee in aggregated format.</s><s>Three break-out groups, chaired by one expert, were formed to amend the 2007 recommendations (1-4; 5-8 and 9-12) and to propose new recommendations if considered appropriate.</s><s>Each group then reported its proposals and wording to the entire committee for discussion and consensus, and the final formulation of the recommendations was obtained after a vote with at least 85% agreement for each item's final wording.</s></p><p><s>After the meeting the recommendations were circulated by email to all expert committee members for further minor amendments if necessary.</s><s>Categories of evidence and grades of recommendations were then determined (by CID, CH, RL, BC) according to the standards of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17</ref></s><s>To determine the level of agreement with recommendations, an anonymised email-based voting on a 0-10 scale was performed, a vote of 0 indicating complete disagreement with a particular recommendation and 10 indicating complete agreement.</s><s>The means and SDs for scores from the whole group were calculated.</s><s>The recommendations are presented in box 1 and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>The discussions of the expert committee resulted in 3 overarching principles and 12 recommendations (box 1) (in 2007, 12 recommendations were formulated).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overarching principles</head><p><s>The expert committee considered that some of the principles on the care of patients with early arthritis are generic and should be stated first and separated from individual recommendations on diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.</s><s>The committee decided unanimously on the following three overarching principles (box 1).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principle A:</head><p><s>Management of early arthritis should aim at the best care and must be based on a shared decision between the patient and the rheumatologist.</s><s>The term 'best care' is obviously a major principle in medicine.</s><s>The wording 'shared decision between the patient and the rheumatologist' is more than informing the patient; it rather refers to the comprehensive process of communication, knowledge exchange and achieving consensus that should lead to a treatment decision, that is, optimal from the perspectives of both patient and clinical care provider.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principle B:</head><p><s>Rheumatologists are the specialists who should primarily care for patients with early arthritis.</s><s>This statement, which was part of recommendation 1 in the 2007 recommendations, was also highlighted in the EULAR recommendations for the management of RA <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref> and PsA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6</ref></s><s>9]<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref> Rheumatologists have the expertise to establish an accurate diagnosis of early arthritis, are familiar with monitoring disease activity and with the potential severity of the disease in their patients with inflammatory arthritis and are well aware of the indications, contraindications and adverse effects of specific therapies.</s></p><p><s>However, the expert committee intentionally added the term 'primarily' to this statement for three reasons: (1) the management of patients with early arthritis includes the care by primary care physicians and other healthcare professionals in a multidisciplinary approach; (2) in some places care by rheumatologists is not always available and accessible.</s><s>Some countries have a shortage of rheumatologists, and in such situations patients should receive treatment from other healthcare providers with experience in the care of patients with inflammatory arthritis; (3) in some countries, task shifting from rheumatologists to other healthcare professionals is actively supported in order to facilitate early access and optimal quality of care, and to make care cheaper.</s><s>Such care is still primarily under the responsibility and supervision of rheumatologists, but may be provided by other care providers.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Principle C:</head><p><s>A definite diagnosis in a patient with early arthritis should only be made after a careful history taking and clinical examination, which should also guide laboratory testing and additional procedures.</s></p><p><s>In the 2007 recommendations, this important statement was included as bullet point 3.</s><s>It was considered that 'good clinical practice' and a 'high level of training' suffices an opinion that was entirely expert-based.</s><s>The expert group was of the unanimous opinion that the statement is so generic that it represents an overarching principle rather than a recommendation.</s><s>To establish a definite diagnosis in a patient with early arthritis, the group proposed that the minimum diagnostic procedures should include careful history taking and clinical examination, keeping the different possible causes of inflammatory arthritis in mind.</s><s>After excluding other causes of joint swelling and pain (eg, septic arthritis, trauma, osteoarthritis, gout), particular attention should be paid to age, geographical area and travel history, number and pattern of involved joints, axial/entheseal involvement and extra-articular features (eg, eye, skin, genitourinal and gastrointestinal symptoms), including recent infections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">1</ref> A minimal laboratory testing panel was proposed in the 2007 recommendations and should include testing for C reactive protein (CRP)/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), full blood cell count, transaminase levels, renal function and urine analysis,</s></p><p><s>Box 1 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for management of early arthritis: final recommendations based on evidence and expert opinion Overarching principles A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation 11:</head><p><s>In patients with early arthritis, smoking cessation, dental care, weight control, assessment of vaccination status and management of comorbidities should be part of overall patient care.</s></p><p><s>This recommendation is new and largely based on expert opinion.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[82]</ref> Comorbidities may affect life expectancy and outcomes (physical function, quality of life) independently of disease activity in patients with inflammatory arthritis.</s><s>In addition, coexisting diseases may affect the efficacy and safety of antirheumatic therapies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">82</ref></s><s>Obesity and smoking may affect the response to treatment in inflammatory arthritis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">80</ref></s><s>Prevention is now considered key in the management of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, but comorbidities are still not optimally managed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">76</ref></s><s>Smoking is the best-established modifiable risk factor in the development of RA and spondyloarthritis. <ref type="bibr">83 84</ref></s><s>Furthermore, tobacco use has been associated with the presence of extra-articular manifestations such as rheumatoid nodules and also serum RF and ACPAs.</s><s>While smoking does not seem to be associated with the perpetuation of disease activity or progression of RA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">85</ref> it may affect the outcome of spondyloarthritis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">84</ref></s><s>A is associated with periodontal disease, although the direction of the relationship still remains unclear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">86</ref></s><s>The microbiome may play a role in chronic arthritis risk and progression, and Porphyromonas gingivalis infection could promote aberrant citrullination and a local breach of tolerance to citrullinated peptides.</s><s>The potentially beneficial contribution of oral hygiene has been put on the research agenda.</s></p><p><s>Although current data do not prove that risk-factor modification is beneficial to patients, the modifiable risk factors identified in the SLR are so generic in nature that the committee was unanimously of the opinion that a recommendation aiming at abolishing their potential influence on arthritis (and general health) would not harm patients and may convey some benefits.</s></p><p><s>In addition, the expert committee noted that fewer patients with chronic arthritis than recommended are currently vaccinated, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">87</ref> and that this should be specifically mentioned.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendation 12:</head><p><s>Patient information concerning the disease, its outcome (including comorbidities) and its treatment is important.</s></p><p><s>Education programmes aimed at coping with pain, disability, maintenance of ability to work and social participation may be used as adjunct interventions.</s><s>This recommendation was very similar to the previous item no. 6. Obviously, full transparency about the disease and its treatment options should be an integral part of the management of any chronic disease, and constitutes the core of overarching principle A. Other healthcare providers share the responsibility in the provision of information.</s><s>Studies have suggested that adherence to treatment is dependent on the quality of information exchange and the quality of the interaction between the patient and healthcare professionals, including rheumatologists. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref></s><s>ULAR has recently recommended that 'people with inflammatory arthritis should have access to and be offered patient education throughout the course of their disease, including as a minimum, at diagnosis, at pharmacological treatment change and when required by the patient's physical or psychological condition'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">88</ref></s><s>The content and delivery of patient education should be individually tailored, with individual and group sessions representing different approaches to delivery.</s><s>It is impossible to prioritise a single educational intervention since all tested interventions have only short-term benefits and feature cross-national and cultural variations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref></s><s>Improved quality of life is a major aim for patients and the committee proposed to add 'social participation' as one of the objectives of these education programmes.</s><s>The expert committee also felt that patients should be aware that comorbidities may affect the outcome and treatment of inflammatory arthritis, and that their screening and management should be part of the global management of early arthritis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis followed the 2014 EULAR Standardised Operating Procedures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref></s><s>The committee has proposed an important revision of the items, but obviously most major recommendations have remained intact.</s><s>These updated recommendations for management of early arthritis contain 3 overarching principles, 12 recommendations and 2 algorithms that integrate all the recent developments in the management of early arthritis.</s><s>The definition of the term 'management' was unchanged and includes all spectra of management of early arthritis, including referral, diagnosis, prognosis, classification, information, education, nonpharmacological interventions and pharmacological treatments and monitoring of the disease.</s><s>The term 'early arthritis' was restricted to 'early inflammatory arthritis' and mainly, but not only, focused on the risk of chronic arthritis.</s></p><p><s>The expert committee had to face a limitation in that most of the published data on treatment and strategy on which they could build their recommendations involved studies in patients with early RA or established RA, rather than specific studies of early arthritis.</s><s>Despite this limitation, the committee considered much of the data for early RA sufficiently robust and relevant for extrapolating to 'early arthritis with a certain propensity to become persistent.'</s><s>The scope was different compared with the EULAR recommendations for the management of RA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> which focussed on the use of DMARDs in both early and established disease.</s><s>However, there are overlaps with regard to the first-line therapy for early arthritis at risk of persistence (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and for early RA (DMARD-naïve and usually &lt;6 months disease duration).</s><s>Not surprisingly, the two sets of recommendations are very congruent on these specific points.</s></p><p><s>These recommendations have important strengths including the composition of the expert committee comprising 20 rheumatologists, including 2 research fellows, from 12 European countries and new addition of 1 healthcare professional and 2 patient representatives.</s><s>The committee chose to grade the level of evidence provided by every study, which was based on the methodology of the study, and took this grading into consideration when discussing the content and the strength of the recommendations.</s><s>An important consideration in the discussions was always whether the type of study fitted the content of the research question that was at the basis of the literature search.</s><s>The recommendations were based on the most recent evidence and on expert opinion.</s><s>For example, the expert committee felt that evidence supported comorbidities as possibly affecting the outcome of arthritis and also treatment efficacy and safety and should be considered in the management of all early arthritis cases.</s><s>Despite the sparse evidence, the expert committee also wanted to indicate that smoking cessation and dental care could be proposed to patients with early arthritis, and that both patients and healthcare professionals should be aware of the importance to improve vaccination coverage.</s><s>In this respect, a new recommendation on prevention was added (item no.</s><s>11).</s><s>Of note, the level of agreement among the experts was high for each item (means of 9.0-9.9),</s><s>which support the appropriateness and validity of the recommendations.</s></p><p><s>In light of the current literature and despite important recent advances, the committee felt that further development of new tools is needed for early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis, including new biomarkers, better understanding of the added value of US and MRI and creation of prediction algorithms for long-term outcome (box 2).</s><s>Finally, the expert committee felt that the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the different strategic modalities in early arthritis, including the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions, need additional research.</s></p><p><s>While these 'recommendations' are deliberately not called 'guidelines', they do reflect a strong view of many European experts including patient representatives.</s><s>They should provide rheumatologists, general practitioners, medical students, healthcare professionals, health authorities and patients a practical approach to the management of early arthritis, even though each healthcare professional should choose the most appropriate management strategy for each individual patient.</s><s>To that end, it is hoped that the recommendations will be widely disseminated and discussed within the community of rheumatologists and other healthcare professionals caring for patients with early arthritis and that they will help improve the standard of care for patients with arthritis across different healthcare systems.</s><s>Obviously, these recommendations will probably need amendment after about 5 years to incorporate new scientific evidence.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure
