<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p><s>In the present study we demonstrate, using a simple stochastic two-dimensional simulation model, that a ratchet mechanism is able to explain the penetration enhancement of nanoparticles into hair follicles.</s><s>We distinguish two transport mechanisms: directed motion and enhanced diffusive motion, both are caused by the oscillatory hair motion.</s><s>We find that radially moving hair causes directed nanoparticle transport into the hair follicle, which is most efficient at an optimal driving frequency and at an optimal particle size.</s><s>By introducing an effective viscosity, the directed ratchet transport model yields penetration depths even larger than observed in experiments.</s><s>This might be due to the fact that experiments haven been done at a fixed and most likely sub-optimal frequency of the massage device.</s><s>We show that a diffusive transport mechanism can also play an important role.</s><s>We estimate the crossover from diffusive to directed transport for radial hair motion to occur at a penetration depth of the order of 5 µm, which is much smaller than the experimentally observed penetration depths of more than 1000 µm.</s><s>In order to predict the relevance of diffusion for the nanoparticle transport, it would be important to know the amount of applied nanoparticles that actually penetrate into the follicle besides the maximal penetration depth.</s><s>Further experimental studies at variable frequency would also be highly interesting and in fact are needed be

experimental studies we compare our simulations with, the hair motion is caused by massage <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In these experiments, the precise fashion in which the hair is moving relative to the hair follicle is not precisely known and presumably correspond to a superposition of radial and axial oscillatory hair motion.</s><s>This serves as a motivation for our work in which we study the effects of these two modes of motion separately.</s><s>In contrast to pure radial hair motion, which causes a flashing ratchet effect and transports nanoparticles into the follicle, pure axial hair motion leads to nanoparticle transport in the opposite direction, i.e. out of the follicle.</s><s>We denote this transport mechanism as pushing ratchet mode.</s><s>In this case we observe a significant enhancement of the diffusivity, which even becomes larger than for the free diffusion case.</s><s>Since particle transport into the hair follicle is observed in the experiment, we speculate that radial hair motion is the dominating mode, but more experiments would be needed to settle this question.</s><s>In future work it would certainly be interesting to study a more general simulation model and to investigate the effects of the superposition of radial and axial hair motion.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our simple two-dimensional stochastic model demonstrates
