<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The family is one of the basic units of society and has a great influence on its members.</s><s>When a family member becomes ill, the illness affects the well-being of other family members, causing changes in the life of the whole family.</s><s>Critical illness often occurs without warning and there is little time for patients and their families to prepare.</s><s>If family members' immediate needs can be met, desirable consequences for both family members and patients can be achieved.</s><s>In order to meet family member's needs, critical care units' nurses must be able to identify their needs accurately <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Every year in the United States, approximately 20% of all deaths occur in an intensive care unit (ICU), and family members suffer from being withdrawn or withheld.</s><s>Many of patients are unable to communicate because of sedation, mechanical ventilation, confusion, and comatose.</s><s>This results in much of the burden of decision-making and treatment choices on the patients' family members.</s><s>This may affect family members by increasing their stress levels and increasing their risk for psychological and physical symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In ICU an array of equipment, IV lines, medications, and sounds becomes unfamiliar to the public and this added fragile emotional stress to families and friends of admitted patient.</s><s>This rush of unforeseen stimuli often leads to feelings of fear and powerlessness to family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Relatives go through traumatic experiences when a family member is admitted to critical care units which are unplanned and occur as emergencies.</s><s>Relatives are not psychologically prepared for their patient's critical illness and their life becomes disorganized and disrupted adding to the stress of family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The mortality rate of patients in the ICU is between 12 and 17%.</s><s>In such condition, the family of the patients needs to provide physical and emotional support.</s><s>It is the duty of nurses to provide clear and appropriate information and compassionate care to family members.</s><s>Families constantly adapt themselves to the stressful situation so they need the emotional, informational, and instrumental support <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Meeting the needs of their patients' family members is an essential part and responsibilities of critical care units' physicians and nurses, who are committed to easing the pain and suffering of patients' relatives or close friends.</s><s>A major task of nurses and physicians is to provide family members with the appropriate, clear, and compassionate information as they need to participate in making decisions about patients who are unable to speak for themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Nursing care must address the needs not only of the patient, but those of the whole family.</s><s>The needs of patients in intensive care and those of their families are especially complicated by the physical and emotional demands.</s><s>Families experience severe stress and anxiety and may feel helpless and unable to cope.</s><s>Accurate assessment of their needs is one of the first steps in providing appropriate care to ICU patients and their families <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The plight of family members has generated much interest in family care.</s><s>A number of studies have been conducted to identify family needs in the critical care unit.</s><s>Using the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory (CCFNI), developed by Molten in 1979 and revised by Leske in 1991, most studies have confirmed the following basic needs of family members as needs for information, assurance, support, closeness or proximity, and comfort <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Meeting needs of relatives of critically ill patients can have a positive impact on a patient's ability to cope during their hospital stay.</s><s>When families have a stress, they may be unable to support the patient and transfer their stress to the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Access to information about patient's conditions and quality relationships with nurses are high priority needs for families.</s><s>Meeting these needs of the family members is a primary responsibility of physicians and nurses of critical care units.</s><s>Families have expectations to fulfill the needs from healthcare providers which are commonly overlooked or become secondary to caring for the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Molter (1979)</ref> conducted an exploratory descriptive study to ascertain the needs of family members of patients who were critically ill and identified the 45 needs of family members

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p><s>On the basis of the study findings, it is concluded that nurses rank the subscale of needs for assurance as most important needs of family members and the subscales of needs for support as least important needs of family members.</s><s>Nurses having more experience in critical care unit perceived the needs of family member to be more important.</s><s>There is positive correlation between the subscales of needs of family members.</s><s>Therefore, these needs are to be addressed by nurses to support the affected family members while providing care to the patient.</s></p></div>
