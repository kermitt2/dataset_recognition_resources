<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Invasive IAP Measurements.</head><p><s>In order to establish direct IAP measurements, 2 custom made transdermal telemetric pressure probes based on the NEUROVENT-P-tel system (Raumedic, Helmbrechts, Germany) with a catheter length of 18 cm were implanted intraperitoneally on day 0 of experiments (IAP cranial and IAP caudal).</s><s>For this purpose, 2 incisions of each 6 cm in a distance of 30 cm in the abdominal midline were made and subcutaneous pouches for the telemetric units were formed.</s><s>Then the peritoneum was opened and the catheters were inserted intraperitoneally.</s><s>After tight closure of the peritoneum and the fascia, the telemetric units were placed in the prepared subcutaneous pouches and the skin was carefully sutured.</s><s>IAP data were read out transcutaneously by applying a radio-frequency transmission coil wired to a portable data recording device (Datalogger MPR 1, Raumedic, Helmbrechts, Germany).</s><s>All measurements were stored on the Datalogger memory.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Noninvasive IAP Measurements.</head><p><s>Indirect IAP measurements were performed using an intravesical pressure (IVP) measurement system (AbViser, Fa.</s><s>ConvaTec, Munich, Germany) and an intragastral pressure (IGP) measurement system (CiMON, Pulsion, Munich, Germany).</s><s>Both were established temporarily and directly in advance of experiments.</s><s>The IVP measurement system was connected to a standard urinary catheter and referenced to the median line of the animal.</s><s>The bladder was filled with 20 mL of saline before every measurement as recommended by the manufacturer.</s><s>The IGP measurement system was placed together with the integrated gastric feeding tube and referenced against the atmospheric pressure.</s><s>All IAP measurements were carried out at end-expiration.</s></p></div>
