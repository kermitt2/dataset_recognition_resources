<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Co-occurrence and risk factors of infectious diseases, malnutrition and metabolic conditions</head><p><s>The vicious circle of infectious diseases and malnutrition remains a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> This seems to apply to adolescents in rural Ghana, too.</s><s>Almost one-third of our study population presented with an infectious disease plus at least one form of nutritional deficits.</s><s>Malarial infection and vitamin A deficiency were the predominant conditions <ref type="bibr">(32/53)</ref>.</s><s>The association between clinical malaria and malnutrition has extensively been examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, and is seen also for asymptomatic infections among adolescents elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> In our study, malarial infection and other common infectious diseases increased the odds of malnutrition 2.3-fold; and this was also observed vice versa.</s><s>Moreover, low occupational status of the father and low wealth score increased the odds of infectious diseases and of malnutrition, in accordance with current findings from sub-Saharan Africa, linking poverty and disease.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> More specifically, vitamin A deficiency was strongly associated with common infectious diseases (other than malaria), a finding that is commonly attributed to impaired mucosal epithelial regeneration and immune dysfunction.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> Despite a considerable reduction of vitamin A deficiency-associated diseases in West Africa in the past 20 years, our results underscore that vitamin A deficiency remains the fourth leading cause of disease burden in this region.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> On the background of demographic and economic development, Ghana faces an epidemiologic transition from infectious diseases to metabolic conditions that appears to be delayed in rural areas and poorer social classes.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> Consequently, infectious diseases still predominate while metabolic conditions increase steadily.</s><s>This "double burden of disease" has been recognized on the country level, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> but only selective efforts were made to re-conceptualize healthy body ideals and to improve health literacy in Ghana.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> In the present study, we assessed the co-occurrence of infectious diseases and CRFs in the individual.</s><s>This proportion of 6% was dominated by malarial infection plus hypertension.</s><s>It appears unlikely that high blood pressure was an immediate consequence of malarial infection, as indicated by the lack of association in our study.</s><s>Rather, malarial infection and malaria-related fever reduce systolic blood pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and our observations probably reflect paralleling diseases.</s></p><p><s>While the term "double burden of malnutrition" usually refers to the co-occurrence of underweight, stunting or micronutrient deficiencies plus overweight or obesity, the denominator for this constellation frequently varies.</s><s>On the country level, the Double burden of malnutrition refers to considerable amounts of childhood stunting (27%) and maternal overweight (29%) in the Ghanaian population.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> On the household level, the term describes families with at least one underweight, stunted or micronutrient deficient member plus at least one overweight or obese person.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> For the individual level, the double burden of malnutrition addresses macro-and micronutrient deficiencies as comorbidities of adiposity in one person.</s><s>The present study extends the latter concept to the co-occurrence of nutritional deficits plus overweight, obesity, IFG and hypertension.</s><s>A similar analysis was conducted among urban adults aged 25-60 years in Burkina Faso, and revealed that one-quarter of the study population had at least one nutritional deficiency and one CRF (overweight or obesity or abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycaemia or insulin resistance or diagnosed diabetes and dyslipidaemia).[40]</s><s>Already at the age of 15 years, nutritient deficiencies plus CRFs were present in 7% of our study population, which was mainly attributed to vitamin A deficiency plus hypertension.</s><s>Hypertension rates in Ghana are projected to increase dramatically, based on population growth and aging [41], while vitamin A deficiency still manifests in 2% of women at childbearing age.[42]</s><s>Therefore, once the adolescents get older, the group of vitamin A deficient and hypertensive adults will definitely grow, challenging diagnosis and management of these entities.</s><s><ref type="bibr">[43]</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>So far, data on the co-occurrence of infectious diseases, malnutrition and CRFs are scarce for the population group that forms the basis of Africa's future-adolescents.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Thus, our findings make an important contribution to the knowledge on the health of African populations under epidemiologic transition.</s><s>Still, the present study was limited in sample size producing wide confidence intervals of the detected proportions.</s><s>This calls for independent replications in larger surveys.</s><s>In addition, we cannot comment on the characteristics of adolescents who did not follow the study invitation, and selection bias might have occurred.</s><s>Also, the crosssectional nature of our study bears the problem of recall bias for self-reported diagnoses and symptoms, and the potential of reverse causation for some risk factors.</s><s>This may limit the interpretability of the associations between infectious diseases and malnutrition.</s><s>Still, malarial infection, malnutrition and CRFs were objectively measured by well-trained study personnel.</s><s>For instance, hypertension was defined based on the last two BP measurements performed by a validated, fully-automated device using sex-, age-and height-specific percentiles, to avoid misclassification through investigator-related BP increase (white-coat effect) or conventional BP cut-offs, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In conclusion, in this population of rural Ghanaian adolescents, asymptomatic malaria infection, chronic energy deficits and vitamin A deficiency still constitute major health threats.</s><s>Already at this young age, obesity and hypertension evolve and even co-exist with infectious diseases and nutrient deficits on the individual level.</s><s>Potential interrelations of malaria, malnutrition, and cardio-metabolic risk factors remain to be investigated for understanding disease trends and ultimately guide resource allocation for health care in sub-Saharan Africa.</s></p></div>
