<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study is the first economic evaluation to compare the costs of an av-ECCO 2 R strategy to avoid IMV with costs for a conventional strategy of IMV after NIV failure in patients with acute-on-chronic ventilatory insufficiency.</s><s>The overall hospital costs did not differ significantly between the av-ECCO 2 R group and the matched control group (53.689 vs. 54.155</s><s>€) despite additional average costs of 7717 € per av-ECCO 2 R treatment.</s><s>This did not change after excluding four ECCO 2 R patients who underwent lung transplantation and their controls.</s><s>Thus, in this study the extra costs for av-ECCO 2 R treatment were offset by lower hospital costs due to shorter average hospital length of stay in the av-ECCO 2 R group.</s><s>A short length of stay in the ICU may per se result in a reduction of treatment costs, as it has previously been shown that length of ICU stay explains approximately 85 to 90 % of interpatient variation in hospital costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of all COPD patients, the biggest and most homogenous diagnostic subgroup, revealed significantly lower overall hospital treatment costs in the av-ECCO 2 R group <ref type="bibr">(19.610 vs. 46</ref>.552</s><s>€) suggesting that ECCO 2 R to avoid intubation in patients with AECOPD and NIV failure may lead to a reduction of overall treatment costs.</s><s>The potential economical relevance of this hypothesis is augmented by the fact that COPD has a high prevalence projected to be the fifth leading burden of disease worldwide by the year 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Micro-costing was used for cost calculation of material consumption for av-ECCO 2 R. Itemised cost evaluation of all other treatment costs was not feasible due to the retrospective study design.</s><s>Instead, further cost analysis was performed by means of macro-costing.</s><s>Average daily costs for ICU treatment used for cost analysis in this study were based on a previous study by Moerer et al. who calculated the average daily ICU costs in Germany by cost analyses of 51 German ICUs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Their calculations included both variable and fixed costs as were costs for IMV.</s><s>However, many health economic studies have demonstrated that fixed costs, especially staffing costs, account for up to 65 % of all treatment costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Thus variation of variable costs probably has a smaller effect of overall treatment costs.</s><s>Moreover, sensitivity analysis did not change the results suggesting a degree of robustness of the results.</s></p><p><s>The rationale for applying the above mentioned data on average ICU costs also to ECCO 2 R patients despite the fact that the majority this group were not intubated and mechanically ventilated was, that from the experience of the participating study centres staff resource utilisation for management of invasive MV and av-ECCO 2 R with or without non-invasive ventilation is comparable.</s><s>In addition, costs for material consumption from MV were proposed to be relatively low and not significantly contributing to the overall treatment costs.</s><s>Costs for treatment of side effects of av-ECCO 2 R observed in the original case-control study, such as bleeding and vascular surgery in one case, were not itemised separately.</s><s>These costs were included in the average daily ICU costs as were treatment costs in the control group for side effects caused by invasive MV, such as treatment of ventilator-induced pneumonia.</s><s>There is evidence that costs for patients on MV are significantly higher than costs for non-ventilated patients in ICU <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> and that COPD patients on invasive mechanical ventilation have a longer stay in ICU and require higher treatment efforts than non-COPD patients on MV <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>These data may further justify subsuming costs for side effects of av-ECCO 2 R into average daily ICU costs and may even suggest that a potential cost saving effect of avoiding MV with its complications and associated costs by applying av-ECCO 2 R may have been underestimated.</s><s>On the other hand, additional costs for complications caused by av-ECCO 2 R may also be associated with significant costs.</s><s>The incidence of major, potentially costly complications was low in the av-ECCO 2 R group (9.5 %), but may have been underestimated because of low case numbers.</s><s>Excluding 4 case-controls where the av-ECCO 2 R cases subsequently underwent lung transplantation with potentially higher costs did not change the results.</s></p><p><s>Since there are no valid national data on average daily costs for treatment of patients on normal wards in Germany who have previously been in ICU with respiratory failure, estimating these costs was based on the study centres local average cost calculations.</s><s>These locally derived calculations may be less generalizable.</s><s>However, as only less than 25 % of the total hospital costs were attributable to treatment on the normal ward, this potential error may be negligible.</s></p><p><s>This relationship is in line with findings of other studies that have shown that length of ICU stay was the main determinant of overall hospital cost variations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>Again, sensitivity analysis had no significant effect on the results of this cost comparison.</s></p><p><s>Since cost calculations for ECCO 2 R were based on the pumpless arterio-venous ECCO 2 R device applied in the original study, these results cannot directly be applied to veno-venous, pump-driven devices for ECCO 2 R since their technology is more complex and extra cost apply for more expensive circuits and consoles.</s><s>In addition, the clinical characteristics of patients and their controls of this study are quite specific as they had actually failed NIV and all patients in the control group had been intubated.</s><s>Therefore they differ from the population of a recently published case-control-study in which patients at risk of NIV failure where treated with ECCO 2 R to avoid intubation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>In this study 25 patients treated with NIV and in addition a veno-venous, pump-driven ECCO 2 R device revealed a significantly lower intubation rate in comparison to their 21 controls treated with NIV alone (12 % vs. 33 %).</s><s>The LOS in ICU and hospital did not differ significantly between the two groups (8 vs. 12 and 24 vs. 22, respectively).</s><s>Further, this cost analysis did not take into account the health care provider's perspective on reimbursement plans, because aspects of diagnosis-related groups (DRG) or specific reimbursements for costly treatments and procedures such as invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal lung support were not addressed.</s><s>The rational for this was that reimbursement plans are individually negotiated between health care providers and healthcare payers on a local, regional and/or national level.</s><s>Reimbursements do not necessarily represent factual costs and are highly variable
