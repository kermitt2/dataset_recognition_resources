<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Age-dependent memory impairment (AMI), which is associated with both psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, starts in midlife and worsens with advancing age, suggesting that the greatest driving factor is age itself.</s><s>The lack of effective treatments that prevent, halt, or reverse the condition is contributing to a diminishing quality of life for many senior citizens.</s><s>Therefore, animal models that allow one to monitor physiological changes across their lifespan and to test for a causal character of age-induced changes might be helpful in exploring the mechanistic basis of AMI.</s><s>D. melanogaster, with its short lifespan of around 60 d and advanced molecular genetic tools, provides an efficient experimental model to unravel mechanisms underlying AMI.</s><s>Additionally, the olfactory nervous systems of insects and mammals exhibit many similarities, suggesting that the mechanisms for olfactory learning may be shared <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, aversive short-, intermediate-, and long-term olfactory memories have been found to be subject to age-induced decline in Drosophila, with an onset at about 10 d of age and plateaus at about 30 d of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, we recently found a simple dietary supplementation of spermidine, a polyamine that specifically protects from AMI in Drosophila.</s></p><p><s>External stimuli are believed to be represented in the brain as spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity within a set of neuronal connections.</s><s>Changes in synaptic communication ("plasticity") within certain neuron populations are meant to ultimately encode behavioral adaptations such as learning and memory.</s><s>Thus, dysfunctioning of synaptic plasticity might well be relevant to age-dependent deterioration of learning and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s>One of the fundamental problems of studying AMI, however, is the inability to differentiate causative changes from adaptive or protective changes.</s><s>Moreover, the brain undergoes changes at multiple levels with advancing age, including alterations in circuits, individual neurons, and single synapses, further complicating the situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Nonetheless, recent work has linked AMI to subtle synaptic alterations in the hippocampus and other cortical brain areas, rather than to the loss of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>.</s><s>At the same time, the age-associated modulation of molecular entities underlying learning and memory that define and change synapse function remain poorly understood.</s><s>Therefore, we set out to determine the role of age-induced changes in the organization and function of synapses in AMI, using dietary supplementation with spermidine as a tool to identify synaptic changes that can potentially contribute to AMI.</s></p><p><s>To accomplish this, we analyzed age-induced changes in the ultrastructural, molecular, and functional organization of synapses within the olfactory system of flies by comparing aged flies fed with normal food to aged flies fed with spermidine-supplemented food.</s><s>We found that aging is associated with an increase in the average size of active zone (AZ) scaffolds, structures recently shown to scale with synaptic vesicle (SV) release.</s><s>Consistent with this, optophysiological analysis showed that more SVs are released in response to natural odor stimuli in aged flies.</s><s>Interestingly, these age-associated changes were suppressed by spermidine feeding, indicating that these changes might be causally relevant to AMI.</s><s>In fact, genetic manipulation provoking an increase of T-bar size in young animals was sufficient to induce a premature decline in memory performance.</s><s>We suggest that a cumulative increase in the size and function of presynaptic AZ scaffolds might reduce the operational range of synaptic plasticity processes, and thus, hamper the formation of new memories with age.</s><s>Additionally, levels of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors and postsynaptic Ca 2+ signals remained largely unaffected with age, suggesting that homeostatic adaptations might be involved in increasing the threshold for memory formation with advancing age.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>It is known that the ability to acquire new memories declines with advancing age.</s><s>Based on previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, one plausible explanation for this observation might be the increase in the threshold required for memory formation with age.</s><s>In fact, when we analyzed olfactory conditioning in aged flies (30-d-old flies or 30d) we found that greater number of exposures to the unconditioned stimulus in order to attain saturated levels of memory scores, which, however, never reached the same maximal learning scores found in young flies (3-d-old flies or 3d), indicating that the dynamic range of memory formation is altered with advancing age (S1 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that presynaptic plasticity processes are responsible for forming olfactory associative memory in Drosophila <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, we set out to determine the role of age-induced changes in the organization and function of synapses in AMI, using dietary supplementation with spermidine as a tool to identify synaptic changes that can potentially contribute to AMI.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age-Induced Increase of Odor-Driven Vesicle Release Is Suppressed by Spermidine Feeding</head><p><s>In order to identify synaptic mechanisms plausibly contributing to AMI, we used opto-physiological assays to characterize overall neuronal responses in synaptic terminals of live intact flies.</s><s>For these experiments, we focused on projection neuron (PN) to kenyon cell (KC) synapses within the mushroom body calyx of the olfactory system for two reasons: first, aversive olfactory learning involves coincidence detection of a conditioned stimulus (odor) with an unconditioned stimulus (electric shock), causing changes in the odor-specific synaptic activity of second order PNs and third order mushroom body KCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>; second, the superficial position of the calyx within the fly brain enabled us to perform efficient optical analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, since sensor signals could be retrieved from discrete synaptic bouton areas.</s></p><p><s>We started by expressing cytosolic GCamp3.0 in the PNs (using GH146-Gal4) and found the basal expression of GCamp3.0 to remain largely unchanged with age (S2A Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Next, we monitored the PN boutons for intracellular Ca 2+ responses to two odors typically used for olfactory conditioning, 3-Octanol (3-Oct) and 4-methylcyclehexanol (MCH), through two-photon microscopy.</s><s>Similar to our previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, we found no significant difference in the amplitude or time course of cytosolic GCamp3.0 signals of young (3d) and aged (30d) animals (S3 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Thus, in the context of odor information processing, odor-evoked action potential frequency or presynaptic Ca 2+ influx remained rather unaffected by the age of the animal.</s></p><p><s>Next, we asked whether the release of SVs was altered with advancing age and analyzed the odor-driven SVs release.</s><s>To this end, we used SynaptopHluorin (SynpH), a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the luminal side of the SV membrane protein Synaptobrevin (Syb) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>SynpH is nonfluorescent at the acidic pH inside SVs; however, when SVs are released, SynpH is exposed to the neutral extracellular space, and the presynaptic terminal becomes brightly fluorescent.</s><s>Following endocytosis, SVs become reacidified, and the cycle can start again <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>SynpH was expressed within PNs, and the release of SVs in response to two odors was monitored, again, at PN-to-KC synapses (Fig 1A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">-1H</ref>).</s><s>We found a profound increase in the amplitude of SynpH signals in aged (30d) animals when compared to young In addition to measuring the SV release at the PN presynaptic terminals within calyx, we also measured odor-evoked changes within the axonal projections of KCs within the mushroom body horizontal lobes by expressing SynpH using mb247-Gal4.</s><s>Though relative signals were smaller (when signal was normalized to the whole mushroom body horizontal lobe), likely reflecting the well-documented sparse odor coding of KCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, we still observed a substantially higher amplitude of SynpH signals in aged (30d) than in young (3d) flies, and, again, spermidine administration (30d Spd ) protected from this age-dependent increase (S6 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Thus, two major neuron populations of the olfactory system-PNs and KCs, showed an increase in odor-evoked fluorescence changes in response to odor stimuli, indicating higher release of SVs in aged animals.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spermidine Feeding Specifically Blocks Age-Induced Increases of Core AZ Components</head><p><s>Since Ca 2+ influx into presynaptic terminals was apparently not responsible for the profound age-induced increase in SV release, presynaptic mechanisms downstream of Ca 2+ signaling might be involved.</s><s>In order to address the molecular and cellular basis of this age-associated increase in SV release, we started by analyzing proteins directly associated with SVs: Synapsin, Syb, and Synaptotagmin-1.</s><s>Synapsin is a SV-associated phosphoprotein important for controlling the number of SVs available for release <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>, and Syb is a core component of SNARE complex that drives the exocytosis of SVs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s><s>We found the levels of Synapsin as well as Syb to remain unchanged with advancing age (comparing aged flies: 30-days old or 30d with young flies: 3d), regardless of spermidine feeding (30d Spd ;
