<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: T 1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) have the potential to guide patient care and serve as surrogate end-points in clinical trials, but measurements differ between cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scanners and pulse sequences.</s><s>To help deliver T 1 mapping to global clinical care, we developed a phantom-based quality assurance (QA) system for verification of measurement stability over time at individual sites, with further aims of generalization of results across sites, vendor systems, software versions and imaging sequences.</s><s>We thus created T1MES: The T1 Mapping and ECV Standardization Program.</s><s>Methods: A design collaboration consisting of a specialist MRI small-medium enterprise, clinicians, physicists and national metrology institutes was formed.</s><s>A phantom was designed covering clinically relevant ranges of T 1 and T 2 in blood and myocardium, pre and post-contrast, for 1.5 T and 3 T. Reproducible mass manufacture was established.</s><s>The device received regulatory clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Conformit√© Europ√©ene (CE) marking.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p><s>The T1MES phantom is an agarose gel-based phantom using nickel chloride as the paramagnetic relaxation modifier.</s><s>It was reproducibly specified and mass-produced with a rigorously repeatable process.</s><s>Each phantom contains nine differently-doped agarose gel tubes embedded in a gel/beads matrix.</s><s>Phantoms were free of air bubbles and susceptibility artifacts at both field strengths and T 1 maps were free from off-resonance artifacts.</s><s>The incorporation of high-density polyethylene beads in the main gel fill was effective at flattening the B 1 field.</s><s>T 1 and T 2 values measured in T1MES showed coefficients of variation of 1 % or less between repeat scans indicating good short-term reproducibility.</s><s>Temperature dependency experiments confirmed that over the range 15-30 ¬∞C the short-T 1 tubes were more stable with temperature than the long-T 1 tubes.</s><s>A batch of 69 phantoms was mass-produced with random sampling of ten of these showing coefficients of variations for T 1 of 0.64 ¬± 0.45 % and 0.49 ¬± 0.34 % at 1.5 T and 3 T respectively.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Myocardial tissue characterisation by T 1 mapping and estimation of extracellular volume (ECV) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is playing an increasingly important role in the diagnosis and management of patients and clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>T 1 mapping is available as three broad classes of sequences, on multiple platforms, at two field strengths.</s><s>Factors influencing T 1 mapping stability and inter-sequence comparisons are well understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> but little is known about T 1 mapping delivery at a larger scale over many sites and there is no global quality assurance (QA) system.</s></p><p><s>The goal of the T1MES program (T1 Mapping and Extracellular volume Standardisation) was to construct an optimised phantom for QA of myocardial T 1 mapping, covering a relevant range of T 1 values with suitable T 2 values for the tissues modelled.</s><s>The proposed QA consists of regular scans using fixed T1-mapping protocols identical to whatever fixed protocols are used in vivo at each participating site.</s><s>We therefore aimed for a phantom design that would have stable T1 values for as long as possible.</s><s>We also aimed for a phantom design avoiding temperature sensitivity of its T1 values as explained later in Methods.</s><s>Such a QA system would form part of a system for optimal mapping precision and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> within the increasingly known fundamental limitations of the T 1 mapping methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The T 1 Mapping and ECV Standardization (T1MES) program therefore aimed to:</s></p><p><s>1. Create a partnership of physicists, clinicians and national metrology institutes 2. Design phantom systems for 1.5 T and 3 T for any manufacturer/sequence reflecting T 1 values in myocardium and blood, pre-and post-Gadoliniumbased contrast agents (GBCA) 3. Reproducibly specify and mass produce phantoms with a rigorously repeatable process and to regulatory standards 4. Distribute them to global CMR sites with detailed instructions for fortnightly scanning 5. Publish full details of the formulation to encourage additional applications 6. Measure confounders (e.g.</s><s>temperature dependency) 7. Analyse scans over 1 year to study the stability of T 1 measurements over time at each scanner, including a temperature correction model for T 1 8. Curate phantom data long-term in an open access repository available for reuse/analysis 9. Analyse the inter-site differences in T 1 values and explore the deliverability of a technique-independent 'T 1 /ECV Standard' through local calibration</s></p><p><s>To date we have achieved steps 1 to 6 of this process, namely the development, testing, certification, QA protocol and preliminary results of T1MES.</s><s>This paper summarises these first 6 milestones.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definitions</head><p><s>The term "phantom" refers to the complete test object (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The term "tube" refers to each of the small bottles embedded within the phantom.</s></p><p><s>The "gel matrix" is the gel and bead mixture filling the phantom that surrounds all of the tubes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Collaboration process</head><p><s>A design collaboration for developing and testing the T1MES phantom and its prototypes was established, consisting of clinicians, physicists, national metrology institutes (the US National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST] and the German Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt <ref type="bibr">[PTB]</ref>) and a small-medium enterprise familiar with phantom production (Resonance Health [RH], Perth, Australia).</s><s>Funding was secured including a grant from the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging.</s><s>Time and expertise was provided for free by the partnership.</s><s>To engage a global community with constrained funding, the phantoms were gifted (first come, first served) to centers with the proviso that they: a) scan them fortnightly for 1 year and upload the results; b) engage with the partnership to explore any unexpected results; c) do not do anything that could potentially compromise (a) or (b) (e.g.</s><s>deconstruct the phantom object); and d) give proper reference to the T1MES project if they use the phantoms for other purposes.</s></p></div>

Initially we aimed to design a single phantom for both 1.5 T and 3 T, containing a sufficient number of tubes to cover the needed T 1 ranges in blood and myocardium, with suitable T 2 values, pre and post-GBCA at both field strengths.</s><s>However, the frequency dispersion (i.e.</s><s>B 0 field dependence) of relaxation times in the phantoms differed strongly from that of myocardium and blood, particularly for the long pre-GBCA tubes, requiring a total of 13 different tubes for 1.5 T and 3 T. Fitting 13 tubes into a single phantom would either have made the object 'large' (in relation to the B 1 distortion at 3 T discussed below) or would have required the use of smaller calibre tubes.</s><s>The following considerations justify our construction therefore of 'field-specific' phantoms:</s></p><p><s>-Tubes had to be a minimum of 20 mm diameter so regions of interest (arbitrarily set to13 mm) would exclude in-plane imaging artifacts at the boundaries between tubes related to the use of clinical T 1 mapping protocols with coarse image resolution, mostly based on single-shot imaging (e.g.</s><s>Gibbs artifact at the edge of tubes [Fig.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>] or the potential impact of filtering against it applied differently by various protocol parameters).</s><s>Altering protocols to optimise phantom scanning would be inconsistent with the aim of the project.</s><s>The true resolution achieved is further convoluted by the use of asymmetric frequency-encoded readouts for faster repetition time (TR) in balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging or partial-phaseencode sampling for shorter total shot duration, and to some extent also by signal variation during the shot.</s><s>-Embedding tubes into a gel-filled phantom is important for three reasons: 1) to permit sufficient signal for scanner calibrations; 2) to minimise B 0 and B 1 field distortions local to each tube; and 3) for greater thermal stability.</s><s>However, embedding all the 13 tubes (to cover 1.5 T and 3 T values) into a single phantom (whether water or water-based gel-filled) will have increased its overall dimensions making it harder to make (our tests and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> show that B 1 homogeneity across large ROIs could not be achieved especially at 3 T).</s><s>Alternative oil-based phantoms have a smaller dielectric permittivity, useful for weaker radiofrequency (RF) displacement current distortion of B 1 , but the chemical shift of the matrix fill would require embedded tubes also to use oil-based chemistry (as in diffusion phantoms).</s><s>Alkanes or similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> could not deliver the required range of T 1 and T 2 (written as T 1 |T 2 ) and a predominately single-peak nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum, with the required temperature stability.</s><s>By using separate water-based gel-filled phantoms for 1.5 T and 3 T with the known high permittivity of water, at a size large enough to fit the needed tubes there was still significant B 1 distortion (range of different flip angles achieved for a prescribed protocol nominal flip-angle) but we were able to counteract it using a method described later.</s><s>-This project aims to provide quality assurance for clinically used T 1 protocols without adapting to the phantom (e.g.</s><s>no switching to spoiled-gradient echo, or using shorter-TR, no alterations of resolution or field of view etc.; see Additional file 1).</s><s>Clinical T 1 mapping protocols are sensitive to off-resonance effects for various well-known reasons.</s><s>Therefore, B 0 distortion near any of the tubes needed to be minimised (tests showed how tube alignment with the B 0 direction was best-this data not shown).</s></p></div>
