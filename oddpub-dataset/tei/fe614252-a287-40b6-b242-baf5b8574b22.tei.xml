<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In axial SpA, including both AS and nr-axial SpA patients, uveitis is the most common extraarticular clinical manifestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(25)</ref> and contributes substantially to the overall burden of disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, the management of uveitis manifestations represents an important aspect of disease management <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(27)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here we demonstrate that the proportion of patients with a prior history of uveitis, and the incidence of uveitis flares to week 96, was similar across the broad axial SpA population, including patients with AS and nr-axial SpA.</s><s>Patients treated with CZP had a uveitis event rate 71% lower than that observed for patients treated with placebo, although the number of events and affected patients was low and cannot be considered as statistically significant evidence of the inhibitory effect of CZP on uveitis flares.</s><s>During the placebo-controlled trial period, all uveitis flares occurred in patients with a past history of uveitis, and in these patients the difference between CZP and placebo uveitis event rates was retained.</s><s>Long-term data demonstrate that with continued CZP treatment the incidence of uveitis flares remained low and stable to week 96, with similar rates seen in both the AS and nr-axial SpA subpopulations.</s></p><p><s>De novo cases of AU with anti-TNF treatment have previously been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(28)</ref> and it has been suggested that new-onset cases are more frequent with etanercept than infliximab <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(29)</ref>.</s><s>In the RAPID-axSpA trial, 8 patients experienced new-onset flares of uveitis to week 96 of the study.</s><s>The new-onset cases of AU reported here share the same characteristics of a typical case of comorbid uveitis expected in a patient with axial SpA.</s></p><p><s>In this study, the incidence of uveitis flares in CZP-treated axial SpA patients was comparable to rates observed for other anti-TNF antibodies in AS patients.</s><s>The AU flare rate of 4.9 per 100 patient-years at weeks 48 and 96 was slightly higher than the pooled AU flare rate of 3.4 per 100 patientyears reported in infliximab-treated AS patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(17)</ref> and slightly lower than the AU flare rate of 7.4 per 100 patient-years reported in adalimumab-treated AS patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(18)</ref>.</s><s>By comparison, the reported AU flare rate in AS patients receiving treatment with etanercept was 12.0 per 100 patient-years and 15.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with AS receiving placebo in a pooled analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(17)</ref>.</s><s>However, interpretation of these results is difficult given the different patient populations in each of the clinical trials, the low number of patients affected, and because definition of flare may differ between studies.</s></p><p><s>The data reported here add to our existing knowledge base supporting the use of anti-TNF agents to prevent or reduce the incidence of axial SpA-associated uveitis flares <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A recent retrospective case series studied the efficacy and tolerability of CZP in refractory active uveitis with positive results <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(21)</ref>.</s><s>All 7 patients included in the series had failed treatment with at least 2 prior anti-TNFs and, of the 7 patients, 2 had AS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(21)</ref>.</s><s>While the number of patients was small, the data suggest that CZP may be effective in the treatment of refractory active
