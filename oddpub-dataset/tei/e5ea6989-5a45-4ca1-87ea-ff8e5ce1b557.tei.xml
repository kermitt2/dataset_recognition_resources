<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expression of cathelicidin in human colon cancer tissue</head><p><s>Human colon tumor samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.</s><s>Sections of noncancerous colon tissue showed weak staining for hCAP-18/LL-37; however, colon cancer tissue sections showed strongly positive staining for hCAP-18/LL-37.</s><s>A total of 60/68 (88.2%) colon cancer tissue samples were positively stained (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A, a-d</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the expression of hCAP-18/LL-37 in tumor cells and colonic epithelial cells was considerably weak and almost un-measurable, whereas infiltrating inflammatory immune cells in the stroma expressed remarkably higher levels of hCAP-18/LL-37 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A, a-d</ref>).</s><s>Macrophage infiltration in tumor tissue from patients was examined via CD68 immunostaining.</s><s>There were few macrophages that were positive for CD68 in noncancerous colonic mucosa; however, there was a large number of CD68-positive macrophages in tumor regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A, e-h</ref>).</s><s>In addition, the number of cells that were positive for the proliferation marker, Ki-67 was higher in tumor tissue than in noncancerous colon tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A, i-l, 1B</ref>).</s><s>These data indicate that hCAP-18/LL-37 is highly expressed in human colon cancer and that infiltrating inflammatory immune cells are the main source of hCAP-18/LL-37 in tumor tissue.</s></p><p><s>Serum levels of hCAP-18/LL-37 were also measured in patients diagnosed with colon cancer.</s><s>Consistent with the changes in expression of hCAP-18/ LL-37 in tumor regions, the concentration of hCAP-18/ LL-37 in the serum was much higher in patients with colon cancer than in healthy humans (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Blood levels of hCAP-18/LL-37 were evaluated in patients with colon cancer, both before and after surgery, to determine whether the higher level of hCAP-18/LL-37 seen in patients with colon cancer was due to the presence of tumors.</s><s>Patients had significantly decreased levels of cathelicidin in the blood 1 month after surgery compared to before surgery (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>These results are consistent with those obtained by immunohistochemical analysis of human colon tumor tissue.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neutralization of cathelicidin reduces colon tumor growth</head><p><s>A colon cancer model was generated in order to investigate the effect of cathelicidin on colon cancer in vivo.</s><s>Mice were injected with the procarcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) and then received three rounds of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) exposure to elicit colitis.</s><s>The expression of mouse cathelicidin (CRAMP) was higher in colonic tissues and the level of CRAMP was higher in the blood after exposure to DSS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A, 4B</ref>).</s><s>All mice treated with AOM plus DSS developed tumors by day 80 (data not shown).</s><s>Macrophage infiltration was observed in mouse tumor tissue, whereas macrophages were sparsely scattered in noncancerous mouse tissue, similar to results found in human cancerous and noncancerous tissues, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>CRAMP was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of infiltrating immune cells of the stroma (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, there was a complete loss of CRAMP expression in colon tumor cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s><s>These results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis and realtime PCR for CRAMP, in which the levels were found to be remarkably higher in tumor tissues (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D, 4E</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, CRAMP protein and CRAMP mRNA were also strongly expressed in macrophages that had been isolated from colon tumor tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F, 4G</ref>).</s><s>Eighty days after treatment with AOM plus DSS, CRAMP neutralizing antibody (anti-CRAMP), IgG control antibody or PBS was administered to tumor-bearing animals for 30 days to investigate whether CRAMP contributes to colon cancer growth.</s><s>Anti-CRAMP significantly reduced the number of macroscopic colon nodules and reduced maximal tumor size compared with the IgG control antibody and PBS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A, 5B</ref>).</s><s>The tumor load in the colons of mice treated with anti-CRAMP was much lower compared to the colons of mice treated with IgG or PBS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>).</s><s>The proliferation of tumor cells was then examined via immunohistochemical staining for Ki-67.</s><s>Consistent with the changes in colon tumor burden, the number of cells expressing Ki-67 was significantly lower in tumors from mice treated with anti-CRAMP compared to mice treated with IgG or PBS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D, 5E</ref>).</s><s>TUNEL staining was performed to determine whether the blocking of CRAMP had an impact on tumor cell apoptosis.</s><s>There was no significant difference in colon tumor cell apoptosis between the group treated with anti-CRAMP and the group treated with IgG or PBS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>).</s><s>Thus, cathelicidin appears to play a critical role in the promotion of colon tumor growth, most likely through stimulating the proliferation of malignant cells.</s><s>In addition, the macrophage infiltration into colon tumors was much lower in mice treated with anti-CRAMP than in mice treated with IgG or PBS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>), indicating that cathelicidin plays a critical role in directing immune cells into tumor tissues.</s></p></div>
