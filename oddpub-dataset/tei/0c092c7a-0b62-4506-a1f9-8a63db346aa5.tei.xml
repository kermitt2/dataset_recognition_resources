<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Cohort</head><p><s>This study included a total of 41 pre-and perimenopausal women, who were treated using MRgHIFU for symptomatic UF within a period of 24 months at our institution and the patients were retrospectively reviewed.</s><s>Patients were excluded if there was no baseline ceMRI scan available (n=3) or if the patients did not return for 6-month follow-up (n=3).</s><s>Additionally, 5 patients were excluded due to insufficient imaging quality and exclusion of another 6 patients was due to additional alternative treatments within the time of follow-up.</s><s>For this type of study formal consent was not required.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Evaluation</head><p><s>Prior to treatment, all patients underwent a gynecological examination.</s><s>Clinical symptoms of UF can be divided into menorrhagia on the one hand and bulk-related symptoms (pelvic, leg, back or abdominal pain, urinary frequency, incontinence, dyspareunia, constipation) on the other hand.</s><s>Symptoms were recorded preprocedurally as well as 6 months after MRgHIFU and assessed using questions included in the previously validated Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(12)</ref>.</s><s>The severity of symptoms was categorized as worsened, unchanged, improved or resolved.</s><s>Depending on the changes of symptoms reported at the 6-month follow-up, the patients were classified as responders (R) when the clinical symptoms had improved or resolved or non-responders (NR) in all other cases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MRgHIFU procedure and Follow-up Imaging</head><p><s>MRgHIFU treatments were performed using a modified MR-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery System (EXAblate 2000, InSightec, Haifa, Israel), coupled with a 1.5T MR system (General Electric Health Care, Milwaukee, Wi).</s></p><p><s>All patients included in this study were subjected to a standardized ceMRI protocol prior to treatment (baseline) as well as 6 months after treatment (6-month follow-up).</s><s>The baseline ceMRI scan was acquired within a median of 22.53 days (4-77 days) prior to the MRgHIFU procedure.</s><s>For 19 out of 24 patients an immediate follow-up ceMRI scan (24 hours) was obtained.</s><s>13 and 6 patients underwent additional 12-and 24-month follow-up imaging, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Imaging Data Evaluation-3D Quantification of Lesion Response</head><p><s>Lesion Segmentation-The dominant target lesion was determined on the T2-weighted baseline scans as the largest UF by volume.</s><s>A semi-automatic 3D quantitative measurement of the total lesion volume (TLV) as well as the enhancing lesion volume (ELV) was applied on the baseline and followup arterial-phase ceMRI scans to evaluate UF response to MRgHIFU.</s><s>This semi-automatic imaging analysis was performed using a software prototype (Medisys, Philips Research, Suresnes, France), which has initially been established for primary and secondary liver malignancies and is here-in referred to as 3D-RESQU (3dimensional response quantification in uterine fibroids).</s><s>This software uses non-Euclidean geometry and theory of radial basis functions that permit the segmentation of 3D objects with straight edges and corners <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(13)</ref>.</s><s>The reader defines an initial control point and the software algorithm creates an image-based mask located in a 3D region of the tumor, yielding the term "semi-automatic".</s><s>As opposed to fully automatic segmentation techniques, the user can interactively expand or minimize the 3D mask and its coordinates will be saved within the MRI dataset.</s><s>In the present study, the resulting 3D segmented lesion masks were used to quantify response to MRgHIFU in the dominant lesion of each patient.</s></p></div>

The 3D segmented lesion mask was then applied on the subtracted scan (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A 3D ROI of 1cm 3 was placed into hypoenhancing soft tissue (left psoas muscle) of the subtracted image set in order to calculate a reference value for tissue enhancement.</s><s>Furthermore, in order to avoid corrupted ROIs within focally inhomogeneous muscle tissue, signal intensity statistics were calculated for every 3D (1cm×1cm×1cm = 1cm 3 ) ROI with the goal of achieving a maximum of signal homogeneity.</s><s>The software provided the minimum and maximum voxel brightness values within the cubic ROI.</s><s>The numeric output was in patient-specific arbitrary units (AU) for each ROI.</s><s>The software furthermore calculated the mean brightness value (MBV), standard deviation (SD) as well as the coefficient of variation (CV).</s><s>Empirically, a CV of less than 30% was seen as acceptable, while a CV greater than 30% was rejected leading to ROI repositioning.</s></p><p><s>Eventually, the TLV was calculated according to the segmentation.</s><s>In order to estimate the extent of necrosis, the ELV was defined as voxels within the previously calculated TLV (% and cm 3 ), in which the enhancement exceeded the value of the ROI.</s><s>A normalized patientspecific color map overlay, which was individually normalized to the maximum intensity in the ceMRI scan, demonstrated the distribution of enhancement within the 3D segmented lesion mask (with red representing maximum enhancement/viable fibroid and blue representing no enhancement, below the threshold/necrotic tissue) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Manual Image Analysis-For validation purposes, additional subjective manual measurements of the dominant UF dimensions were performed by two radiologists with 3 and 5 years of experience in abdominal MR imaging who were blinded to the results of the 3D-RESQU analysis.</s><s>Volumetric calculations were based on a formula for prolate ellipsoid shapes (lengh×width×height×0.523)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">16)</ref>.</s><s>Enhancing UF portions (in % of the entire lesion) were visually determined on the ceMRI scans and quantified in 10% increments.</s><s>Both readers separately evaluated the baseline and 6-month follow-up imaging dataset and the values were used for an interobserver correlation analysis and then averaged for an intermethod correlation analysis with the semi-automatic 3D quantification.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Statistical calculations were performed using the commercial software GraphPad Prism (Version 6.1, San Diego, California, USA).</s><s>The Wilcoxon t-test was used for paired, nonparametric analysis in individual patients to compare imaging parameters before and after treatment.</s><s>For unpaired, non-parametric analysis, the Mann-Whitney-test was applied to compare the both cohorts, R and NR.</s><s>A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</s><s>A linear regression model was used to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (R 2 ) and analyze the interobserver agreement and the correlation of the radiologic readings with the software-assisted 3D quantification.</s></p><p><s>This was an institutional review board (IRB) approved and U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant single-institution analysis.</s></p></div>

semi-automatic technique to assess uterine fibroid response after MRgHIFU therapy on ceMRI scans.</s><s>In vitro and in vivo studies have shown MRgHIFU therapy to cause coagulative necrosis and tumor volume reduction in UF within 6 to 12 months after MRgHIFU therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">18)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, assessing ELV and TLV, 3D-RESQU reflects on the major pathological effects of sonification.</s><s>As UF response to MRgHIFU occurs gradually, a decrease of TLV is not present immediately after the procedure but becomes highly significant at the 6-month follow-up and remains relatively stable at 12 and 24 months (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The increase of ELV values during the long-term follow-up primarily correlated with the observation of relapsing viable UF tissue at the lesion rim on the ceMRI scans (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>A possible explanation could be that remaining vasculature facilitates UF recurrence, which might be a technically reasonable benefit of UAE over MRgHIFU.</s><s>Based on the principle of devascularization, UAE is known to effectively reduce heavy bleeding symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">20)</ref>.</s><s>But aiming at UF infarction also implies a threshold tumor volume for successful and realistic UAE treatment, which is reported to be relatively small at 66.0 cm 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">22)</ref>.</s><s>In the present study, dominant lesions with a TLV ranging from 30.45 to 689.56 cm 3 were successfully treated with MRgHIFU and tumor volume did not limit the application of MRgHIFU or reduce the efficacy of the procedure.</s></p><p><s>In previous studies, post-procedural enhancement on ceMRI was suggested as a good surrogate for UF necrosis after MRgHIFU and a predictor for clinical outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">9)</ref>.</s><s>Contrary to those results, the ELV measured with 3D-RESQU does not seem to be representative of the clinical outcome.</s><s>Instead, the major decrease in lesion volume at the 6month follow-up corresponds well to the improvement of symptoms in the majority of patients.</s><s>Accordingly, our analysis suggests that volume reduction is essential for symptom resolution and that TLV has a strong diagnostic value after MRgHIFU treatment of symptomatic UF.</s><s>In particular, our preliminary results indicate that bulk-related symptoms are more likely to resolve after volume reduction rather than menorrhagia.</s><s>All 3 patients classified as NR only reported menorrhagia at the preprocedural examination, whereas all R presented with bulk-related symptoms with or without menorrhagia.</s><s>From a technical point of view, MRgHIFU does not achieve complete devascularization of the UF as opposed to UAE, which would allow for continuous abnormal bleeding after treatment.</s><s>However, this aspect requires further investigation.</s></p><p><s>From a clinical perspective, MRgHIFU is a newer intervention with a smaller body of evidence compared to myomectomy and UAE but there continues to be development.</s><s>As an example, the Sonalleve Fibroid Ablation Pivotal Clinical Trial for MR-HIFU of Uterine Fibroids (SOFIA) represents an ongoing randomized double-blind interventional study that investigates the efficacy and safety of MRgHIFU compared to sham treatment in the therapy of symptomatic UF with an estimated enrollment of 224 patients (NCT01504308).</s></p><p><s>With regards to current error-prone manual measurements, there is growing evidence in support of the use of 3D quantitative methods for lesion response evaluation and the present study demonstrates major advantages of 3D-RESQU after MRgHIFU.</s><s>The semiautomatic approach allows for manual adjustments at all steps and furthermore, the 3D approach overcomes technical errors, which may occur with manual assessment of tumor volume on planar scans.</s><s>In particular, we suggest a major benefit of the 3D-based calculation of enhancement as well as the subtraction-based analysis of the lesion mask.</s><s>Moreover, the segmentation-based software is capable of calculating absolute numeric values for ELV, which enable the user to evaluate lesion enhancement in consideration of postprocedural tumor shrinkage based on a voxel-by-voxel threshold analysis.</s><s>This allowed for a rigorous evaluation that determined that the enhancement based metric (ELV) did not show a diagnostic value.</s><s>Most importantly, a good intermethod correlation for the quantification of lesion volume could be shown to confirm the results and validate the technique in this setting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, the results of the present study outline the limitations of visual enhancement estimation for response evaluation purposes in UF.</s><s>Asymmetric necrosis with rim tissue enhancement and scattered viable foci within the lesion is a common phenomenon after MRgHIFU therapy and may explain the great extent of interreader disagreement and discrepancy between software-assisted 3D ELV quantification and planar visual attemps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Subsequently, the 3D segmentation technique overall provides a feasible, reproducible and accurate basis to evaluate tumor response to treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(23)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, this study has several limitations.</s><s>First, the small number of patients as well as the large drop-out range for patients after the 6-month follow-up.</s><s>The latter might be a result of incompliance due to clinical improvement or due to the retrospective design that has prevented us from consistently acquiring MRI scans for every patient.</s><s>Additionally, one might argue that the stratification of clinical symptoms was insufficient.</s><s>In particular, 87.5% of clinically assessed patients in this study were categorized as R at the 6-month follow-up.</s><s>However, 6 patients were excluded from this study due to additional treatments such as hysterectomy or UAE within the time of follow-up.</s><s>These patients were not included in the statistical analysis but clearly have to be considered as clinical NR.</s><s>As the patients presented with a large range of tumor volume, a correlation analysis did not reveal significant differences in the imaging parameters between the two cohorts.</s><s>Assessment of the clinical outcome at the 12-and 24-month follow-up could have clarified possible correlations.</s><s>Taking into account that most women presented with numerous fibroids, this selective evaluation of the dominant lesion as a surrogate for overall tumor response appears to be another limiting factor.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the results of the present pilot study provide initial evidence for the advantages of a segmentation-based semi-automatic 3D quantification of UF response to MRgHIFU.</s><s>Applied on ceMRI scans, the segmentation is accurate and feasible for daily clinical practice and reveals a beneficial diagnostic value of TLV in this setting.</s><s>This study may drive research in the field of image-based 3D response evaluation for further validation of the presented results in larger prospective trials.</s><s>The graph illustrates representative changes in the total lesion volume (TLV) and the enhancing lesion volume (ELV) of a uterine fibroid after MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU) in a 44-year old patient.</s><s>In the vertical, the contrast-enhanced MRI (ceMRI) scans are arranged according to the time of acquisition.</s><s>In the horizontal, A and B demonstrate the ceMRI scans at 0 and 20 sec, respectively.</s><s>C represents the volume rendering for the segmented lesion on a ceMRI scan.</s><s>D demonstrates the color map of the lesion using 3-dimensional response quantification in uterine fibroids (3D-RESQU); the color coding varies from red representing maximum enhancement to blue representing no enhancement.</s><s>The graph illustrates the interreader agreement for manual volume measurements A, B as well as the inter-method correlation between manual and 3D-RESQU evaluation of the total lesion volume (TLV) on contrast-enhanced MRI scans C, D at baseline and 6 months after MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU).</s><s>According to the linear regression model and the calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient (R 2 ), volumes assessed manually by both readers demonstrate good agreement and the strong correlation of both attempts validates volumetric calculations by the semi-automatic 3D-RESQU technique in this setting.</s><s>The graph illustrates the inter-reader agreement for visual enhancement assessment A, B as well as the inter-method correlation between visual and 3D-RESQU evaluation of the enhancing lesion volume (ELV) on contrast-enhanced MRI scans C, D at baseline and 6 months after MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MRgHIFU).</s><s>According to the linear regression model and the calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient (R 2 ), visually estimated enhancements only show slight agreement and thereby demonstrate limited reproducibility.</s><s>The correlation analysis of both attempts reveals strong discrepancy, particularly at the 6-month follow-up, suggesting a benefit of the semi-automatic 3D-RESQU technique over a planar visual approach.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure
