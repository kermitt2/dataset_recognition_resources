therefore making generalization between studies difficult.</s></p><p><s>Exploratory analyses contrasting nap and full-night sleep architecture indicated several substantial differences besides mere sleep duration.</s><s>Specifically we found more (relative) N1 sleep, less (relative) REM sleep and shorter N2 onset latency during naps.</s><s>Furthermore, group comparisons regarding spindle characteristics showed robust differences in spindle density, activity, and amplitude.</s><s>It can be speculated if differences of such kind may have direct consequences on aspects of memory consolidation.</s><s>Especially, a practical absence of REM sleep and NREM-REM cycles as well as alterations in sleep spindles may be detrimental to certain kinds of memories.</s><s>In addition, SWS amplitude and slope are significantly altered by prior time spent awake <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dijk et al., 1990)</ref>, indicating that SWS itself likely differs in quality during naps.</s><s>Finally, hormones such as acetylcholine, cortisol and norepinephrine are under circadian control <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Roberts, 2000)</ref>, and have been related to consolidation during sleep (Gais   <ref type="bibr">, 2004</ref>).</s><s>Altogether we believe that differences in such factors should be more carefully considered when discussing napping data and when generalizing results.</s><s>Our current study and admittedly exploratory attempt to compare daytime naps with full-night sleep is intended to highlight the manifold differences in sleep characteristics as well as performance outcomes, even if one uses completely identical memory tasks.</s></p><p><s>As in previous nighttime studies <ref type="bibr">(B odizs et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schabus et al., 2006)</ref>, we also tested whether associations between IQ and sleep spindles can likewise be found in nap data.</s><s>Surprisingly, the current study did not reveal associations of spindle activity and IQ, at least not after carefully correcting for multiple comparisons (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Ideally this study should have included an adaptation sleep period as habitually performed for full-night studies.</s><s>Unfortunately this is rarely conducted for nap studies, although our data indicate that for a first nap N2 sleep onset latency is prolonged (by 3 min) and N2 percentage is reduced (by 9%;
