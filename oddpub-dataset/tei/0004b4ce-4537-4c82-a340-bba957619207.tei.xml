<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>for the ESCAPE Trial Consortium and the 4C Study Group IMPORTANCE Conventional methods to diagnose and monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children, such as creatinine level and cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and assessment of proteinuria in spot or timed urine samples, are of limited value in identifying patients at risk of progressive kidney function loss.</s><s>Serum soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR) levels strongly predict incident CKD stage 3 in adults.</s></p><p><s>OBJECTIVE To determine whether elevated suPAR levels are associated with renal disease progression in children with CKD.</s></p><p><s>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Post hoc analysis of 2 prospectively followed up pediatric CKD cohorts, ie, the ESCAPE Trial (1999-2007) and the 4C Study (2010-2016), with serum suPAR level measured at enrollment and longitudinal eGFR measured prospectively.</s><s>In the 2 trials, a total of 898 children were observed at 30 (ESCAPE Trial; n = 256) and 55 (4C Study; n = 642) tertiary care hospitals in 13 European countries.</s><s>Renal diagnoses included congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (n = 637 [70.9%]), tubulointerstitial nephropathies (n = 92 [10.2%]), glomerulopathies (n = 69 [7.7%]), postischemic CKD (n = 42 [4.7%]), and other CKD (n = 58 [6.5%]).</s><s>Total follow-up duration was up to 7.9 years, and median follow-up was 3.1 years.</s><s>Analyses were conducted from October 2016 to December 2016.</s></p><p><s>EXPOSURES Serum suPAR level was measured at enrollment, and eGFR was measured every 2 months in the ESCAPE Trial and every 6 months in the 4C Study.</s><s>The primary end point of CKD progression was a composite of 50% eGFR loss, eGFR less than 10 mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 , or initiation of renal replacement therapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</head><p><s>The primary end point in this study was renal survival, defined as a composite of 50% loss of GFR that persisted for at least 1 month, the start of renal replacement therapy, or an eGFR less than 10 mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 .</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Of the 898 included children, 560 (62.4%) were male, and the mean (SD) patient age at enrollment was 11.9 (3.5) years.</s><s>The mean (SD) eGFR was 34 (16) mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 .</s><s>The 5-year end point-free renal survival was 64.5% (95% CI, 57.4-71.7) in children with suPAR levels in the lowest quartile compared with 35.9% (95% CI, 28.7-43.0) in those in the highest quartile (P &lt; .001).</s><s>By multivariable analysis, the risk of attaining the end point was higher in children with glomerulopathies and increased with age, blood pressure, proteinuria, and lower eGFR at baseline.</s><s>In patients with baseline eGFR greater than 40 mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 , higher log-transformed suPAR levels were associated with a higher risk of CKD progression after adjustment for traditional risk factors (hazard ratio, 5.12; 95% CI, 1.56-16.7;</s><s>P = .007).</s></p><p><s>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with high suPAR levels were more likely to have progression of their kidney disease.</s><s>Further studies should determine whether suPAR levels can identify children at risk for future CKD.</s></p></div>

association between suPAR levels and CKD progression relative to the prevailing degree of renal dysfunction.</s><s>In prospective CKD studies, GFR is universally highly predictive of renal survival because the time to both end-stage renal disease and a fractional GFR loss is shorter in patients with an initially low GFR.</s><s>Owing to impaired clearance of suPAR in advanced CKD, an inverse relationship between circulating suPAR levels emerges as renal failure progresses, limiting the additional in-formation content of suPAR levels over eGFR alone.</s><s>It remains to be explored whether
