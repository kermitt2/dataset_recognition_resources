of literate adults who are fluent in English.</s><s>The self-administered version performed similarly to the interviewer-administered version, and this would enhance its usability in assessing daily physical activities in population-based surveys by reducing questionnaire administrative burden.</s><s>Our study presented fair-to-moderate criterion validity of the GPAQ via comparison with the accelerometry-measured physical activity, which is comparable between the two modes.</s><s>These validity results are consistent with the findings reported by other researchers who validated the interviewer-administered GPAQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>It was observed that correlations for vigorous-intensity activity were stronger than for moderate intensity, which is consistent with several studies of other physical activity questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our study also demonstrates that relative to the GPAQ, the accelerometer provided up to almost one hour lower estimates of total MVPA per day, which agrees with earlier findings where an overestimation of self-reported MVPA was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>The Bland-Altman plots demonstrate larger disagreement between the GPAQ and accelerometer at higher levels of MVPA.</s><s>This pattern indicated overestimation at high activity levels and underestimation at lower activity levels by the GPAQ in our population being studied.</s><s>The difference between both self-and interviewer-administered approaches seemed to be particularly prominent with regard to vigorous physical activity.</s><s>This pattern of bias between accelerometry-based physical activity and questionnaires was similar to the findings of other published validation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>When accelerometry-based physical activity was determined without the 10-minute bout definition, there would unlikely be nonzero minute of MVPA.</s><s>As opposed to this, physical activity questionnaires measure physical activity in bouts of 10 minutes, resulting in the inconsistencies between the two measurements.</s><s>This bias makes the interpretation of questionnaire based findings alone in epidemiological studies problematic.</s></p><p><s>Our findings are consistent with other research demonstrating stronger correlation in vigorous-intensity activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s>This may be explained by a more structured nature that is easier to recall.</s><s>On the other hand, moderate-intensity activities may be both more perceptually and cognitively difficult to recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>Identifying ways to improve the accuracy of self-report measures among the population is therefore important in assessing physical activity and trends.</s></p><p><s>The GPAQ, alongside with other commonly used physical activity questionnaires (e.g.</s><s>International Physical Activity Questionnaire, IPAQ) were designed to collect physical activity information in accumulated bouts of at least 10-minute per session.</s><s>Hence, this study considers the implications of using total minutes of activity and 10-minute bouts of activity to determine the accelerometry-derived activity measures.</s><s>Based upon existing literature, it seems often unclear whether previous validation studies used total activity or 10-minute bouts for the direct comparison with self-report physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Several published studies treated the accelerometer activity data in 1-minute bout definition to validate the physical activity questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Our study showed that when accelerometry-derived MVPA in bouts of 10-minute was considered, the overall and vigorous correlations changed only slightly compared to total-minute activity.</s><s>However, the correlation at moderate-intensity activity estimate dropped substantially from the 1-to 10-minute bout definition.</s><s>To our knowledge, only one previous study has analyzed the physical activity data using 1-minute and 10-minute bout definitions for the validation of the IPAQ (short form) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>They also found that in comparison with the 1-minute bout length, there was a slightly lower correlation between the IPAQ and accelerometry-derived activity when the 10-minute bout definition was employed (r = 0.36 and r = 0.26, respectively).</s><s>This seems to confirm the previously highlighted difficulties of accurately recalling moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities, especially activities accumulated in at least 10-minute bouts.</s></p><p><s>Apart from overestimation by self-report questionnaires, there are issues related to the use of accelerometers that can also contribute towards the discrepancy between both approaches and the observed moderate correlations.</s><s>For instance, albeit being the most widely used objective tool to measure physical activity, accelerometers are known to underestimate certain activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Activities like doing housework and cycling which involve only limited movement of the center of mass are poorly detected by accelerometers.</s><s>In addition, activities such as swimming are often not captured because participants are advised to remove the devices during such activities.</s><s>This can partly contribute to the discrepancies between self-reported and accelerometry-derived estimates of activity.</s><s>Although several thresholds and algorithms have been developed for accelerometry-measured physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, there is no consensus on the best method to define physical activity levels and types.</s></p><p><s>Only few studies seem to have reported the reliability of the GPAQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, the self-administered version showed comparable reliability with the interviewer-administered version in estimating activity level at each intensity, as well as classification of participants in meeting recommended levels of physical activity.</s><s>Of note, a lower agreement of the testretest on total MVPA was demonstrated in the interviewer-administered group.</s><s>This may be explained by the differences in the domains of physical activities our study population participated in.</s><s>The reported activity in the transport domain contributed to most total MVPA and showed greater variability as compared to other activities.</s><s>As the total MVPA was calculated by the sum of vigorous-, moderate-intensity activities of all domains, the observed difference in trend between the Spearman's correlation and ICC (r s = 0.61 vs. ICC: 0.28) of the reliability for total MVPA was not unexpected given participants in our study reported engaging more active transport activities and may hence influence the total level of MVPA.</s><s>In contrast to these observations, the interviewer-administered mode has resulted in better test-retest reliability than self-administered mode in a study of elderly adults' physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Similar to our observations for validity, reliability was strongest for the assessment of vigorous recreational activities, which is consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s><s>This result could be explained by the fact that vigorous activity is predominantly accumulated through recreational and thus likely intentional structured exercise.</s><s>Participants are able to report such intentional and more well-defined periods of physical activity behavior better than less well-defined ones such as traveling from one place to another or moderate intensity day to day activities.</s></p><p><s>Our reliability result from the self-administration mode was comparable to Trinh et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> in which moderate reliability was presented for total MVPA using the GPAQ.</s><s>A considerably smaller study by Herrmann et al. reported somewhat better reliability when assessing the GPAQ with an interval of 10 days among US adults aged 43.1 ± 11.4 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>A possible explanation for the differences in physical activity reporting reliability might be related to different study populations.</s></p><p><s>Variations in correlation coefficients and agreement of test-retest assessments were noted.</s><s>Nonetheless, different measures suggested that all the GPAQ items provided acceptable reproducibility, which is consistent with results of Lachat et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, which showed differences in the test-retest reliability of the IPAQ.</s><s>The GPAQ showed good reliability in classifying participants' physical activity levels, which is in line with Herrmann et al.'s <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> study outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Reliability across all three domains was at least moderate, and the highest reliability was found for recreational activities.</s><s>In line with our discussion of higher validity and reliability for vigorous intensity activities, this also seems to suggest that the relatively more structured and planned nature of recreational activities may be responsible for these results.</s><s>However, our findings differ somewhat from those of Bull et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> who reported the highest correlation for the work domain.</s></p><p><s>The strength of this study is the high compliance with accelerometer wear and adherence with the study protocol.</s><s>Additionally, our study included a 24-hour accelerometer wear time protocol, which resulted in relatively high wearing durations per day.</s><s>This might better reflect the physical activity pattern of a participant on a full day than the commonly used approach of focusing on waking time alone.</s><s>Furthermore, participants were randomly assigned to two administration modes to avoid any potential bias for the comparison between groups.</s><s>Through this random grouping method, the comparability between the two groups was achieved in relation to their sociodemographic characteristics.</s></p><p><s>One of the limitations of our study is that the population of our study consisted of mostly full-time working adults and a small number of students from within the university and hospital workplace settings; thus, the results may have limited representativeness for the entire Singaporean population.</s><s>Also, as the population studied comprised English-speaking adults with more than 50% of them having tertiary education; applicability to other populations cannot be assumed.</s><s>Second, a bias in estimation of activity which is dependent on the duration of overall activities has been shown by the GPAQ, which introduces some errors.</s><s>Nonetheless, previous studies have also presented similar findings, thus it is inevitable that the questionnaire are likely to be subject to performance limitations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In conclusion, this is among the first studies comparing the reliability and validity of the internationally widely used GPAQ considering two different modes of administration.</s><s>Moreover, a 24-hour wear time protocol was employed and considered two different scenarios for accelerometer data processing.</s><s>Our findings show that both interviewer-and self-administered modes of the GPAQ are comparable.</s><s>Evidence for criterion validity was shown with fair-to-moderate correlation coefficients, of which the self-administration can be used in population-based studies.</s></p><p><s>However, there was potential bias in estimation of activity differing at different intensities by the GPAQ.</s><s>It should be noted that the pattern of over-and underestimation from the GPAQ is unpredictable; and these responses are dependent on the overall physical activity.</s><s>Therefore, the use of GPAQ as a tool for investigation of adult physical activity patterns should be undertaken with caution.</s></p><p><s>Future epidemiological studies could incorporate the GPAQ with a good understanding of various types and domains in which physical activity is carried out; together with objectively measured physical activity that provide a more accurate measure of overall activity levels and at various activity intensity levels.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
