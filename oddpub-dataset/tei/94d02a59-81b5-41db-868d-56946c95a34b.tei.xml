<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INtrODUctION</head><p><s>Inherited genetic variation and acquired genomic aberrations are constitutive for cancer initiation and cancer progression.</s><s>In the era of cancer precision medicine, monitoring of clinically relevant genetic alterations is important to stratify patients for targeted therapies.</s><s>In addition to "conventional" mutations such as point mutations, small insertions and deletions, clinically relevant genetic alterations include macro-aberrations such as amplifications, deletions or translocations.</s><s>In particular, HER2 amplifications in breast cancer exemplify the important biological role and clinical utility of copy number variations/alterations (CNVs/CNAs) in oncological therapy.</s><s>HER2 testing and anti-HER2 treatment revolutionized breast cancer care in 1998, when the FDA approved Herceptin for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer following the success of the first phase III clinical trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Subsequently, Herceptin was also approved for early breast cancer in the adjuvant setting after completion of the NSABP/NCCTG and HERA trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a recent pan-cancer analysis of more than 3,000 TCGA tumors resulted in two top classes either dominated by somatic mutations (M class) or dominated by somatic copy number alterations (C class) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The C class included almost all breast cancers and almost all high-grade serous ovarian cancers.</s><s>For breast cancer, this assignment is supported by the fact that the number of recurrently mutated genes is low <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, while copy number alterations (together with gene expression data) built the basis of the recent METABRIC breast cancer classification in ten internal clusters <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Complementing HER2, the landscape of all gene amplifications and deletions may represent a collection of promising candidates for future biomarkers and therapeutic targets in breast cancer.</s></p><p><s>There is a multitude of methods to detect germline CNVs or somatic CNAs in cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>These methods can be classified in different ways: Firstly, there are basically two types of technologies, hybridization based and next-generation sequencing (NGS) based approaches.</s><s>Secondly, there are technologies interrogating the whole genome such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), SNP arrays or whole genome sequencing as opposed to technologies that analyze selected regions of the genome.</s><s>These targeted approaches range from whole exome sequencing via sequencing of a smaller number of selected gene regions to the traditional locus-specific methods such as fluorescence or silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (FISH or SISH).</s><s>Thirdly, it is important to distinguish between the ISH based methods that allow cell-specific assessment of CNAs under the microscope and all other methods that are based on many-cellaverages and possibly include genetically different cells, such as cancer cells, normal cells and differing subclones of cancer cells.</s></p><p><s>In recent years, targeted NGS has been established for routine molecular diagnostics of cancers to interrogate clinically actionable genetic aberrations.</s><s>This implementation was driven by the advances in personalized oncology with both a growing number of actionable genetic targets in a single tumor and a growing number of patients being investigated for these targets.</s><s>In addition to the detection of somatic mutations, it was shown that the detection of CNAs from targeted sequencing data is generally feasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>Methodically, CNA calling in amplicon sequencing (AS) data relies on calculation of the amplicon coverages and the detection of coverage outliers after a suitable normalization.</s><s>To this end, most of the current algorithm require sequencing of paired tumor and normal DNA samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or utilize a normal DNA reference sample for normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>However, in routine diagnostics normal control tissue is not always available, particularly when it comes to genotyping of small biopsies.</s><s>In addition, sequencing normal tissue in parallel would double the costs for diagnostic AS applications per case.</s><s>Moreover, most of the current algorithms include neither significance assessment nor correction for multiple hypotheses testing.</s></p><p><s>To overcome these limitations, we developed and evaluated Ioncopy, a new algorithm to detect CNAs from AS data that is freely available as R package from the CRAN repository.</s><s>As input, the algorithm uses sequencing data of cohort of tumors and does not require normal DNA controls.</s><s>The guiding idea is to estimate a null distribution of copy numbers using outlier-robust statistics and assess the significance of CNAs by comparison with this null distribution.</s><s>In this way, p-values are obtained for each amplicon in each tumor that are subsequently corrected for multiple hypothesis testing.</s></p><p><s>We tested Ioncopy in AS data obtained with a 154-amplicon-panel that was designed to include the most important simple somatic mutations and gene amplifications in breast cancer.</s><s>Using this panel, a clinical cohort of 184 breast carcinomas was sequenced and data were analyzed for the detection of CNAs using the new algorithm.</s><s>The performance of Ioncopy was evaluated by (i) comparing the detected HER2 CNAs with the HER2 status determined by the gold standard of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ISH <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, (ii) comparing the CNs detected by different amplicons interrogating the same gene, (iii) analyzing the overall CNA landscape of all 48 genes covered by the panel and (iv) correlating the Ioncopy CNA calls with the tumor RNA expression of the corresponding gene.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIscUssION</head><p><s>Ioncopy is a novel fast and easy-to-use algorithm to detect CNAs from AS data without normal controls.</s><s>An implementation is freely available as R package ioncopy from the CRAN repository.</s><s>While the general feasibility to detect CNAs using this kind of data has been demonstrated before <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, to our knowledge this algorithm is the first that includes a significance assessment for each of the detected changes.</s><s>Unlike the majority of other algorithms, Ioncopy does not depend on normal DNA controls, but estimates a null distribution from CNs in a tumor cohort.</s></p><p><s>In routine diagnostics, there are several difficulties connected with the use of normal DNA controls: Often, normal control tissue is not available, particulary when a single small tumor biopsy of a patient has to be genotyped.</s><s>In addition, sequencing of paired normal tissues would double the already considerable costs for targeted deep sequencing.</s><s>Finally, in some countries there are legal issues connected with sequencing of normal DNA and putative inadvertent detection of clinically relevant germline aberrations.</s></p><p><s>A total number of 252 gene amplifications affecting 39 genes were found, whereof 183 (72.6%) could be validated by a call of a second amplicon interrogating the same gene.</s><s>Analyzing the 16 top amplified genes, validation rates were higher than 89% for 11 of these genes.</s><s>Furthermore, 11 of the top 16 genes showed significant overexpression in the amplified tumors compared to the unamplified tumors.</s><s>A detailed analysis of the 17q12 region showed that 89.5% of the HER2amplified tumors were also GRB7 and STARD3 amplified, whereas 68.4% of the HER2-amplified tumors were MED1 amplified.</s><s>The rates of co-amplifications are in good agreement to those reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, a total number of 33 gene deletions affecting 7 genes were founds, whereof 27 (81.8%)</s><s>could be validated.</s><s>In an analysis of 16 normal tissues, gene amplifications were only detected in one of the samples, and gene deletions were detected in none of the samples supporting the notion that Ioncopy is a highly specific method for calling CNAs.</s></p><p><s>Gene deletions are usually associated with a lower change of CNs and more difficult to detect than gene amplifications.</s><s>In AS data, CN are estimated from coverages of the amplicons and therefore the sensitivity to discriminate between CNs is related to the precision of the CN estimates.</s><s>The precision of copy number estimation can be characterized by the width of the inter-sample CN distribution that harbored SDs between 0.20 and 0.60 for the majority (&gt; 90%) of the amplicons.</s><s>Gene deletions correspond to copy number changes ΔCN = 1 or 2, while gene amplifications can harbor much higher ΔCNs, for example 5 or even 10.</s><s>Furthermore, gene deletions are more prone to false positive detection because technical problems may cause malfunction of particular amplicons resulting in low or zero coverages.</s><s>Ioncopy addresses these differences by using different detection algorithms for gene amplifications and for gene deletions.</s><s>Detection of a gene amplification was based on detection by a single amplicon and multiple testing correction of the p-value for samples and amplicons, In contrast, detection of a gene deletion was based on detection by at least four amplicons using raw p-values without multiple testing correction.</s></p><p><s>Analyzing the agreement between amplicons in exons 19, 20 and 21 of HER2, we observed very strong pairwise correlations (all R &gt; 0.93) and an excellent agreement of CNA calls: 17 tumors (9.2%) were classified as HER2 amplified by all three amplicons, 162 tumors (88.0%) were classified as HER2 unamplified by all three amplicons, while disagreements occurred only for 5 tumors (2.7%).</s><s>For HER2 status determination using the 2013 ASCO-CAP guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> as gold standard, NGS based CNA calling had a sensitivity of 90.0% and a closeto-perfect specificity of 98.8% and an overall agreement of 97.8%.</s><s>As discussed before, the NGS based method had excellent inter-amplicon reproducibility and NGS results showed a high degree of co-amplification among the genes HER2, GRB7 and STARD3 that are located close together in 17q12.</s><s>Thus, the limited sensitivity for detection of HER2+ tumors is most likely not due to a lacking sensitivity of the NGS-based method but a consequence of one or more of the following factors: (i) Some of the tumors might be wrongly classified as IHC 3+ and thus HER2+ being negative for HER2 amplification in reality.</s><s>(ii) According to the ASCO-CAP guidelines, a HER2 test result has to be reported as positive if either HER2 copy number signal ≥ 6.0 or HER/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0.</s><s>In principle, it would be possible that cases below the detection limit of Ioncopy (CN &gt; 3.51 for the amplicon in exon 19 of HER2) are classified as HER2+ by SISH.</s><s>(iii) CNAs are diminished by contamination with normal tissue and therefore below the detection limit.</s><s>(iv) The same effect might be caused by subclonality of the tumor cells, where some tumor cells are HER2-amplified, but the majority of tumor cells is not amplified for HER2.</s><s>(v) Inter-block tumor inhomogeneity may contribute to the discordance as NGS and IHC/SISH were not conducted using consecutive sections because we used frozen tissues for sequencing but FFPE tissues for HER2 status determination.</s><s>Interestingly, there was a perfect agreement for the tumors with high (≥ 11.75) HER2 gene expression: all of them were HER2+ and all of them got called for HER2 amplification by Ioncopy.</s><s>This observation supports the view that a large portion of the discrepancy is caused by tissue inhomogeneity.</s><s>It should be noted that the comparison of HER2 status assessment at different laboratories and even between different pathologists at the same laboratory has been reported to have an agreement in the range of 67-92% <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>For example, agreement on HER2 status between local and central laboratories in the NCCTG N9831 trail was 85.8% <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Taking into account inter-laboratory and inter-pathologist variance, it is unrealistic to expect a perfect agreement of NGS and Ioncopy with the visual method.</s><s>Moreover, Ioncopy results represent an average value over the tumor tissue used for sequencing whereas visual scoring is performed at a comparatively smaller region leading to variations due to sampling effects.</s></p><p><s>The new method for CNA detection has certain limitations.</s><s>Firstly, as Ioncopy does not use paired normal tissues for CNA detection, it is not possible to distinguish between germline CNVs and somatic CNAs.</s><s>However, although germline CNVs are much less frequent than acquired CNAs in most solid cancers, both of them can contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor growth.</s><s>Thus, from the standpoint of clinics and of treatment options gene dose changes are important, but it may be unimportant if the change is hereditary or acquired.</s><s>In this context, it can be considered as an advantage, that both kinds of changes are covered by a single analysis.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, contamination of tumor DNA with normal DNA diminishes the degree of gene amplification or gene deletion detectable in the extracted DNA that is investigated by AS.</s><s>Normal tissue contamination has two important implications: 1.</s><s>The sensitivity to detect CNAs is diminished 2. Detected changes of CNs are less pronounced.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the effect of contamination with normal (germline) DNA on the detection limits for CN gains: Using multiple testing correction for samples and amplicons, the detection limit increases from 3.99 via 4.48 and 5.97 to 8.62 when the tumor DNA content decreases from 100% via 80% and 50% to 30%.</s><s>In cohorts with low tumor content, calling amplifications based on calls of more than one amplicon can help to lower the detection limit and to increase sensitivity.</s><s>The second issue can be corrected post hoc using a linear transformation CN[tumor] = 1/TA × (CN[mixture] -2) + 2 (TA = tumor area in %).</s><s>In the cohort under investigation, these effects are moderate because the average tumor content was 85.7% in the investigated samples.</s><s>However, it can be more pronounced in samples with less tumor content.</s><s>In situ methods like FISH are more accurate in this context, but lack the opportunity of scalability and high-throughput investigation of many genes.</s></p><p><s>Thirdly, the algorithm is built on the assumption that the majority of tumors in the cohorts is unaltered at each genomic position under consideration.</s><s>Under this assumption, the null distribution can be validly estimated using median and median absolute deviation.</s><s>The assumption is fulfilled for most if not all of the genomic regions in many population-based cancer cohorts.</s><s>In breast cancer, the most frequent CNAs affect only 5% to 20% of tumors in a representative population <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>However, this assumption might be violated for some chromosomal regions in some tumor types.</s><s>In this case, a cohort of normal tissues (or blood) can be sequenced and used as control.</s><s>Ioncopy can be applied in such a way that normalization constants and thresholds for CNA calling are estimated in the normal tissue cohort.</s></p><p><s>We presented and evaluated a new algorithm to detect CNAs in AS data.</s><s>Ioncopy offers the opportunity to call gene amplifications and gene deletions together with "conventional" mutations such as point mutations, small insertions and deletions from the same data set.</s><s>When designing a panel for conventional mutation and CNA analysis, we recommend including at least three amplicons for each gene that is investigated for amplifications and six amplicons for each gene that is investigated for deletions.</s><s>A minimum number of one amplicon is needed for the detection of gene amplifications, while a minimum number of four amplicons is needed for the detection of gene deletions.</s><s>The additional amplicons allow for internal validation and help to circumvent technical errors caused by possible malfunction of particular amplicons.</s></p><p><s>Targeted NGS has reached the status of a routine diagnostics application that is used to interrogate targetable simple somatic mutations in a tumor.</s><s>Here, we extended its use to the calling of gene amplifications and gene deletions in a reproducible and reliable way.</s><s>Implementation of gene amplification calling to together with somatic mutation calling in a single and easy-touse assay is a step forward towards an intensification of research on the clinical implications of CNAs and implementation of suitable actionable CNA markers in routine diagnostics.</s></p></div>
