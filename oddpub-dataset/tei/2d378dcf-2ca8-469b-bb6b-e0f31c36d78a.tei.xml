Ha</s><s>ing these 5â€² complete transcript models allows us to better assess the sequence features and selective constraints at lncRNA loci, and categorize them on the basis of epigenetic marks at their transcription initiation regions (TIRs).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Building a 5â€² complete transcriptome</head><p><s>To build a 5â€² complete transcriptome atlas, we first collected transcript models from GENCODE release 19 (ref.</s><s>19), Human BodyMap 2.0 (ref.</s><s>4), miTranscriptome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , ENCODE <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and an RNA-seq assembly from 70 FANTOM5 samples (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>, Methods and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>To identify 5â€² complete transcript models, we developed the transcription initiation evidence score (TIEScore).</s><s>For a given pair of CAGE cluster and transcript model, TIEScore evaluates three criteria: (1) the expression level of the CAGE cluster, (2) the distance from the transcript 5â€² end to the CAGE cluster and (3) the length and number of exons of a transcript, to determine the likelihood that they identify a genuine transcription start site (TSS) (Supplementary Note 1 and Methods).</s><s>We next assessed the performance of TIEScore on 70 matched CAGE and RNA-seq data sets on the basis of epigenomic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , and found that TIEScore outperformed both CAGE-only and RNA-seq-only approaches in identifying genuine TSSs (Supplementary Note 2 and Methods).</s><s>We then applied TIEScore to each of the five transcript model collections separately and merged them into a meta-assembly referred to as the FANTOM CAGEassociated transcriptome (FANTOM CAT) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a, b</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we defined genes at permissive (n = 124,245), robust (n = 59,110) and stringent (n = 31,520) TIEScore cutoffs (Supplementary Note 3 and Methods).</s><s>The robust cutoff defines the FANTOM CAT genes used in the remainder of the manuscript (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), unless otherwise specified.</s></p><p><s>We next defined 27,919 lncRNA genes in FANTOM CAT on the basis of Coding-Potential Assessment Tool (CPAT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> scores and GENCODE release 19 annotations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> (Methods and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>).</s><s>The 5â€² ends of our lncRNA transcript models show stronger evidence for being genuine TSSs than those in other catalogues (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d</ref>, e and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the FANTOM CAT catalogue has a lower false discovery rate (FDR) of complete 5â€² ends (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>) and contains more 5â€² complete transcript models (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>), as further validated by RAMPAGE data <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, FANTOM CAT improves the existing lncRNA transcript models (examples in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and Supplementary Note 4) and provides the most comprehensive catalogue of human lncRNAs so far.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>lncRNA TIRs</head><p><s>Next, we categorized lncRNAs on the basis of the overlap between their TSSs and the DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) previously classified as promoter, enhancer or dyadic regulatory regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b, c</ref>).</s><s>We found that a large fraction of DHS-supported intergenic lncRNAs (68%) originate from enhancer DHSs (e-lncRNA, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>).</s><s>For lncRNAs originating from promoter DHSs, most (72%), were divergently transcribed from messenger RNA (mRNA) TSS (divergent p-lncRNA, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>) as previously observed in mouse erythroblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> , and surprisingly only a minority, for example MALAT1 (ref.</s><s>7), were intergenic (intergenic p-lncRNA, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>).</s><s>Histone marks at the TIRs of these lncRNA categories recapitulate the epigenomic features of their regulatory regions (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Leveraging the 5â€² completeness of FANTOM CAT, we revisited <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> the analysis of sequence features at TIRs of mRNAs and lncRNAs.</s><s>First, we examined the overall selective constraints on the basis of rejected substitution score <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>For mRNAs, we observed strongly positive rejected substitution scores at their TSSs and slightly negative scores upstream (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>, first row).</s><s>For divergent p-lncRNAs, we observed a mirrored pattern to their mRNA counterpart, as expected (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>, first row).</s><s>Although intergenic p-lncRNAs and e-lncRNAs showed only slightly positive rejected substitution scores at their TIRs (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>, first row), we observed sequence features conducive to generating long transcripts (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>, third and fourth rows) and enrichment of motifs involved in transcription initiation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, these suggest that at least a subset of intergenic p-lncRNA and e-lncRNA TIRs have undergone selection for both transcription initiation and elongation.</s></p></div>
