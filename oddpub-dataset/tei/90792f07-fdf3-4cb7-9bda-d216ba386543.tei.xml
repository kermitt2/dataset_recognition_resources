<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The basic cellular units of skeletal muscle are myofibers, which are multinuclear syncytia capable of contraction.</s><s>Myofibers, which are generated during prenatal development, continue to grow after birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(White et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>This postnatal growth requires a sufficiently large pool of muscle precursors, the so-called satellite cells, which reside between the basal lamina and the sarcolemma of muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Mauro, 1961)</ref>.</s><s>During the first 3 weeks of postnatal mouse development, muscle fibers grow through the recruitment of satellite cells (accretion), thereby enlarging the number of myonuclei, as well as expanding the cytoplasmic domain.</s><s>Thereafter, muscle fibers grow mainly by expanding their cytoplasmic volume without further addition of myonuclei <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(White et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>Whereas postnatal satellite cells cycle to generate progenitors for fusion with the muscle fibers, they are quiescent in adult muscle and are only reactivated for the regeneration of damaged muscle fibers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Beilharz et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>The postnatal growth period is accompanied by a steady decline in the number of muscle satellite cells until 21 days after birth and remains stable thereafter throughout adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(White et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Little is known about the intercellular signaling systems that guide postnatal muscle growth and determine adult satellite cell number.</s><s>We and others have previously described the crucial role of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) during embryonic, fetal and adult muscle growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Amthor et al., 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amthor et al., , 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amthor et al., , 2002;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hirsinger et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ono et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pourquié et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sartori et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>In parallel with other members of the TGFβ family of signaling molecules, BMPs act on target cells via transmembrane serine/ threonine kinase receptors.</s><s>BMPs bind to type II and type I receptors, and form a ligand-receptor complex that permits the phosphorylation of the type I receptor via the constitutively active type II receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Nohe et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Nohe et al., , 2002))</ref>.</s><s>The type I receptor in turn phosphorylates the BMP-responsive Smad1/5/8 proteins.</s><s>Phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 proteins subsequently form complexes with co-Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate transcriptional activity of target genes such as DNA-binding protein inhibitors (Ids) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Four isoforms of these proteins (Id1-4) block the binding of E proteins with the myogenic regulatory transcription factor MyoD and inhibit terminal differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jen et al., 1992)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, BMP signaling upregulates the inhibitory Smad6 as part of a negative feedback loop.</s><s>Smad6 interferes with BMP signaling at the level of the receptor, as well as at the level of the complex formation between receptor-regulated Smad1 and the common mediator co-Smad4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Goto et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A number of secreted proteins, such as noggin (Nog), can noncovalently bind BMPs, thereby impeding their receptor binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Amthor et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krause et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The BMP/Nog antagonism regulates satellite cell lineage progression.</s><s>We have previously demonstrated in vitro that BMP signaling stimulated proliferation of activated adult satellite cells and inhibited myogenic differentiation, whereas abrogation of BMP signaling via addition of Nog, induced precocious differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ono et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, myotube formation is delayed in Nog-null mice, pointing to a requirement for Nog expression for proper muscle differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Tylzanowski et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, injection of Nog into regenerating muscle inhibited BMP signaling and reduced P-Smad1/5/8, Id1 and Id3 protein levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Clever et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Based on our previous in vitro findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ono et al., 2011)</ref>, we set out to determine the role of BMP signaling on satellite cells in vivo.</s><s>We chose the early postnatal/juvenile growth phase of mouse limb muscles as our main experimental model because satellite cell activation, proliferation and differentiation, as well as fiber growth, can be much more easily observed when compared with regeneration models.</s><s>We used three independent techniques to interfere with BMP signaling in satellite cells: (1) addition of Nog, which interferes at the ligand level; (2) abrogation of the BMP transmembrane receptor Alk3, which interferes at the receptor level; and (3) overexpression of SMAD6, which interferes with BMP signaling at the cell-autonomous level.</s><s>We show that abrogation of BMP signaling severely inhibits satellite cell activity, myonuclear recruitment and the generation of the adult satellite cell pool.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BMP signaling is active in postnatal muscle satellite cells</head><p><s>We first asked whether the BMP signaling pathway is active during the postnatal growth phase of skeletal muscle.</s><s>We found the presence of transcripts of genes encoding different BMP ligands, the BMP receptor Alk3 (also known as Bmpr1a), the BMP target gene Id1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002)</ref>, as well as the BMP antagonists Nog, Grem1, Fst and Chrd (respectively encoding for Nog, gremlin 1, follistatin and chordin) in total RNA extracted from limb skeletal muscle of 3-,14-, 21-and 28-day-old mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1A</ref>).</s><s>Generally, the mRNA concentrations for BMP signaling components declined from postnatal to young adult stages.</s></p><p><s>In order to identify whether satellite cells respond to BMP signaling, we monitored the nuclear accumulation of BMP-induced Smad1/5 proteins in Pax7-positive nuclei using double immunohistochemistry.</s><s>We discovered P-Smad1/5-positive and -negative satellite cells in postnatal, juvenile and young adult muscle (from 3-, 14-, 21-and 28-day-old mice) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>We also found P-Smad1/5-positive nuclei that were negative for Pax7, which mainly were myonuclei within myofibers, as judged from their position.</s></p><p><s>We next examined the time frame and dynamics of the response of satellite cells to BMPs.</s><s>For this, satellite cells were isolated from 6-to 8-week-old mice by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and expanded in culture, which maintained Pax7 expression in nearly 100% of cells in all the described conditions.</s><s>Cells were then submitted to a serum-free culture condition supplemented with soluble Alk3 receptor for 6 h, thereby removing residual BMP ligands otherwise likely present in the culture medium.</s><s>Thereafter, culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 100 ng/ml of BMP4 for 1 h, which increased nuclear levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5 protein in the cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1B,C</ref>), clearly indicating that they respond to BMP signaling.</s><s>Additionally, by performing a time course study, we found that Id1 mRNA copy numbers peaked 1 h after BMP4 exposure and slowly declined thereafter (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1D</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, in control cultures, Id1 expression increased slowly following medium change from Alk3 pre-treatment to vehicle supplemented control medium (not containing Alk3), suggesting that cells synthesize BMPs and therefore respond to BMP signaling in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.</s><s>This hypothesis was further supported by the finding that Id1 mRNA copy numbers in serum-deprived control cells could be further halved through addition of sAlk3, which sequestered the satellite cell-derived BMPs.</s></p><p><s>Having found that satellite cells activate the BMP signaling cascade, we next studied the expression of BMP signaling components in FACS-isolated muscle satellite cells from 3-, 14-, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>BMP signaling activity in satellite cells during postnatal muscle growth.</s><s>Sample images of immunohistochemistry to monitor phosphorylated Smad1/5 ( p-Smad1/5) expression (red) in Pax7-expressing satellite cells (green).</s><s>Muscle sections were obtained from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of postnatal wild-type mice at P3, P14, P21 and P28 ( panels from top to bottom).</s><s>DAPI (blue)
