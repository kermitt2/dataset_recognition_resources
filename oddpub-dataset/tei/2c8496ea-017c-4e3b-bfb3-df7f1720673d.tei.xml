Specifically, the National Research Council's Committee on Improving Risk Analysis Approaches used by EPA proposed that CRA be defined as evaluating an array of stressors (chemical and nonchemical) to characterize quantitatively-to the extent possible-human health or ecological effects, accounting for population vulnerability and background exposures <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</s><s>The approach to CRA thus far tends to build upon the longstanding four-step framework for conducting single chemical risk assessment: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To support the development of CRA methods across the four steps of risk assessment, the EPA issued a research solicitation, Understanding the Role of Nonchemical Stressors and Developing Analytic Methods for Cumulative Risk Assessments, through its Science to Achieve Results (STAR) extramural research program in 2009.</s><s>Although EPA has defined nonchemical stressors broadly to include physical and biological stressors such as noise, radiation, infectious agents, and poor nutrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref>, the research solicitation highlighted social conditions contributing to chronic psychosocial stress.</s><s>Under this research solicitation, EPA awarded seven STAR CRA grants (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), with a total investment of $7 million in 2010, to support community-engaged research to develop new analytical tools for combining chemical and nonchemical stressors for community-based cumulative risk assessments and evaluating modification of health effects of chemical exposures by social stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Results from these grants provide the "building blocks" for conducting CRAs to improve environmental health decision-making at national, state, and local levels.</s><s>In the following section, we review the biological basis for incorporating psychosocial stressors in environmental health risk assessment, the motivation for the EPA STAR CRA program.</s><s>Then we present the broad range of methods employed by the studies funded under the STAR CRA mechanism, which represent a variety of disciplines, including population health science, laboratory science, social sciences, geography, statistics and mathematics.</s><s>Using various techniques, the studies examined combined effects and developed insight regarding how psychosocial stressors influence population susceptibility and vulnerability to chemical stressors.</s><s>We conclude with a discussion of how the insights from these studies could inform CRA practice as defined by EPA, along with lessons learned and priorities for further research.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Psychosocial Stressors in Cumulative Risk Assessment</head><p><s>The prospect of assessing the effects of multiple stressors is daunting, as there are a seemingly an infinite number of multiplicative combinations of agents, exposures, targets, or health endpoints, with varying temporal patterns occurring acutely and/or chronically over the life span.</s><s>Approaches to these many-to-many-relationships can be simplified using models in which multiple stressors affect the same physiological systems and/or share common mechanisms of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref>.</s><s>These more-practical models for CRA require some understanding of common biological pathways or targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12,</ref><ref

resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Acute and chronic stress impact health through a wide range of biological pathways, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axes, and other key regulatory systems of the body, including immune, endocrine, central nervous system, cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In response to acute stress, the hypothalamus secretes corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), which acts on the pituitary gland, causing release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which subsequently acts on the adrenal gland, resulting in the release of cortisol (corticosterone in animals).</s><s>Normally, cortisol, the primary human stress hormone, exhibits both ultradian and circadian rhythms, with low nocturnal concentrations that increase to a morning high controlled by a circadian clock <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Release of glucocorticoids is terminated by a classic negative feedback loop, whereby the unbound form inhibits any further adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary gland.</s><s>This inhibition is further facilitated by glucocorticoid binding to specific brain regions rich in glucocorticoid receptors, such as the hippocampus and other structures of the limbic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The HPA axis also has significant interactions with the

(norepinephrine) and from the adrenal medulla (epinephrine) into the circulatory system.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, the body's response to stress is adaptive, meaning it responds to changing conditions and demands.</s><s>However, over-extension of this acute stress response over time (a.k.a., chronic stress) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29]</ref>, and the consequent failure to achieve homeostasis is what is thought to ultimately impose physiological damage and increase an individual's susceptibility to injury from other social and environmental stressors <ref type="bibr"

target="#b30">34]</ref>.</s><s>A contrasting model in which cortisol production is decreased following chronic stress has been proposed to explain the pro-inflammatory effects of chronic stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Chronic, repeated activation of acute stress responses may down-regulate, or blunt, adaptive acute stress responses either via dis-regulation of cortisol or catecholamine release, at the target tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">37]</ref>.</s><s>A meta-analysis found that chronic stress was associated with a dysregulated pattern of secretion of cortisol, including lower morning cortisol but higher secretion during the rest of the day, giving rise to a flattened diurnal variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[38]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Psychosocial stressors and chemical pollutants impact many of the same physiological systems (e.g., neurological, metabolic, immune, and cardiovascular), which are key regulatory systems of the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is highly plausible that combined psychosocial and physical environmental exposures may interact to increase or amplify risks of adverse health <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr"

additive and synergistic effects of joint exposures to chemicals and social stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">93,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">100]</ref>, little progress has been made to routinely apply CRA to environmental regulatory and policy decision-making.</s><s>Specific chemical mixtures have been analyzed for some time, in part because of statutory language (i.e., in the Food Quality Protection Act, which required examination of cumulative risks of pesticides with common mechanisms of toxicity), but policy analyses have not generally considered broader categories of mixtures that include nonchemical stressors.</s><s>Policy-makers have reasoned that this is due to a general scarcity of appropriate data on chemical mixtures, the paucity of toxicological data on the biological mechanisms of adverse health effects of mixtures and multi-stressor exposures, and a shortage of verified analytical frameworks for cumulative risk.</s><s>However, the EPA STAR CRA grantees have demonstrated that many of the necessary analytical methods to support CRA are readily available.</s><s>They involve a variety of techniques, existing and novel, including both quantitative and qualitative approaches, reinforcing that there is no one ideal approach for CRA given the wide range of applications and settings.</s><s>While the STAR grantees used diverse approaches to understand the combined impacts of chemical and nonchemical stressors, each of the studies detailed above made important contributions to furthering methods for CRA.</s></p><p><s>The projects developed and tested methods for some of the building blocks of CRA.</s><s>Each project implicitly or explicitly addressed some aspect of planning, scoping and problem formulation, although this was not the primary focus of any individual project.</s><s>Examples of methods and tools relevant to CRA planning and scoping employed by the grantees include focus groups and interviews among community residents to identify locally-relevant stressors, which were subsequently incorporated into survey instruments.</s><s>STAR CRA projects found that asking open-ended questions via these qualitative methods was particularly helpful in revealing or identifying important psychosocial stressors in residents' lives that are not usually captured by existing data sources (e.g., unstable employment, language barriers, and immigration status).</s><s>Many of these CRA STAR grantees applied community-engaged research approaches as a strategy to integrate communities' knowledge into research on environmental exposures, as well as to build community capacity to address environmental health problems.</s><s>However, these qualitative and community-engaged approaches are most relevant to local-scale assessments and may not be applicable to national-scale assessments, which are generally needed for regulatory environmental decision making by EPA.</s></p><p><s>Elucidating how chemical and nonchemical stressors may act via the same biological systems/substrates can help provide focus for CRAs, given the numerous candidate stressors.</s><s>Laboratory/experimental studies have historically provided the basis for risk assessment.</s><s>Increasing toxicological investigations that not only examine chemical mixtures but also animal models of combined chemical and nonchemical stressor exposures will be valuable in validating and identifying possible biological pathways and informing the epidemiological studies as illustrated by one of the CRA grantee projects.</s><s>However, many methodological challenges remain for integrating insights from both toxicological and epidemiological studies for assessing combined effects of multiple stressors.</s><s>First, there are many available animal stress models, so selecting the right model requires careful thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[44]</ref>.</s><s>The animal stress models should be selected based on the hypothesis to be tested and closely simulate, to the extent possible, the biological equivalent of chronic psychosocial stress in human populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[45]</ref> (e.g., the human experience of poverty, discrimination or stigma).</s><s>Animal models more akin to social stressors in human include maternal separation, isolation housing, intruder entry into the cage, and odors of predators <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>.</s><s>However, many animal models for psychological stress include physiological stress components (e.g., forced swim <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">102]</ref>, cold exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[46]</ref>, foot shock) to which animals often show adaptation as these stressors become controllable and predictable.</s><s>Animal models incorporating multiple varied stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[104]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[105]</ref> may better simulate the complexity and unpredictability of many impoverished human environments.</s></p><p><s>Further interactions among many chemical and nonchemical exposures likely have non-linear effects on health (dose-response curves), just as many individual chemical exposures have non-linear effects.</s><s>Some exposures may exert notable biological effects only above a given dose (i.e., a threshold effect), while others may exert a constant, non-varying biologic effect above a given dose (i.e., a saturation effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[40]</ref>.</s><s>For example, one earlier study of indoor environmental interventions to reduce childhood asthma symptoms in Boston revealed that, for families reporting substantial fear of community violence, there were no observable benefits of indoor environmental interventions; this result suggested that the impact of this strong urban stressor may, at very high exposures, act to nullify any benefits of physical environmental improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[104]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, at lower doses, urban violence has been associated with heightened impacts of physical environmental exposures <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[105]</ref>.</s><s>Because of these complex dose-response effects-which are especially challenging for interactions among multiple exposures which may have independent non-linear effects-there is a great need for more sophisticated statistical methods to address mixtures, and for more toxicological research elucidating the biological pathways and dose-response curves for combined effects on respiratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[106]</ref> and other disease outcomes.</s><s>Ultimately, there needs be richer incorporation of toxicological information into epidemiologic studies of these interactions, and vice-versa, to provide the critical knowledge base for CRAs.</s></p><p><s>The STAR grantees provided significant insights related to both exposure assessment and dose-response modeling, which are important for CRA.</s><s>For exposure assessment, grantees confronted the challenge of characterizing exposures to key nonchemical stressors.</s><s>In the absence of direct measurements of psychosocial stress, grantees used a range of publicly-available datasets on demographics, health characteristics, and other geospatial information that may be significantly associated with psychosocial stress.</s><s>However, as some grantees noted, limitations of the interpretability of administrative data include potential differential misclassification, issues of validity of the social stressor construct of interest, and spatial and temporal units of aggregation.</s><s>Issues of geospatial accuracy and resolution were addressed through multiple novel statistical techniques, while some grantees directly validated that the administrative data truly represented psychosocial stress.</s><s>Broadly, given that exposure assessment has often been an underappreciated aspect of CRA, the advancements made across the range of EPA STAR grants were helpful in moving the field forward.</s></p><p><s>For dose-response modeling, researchers used a variety of advanced statistical techniques to better elucidate the combined effects of multiple stressors, a challenge that extends well beyond the context of CRA <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[107]</ref>.</s><s>Structural equation modeling was a promising technique utilized by multiple grantees, but given limitations in sample size, data structures, and interpretation of outputs, it may only be applicable to a subset of investigations.</s><s>Similarly, techniques such as statistical isoboles or lattice diagrams can provide considerable insight, but some of these strategies would be challenging to apply directly to a quantitative CRA.</s><s>More generally, what these collective investigations reinforced is that epidemiological investigations conducted with a CRA application in mind could provide more relevant information than available from post hoc syntheses of the published literature.</s></p><p><s>Although the STAR grantees collectively addressed a number of the building blocks of CRA, some significant gaps remain.</s><s>First, CRA is ultimately most valuable when it is decision-relevant; in the absence of a specific risk management or policy decision that is calling for insight from CRA, it is difficult to narrow the scope of stressors under consideration <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.</s><s>While linkages with community partners ensured that the seven STAR CRA projects were relevant to local concerns, their specific insights are challenging to implement in a decision-making context.</s><s>In addition, many of the methods utilized are predicated on the availability of locally-relevant exposure information and health databases, which would limit broad-based application.</s><s>Rarely will EPA or others conducting CRAs for policy decisions have the opportunity to conduct new epidemiological investigations or to collect new exposure information.</s><s>Ultimately, CRAs will only be successful if exposure scientists, epidemiologists, toxicologists, and others develop models and databases with a CRA end use in mind.</s><s>For example, there is a range of potential policy applications of CRA, which may employ methods described herein, including identifying vulnerable overburden communities for technical assistance, enhanced monitoring or enforcement of environmental laws and regulations; targeting neighborhoods for financial investments to reduce pollution and build community resilience; informing multi-pollutant control strategies and systems approaches to reduce chemical and nonchemical exposure burdens; and ultimately informing the setting of health-based standards for chemical pollutants and permitting decisions.</s></p></div>
