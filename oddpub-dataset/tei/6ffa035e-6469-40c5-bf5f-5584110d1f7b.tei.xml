<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This is the first and currently only comprehensive and highly detailed analysis of IBD inpatient care costs and revenues in a European DRG based healthcare system.</s></p><p><s>We show that IBD inpatients are on average more severely ill than their fellow inpatients as indicated by admissions for mostly life threatening complications of their disease such as fulminant flares, infections with multiresistant and/or opportunistic pathogens, acute bleeding and coagulation disorders, longer stays, requirement of more intense nursing and critical care, dependence on expensive cross sectional imaging studies with contrast agents, interventional endoscopy, blood products, immune therapies including biologics and special medical materials.</s><s>Thus, perhaps not surprisingly the expenditures for their care are almost double of those for the average academic gastroenterology inpatient.</s><s>Moreover, our detailed analyses demonstrate that costs, revenues, and their mismatch for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients are distinct in various cost type and cost center domains, reemphasizing that CD and UC are two different systemic inflammatory disease groups, with Crohn's being the most heterogeneous one.</s></p><p><s>We demonstrate that expenditures are not fully recovered by DRG proceeds.</s><s>In extensive coverage analyses we show, that particularly in Crohn's disease, but also in ulcerative many DRGs assigned by the grouper software result in coverage deficits.</s><s>This is particularly true, when IBD specific, rather than interventional procedure oriented DRGs are assigned.</s><s>Cost center and cost type analyses discovered particularly serious mismatches in in the personnel, laboratory, single medication and medical materials budgets.</s><s>Blood products, antimicrobial and biologic drugs as well as interventional procedure and critical care related material costs contribute substantially to the deficit.</s><s>Somewhat surprisingly, more money is spent for non-medical infrastructure costs than for physicians.</s><s>This does not seem to be disease specific though, but rather relates to the size of the institution and a disproportional quota of controlling and business vs.</s><s>medical staff.</s><s>Non-DRG generated proceeds were almost double that of the average gastroenterology and hepatology inpatient (16.1% vs. 8.2%) and contribute to an overall positive cover statement for both UC and CD.</s><s>A positive cover statement should not be confused with a balanced cost and revenue distribution though, as our total coverage analyses conclude.</s><s>PCCL and length of stay have literally the opposite effects on total coverage in CD and UC, while female gender appears to independently associated with greater revenues.</s></p><p><s>While several studies have theoretically modeled and estimated healthcare costs of IBD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> [26], very few have investigated actual DRG data.</s><s>In 1990, new incentives regarding delivery of inpatient care by physicians and administrators have resulted from Medicare's DRG-based prospective reimbursement system in the US.</s><s>A research study published that year investigated the hypothetical application of the IBD Medicare DRG on 507 IBD inpatient admissions (of which only 10.8% were actual Medicare cases) staying on average 9.71 days at a US large tertiary care hospital and concluded inadequate reimbursement with an average theoretical loss of 127.24 US$ which largely resulted from CD patients requiring surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A Canadian study compared direct patient care costs between 1994 and 1995 based on Canada's DRG system <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> for medical and surgical IBD admissions.</s><s>Surgical admissions were more costly, especially when controlling for total parenteral nutrition.</s><s>Interestingly, the nondigestive DRG coded admissions, were more costly, which is the opposite of what we found, probably because the G-DRG <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[23]</ref> grouper puts more weight on interventional procedures and ICU care.</s><s>However, regarding cost centers and cost types, the Canadian data is strikingly in line with ours listing nursing, medications, labs, operating room, diagnostic imaging and endoscopy as the top categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In their 2005 and 2006 data based case control study the same group compared also IBD with non-IBD age and gender matched costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Our data can be partially related to the inpatient portion of their study that compared 1089 IBD cases with 5279 controls within one Canadian province.</s><s>They reported a mean total cost (excluding administrative overheads, emergency room visits and physician salaries) for IBD 13495 CAN$, CD 12940 CAN$, UC 14183 CAN$ and non-IBD 12607 CAN$ respectively.</s><s>Since their non-IBD inpatient population consisted of controls from an entire health system irrespective of diagnosis and specialty no conclusions can be drawn here.</s><s>However, their report that medications and biologics again contributed largely to costs is in line with our results.</s><s>These finding are apparently independent of any coding related issues as Canadian doctors are well aware of and properly use DRG coding in IBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our study has limitations.</s><s>Due to its single center design and restriction to an academic adult gastroenterology and hepatology department it may not fully reflect the situation in other academic medical centers or patients cared for in other subspecialties, i.e. pediatric IBD patients or IBD patients exclusively cared for in the surgery department or the situation in community hospitals, which don't carry the extra effort and expenses of transplant patients.</s><s>Although the German DRG system was derived and refined from the Australian DRG system, which was modeled after the US Medicare DRG system, national specifics in healthcare funding preclude the full extrapolation of numeric data and uncritical applicability of the results to all other countries, which applies to virtually all health economic analyses published to date.</s><s>Owed to the data source and privacy legislation we were unable to phenotype patients according to the Montreal classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref>, report their disease onset or disease duration, individual medications, their medical and surgical history details or outpatient encounters (where no DRG billing is applied in Germany), which also impact on their overall all healthcare costs.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, DRGs and their reimbursement are not static.</s><s>In fact, many countries annually review and revise their DRGs to accommodate the continuous advance of the science, practice and economics of medicine <ref type="bibr">[32] [33]</ref>.</s><s>Partial aspects of this process are reflected in our study.</s><s>The non-DRG proceeds include adjustments to balance the higher medication costs not currently covered by DRGs.</s><s>However, science and practice advance much faster than the administration and distribution of healthcare funds.</s></p><p><s>Future research needs to investigate the development of academic inpatient care costs and revenues over time, study academic outpatient care costs and compare both to private and community in-and outpatient care data.</s><s>A multicenter setting at national level is highly desirable, but currently not feasible as access to reliable primary data is very complicated due to privacy legislation and political partisanship of different providers and payors.</s></p><p><s>DRGs were thought to improve efficiency because they provide incentives for hospitals to limit the services per patient and to treat more patients, but also in (un)intended consequences, such as reduced quality of care, preference for profitable cases ("cherry picking"), forced patient transfers ("patient dumping"), and frequent readmissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Our data demonstrate, that all native, non-procedure or critical care oriented IBD DRGs are still deficient, despite their annual adjustment and creation of almost 40% new DRGs since their introduction in 2004.</s><s>Academic medical centers like ours rightfully receiving and caring for these complex diseases are taking an economic downturn, because even one of the most sophisticated and refined DRG systems is still unable
