<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Nature has developed an extremely efficient mechanism to deliver circulating cells to sites of inflammation and injury.</s><s>This process is controlled by a highly ordered cascade of molecular interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Butcher 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Springer 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sackstein 2005</ref>).</s><s>The first essential event in cell recruitment involves shear-resistant adhesion of flowing cells on the endothelial surface, a process most efficiently mediated by selectins, a family of three Ca 2+ -dependent lectins (comprised of E-, P-and L-selectins), binding to their respective counter-receptors.</s><s>These interactions initially tether the cell to the vessel wall and, in the context of vascular shear flow, cause the cell to roll along the endothelial surface at velocities below that of the prevailing hemodynamic stream (Step 1).</s><s>This process facilitates engagement of specific cellborne chemokine receptors to pertinent chemokines present in the perivascular areas, thereby triggering inside-out signal transduction events leading to increased adhesiveness of integrin family members (Step 2).</s><s>Adhesive interactions between the activated cell integrins and their cognate endothelial cell counter-receptors then lead to arrest of rolling and firm adhesion of the cell to the vessel wall <ref type="bibr">(</ref>Step 3), and, ultimately, transendothelial migration (extravasation, Step 4).</s></p><p><s>In multiple sclerosis (MS), and in its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), recruitment of immunologic effectors, is mediated by the upregulation of the vascular selectins, E-and P-selectins.</s><s>E-and P-selectins are expressed on brain endothelium after in vivo activation with lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α); however, in murine EAE, P-selectin is expressed only transiently <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Piccio et al. 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, E-selectin is expressed throughout the inflammatory period with a patchy distribution at sites where vessels branch, suggesting the existence of preferential recruitment areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Piccio et al. 2002</ref>).</s><s>E-selectin is also characteristically found in vessels from acute plaques in MS patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Washington et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Lee and Benveniste 1999)</ref>.</s><s>These findings suggest that E-selectin plays a dominant role in the recruitment of circulating cells to the brain in inflammatory diseases.</s></p><p><s>All three selectins bind to specialized carbohydrate determinants, comprised of sialofucosylations containing an α(2,3)-linked sialic acid substitution on galactose, and an α(1,3)-linked fucose modification on N-acetylglucosamine, prototypically displayed as the terminal tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis X (sLe x ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Polley et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sackstein 2005)</ref>.</s><s>This structure, also known as "CD15s", may be displayed on either a protein scaffold (i.e., a glycoprotein) or a lipid scaffold (i.e., a glycolipid) and is recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) such as CSLEX-1 and HECA-452 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alon et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Fuhlbrigge et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dimitroff et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr"

modifications principally involving sulfation increase binding affinity of P-and L-selectins to sLe x , no such modifications are needed for optimal binding of E-selectin <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Leppanen et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Rosen 2004</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Neural stem cell (NSC)-based therapy has generated great hope for halting and/or reversing disease progression in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory and/or degenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Ben-Hur et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Pluchino et al. 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Pluchino et al. , 2005;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Imitola, Raddassi, et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Einstein et al. 2006</ref><ref

express Step 2 and Step 3/4 effectors, such as CXCR4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Flax et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bezzi et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Imitola, Raddassi, et al. 2004</ref>) and VLA-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pluchino et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Rampon et al. 2008</ref>), respectively, but there are no data on whether NSCs natively express Step 1 effectors.</s><s>Accordingly, we examined expression of Step 1 effectors on mouse NSCs and found that these cells are conspicuously devoid of Step 1 effectors, in particular, E-selectin ligands.</s><s>Using the EAE model, we analyzed whether enforced E-selectin ligand activity via cell surface glycan engineering would impact migration of administered NSCs and, more importantly, the therapeutic effect(s) of administered cells.</s><s>To this end, we utilized a technology called glycosyltransferase-programmed stereosubstitution (GPS) to create relevant selectin-binding glycan determinants on the cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Sackstein et al. 2008)</ref>.</s><s>We report here that GPS enforces expression of E-selectin ligands on NSCs by modifying glycans of two NSC membrane glycoproteins, CD44 and of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), creating the E-selectin ligands HCELL (hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand) and E-selectin-binding glycoform of NCAM (NCAM-E), respectively.</s><s>Glycoengineering of NSC E-selectin ligand activity resulted in increased neurotropism and yielded improved clinical outcome in EAE in the absence of detectable long-term engraftment, indicating that these tissue-specific stem cells engendered a repair effect, not a direct cell replacement effect.</s><s>Importantly, this beneficial effect is not a universal property of adult stem cells, as administration of GPS-engineered mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) did not improve EAE clinical course.</s><s>These findings have profound clinical implications in providing the first direct evidence that cell surface glycoengineering to create effectors of cell migration can improve the efficacy of stem cell-based therapeutics and also provide new perspectives on the use of NSCs in the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.</s></p></div>

on NSCs could be contributory to neuroprotection via immunomodulation by virtue of increased tissue ratio of NSCs to immune cells.</s><s>This notion is supported by our in vitro data showing that although GPS-NSCs did not confer an immunomodulatory advantage compared with that observed with control NSCs, as the ratio of input NSCs to splenocytes is increased, T cell proliferation decreases (Supplementary data, Figure <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Previous studies of cell surface exoglycosylation had utilized human mesenchymal stem cells in a xenotransplant model and did not address the therapeutic impact on tissue injury, i.e., whether glycoengineered stem cells would home to a site of inflammation and whether such cells would have desired regenerative and/or tissueprotective effect(s).</s><s>Though enhanced recruitment of NSCs to the CNS was observed following infusion of GPS-NSCs, there was no commensurate increase in long-term engraftment of NSCs.</s><s>Thus, though enhanced CNS infiltration was achieved by exploiting physiologic cell migration (i.e., in a noninvasive fashion that would preserve CNS tissue microenvironmental architecture), we did not observe that administered NSCs differentiated into progeny that regenerate functional CNS tissue in situ (i.e., through direct regeneration).</s><s>In fact, we observed that administration of GPS-NSCs improved the ability of endogenous neuronal progenitors to become oligodendroglia (Figure <ref type="figure">6D and E</ref>) as suggested by the increase in CNPase staining, a marker of mature oligodendrocytes.</s><s>In order to correlate with differentiation in vivo, we quantified the expression of Sox-9 and Olig-2, two independent transcription factors associated with oligodendrogenesis that are expressed in oligodendrocyte precursors.</s><s>Taken together, our results suggest that NSC infiltrates support oligodendrogenesis.</s><s>However, our findings do not provide evidence for NSC-based direct neuroregeneration but instead suggest that the predominant role of NSCs in CNS tissue repair is via trophic effects that prime repair by endogenous cells <ref

target="#b55">Pluchino et al. 2005</ref>) that trigger indirect neuroregeneration by endogenous cells.</s></p><p><s>Collectively, our data support a mechanism in which glycan engineering of NSC to enforce expression of E-selectin ligands heightens tissue colonization, mediating immunomodulation and tissue repair without necessitating persistent/long-term engraftment of administered NSCs.</s><s>Notably, despite enhanced E-selectin ligand activity, infusion of GPS-HSPC did not improve the course of EAE (indeed, injection of HSPC worsens disease, see Supplementary data, Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>), indicating that the observed neuroprotective effects of GPS-NSCs are not a general property of adult stem cells and are due to intrinsic factors related to NSCs.</s><s>Consistent with this finding of adult stem cell-specific biologic effect(s), human HSPCs have been found to elicit strong host immune rejection in a mouse model of congenital corneal disease, while other adult stem cells such as mesenchymal stem cells suppress the host immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Liu et al. 2010</ref>).</s><s>Though further studies on the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the observed neuroprotection by NSCs are warranted, our results indicate that cell surface glycan engineering did not change the self-renewal capacity, differentiation potential or alter the innate immunomodulatory capacity of NSCs.</s><s>Collectively, the data presented here lead us to propose a model (Supplementary data, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>) whereby enforced E-selectin ligand expression via exofucosylation of the surface of NSCs yields increased tissue recruitment at CNS inflammatory sites, thereby enhancing payload delivery of NSC trophic factors where they are needed.</s><s>Because E-selectin expression is markedly upregulated at endothelial beds at all sites of inflammation in humans, our findings have profound translational implications for future clinical trials exploiting cell surface glycan engineering to improve the efficacy of stem cell therapeutics for MS as well as other devastating
