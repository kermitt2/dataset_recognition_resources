<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p><s>Formulation and physicochemical characterisation of polymeric nanocapsules.</s><s>Lysozyme containing PNCs were formulated using poly (D, L-Lactide-co-Caprolactone) (PLC) at two different ratios (86:14 or 40:60) to encapsulate protein in liquid or solid state with different trehalose concentrations (1 mM and 10 mM).</s><s>All factors were investigated together in a full factorial design of experiment rather than testing one factor at a time.</s><s>All formulations were prepared either by S/O/W or W/O/W methods, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Investigation of nanocapsules morphology by TEM revealed round core-shell structure with smooth external surfaces and particles of various size.</s><s>Some of the agglomerates were also shown in the images with no noticeable Schematic representation of the formulation method of the protein-loaded PNCs.</s><s>The PNCs were formulated by the emulsification of an internal aqueous phase (Protein and trehalose in water)/suspending of internal solid protein and trehalose into organic phase (ethyl acetate) containing polymers, and Span ® 60.</s><s>Then, further emulsification step has taken place between the internal (w/o or s/o) and an external aqueous phase (water, and PVA) using probe sonication.</s><s>The solvent is removed forming PNCs aqueous dispersion.</s><s>Finally, the formed suspension was lyophilised over 48 hours.</s><s>difference in the shell thickness was noticed.</s><s>The presence of the spots at the core of PNCs is supportive of the hypothesis that trehalose is encapsulated inside the polymeric shell.</s><s>The spotty core was absent in the formulations prepared with 1 mM trehalose, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Also, trehalose encapsulation was confirmed by utilising HPLC to detect peaks of trehalose.</s><s>Data are provided in the supplementary information.</s></p><p><s>The hydrodynamic size obtained by dynamic light scattering was in the wide range of (325.3-865.3)</s><s>nm, particle size distribution curves are provided in the supplementary information.</s><s>None of the copolymers blocks ratio or the preparation method led to a statistically significant difference in PNC particle size (P &gt; 0.05).</s><s>However, high trehalose concentration increased PNC diameters (601-865 nm) significantly (P &lt; 0.049), Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>This could be due to the accumulation of both protein and trehalose together in the core which may acquire a more substantial inner space.</s><s>This assumption is supported by the observed spotty core in the presence of trehalose in the formulations, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Unencapsulated protein was removed by centrifugation and, then, freeze-dried for 48 hours before finding the percentage of encapsulation efficiency.</s><s>Protein encapsulation efficiency (EE%) for all formulations was quantified by size exclusion chromatography and described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Values of EE% were obtained over a wide range (31.3-69.3%)</s><s>and significantly affected by the ratio of monomers (P &lt; 0.0106).</s><s>The higher ratio of ε-caprolactone the higher noticed EE%.</s><s>Although trehalose and the physical state of proteins had no significant effect on EE%, utilised DOE revealed a significant effect caused by the interaction between the physical state and copolymer ratio.</s><s>Thus, a substantial increase in encapsulation efficiency was recorded when (40:60) PLC was used to encapsulate liquid lysozyme when compared to its ability to encapsulate lysozyme in the solid state.</s><s>High EE% caused by the presence of a high ratio of ε-Caprolactone refers to the longer hydrocarbon chain of ε-Caprolactone, which helps to confine the protein and reduce the leakage to the outer aqueous medium during the emulsification process.</s><s>Longer hydrocarbon chain accelerated the solidification of nanocapsule shell during organic phase evaporation.</s><s>This rapid solidification could increase the polymer ability to confine the protein and reduce the amount of the leaked protein into the external aqueous medium.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vitro release of lysozyme in Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF) and Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF).</head><p><s>The release of lysozyme from the polymeric Nanocapsules was investigated over 4 and 24 hours in SGF and SIF, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), and the total percentage of lysozyme released is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>In SGF, release process was biphasic over 4 hours when an initial release phase (8%) was followed by an equilibrium state or slower release with an average overall release around 10.5% for all formulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Whilst, a triphasic pattern represented the release of protein from the PNCs' reservoir into SIF over 24 hours, which is concluded by;

however, the particle size was increased with some distortion of the particle surface, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>.</s><s>TEM images confirm    that; no erosion occurred in the copolymers, and the release happened due to diffusion of the protein outside through the polymeric shells.</s><s>When the PNCs were immersed in the aqueous medium (SIF), as direct contact between the polymeric outer shell and the aqueous medium plasticizes the polymer chains <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> , This allows further fluid influx into the inner core of the PNCs and eventually dissolved the protein and helped the PNCs to swell and generate some pores and increased the permeability due to its weakened and plasticised mechanical properties.</s><s>Consequently, lysozyme started to efflux outside in a sustained manner with time.</s></p><p><s>The explanation was consistent with the study conducted by Blasi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> .</s><s>Blasi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> stated that; T g of PLGA had been dropped by incubating in water at two different temperatures, i.e., 23 °C and 30 °C.</s><s>Moreover, the same study showed that the decline in T g was 15 °C after 1 hour of incubation irrespective of temperatures used.</s><s>This depletion in T g value has resulted in converting the polymer structure from the glassy state into a rubbery state, thus, increased the polymer fluidity, which consequently, may increase the drug release from polymeric drug delivery systems.</s></p><p><s>Statistical analysis revealed that total lysozyme released in SIF was significantly affected by the monomers' ratio, where (86:14) PLC attained higher drug release over 24 hours.</s><s>D, L-lactide is the racemic form of Lactide moiety due to the presence of chiral methyl group in the Lactide.</s><s>The molecule backing of racemic Lactide forms changed the mechanical properties from being crystalline or semi-crystalline to utterly amorphous form for the copolymer, which subsequently, decreases the polymer consistency.</s><s>This changing in internal structure decreases T g , thus plasticizes the polymer and increases the permeability.</s><s>The Poly (L-Lactide) form has 35:65 of crystalline: amorphous, while poly (D, L-Lactide) is entirely amorphous has a T g value of 57 °C in comparison to pure poly(L-Lactide) (65 °C); which reflects different mechanical properties.</s><s>Furthermore, forming copolymer can create new molecules with different mechanical properties, which may be able to reduce the rigidity of the polymers as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> .</s></p><p><s>PLC 86%:14% has low T g (16 °C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>This depletion in T g means that the copolymer gets plasticized and become rubbery at temperatures higher than 16 °C (body or release experiment temperature is 37 °C).</s><s>However, 40:60 PLC has a melting temperature (Tm) of 31 °C32 .</s><s>Hence, mentioning melting temperature rather than glass transition temperature reflects that the polymer mainly consists of dominantly crystalline or semi-crystalline structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> .</s><s>This means the polymer has more rigid and stable bond backing, thus confining lysozyme inside the polymeric system for a longer time due to slow release.</s><s>The slow drug release of (40:60) PLC is caused by its slower softening rate when exposed to the dissolution condition at 37 °C when compared to (86:14) PLC.</s></p><p><s>The biological activity of encapsulated lysozyme.</s><s>Encapsulated lysozyme retained 39.69-97.42% of their original activities, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Biological activity was increased significantly with increasing the amount of trehalose (p-value &lt;

Stability of lysozyme in solid state refers to the low rate of hydrolysis due to the absence of water <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> .</s><s>Presence of water around lysozyme can cleave amide bonds and thus, denature the protein during the process of preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>The rate of chemical reaction of protein in the solid state is minimum due to the internal zero energy which protects the physical and chemical integrity of proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> .</s><s>Trehalose stabilises the proteins in solutions by preferential hydration mechanism and reducing the protein mobility which keeps the protein in the folded state <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, trehalose stabilises proteins by working as a water substitute during the lyophilization process by maintaining proteins' hydrogen bonds, which eventually reduces the unfolding and protein deactivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Trehalose stabilises solid proteins by so-called "Glass Dynamic Hypothesis".</s><s>The glass dynamic hypothesis states that trehalose forms rigid and inert solid filler around the proteins, which separates the protein molecules and inhibits any chance of protein motion and collision with other protein molecules.</s><s>This eventually restricts the proteins unfolding and denaturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Optimisation of formulation factors to prepare lysozyme/DNase-PNCs with optimum characteristics.</s><s>Altogether no formulation appeared to have optimum properties.</s><s>Therefore, an optimising equation describing the best-fitted model was applied to optimise the factors to find the best-compromised responses.</s><s>The optimised formulation is predicted to be prepared from 40:60 poly(D, L-Lactide-co-Caprolactone) to encapsulate solid lysozyme with 9 mM trehalose to obtain the following predicted responses; 70% EE% and 95% biological activity.</s><s>However, release profile was predicted to stay low (36.5%) over 24 hrs even after optimisation; this is expected as high content PCL-NCs showed slow release kinetics.</s><s>Several approaches could increase the release; however, not all of them are suitable for the other physicochemical properties.</s><s>PEGylation is one of the most commonly used approaches in the preparation of polymeric nanocapsules due to its biocompatible nature and its ability to enhance drug release <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> .However, PEGylating time is critical as blending the used polymers with a hydrophilic polymer, e.g.</s><s>PEG from primary stages may significantly reduce the encapsulation efficiency due to the leakage of protein into the outer aqueous phase during the process of the formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, PEG 8000 was selected due to its relatively high molecular weight and was added after the preparation and solidification of PNCs and just before the lyophilisation.</s><s>The quantity of added PEG was optimised by adding different amounts to the formulation, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. Four different formulations were prepared, and PEG was added in different quantities; 10%, 15%, 25%, and 50%.</s><s>The highest drug release in SIF was 92% and observed for PEG-PNC 25% containing PEG, while 60.02% of lysozyme was released from the same formulation in SGF.</s><s>Nevertheless, the release of SIF from PEG-PNC 15% was 81.06%, but it suits the oral delivery more, as the release in SGF was 21.06%.</s><s>Lysozyme release from the PEGylated and control (non-PEGylated) formulations was in the diphasic pattern except the release from PEG-PNC 25% in SIF where triphasic was observed, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Enhancing the systems' release was caused by PNCs interaction with PEG which softened the polymer by increasing the water content it.</s><s>Caprolactone is permeable to small molecules but, not macromolecules like protein because of the tiny pores on its surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> .</s><s>PEG8000 may have increased the already existing pores by improving the permeability.</s><s>However, increasing the quantity of PEG8000 to 50% w/w decreased the release percentage, and even less than the control formulations.</s><s>After finding out the PEGylated PNCs morphology by TEM, a shield of PEG was formed around the particles which may hinder the release significantly, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Two PNCs optimised PEGylated formulations (15% PEG8000) were prepared and characterised for encapsulation efficiency, drug release and biological activity.</s><s>The obtained results were close to the predicted ones, where %EE 74.6%, 97% biological activity, and 82.15% SIF release were obtained.</s></p><p><s>Lysozyme was used as a model protein throughout the study.</s><s>After optimising the factors and PEGylating the optimum formulation, PEG-PNCs 15% was prepared to deliver deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and then characterised.</s><s>DNase is a therapeutic protein being used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.</s><s>The biological activity of encapsulated DNase I exceeded 95%, which reflects the ability of DNase to withstand during the process procedures.</s><s>Interestingly, the %EE, release profile in SIF, and release profile in SGF are comparable to those obtained from encapsulating lysozyme into PNCs at the same optimum conditions.</s><s>The developed PNCs may present an excellent model for developing future polymeric nanocapsules containing other macromolecules, e.g.</s><s>therapeutic proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and genes.</s></p></div>
