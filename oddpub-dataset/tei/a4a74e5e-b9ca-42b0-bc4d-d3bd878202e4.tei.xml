present study, additional laboratory and neuroimaging/electrophysiology data would have been required in 147 indeterminate cases.</s><s>For example, lumbar punctures and neuroimaging and/or EEG studies had not been ordered in 37 suspected cases, rendering the classification into 'aseptic meningitis versus encephalitis' impossible.</s><s>This drawback will be avoided with future use, when the VACC-Tool will be issuing digital reminders in cases where pertinent laboratory, neuroimaging, or electrophysiology studies are indicated according to the respective case definition.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation of this proof-of-concept study is that the initial VACC-Tool included only four case definitions.</s><s>The limited range of algorithms may have resulted in some effect modification and ascertainment bias in favor of the pre-defined disease entities represented in the VACC-Tool.</s><s>An unbiased and conclusive differentiation of the four disease entities from related disease entities such as Guillain-Barré-Syndrome or Multiple Sclerosis will require the inclusion of additional case definitions into the VACC-Tool and the refinement of any areas of overlap.</s><s>With increasing complexity of case algorithms, the VACC-Tool will provide a clear advantage for the automated discrimination of closely related but complex disease entities while providing CDSIC-compliant standardized data at the point-of-care.</s></p><p><s>During the development of the VACC-Tool and multiple rounds of iterations, the direct feedback from clinicians was instrumental, as they were able to test the Tool in their everyday workflow and in busy clinical care settings.</s><s>The key motivation for clinicians to use the VACC-Tool is the ability to discriminate several, including complex neurologic disease entities reliably and consistently.</s><s>In difficult cases, for example, patients presenting with clinical symptoms consistent with both ADEM and encephalitis, such cases were classified as belonging to a predefined are of overlap between ADEM and encephalitis (Level 3A), indicating a need for further imaging or histopathological studies to differentiate the two.</s><s>Therefore, the VACC-Tool promotes timely diagnoses while decreasing interrater variability but it also opens the possibility to trigger important follow-up diagnostic procedures, if indicated.</s></p><p><s>Diagnostic algorithms require the uniform assignment of positive as well as negative values to each variable.</s><s>Bioinformaticians interested in machine learning and advanced precision medicine analyses will ask for a clear discrimination between positive and pertinent negative values for each variable.</s><s>Use of the VACC-Tool at the point-of-care increased the number of conclusively and consistently classified cases thereby decreasing the risk of missing data.</s><s>Therefore, use of the VACC-Tool</s></p></div>
