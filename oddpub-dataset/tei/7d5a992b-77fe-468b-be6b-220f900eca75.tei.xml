<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and Material</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p><s>The sample consisted of 42 patients (26 of which were women) aged between 20 and 76 (M = 48.5,</s><s>SD = 12.2) with psychosomatic disorders (somatoform disorder: N = 15; adjustment disorder: N = 11; depressive disorder: N = 11; anxiety disorder: N = 5).</s><s>The patients participated in the study during inpatient treatment at the Department for General Internal and Psychosomatic Medicine at Charite ´-Universita ¨tsmedizin Berlin.</s><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of Charite ´-Universita ¨tsmedizin in Berlin (application number: EA1-290-12) and informed consent was obtained from all patients.</s><s>All patients provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>Each patient received a 20-minute exposure to a Body Monochord and a 20-minute presentation of slow consonant relaxation music (panpipe with piano accompaniment), which was played on an audio CD.</s><s>The strings of the Body Monochord were tuned in fifths tuning (tone pitches: D3, A2, D2, with additional A1 and D1 at three strings each), which allowed it to emit a sound with a manifold overtone spectrum.</s><s>The Body Monochord was constructed by the manufacturer of musical instruments Bernhard Deutz in Berlin (http://www.deutz-klangwerkstatt.</s><s>de; a sound sample is available at http://psychosomatik.charite.de/forschung/koerpererleben_</s><s>koerperzentrierte_therapieverfahren/).</s><s>For clinical reasons (practicability) data acquisition took place from about 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. Immediately before each exposure the patients were lying in a quiet resting state for two minutes.</s><s>Both treatments were presented in succession in randomized order, with a break of about ten minutes in between.</s><s>While listening to the CD music patients were also lying on the Body Monochord.</s><s>The patients received the instruction to close their eyes and do nothing else aside from listening to the sound of the music.</s><s>Immediately after each treatment method two self-rating scales for assessing the subjective experience during the single treatment exposition and the state of mood after the treatment were presented.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cortisol Measurement</head><p><s>Saliva cortisol samples were collected directly before the first treatment session (T1), immediately after the first one (T2) and immediately after the second treatment session (T3), using Salivette1 sampling devices (Sarstedt, Germany).</s><s>On doing so the patients chewed on a cotton roll for the duration of about two minutes.</s><s>The samples were immediately chilled on ice and centrifuged at 2400 x g for 2 minutes at 4˚C.</s><s>Then the samples were chilled on ice again and after the procedure of the presentation of the two treatment methods they were frozen in aliquots at -80˚C until assayed.</s><s>Cortisol levels (nmol/l) were determined using the commercially available immunoassay ELISA-Kit Parameter™ Cortisol Assay (R&amp;D Systems, Inc., USA).</s><s>According to the manufacturer the assay sensitivity for the kit was 0.111 nmol/l.</s><s>Intraassay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 5.4% and 9.3%, respectively.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EDA Measurement</head><p><s>During the whole investigation SCL was recorded continuously exosomatically from the surface of the skin via application of a direct current voltage of 1.5 V, using the portable biofeedback device MentalBioScreen K3 (Porta Bio Screen GmbH, Germany).</s><s>For the measurement EKG foam electrodes with a carbon push button and adhesive gel pad (43 x 45 mm) were used (ASF-40C, Bio Protech Asmuth GmbH, Germany).</s><s>Two electrodes were fixed to the hypothenar site on each palm of both hands, overlapping about 0.5 cm, thus the distance was about 3.5 cm.</s><s>The subsequent EDA-analysis was conducted for a 1-minute interval during the resting position before the treatments and for 1 minute intervals during the periods of 0-1, 5-6, 11-12 and 17-18 minutes following the start of the Body Monochord and CD music exposure.</s><s>The SCL values were averaged for each time interval.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective Experience</head><p><s>As described in detail previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, the subjective experiences that occurred during the exposure to the Body Monochord and the exposure to the CD music were immediately recorded after the presentation of each treatment method by means of a self rating scale (7-point Likert scale).</s><s>The questions were based on the dimensions of experience of the Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI) by Pekala <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, German version by Rux <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, a questionnaire for assessing altered states of consciousness, which can arise e.g. during relaxation states <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>For assessing the positive emotional feelings during the two treatments, patients were asked about feelings of joy, feelings of kindness and the feeling of safety that occurred during the treatment methods.</s><s>For each subject the mean value of these categories was calculated separately for each treatment method.</s><s>Since negative feelings like fear, anger, sadness showed rather low values and differed only very slightly between patients, categories of emotionally negative response were not included in this assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, the Berlin Mood Questionnaire (Berlin Mood Scale, BMS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> was carried out at three points of cortisol measurement (T1, T2, T3).</s><s>The 30-item BMS measures six different states of mood (listlessness, tiredness, anxious depression, anger, involvement, elevated mood).</s><s>The items are presented on a 5-point Likert scale.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>Statistical data analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS (Version 20).</s><s>We tested the possible effects of the chronological order of the single treatment methods and the kind of treatment on positive emotional feelings.</s><s>We did so by calculating an ANOVA with repeated measurement of the within-subject factor 'kind of treatment' (Body Monochord, CD music) and the between-subject factor 'treatment chronological order' (Body Monochord first, CD music first).</s><s>Differences in the various dimensions of the BMS in depending of the different treatment conditions (T1, T2, and T3) were tested by calculating t-tests for dependent samples.</s></p><p><s>The possible influences of the chronological order and the kind of the treatments on the SCL were tested by calculating an ANOVA with repeated measurement of the factor 'kind of treatment' (Body Monochord, CD music) and 'point in time of measurement' (Rest, 0-1 min, 5-6-min, 11-12 min, 17-18 min) and the between-subject factor 'treatment chronological order'(Body Monochord first, CD music first).</s></p><p><s>For statistical analysis of the Cortisol data an ANOVA with repeated measurement of the factor 'time of measurement' (before 1 st treatment, after 1 st treatment, after 2 nd treatment) and the between-subject factor 'treatment chronological order' (Body Monochord first, CD music first) was calculated.</s><s>The specifications for alpha error of variance analytical significance test were based on the Greenhouse-Geisser-adjusted degrees of freedom.</s><s>Multiple comparisons in t-tests were adjusted using the Bonferroni-method or Bonferroni-Holm-method, when more than three comparisons were conducted.</s><s>Effect sizes were indicated with the coefficients Partial Eta Squared (η 2 ) and Cohen's d.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Six patients were excluded from the statistical analysis of the salivary cortisol data, because their measurement values of salivary cortisol were outside the standard curve.</s><s>One patient was excluded from the statistical analysis of the self-rating scale and five patients were excluded from the statistical analysis of the BMS because of missing measurement data.</s><s>SCL data of eight patients could not be used for statistical analysis because of measurement errors due to heavy perspiration and low adherence of the electrodes.</s></p></div>

measurement points was significant and the increase between the first and the third measurement points was not.</s><s>The increase of salivary cortisol levels during the two treatments with the Body Monochord and the CD music is contrary to our expectations that listening to music, especially to relaxation music, and experiencing relaxation states are associated with a decrease in cortisol levels, as revealed in former studies <ref type="bibr">[17-19, 21-23, 43, 44]</ref>.</s><s>After the first treatment session, which was experienced in an emotionally more positive way, the increase in salivary cortisol was significant and more pronounced than after the second presentation of the treatment session, which was emotionally experienced in a slightly less positive way.</s></p><p><s>Regarding research on the relation between emotion, affect and cortisol, an increase in cortisol levels is in general associated with negative affect.</s><s>On the other hand, positive affect is rather associated with a decrease in cortisol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s>Other studies revealed that there was no effect of positive daily events on cortisol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it was shown that positive emotion with high physiological arousal, in terms of being alert and active, was associated with a decrease in salivary cortisol <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, positive emotion with low physiological arousal, in terms of being happy and relaxed, did not show any effects on cortisol levels.</s></p><p><s>Thus, our results seem to contradict findings of studies, which revealed that negative, but not positive affect is associated with higher cortisol levels.</s><s>Another investigation of our working group, which compared the effects of the Body Monochord in the shape of a chair and in the shape of a lounger, found similar results concerning the increase of salivary cortisol levels in patients suffering from eating disorders, somatoform disorders and pain disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s>This makes it unlikely that the reported increase in salivary cortisol is based on measurement errors.</s></p><p><s>It might be possible that the relaxation states, induced by listening to the relaxation music and by vibroacoustic stimulation, in some patients also constituted a kind of emotional challenge related to stress, which might be reflected in the increase of cortisol levels.</s><s>Relaxation techniques, which use imagery, are supposed to be more likely to induce adverse experiences than relaxation techniques without imagery, because intrusive distressing images and thoughts might be enhanced more easily through imagery instructions, which would lead to an increase in arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s>In general, during relaxation states unconscious or preconscious contents, which might be related to conflicts in one's personal life, are more likely to appear <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s>The appearance of these phenomena is used in the psychotherapeutic technique e.g. of Guided Imagery and Music <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The analysis of qualitative interview data on subjective experiences during the treatment with a Body Monochord of patients suffering from eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> revealed that changing inner images, thoughts, body-related feelings and emotions occurred during the course of the treatment, which also means that short phases of pleasant and unpleasant experiences sometimes alternated.</s><s>Possibly, similar subjective experiences during the treatment with the Body Monochord and CD music might have occurred in the patients we investigated in this study.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies on the impact of music or relaxation on cortisol levels mainly investigated healthy subjects who were not suffering from psychological disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>.</s><s>As the patients in our study were suffering from depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, adjustment disorders and somatoform disorders, which are supposed to be associated with individual psychosocial stress factors, part of these stress factors might have come to consciousness by focusing the attention towards the self by means of the vibroacoustic stimulation and listening to the sound and music.</s><s>Taken as a whole, aside from pleasant and relaxing phases of subjective experiences during the treatment sessions, the treatments by themselves might have been emotionally challenging experiences, which could be the reason for the increase of patients' salivary cortisol levels.</s></p><p><s>The former results of the analysis of the electrocortical activity (EEG) during the treatment with the Body Monochord in a larger sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> might give a hint to a possible mental stress processing in the beginning of the treatment.</s><s>During the first minutes of exposure to the Body Monochord a desynchronsation both of the EEG-Theta and Alpha bands occurred (see results in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>).</s><s>As described in detail previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, desynchronised EEG-Alpha activity is an indicator of increased attention during the expectation of cognitive tasks and information processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>.</s><s>Synchronised Theta activity is associated with relaxation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> (and correlates with focused attention and memory search <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</s><s>Due to the fact that both the Alpha and the Theta bands are desynchronisized, this result suggests that in the beginning of the exposure to the Body Monochord a state of increased vigilance took place without any mental relaxation, memory processing or focused attention.</s><s>The desynchronization of the EEG could thus be matched with a situation of mental orientation in which an attempt is made to make sense of and to structure the unusual perception, which might also be interpreted as stress processing.</s><s>It should be mentioned that during the exposure to the CD music these EEG effects were not observed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Skin Conductance Level</head><p><s>The increase in salivary cortisol as an indicator of a stress response seems to be contradicted by the decrease in the SCL, which indicates an experience of relaxation.</s><s>During the first treatment the decrease in SCL was significantly more pronounced than during the second treatment.</s><s>This result corresponds with the sequence effect of positive emotional feelings, which were scored as being higher during the first treatment compared to the second treatment.</s><s>This is consistent with results of former studies, which demonstrated an association between feelings of relaxation, wellbeing or contentment and a reduction of SCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As we discuss the increase in salivary cortisol levels as a possible indicator of a stress response that occurred during the treatment sessions, and as the SCL is regarded to be an indicator of emotion-associated sympathetic activity, one would expect an increase in SCL during an emotionally challenging experience.</s><s>But the emotionally associated SCL response is probably masked over by a possible relaxation response, which is induced by focussing on the music or by just lying on the lounger.</s><s>In a study by Nater and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> on psychophysiological and emotional responses to musical stimuli, listening to Heavy Metal music led to an increase in unrest and aggression, whereas smoothing classical music led to more calmness and improvement of mood.</s><s>The SCL levels were higher during listening to Heyvy Metal music, but both during the Heavy Metal music and the relaxing music a decrease in the courses of SCL could be observed.</s><s>However, these contradictory results were not discussed in this article, because the focus of the study was on different responses of men and women to musical stimuli.</s><s>Possibly the focussing on the music in a resting position facilitated a physical relaxation state, which at the same time was masked by the emotional arousal because of the music.</s><s>Thus, on the one hand during listening to Heavy Metal music the SCL was higher than during relaxation music, but on the other hand the SCL decreased during both conditions probably due to physical relaxation.</s></p><p><s>It should also be noted that in our study on the effects of the Body Monochord and relaxation music on psychophysical parameters and subjective experience we altogether examined 101 patients (of which only 42 were measurd by salivary cortisol) of which 8 patients discontinued the treatments because of unpleasant feelings or imageries that occurred (Body Monochord: N = 7, CD music: N = 1).</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows the courses of SCL until the termination of the treatment.</s><s>It is striking that 6 patients showed an obvious decrease in SCL, whereas in 2 patients the SCL remained about the same level.</s><s>These results give hint to the existence of a kind of paradoxical relaxation response, in which the electrodermal activity decreases, whereas unpleasant or stressfull feelings or imageries are processed mentally.</s><s>The physical position of resting and lying down probably facilitates the relaxation of the skeletal muscles.</s><s>The patients were invited to do nothing else but paying attention to the sound and music.</s><s>Focusing of attention without distraction combined with a relaxing position of the body is supposed to be necessary to encourage the appearance of a relaxation response, as described in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, the question arises why the increase in cortisol was not masked by the same effect.</s><s>Possibly the electrodermal activity and the activation of the HPA-axis represent independent components concerning the relaxation response.</s><s>This could mean that the decrease in SCL might be more strongly influenced by the physical calming effect whereas the increase in salivary cortisol levels might be more associated with inner mental activity and might be less sensitive to mere physical rest.</s><s>A study of Pawlow and Jones <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> showed that merely sitting quietly did not show any impact on salivary cortisol levels.</s></p><p><s>However, the exposure both to the Body Monochord and to the relaxation music led to an increase in elevated mood and a decrease in anxious depressiveness, anger and listlessness (dimensions of the BMS-Berlin Mood Scale).</s><s>It should be noted that the self-rating of the BMS refers to the state of mood that patients experienced at the point in time immediately after the treatment exposure.</s><s>Probably the state of mood did not remain the same during the whole exposure.</s><s>Presumably, during the exposure to the Body Monochord and maybe also during the CD music changing contents of mental images, thoughts and memories ocurrued and both pleasant and unpleasant states of mood might have appeared alternately, similar to the patients suffering from eating disorders, whose subjective experience during Body Monochord treatements was investigated in another study of our working group <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s><s>The viewing of the qualitative interview data of patients in the present study and of the whole sample suggests that part of the patients indeed experienced the treatment as emotionally challenging, especially in the beginning.</s><s>This happened because unpleasant memories or actual problems in life emerged in their minds, from which, however, they could distance themselves in the further course of the treatment exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the rated mood at the point in time after the treatment exposure might be the result of coming to terms with a somehow challenging emotional process.</s></p><p><s>Another explanation for the increase in salivary cortisol might be the possibility that the patients' experiences of elevated mood and decrease in listlessness also indicated an activating process, induced both by the bodily vibroacoustic stimulation and the inner images, which might have been encouraged through sound and music.</s><s>So this activating process might have been experienced as a kind of eustress, which might have caused the increase of salivary cortisol levels.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The cortisol results must be interpreted with caution, because it cannot be completely excluded that the release of cortisol was influenced by a variety of drugs like beta-blocker propanol, antidepressants or others, which were taken by various patients prior to testing.</s><s>Possibly the medication caused a delayed onset of the cortisol release and led to the rise in cortisol observed over the treatment.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation regarding cortisol might be the fact, that the release of cortisol follows a circadian rhythm, which culminates in the morning after waking up and decreases throughout the rest of the day <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66]</ref>.</s><s>The patients had been tested during the late morning when higher fluctuations in cortisol levels can be assumed.</s><s>To address this problem and to reduce possible influences of medication, further studies should be conducted in the late afternoon.</s></p><p><s>As the focus of this study was on the impact of vibroacoustic stimulation on patients' salivary cortisol levels and electrodermal activity in relation to their subjective emotional experience, we did not include a control group with healthy subjects.</s><s>Thus the study has an explorative character and the absence of a control group can be considered as a limitation.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, it can be regarded as a limitation that we did not include more direct psychological measures of relaxation and stress e.g.</s><s>like visual analogue scales, because the focus of the study was on the patient's state of mood and emotional experience.</s><s>This could have provided additional information about the perceived state induced by the treatments.</s></p><p><s>A further limitation of the study is the fact that there was only a break of ten minutes between the successive interventions.</s><s>This might have been not enough time for the physiological systems to return to a true baseline.</s><s>One way of avoiding this problem is to perform the measurements on two different days.</s><s>But it must be taken into consideration that on different days usually different unavoidable therapeutic and diagnostic procedures are conducted due to the clinical context, which might have been experienced as different additional stress factors.</s><s>In this context our study has an explorative character, which should invite to further studies.</s></p><p><s>Finally, it can be taken into consideration whether the cortisol system of patients might be dysregulated to varying degrees due to long lasting distress, which finally led to disease and inpatient admission.</s><s>Moreover, it is to be assumed that patients had different lengths of time for recovery, because of different length of hospital stay or different influencing factors which might have occurred during the stay in hospital before the investigation.</s><s>This might have some impact on possible differences between the responsiveness of the cortisol system and the electrodermal activity to pleasing or displeasing stimuli.</s><s>In order to address this issue, it would be necessary to investigate several treatments in single persons over a longer period of time by means of time series analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>A relaxation state, induced by vibroacoustic stimulation or listening to CD music, is associated with a reduction of the electrodermal activity and thus of the sympathetic arousal, which was more pronounced during higher emotionally positive feelings during the treatments.</s></p><p><s>Both vibroacoustic stimulation and listening to relaxation music induced an improvement of patients' mood and were associated with an increase in salivary cortisol.</s><s>The increase in salivary cortisol might be explained by a potentially challenging experience of the relaxation state due to possibly uncommon body sensations and inner images.</s><s>Thus the electrodermal activity and the HPA-axis might be independent components concerning the relaxation response, which could mean that the decrease in tonic electrodermal activity might better reflect the physical calming effect and the increase in salivary cortisol levels might be more associated with inner mental activity.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
