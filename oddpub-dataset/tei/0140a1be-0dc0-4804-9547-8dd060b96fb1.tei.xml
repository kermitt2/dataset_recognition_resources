target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>We show here that microglia, the major immune cells of the brain, likewise feature similar properties.</s><s>In detail, supernatants from microglia stimulated through TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, or TLR9 resulted in activation and IL-17 production of γδ T cells.</s><s>This effect on γδ T cells seems to be cell type-specific since supernatants derived from equally activated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) induced these effects only by activation of TLR2 or TLR4, but not by activation of TLR7 or TLR9.</s><s>Moreover, microglia required TLRs to induce a neurotoxic γδ T cell phenotype, whereas BMDMs induced such a phenotype independently on TLR signaling.</s><s>Accordingly, previous studies performed by other groups demonstrated that the sole presence of BMDMs causes neuronal dysfunction and ultimately neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We observed neurotoxic effects of IL-17+ γδ T cells in vitro, and these effects required cellcell contact between neurons and T cells.</s><s>In a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion injury infiltrating macrophages were the main source of IL-23 after ischemia, promoting IL-17 production of γδ T cells.</s><s>γδ T cells were shown to localize to the infarct boundary zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Localization of γδ T cells to an area where neuronal cell death is observed indicates the possibility of direct interaction of activated IL-17+ γδ T cells with neurons.</s><s>A prolonged interaction of CD4+ Th17 cells with axons and cell contact-dependent localized Ca2+ increase leading to neuronal injury was reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Also, neuronal apoptosis and expression of Fas on neurons and FasL on infiltrating Th17 cells were observed in a rat model of Alzheimer´s disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</s><s>However, in our experiments neither IL-17+ γδ T cells induced by addition of IL-1β and IL-23 nor those induced by supernatants from microglia stimulated through TLRs expressed FasL (data not shown).</s><s>As mentioned above, neurotoxic effects mediated by IL-17+ γδ T cells required a direct contact between T cells and neurons, and neither supernatant derived from IL-17+ γδ T cells nor addition of recombinant IL-17 alone, was sufficient to decrease neuronal viability.</s><s>Interestingly, a spatial proximity between IL-17+ γδ T cells and neurons was frequently observed in vitro (data not shown).</s><s>Close contact between γδ T cells and neurons may point to the involvement of other, yet unidentified, cellular mechanisms mediating neurotoxicity.</s><s>Granzyme B might be one effector molecule mediating neuronal injury as has been described for CD4+ Th17 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>However, in our studies supernatants from TLR-activated microglia did not induce production of granzyme B in γδ T cells, as did activation of γδ T cells with IL-β and IL-23.</s><s>Also, CD4+ Th1, Th17, CD8+ T cells as well as NK cell lysates were reported to induce neuronal damage via the induction of microtubule axonal destabilization mediated by lytic granules <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[57]</ref>.</s><s>Further studies are required to elucidate whether IL-17+ γδ T cells induced by TLR-activated microglia use a similar mechanism.</s></p><p><s>In summary, soluble factors, including IL-1β and IL-23 secreted from microglia stimulated by TLR-specific ligands, induce MyD88-dependent activation of γδ T cells.</s><s>Such activated γδ T cells resemble IL-17+ γδ T cells generated by the addition of IL-1β and IL-23.</s><s>The presence of IL-17+ γδ T cells but not naïve γδ T cells, results in toxic effects towards neurons that require a direct cell-cell contact between neurons and γδ T cells.</s></p></div>
