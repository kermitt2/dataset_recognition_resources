<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>The panel of this yearʼs 15th St. Gallen Consensus Conference on the initial treatment of primary breast cancer consisted of 72 specialists on breast cancer from 24 countries, making the panel significantly larger than in previous years.</s><s>Five members of the panel are from Germany.</s><s>Since 30 years the recommendations of the St. Gallen Consensus Conference have attracted much interest worldwide.</s><s>This is still the case, even though evidence-based guidelines are becoming increasingly important.</s></p><p><s>The St. Gallen recommendations are based on majority votes by the panelists.</s><s>The panelists vote on questions which are put to the vote; they have the option of voting "yes" (agreement), "no" (rejection) or "abstain" (insufficient data, no opinion possible).</s><s>Other questions may require panelists to choose between several different options.</s><s>The questions and topics which were put to the vote were chosen by the St. Gallen Committee.</s><s>The aim is to obtain the opinion of the majority of the panel members based on their own practical experience and, ideally, to use this to create an international consensus for clinical practice.</s></p><p><s>As the St. Gallen panelists work in different disciplines and come from different countries with different healthcare systems and resources, the consensus essentially reflects the opinions of these specialists.</s><s>Voting by the panel aims to take account of the currently available evidence.</s><s>With that in mind, for several years a German working group has regularly commented on the voting results of the St. Gallen panelists and the implications for clinical practice in Germany.</s><s>The comments given by the German working group also take the current treatment guidelines of the Breast Commission of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (AGO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> into account; this year, the update of the S3-guideline which is due to be completed shortly was also included in the comparison.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Basis of the St. Gallen consensus</head><p><s>The motto of the 15th St. Gallen Consensus Conference was "Escalating and De-Escalating".</s><s>Given the fact that our understanding of tumor biology is becoming ever more detailed and that therapy is now based on this more detailed information, the focus was on developing strategies which could be used to select the appropriate treatment for individual patients from a range of available options; the aim is to avoid the risk of overtreatment or undertreatment.</s><s>The choice of treatment is guided by analyzing which patients require more intensive treatment and which patients can have reduced treatment without leading to a worsening of their prognosis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ABSTR AC T</head><p><s>The St. Gallen International Consensus Conference on the treatment of patients with primary breast cancer has been held regularly (every second year in the last six years) for more than 30 years.</s><s>This year, the findings of the International St. Gallen Consensus Panel and their implications for clinical practice were again discussed by a German working group of leading breast cancer specialists.</s><s>Five of the breast cancer specialists from Germany were also members of this yearʼs St. Gallen panel.</s><s>A comparison between the St. Gallen recommendations and the annually updated treatment guidelines of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (AGO 2017) and the S3guideline agreed upon in 2017 is useful.</s><s>The recommendations of the St. Gallen panel represent an international crosssection of opinions of experts from different countries and different disciplines, while the S3-guideline and AGO guidelines are evidence-based.</s><s>The motto of this yearʼs 15th St. Gallen Conference was "Escalating and De-Escalating".</s><s>The rationale behind this concept was to promote more individualized treatment and thereby reduce overtreatment as well as undertreatment.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resection margins for DCIS</head><p><s>If a patient with histologically confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) undergoes breast-conserving surgery (no invasive carcinoma present) and adjuvant radiation of the breast is planned, a second resection is not required if there was no ink on tumor (R0) and the histologically confirmed tumor-free margin is of at least 2 mm.</s><s>This should not be understood to indicate that a second resection is necessary for smaller tumor-free margins; the decision whether second resection is required depends on the individual case and on the assessment by an interdisciplinary team.</s></p><p><s>The German group of experts agree with the majority vote of the St. Gallen panelists.</s><s>The German specialists refer to the AGO 2017 guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: the guidelines propose that if the tumor-free resection margin is less than 2 mm a second resection is discussed with the patient.</s><s>According to the AGO guidelines, the majority of patients with DCIS should undergo adjuvant radiation of the breast after breast-conserving surgery (BCS).</s><s>However, it is important to note in each individual case that radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence but probably does not affect the probability of overall survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> except in higher-risk cases.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multifocal or multicentric breast cancer</head><p><s>It is generally agreed that patients with invasive early breast cancer and multifocal (more than two lesions in a single quadrant) or multicentric (lesions in more than one quadrant) disease can have breast-conserving surgery if the margins of the resected tumors are clear (tumor-free resection margins) and they subsequently undergo adjuvant radiation of the breast.</s><s>According to the AGO 2017 guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the decision to carry out BCS in patients with multicentric breast cancer must be taken on a case-by-case basis and should depend on the number of lesions present.</s></p><p><s>The German specialists also agree with the St. Gallen vote that the required width of the tumor-free resection margin was not affected by the underlying tumor biology.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Postoperative resection margins after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)</head><p><s>Patients with early breast cancer who have complete tumor regression (ycT0) after NACT can subsequently undergo breast-conserving surgery.</s><s>Control imaging and preoperative marking should be done prior to surgery, which is then carried out within the "new margins".</s><s>It is not necessary to remove the entire tumor bed of the initial primary tumor.</s><s>The prerequisite for this approach is that patients undergo adjuvant radiotherapy of the operated breast.</s></p><p><s>According to the majority vote of the St. Gallen panelists, reresection is not required in these patients if the margins are completely clear (no tumor cells in the resection margin is sufficient).</s><s>According to the majority vote, this also applies to patients with multifocal residual tumor in the resected surgical specimen.</s><s>The German experts add that this minimum requirement must be complied within all cases, and that in individual cases, even if the margin is tumor-free on microscopic examination, second resection should still be considered if there is any suspicion of residual tumor, although this decision should be taken by an interdisciplinary (clinical pathology) tumor board.</s><s>This also applies if only partial radiation of the tumor bed was done but pathological exami-nation found no residual tumor.</s><s>An interdisciplinary tumor board should decide whether this corresponds to complete remission or whether second resection of the tumor bed is necessary to ensure that there is no residual tumor.</s></p><p><s>Nipple areola-sparing mastectomy can be carried out after the patient has completed neoadjuvant systemic therapy.</s><s>Here the German experts agree with the majority vote of the St. Gallen panel.</s></p><p><s>No Axillary Dissectionfor Which Patients?</s></p><p><s>With the introduction of sentinel node biopsy (SNB), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has become less important.</s><s>Since then, the discussion has focused on when ALND is not required.</s><s>Because of the significant side effects of this invasive procedure (pain, hematoma, restricted mobility, chronic lymphedema) the potential benefit needs to be clearly defined.</s></p><p><s>The German experts agree with the majority of St. Gallen panelists that ALND is not recommended for patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (i.e. with macrometastasis) if the patient is scheduled to undergo tangential field radiotherapy postoperatively following BCS or post-mastectomy radiotherapy of the thoracic wall with tangential coverage of part of the axillary lymph nodes.</s><s>Treatment of these patients must additionally include adequate systemic therapy.</s></p><p><s>The St. Gallen panelists did not differentiate between axillary radiotherapy of the lymph nodes with standard radiotherapy or with high tangent radiation to treat patients who had BCS.</s><s>In both cases, ALND is not necessary according to the St. Gallen consensus.</s><s>The German experts agree with this consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>They add that reducing the extent of surgery should not lead to increased radiation therapy.</s><s>The German experts refer in this context to the careful differentiations made in the AGO 2017 guidelines (▶ Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Patients with 1-2 affected sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) who do not undergo ALND should receive conventional breast radiotherapy.</s><s>As hypofractionated radiotherapy is increasingly used in Germany, these patients should be included in the INSEMA trial.</s></p><p><s>The St. Gallen panelists and the German experts agree that tumor biology (lymph node infiltration, hormone receptor status, grading) of patients with 1-2 positive SLN does not affect the decision to perform ALND.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ALND after NACT</head><p><s>The German experts agree with the majority vote of the St. Gallen panel that for patients who have clinically unsuspicious axillary lymph nodes (on palpation and/or sonography) at primary diagnosis (cN0), SNB after neoadjuvant therapy is recommended and ALND is not indicated.</s><s>The German experts recommend that in addition to palpation, sonography should be an indispensable part of the pre-treatment assessment of the axilla.</s><s>The German experts also agree with the St. Gallen panel that for patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes scheduled for NACT, SNB should be carried out after NACT rather than before.</s></p><p><s>This would mean that many patients (about 30 % have a positive SLN before NACT) would be spared ALND who would otherwisegiven the finding of a positive SLN prior to NACThave had ALND.</s><s>Both the AGO guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and the St. Gallen consensus recommend ALND <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> for patients who have positive SLN after NACT.</s><s>The indication for adjuvant radiotherapy does not just depend on tumor size but increasingly also on biological factors.</s><s>This recommendation should definitely be discussed with the radiation therapist.</s><s>German breast centers repeatedly claim that evaluating SLN prior to NACT is important to determine whether postoperative irradiation of the thoracic wall and the regional lymph nodes is indicated when examination shows SLN involvement.</s><s>The procedure should not be recommended because it would cause an overtreatment in 30 % of patients.</s></p><p><s>The question whether SNB is sufficient in patients with suspicious lymph nodes (i/cN+) on palpation and/or sonography at primary diagnosis but which are clinically/sonographically unremarkable (ycN0) after NACT ("down-staging": axillary conversion after NACT) and whether (or even when) complete ALND should be carried out has been discussed intensively.</s><s>Histological confirmation of these suspicious lymph nodes should be attempted with punch biopsy.</s><s>The German experts agree with 54 % of the St. Gallen panelists that SNB is not sufficient for patients who have 1-2 involved axillary lymph nodes after NACT.</s><s>ALND should be performed if macrometastasis are present in one or more SLN after NACT.</s></p><p><s>Both groups agree that in certain situations SNB alone can be considered in patients (i/cN+) with axillary conversion to yicN0 after NACT.</s><s>Certain methods such as clip marking of the involved lymph nodes prior to carrying out NACT can lower the false-negative rate.</s><s>The "plus/minus" option in the AGO 2017 guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> can be used in selected cases to avoid ALND.</s><s>The German experts emphasize that these methods require further study under controlled conditions, e.g. in the context of the upcoming prospective multicenter SenTa register study of AGO and the German Breast Group (GBG).</s></p></div>
