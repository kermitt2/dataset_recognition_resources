trends in the research on snakebite and snake venoms and toxins.</s><s>Second, the employed indicators that refer to the significance of the publications in the scientific community (number of citations, citation rate) need to be regarded critically and therefore, the data should not be over interpreted concerning research quality, as indicated by numerous previous articles <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, assessing the quality of research is only possible by advanced meta-analysis using, for example, Cochrane approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Insofar, the findings of the citation-related analyses refer to the resonance and the attention that the publications gained in the scientific community.</s><s>This is certainly not always connected with the publications' quality, but it indicates the interest with which scientific peers take them into account.</s><s>Third, the research output data was related to epidemiological estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> which do not necessarily display the actual case numbers in different countries exactly <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49]</ref>.</s><s>Fourth, there is a language bias present within the biomedical databases.</s><s>Publications written in English have a higher chance of being included <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</s><s>Also, established journals are listed more frequently than novel journals although the latter may have the same quality standards <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the Matthew effect needs to be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>: The communication systems in science are directed towards a reward for highly productive and renowned journals, scientists and institutions which leads, for example, to a pyramidal citation scheme.</s></p><p><s>Over two hundred years ago, the Scottish surgeon Patrick Russell published a work entitled "An Account of Indian Serpents Collected on the Coast of Coromandel" (1796) which can be regarded as one of the first scientific publications that point to the need of differentiating between venomous and non-venomous snakes and the necessity to develop therapeutic options for snakebite envenoming <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</s><s>About one hundred years later, Léon Charles Albert Calmette developed the first snake antivenom at the Institute Pasteur de Saigon <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">55]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We therefore decided to start the analysis at the beginning of WoS entries in 1900.</s><s>Thenceforward, we analyzed two different time intervals.</s><s>The first time frame was closed in 2007 due to the time that is needed for each publication to show their highest impact measured as Cited Half-Life.</s><s>This value has been introduced by the originator of the JCR (Journal Citation Report) Eugene Garfield, meaning the time span that is necessary to get at least 50% of the citations <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</s><s>Regarding the biomedical literature the mean Cited Half-Life can be considered up to eight years with a growing annual trend <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>.</s><s>Some journals publishing on snakebites reaches even a Cited Half-Life of more than ten years (e.g.</s><s>Archives of Ophthalmology).</s><s>The second evaluation time frame was set from 2008 to 2016 to include also the more current research outputs up to now.</s></p><p><s>The analysis shows that from 1900 to 2016, the yearly published amount of snakebite related publications increases from 5 (1900) to 677 (2012).</s><s>This exemplifies the increase in scientific activity in this scientific area but is also related to the general bibliometric principle that research articles usually double within a time frame of 10 to 20 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>.</s><s>The years after the maximum in 2012 show a slight decrease to 659 publications in 2014.</s><s>The even lower publication numbers in 2015 (p = 586) and 2016 (p = 82) are due to the fact that on the one hand not all accepted publications are already listed (2015) and on the other hand the year 2016 is not terminated at the time of analysis, so that only a part of the real publication output of these years is taken into account.</s></p><p><s>Maxima of publications numbers in single years are often related to important scientific findings and usually occur 2-5 years after the publication of the important finding.</s><s>In this respect, the observed maximum in 1978 (198 publications) is most likely related to the development of Captopril from the venom of the South American Jararaca (Bothrops jararaca).</s><s>Also, the maximum in 1985 (281 publications) is most likely related to the finding of dendrotoxin in 1980, which was isolated from Mamba venom.</s></p><p><s>The strong increase in 1991 is not due to a scientific but to a methodological reason caused by the implementation of the Topic-search tool of WoS.</s></p><p><s>When analyzing the contribution of single countries, neither the estimated incidence (1.7 snakebite injuries per 100,000 inhabitants) nor the mortality (0.01 per 100,000 inhabitants) but the general standing of the USA as the world leading country concerning research activity points to the large gap in overall snakebite-research activity.</s><s>This indicates that countries with a high incidence of snakebites and a low economical level need to be empowered to carry out research.</s></p><p><s>In striking contrast to other scientometric studies that addresses diseases such as gout <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>, silicosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>, or infectious diseases including influenza <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>, or hepatitis B <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>, the global ranking of snakebite research activity is different to the usual picture with the USA being followed by the UK, Germany or Japan: This usual pattern has also been found in a study analyzing over 5.5 million publications on the global publication activity within the following 21 organ systems: Brain, heart, artery, vein, lung, muscle, eye, nose, ear, throat, neck, skin, breast, stomach, intestine, pancreas, kidney, genital, hormone, arm, feet.</s><s>Here, an almost uniform pattern was present for every single organ.</s><s>The USA was ranked first in every of the 21 organ systems.</s><s>Number two and three concerning research output were either the UK, Japan, Germany or France.</s><s>Interestingly, a dichotomy was present between Western countries such as the USA, UK or Germany and Asian countries such as Japan, China or South Korea concerning research focuses.</s><s>Western countries each had the following ranking concerning research activity: the most frequently focused organ was the heart.</s><s>By contrast, the Asian countries had the liver as number one organ of interest.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, the current analysis shows that Brazil, a country with a relatively high incidence and mortality and with a rather low GDP contributed with the second highest research activity.</s><s>The Brazilian publication performance corresponds with the findings of another neglected disease study on yellow fever <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>.</s><s>Here, a recent NewQIS-study identified total of 5,053 yellow fever-associated publications, which were published by 79 countries.</s></p><p><s>The difference of the overall numbers of publications between yellow fever and snakebite related publications is most probably caused by the inclusion (search term) of studies that use venom ingredients to address basic mechanisms of human physiology and to develop novel pharmaceutics.</s></p><p><s>Until now basic research on snakebites and venoms is more or less privileged to highincome countries, firstly, because they have the means for high tech research and secondly, there are no or only very little problems with snake envenomation.</s><s>This is obviously the opposite in middle-income and low-income countries.</s><s>The lack of resources limits the research on snakebite envenoming in these countries.</s><s>Nevertheless, the emerging nation Brazil established-even enhanced-an important role in snakebite research.</s><s>Also, as shown here, other countries from South and Middle America, like Costa Rica and Colombia, have appeared in the recent decade on the global landscape of snakebite research.</s><s>Hence, it should be requested that other directly affected low and middle nations are also integrated to the worldwide research networks.</s></p></div>
