<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specificity of the new primer sets for the discrimination of malaria parasite species</head><p><s>The PCR with universal primers (first PCR) clearly amplified a single band from all types of template DNA (Fig 2 <ref type="figure">)</ref>.</s><s>A gradient PCR machine was not needed for the second PCR, as the conditions (including the annealing temperatures) were the same for all of the primer sets.</s></p><p><s>With the PCR enzyme used in this study, the P. ovale-and P. malariae-specific primers used in the previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> sometimes cross-reacted with the sequences from other species.</s><s>No cross-reaction occurred with these primers when the conventional Taq polymerase was used for the reaction (data not shown); thus, the powerful proof-reading activity of the PCR enzyme may cause such cross-reactions.</s><s>In addition, the previously reported P. ovale-specific primer was designed based on the sequence of P. ovale curtisi, one of the subspecies of P. ovale.</s><s>Thus, new primers specific to the SSU rRNA genes from two subspecies of P. ovale (P.</s><s>ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri) and P. malariae were designed (primers Oc4, Ow1, and M4, respectively: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The comparison of the sets of the classic and new primers specific for P. ovale curtisi and P. malariae clearly showed the relatively high sensitivity of the new primers in the performance of the second PCR reactions with the increase to 30 cycles.</s><s>With the primer set of P1 and the classic O2, PCR products were amplified from the sequence of all species.</s><s>With the primer set of P1 and the new Oc4, PCR products were amplified solely from the sequences of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>With the primer set of P1 and the classic M1, PCR amplifications were detected from the specific sequences of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. knowlesi, and P. ovale wallikeri.</s><s>However, with the primer set of P1 and the new M4, PCR products were amplified only from the specific sequence of P. malariae (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>The previously reported P. vivax-specific primer was reported to cross-react with the SSU rRNA gene from P. knowlesi <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, specific primers for the SSU rRNA genes from P. vivax and P. knowlesi were newly designed in the present study (primers V3 and K1; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To verify the specificity of the newly designed nested PCR system, a PCR with the universal P1 primer and each of the specific F2, V3, Oc4, Ow1, M4, and K1 primers was performed with the first PCR products, which were amplified from each of the SSU rRNA genes from every species.</s><s>In the second PCR, the combinations of the universal primer (P1) and each of the inner-specific primers for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale curtisi, P. malariae, P. knowlesi, and P. ovale wallikeri (F2, V3, Oc4, M4, and K1, respectively) clearly resulted in the amplification of a single band from the first PCR products, corresponding to each positive control, and never cross-reacted with the first PCR products amplified from the partial sequences of the other species of Plasmodium.</s></p><p><s>An exceptional case was observed with the specific primer for P. ovale wallikeri.</s><s>This Ow1 primer clearly amplified the sequence P. ovale wallikeri and cross-reacted of that of P. ovale curtisi (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>Thus, this system cannot discriminate between the P. ovale curtisi single infection and the mixed infection of the two subspecies, P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri.</s><s>Cases that were positive with both the Oc4 and Ow1 primers in the second PCR were simply classified as "P.</s><s>ovale infection".</s><s>No clinical problem is expected from the difficulty of differentiation of these two subspecies.</s><s>For more detailed discrimination of the infection of these two subspecies, sequencing analysis of the PCR products would be required.</s></p><p><s>In addition, variations of SSU rRNA gene sequence among multi-copies in the genome of same species or genetic isotypes of a Plasmodium species had been deposited in gene databases.</s><s>To investigate the second PCR reactivity for each variant DNA, the NCBI nucleotide collection database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide) was searched using the representative sequences of the second PCR products from each species.</s><s>As a result, several patterns of variant for P. falciparum (2 isotypes), P. vivax (3 isotypes), P. ovale curtisi (4 isotypes) and P. malariae (2 isotypes) were additionally identified (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>No additional variants of the region were detected for P. ovale wallikeri or P. knowlesi.</s><s>Some of these variants contain one or two nucleotide changes inside the region covered by the specific primer.</s><s>The DNA sequences of these additional variants were generated by artificial gene synthesis.</s><s>For the P. ovale curtisi variants, the two isotypes did not have nucleotide changes inside the region of the Oc4 primer (Poc isotype-2 and Poc isotype-4; Fig 5A <ref type="figure">)</ref>; the others had the same single nucleotide change inside this region (Poc isotype-1 and Poc isotype-3; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>).</s><s>Then, from P. ovale curtisi variants, only the sequence of Poc isotype-3 was generated to investigate the reactivity of the Oc4 primer to this region.</s><s>The PCR with the species-specific primers was performed using these synthesized DNAs as templates.</s><s>As a result, in spite of the one or two base-pair changes inside the primer region, all of the template DNAs were amplified solely by the primer targeted for the specific species (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>).</s><s>These results indicated that the potential application of the nested-PCR system in the discrimination of Plasmodium species in unknown clinical samples.</s></p><p><s>In addition to P.knowlesi, the possibility of the outbreak of simian malaria parasites in humans has become a concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>For example, a case in which a human was naturally infected with P. cynomolgi was reported in 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>P. cynomolgi is closely genetically related to P. vivax and morphologically indistinguishable from P. vivax under microscopic observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>From this point of view, in the region corresponding to the P. vivax specific V3 primer, the SSU rRNA gene sequences from P. cynomolgi isolates have only three nucleotides differences from the sequence of the V3 primer (S1 Fig) <ref type="figure">.</ref></s><s>Thus, it is expected to be difficult to clearly discriminate P. cynomolgi from P. vivax using our system.</s><s>To diagnose such rare zoonotic malaria cases, it is important to pay careful attention to the patient's symptoms, travel history and the environmental characteristics of the area where he/she stayed, and if necessary, to perform sequencing of the longer region of the SSU rRNA gene.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detection limit for P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the nested PCR system</head><p><s>The detection limit of the nested PCR system was determined using cultured P. falciparum.</s><s>The series of diluted samples of ring-stage parasites were used for the template DNA extraction.</s><s>In the second PCR with the P. falciparum-specific primer, a clear band was observed until the DNA was extracted from the blood sample with 0.1 parasite/Î¼L (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>This parasite concentration is approximately equivalent to 2 Ã 10 â6 % parasitemia.</s><s>Thus, for P. falciparum, this nested PCR system could detect parasites in samples with submicroscopic parasitemia.</s></p></div>
