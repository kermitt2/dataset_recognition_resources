<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) represent a heterogeneous group of extranodal T-cell lymphomas that by definition originate through clonal expansion of neoplastic T cells homing to the skin without further systemic involvement at the time of diagnosis.</s><s>Mycosis fungoides (MF) with an incidence of 4-5/1,000,000 inhabitants per year is the most common form of CTCL, accounting for ∼ 50% of CTCLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Criscione and Weinstock, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Three clinical stages are distinguished in disease progression: initial erythematous macules (patch stage) are often followed by deeper infiltrated plaques (plaque stage), and in some cases skin tumors may develop (tumor stage).</s><s>On the other hand, Sézary syndrome (SS), an aggressive variant of primary CTCL, is characterized by neoplastic T cells in skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood already from the beginning of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Willemze et al., 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>At present, there is only limited understanding on the pathogenesis of CTCL.</s><s>Cytogenetic studies and gene expression analyses of the past years could identify several genes that may have a major role in the development and/or progression of CTCL.</s><s>The so far identified genes enclose several known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that are involved in major pathways regulating the cell cycle, cell survival, or apoptosis-e.g., MYC, TP53, NOTCH1, E2A, and CDKN2A (p16), and CDKN2B (p15) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Vermeer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kamstrup et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marks et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Steininger et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lamprecht et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Manfé et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>These changes were particularly identified in tumor-or plaque-stage MF lesions, as well as in circulating tumor cells of SS patients, owing to the high numbers of tumor cells in these situations.</s><s>It remains therefore an open question of whether these genes are also altered in early stages and may thus contribute to genesis or progression of CTCL.</s></p><p><s>Despite significant progress in the identification of genes and pathways involved in pathogenesis of CTCL, the therapeutic value of these findings is still low, and there remains a particular need for treatments of patients with advancedstage CTCL.</s></p><p><s>The three Aurora kinase (AURK) family members (A, B, and C) represent serine/threonine kinases and are key regulators of mitosis as well as diverse signal transduction pathways for control of, e.g., centrosome function, mitotic entry, kinetochore function, spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and interaction with p53, p73, and cMYC.</s><s>Overexpression of particularly Aurora kinase A (AURKA) has been linked to tumorigenesis and has already been demonstrated in several hematologic malignancies as well as in solid tumors.</s><s>This resulted in the development of several AURK inhibitors that are currently being tested in first clinical trials and have become a promising therapeutic option in cancer therapy.</s></p><p><s>In an approach to further define pathways and to identify novel potential targets for therapeutic intervention, we have investigated gene expression profiles of CTCL samples of different stages compared with normal skin by microarray and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis.</s><s>A number of genes involved in regulation of the cell cycle and mitosis were found to be upregulated in CTCLs.</s><s>Among these, AURKA revealed a most significant upregulation in MF skin samples as compared with normal skin.</s><s>Overexpression of AURKA in CTCL was also confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of circulating tumor cells of SS patients and in CTCL cell lines.</s><s>Interestingly, inhibition of AURKA in CTCL cell lines with MLN8237, a specific AURKA inhibitor, results in a massive reduction of viable cells already after 24 hours.</s><s>This reduction was caused by cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and in addition by induction of apoptosis in tested cell lines, indicating that AURKA inhibition could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for CTCL patients.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genes involved in cell cycle control and mitosis are significantly upregulated in CTCL</head><p><s>To identify pathways that are activated in CTCL, we performed gene expression profiling of 13 lesional skin biopsies of different MF patients (patch = 3, plaque = 6, tumor = 4) in comparison with healthy control tissue from 8 patients.</s><s>Using criteria of 42.0-fold change and false discovery rate of o0.05, we identified a series of differentially expressed genes.</s><s>Our initial analysis focused on genes encoding serine/ threonine kinases and serine/threonine/tyrosine receptor kinases, corresponding to Gene Ontology terms GO:0004674 and GO:0004712, respectively.</s><s>Within this category, we found AURKA as one of the 10 most upregulated genes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Based on these findings that AURKA was one of the highest serine/threonine/tyrosin receptor kinase expressed, and in addition the information that a highly specific inhibitory agent for potential treatment is already available, we focused our further descriptive and functional analyses on AURKA.</s><s>Comparative genome hybridization analyses using the bacterial artificial chromosome arrays of four CTCL cell lines and purified tumor cells of 20 Sézary patients revealed amplification of the whole chromosome 20 in the cell line SeAx as well as a 410 Mb amplification including the gene locus of AURKA, 20q13.3, in one patient.</s><s>Thus, gene duplications had been found in only 1 of 4 cell lines and in 1 of 20 investigated patient samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Steininger et al., 2011)</ref>, thus indicating that gene duplication of AURKA is a rare finding and largely excluding this mechanism as common cause of AURKA overexpression in CTCL.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AURKA expression is upregulated in CTCL tumor cells as well as in CTCL cell lines</head><p><s>To demonstrate that AURKA overexpression in MF skin samples was not a result of the high number of infiltrating (reactive) T cells but owing to a high expression in the tumor cell population, AURKA expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 19 MF and 3 SS samples from skin biopsies.</s><s>As negative control, we analyzed 10 cases of inflammatory dermatoses, including 5 psoriasis and 5 eczema cases.</s></p><p><s>AURKA expression could be detected in 16/19 MF and in 2/3 SS specimens (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>All three stages of MF demonstrated expression of AURKA.</s><s>Moreover, immunohistochemistry results revealed increasing detection rates of AURKA in atypical cells that were judged on the basis of morphology or pattern (epidermotropic, intraepidermal) from patch-to tumor-stage MF.</s><s>In the patch stage, up to 20% of the infiltrating atypical cells stained positive for AURKA, in the plaque stage an average of 30% (range 10-60) stained positive for AURKA, and in the tumor stage an average of 60% (range 30-90) of AURKA-positive cells could be detected.</s><s>Small lymphocytes were noted to be at least faintly positive.</s><s>In the control skin samples with eczema and psoriasis, inflammatory cells almost completely lacked AURKA positivity, with overall less AURKA expression in the epidermis and dermal tissue.</s></p><p><s>To further validate the gene expression data of MF skin samples and to assess whether other entities of CTCL, especially the more aggressive SS, also show upregulation of AURKA, we analyzed its expression in 4 CTCL cell lines (Hut-78, SeAx, MyLa, and HH), as well as in an additional set</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Humme et al.</head><p><s>Aurorakinase A as a Potential Therapeutic Target in CTCL of enriched tumor cells from peripheral blood of 11 patients with SS.</s><s>As a control, sorted CD4+ memory T cells and stimulated proliferating CD4+ cells of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were investigated.</s><s>As demonstrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b and c</ref>, AURKA was expressed at consistently high levels in CTCL lines and stimulated proliferating CD4+ cells, with mean values largely exceeding the levels of unstimulated memory CD4+ cells (410-fold).</s><s>As AURKA expression is linked to mitosis and therefore its upregulation might be only owing to accelerated cell proliferation of cell lines as compared with nonproliferating primary T cells, we also compared the expression of primary, circulating tumor cells in SS patients with those in healthy controls.</s><s>Of note, SS cells do not considerably proliferate in the blood compartment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bunn et al., 1981)</ref>.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the tumor cells of approximately half of the patients showed distinct upregulation of AURKA when compared with the healthy controls.</s><s>When comparing both groups, AURKA expression was elevated by 2.4-fold in the tumor cell samples (Po0.05).</s><s>These data confirmed the significant upregulation of AURKA in CTCL cells at the mRNA and protein levels.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The AURK inhibitor MLN8237 blocks cell proliferation by inducing a cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and can induce apoptosis in CTCL cells</head><p><s>To determine whether AURKA may represent an appropriate therapeutic target in CTCL, we evaluated the functional relevance of its inhibition by using the specific AURKA inhibitor MLN8237.</s><s>First, we analyzed the effects of MLN8237 on cell viability in the four CTCL cell lines Hut-78, MyLa, SeAx, and HH.</s><s>Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of MLN8237 for 48 hours, and the number of viable cells was determined by WST-1 assay.</s><s>All cell lines responded with a significant reduction of viable cell numbers when compared with nontreated cells.</s><s>Cell viability was already significantly reduced (Po0.05)</s><s>at the lowest concentration of 0.01 μM for 3 of the 4 cell lines (SeAx, MyLa, and HH), reaching levels between 85 and 97% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), and reaching highly significant values (Po0.01) for all cell lines at 0.1 μM (range 53-66%).</s><s>Viability only decreased moderately at higher concentrations, with a maximum effect for most cell lines at the 1.0 μM concentration (between 40 and 68%), with Hut-78 being the most sensitive cell line.</s><s>These effects were comparable to that found in phytohemaglutinin-stimulated proliferating CD4+ T cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a and b</ref>).</s><s>No effect on cell viability was seen in unstimulated primary T cells (not shown).</s></p><p><s>To elucidate the mechanisms leading to decreased numbers of viable cells after AURKA inhibition, we analyzed the DNA content of cells at 24 hours after incubation with MLN8237 by staining ethanol-fixed cells with propidium iodide (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a  and b</ref>).</s><s>All cell lines revealed a decrease of cells in G0/G1 cell cycle phase, whereas the relative number of cells in G2/M phase were strongly increased, indicating a block in this cell cycle phase.</s><s>The maximum effect was again reached at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 μM, with Hut-78 being the most sensitive cell line.</s><s>In addition to an arrest in the cell cycle, Hut78 cells also showed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells characterized by DNA contents less than those in cells in G0/G1 (sub-G1), as well as an appearance of hyperdiploid cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Induction of apoptosis in Hut-78 was strongly supported by western blotting for activated caspase-3 cleavage products (17 and 19 kDa).</s><s>In contrast, caspase-3 activation was not significantly enhanced in MyLa, clearly in parallel with the diminished induction of apoptosis in these cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</s><s>The potential factors leading to apoptosis through AURKA inhibition are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Cutaneous lymphomas form a diverse group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas carrying a poor prognosis in its advanced stage, and therefore they are in need of more effective therapies.</s><s>Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that AURKA is strongly expressed in CTCL cell lines and primary tumor cells.</s><s>AURKA is among the top upregulated genes coding for proteins with serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity, as identified by gene expression profiling of lesional skin.</s><s>These findings were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blotting in all investigated CTCL cell lines and tumor cells of SS patients showing high levels of AURKA expression, with mean values significantly exceeding the levels of normal CD4+ memory cells.</s></p><p><s>AURKs are essential for cell proliferation, regulating cell cycle transition from G2, formation of the mitotic spindle,</s></p></div>

AURKs, A, B, and C, that share a high degree of sequence homology.</s><s>AURKA is in principle expressed in most normal cells; however, in line with our findings, overexpression of AURKs has been reported preferentially in malignant cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gritsko et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Jeng et al., 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As AURKA can also be detected in normal cells and is associated with cell proliferation, one may assume that the higher detection rate of AURKA expression in advanced stages of MF might be associated with the higher proliferation rate of malignant cells in comparison with early MF stages.</s><s>Nevertheless, our immunohistochemistry results demonstrate that the proliferation marker Mib-1 is only weakly exhibited in patch and plaque MF samples in comparison with AURKA.</s><s>Hence, proliferation of malignant cells cannot alone explain the increased expression of AURKA in all MF stages.</s><s>Furthermore, there is evidence that the accumulation of tumor cells in MF is based on resistance to apoptosis, e.g., owing to diminished responsiveness to FAS/CD95 ligand and to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand rather than enhanced proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Braun et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Braun et al., , 2010;;</ref><ref type="bibr"

proliferation of tumor cells, in line with findings in other malignant tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Jeng et al., 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The mechanisms of recruitment of AURKA are not completely understood, but they involve a complex interaction with several proteins, e.g., it regulates the activation of the polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Macurek et al., 2008)</ref>, a protein for which overexpression was recently shown in CTCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Nihal et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Stutz et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, recent data suggest that although AURK activity accelerates mitotic entry in normal cells, it is essential for mitotic entry only in DNAdamaged cells, which is the case in CTCL cells harboring a vast amount of genomic aberrations, as previously shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(van Vugt et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Karenko et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Especially, PLK1 seems to be essential for mitotic entry following recovery from DNA damage.</s><s>As for AURKA itself, it can activate cell division cycle 25c (CDC25C) via PLK1 that subsequently promotes mitotic entry by activating the cyclin B/cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) complex.</s><s>It has been proposed that CDC25B acts as the initial starter phosphatase that activates cyclin B/ CDK1, whereas CDC25C has the role to act in a positive feedback loop with cyclin B/CDK1, leading to full and irreversible activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(van Vugt et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that AURKA can directly phosphorylate PLK1 that can additionally be enhanced by the AURKA activator Bora <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Macurek et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the functions of aurora kinase A in mitosis, AURKA also regulates the function of TP53 (p53) and NF-κB that may have important therapeutic implications especially in CTCL <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Braun et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>AURKA phosphorylates TP53 at Ser 315, leading to its degradation via ubiquitination by MDM2 and subsequent proteolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Katayama et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>In CTCL, we and others could demonstrate a nonfunctional p53 signaling owing to genomic aberration in up
