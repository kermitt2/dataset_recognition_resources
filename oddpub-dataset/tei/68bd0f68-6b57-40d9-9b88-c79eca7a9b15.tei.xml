<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium colonizing the stomach of ~50% of the world's population.</s><s>Infection with H. pylori usually occurs during childhood and persists life-long if untreated.</s><s>It may lead to gastritis, peptic ulcer disease and gastric mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue lymphoma or gastric adenocarcinoma.</s><s>A pronounced immune response and severe long-term consequences are mainly associated with strains carrying the cagPAI, which encodes a cagT4SS and its only known effector protein, CagA <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kusters et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>The mechanism by which the innate immune system other than epithelial cells is alerted to the presence of cagPAI positive strains has received almost no attention so far.</s><s>It is likely to have significant implications, however, especially in light of the emerging beneficial effects of H. pylori infection per se, such as protection against asthma and inflammatory bowel disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Oertli et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Engler et al., 2015)</ref>, as well as the increasing appreciation of the microbiota in health and disease.</s></p><p><s>The concentration of bacteria housed in the gastrointestinal tract ranges from 10 2 per milliliter in the stomach to 10 11 per milliliter in the colon <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Walter and Ley, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>It is thus bombarded with ligands that may interact with members of the TLR family and trigger an innate immune response, regardless of whether they are derived from a commensal or pathogenic bacterium.</s><s>However, an important task of the immune system consists of discriminating between normal microbiota and virulent pathogens.</s><s>This may be one reason why the resident innate immune cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the lamina propria dendritic cells or macrophages, show anergy towards ligands that trigger a TLR response and possibly also other innate receptors such as NOD1 and NOD2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mowat and Bain, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Smythies et al., 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Secretion systems such as T3SS and T4SS are critical determinants of the pathogenic potential of Gram-negative bacterial isolates or species, e.g. in Bordetella pertussis or Bartonella henselae harbouring a T4SS, or in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli exhibiting a T3SS.</s><s>A fine-tuned innate response against these structures or translocated effectors could thus facilitate mounting a balanced defence against potential invaders.</s><s>Specific recognition of cagPAI positive H. pylori followed by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines would favour the infiltration of inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils that dominate the inflammatory response.</s></p><p><s>In monocyte-derived cells of the bone marrow, recognition of H. pylori occurs via TLRs such as TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Rad et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>However, cagPAI positive and negative strains express similar amounts of TLR ligands, yet several lines of evidence show that the innate immune system mounts a stronger response to positive strains.</s><s>Both mice and humans have much higher inflammatory scores during infection with cagPAI positive strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Yamaoka et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arnold et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Mice can also be colonized more easily with cagPAI negative strains, and only one mouse-adapted strain established so far maintains expression of a functional cagPAI in vivo for at least 1 month before it is lost <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Arnold et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Gastric epithelial cell lines such as AGS cells, which lack specific TLR-dependent pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Belogolova et al., 2013)</ref>, are able to differentiate between cagPAI positive and negative H. pylori in vitro depending on the cagT4SS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bartfeld et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s>This strongly suggests that TLRindependent mechanisms are involved in recognizing cagPAI positive strains.</s></p><p><s>To illuminate the open issue of mucosal recognition, we used wild type and MyD88/Trif -/bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs), which lack the adaptor proteins of all TLRs and are thus unresponsive to TLR signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kawai and Akira, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>We have previously shown that T4SS-induced up-regulation of miR-155 in these cells is independent of NOD1 or NOD2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Koch et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we analysed global gene expression and kinetics in wild type and MyD88/Trif -/macrophages infected with cagPAI positive and negative strains.</s><s>We found that anergic but not wt macrophages recognize the presence of the T4SS and respond via altered kinetics of a subset of genes that includes a prominent set of pro-inflammatory genes with AU-rich elements (AREs).</s></p></div>

0.0001; odds ratio: 5.884, 95% CI: 3.089 to 11.210).</s><s>Of the 17 genes that regulated more than twofold in all conditions, all contained at least one, and 15 contained multiple AREs.</s><s>Genes containing many ARE pentamers in their 3´UTR share two main features: early onset of expression upon a stimulus ('early response genes') and a fast mRNA decay <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hao and Baltimore, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schwanhausser et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Only MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs show cagPAI-sensitivity in their early response kinetics</s></p><p><s>For wt BMMs, Hao and Baltimore ( <ref type="formula">2009</ref>) defined three groups of mRNAs that exhibit different kinetics upon stimulation with inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF-α: early (with a very rapid onset and decay), intermediate (with slightly later onset and slower decay) and late (with a slow onset and high stability).</s><s>We thus further validated our microarray data by performing time course analyses in wt and MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs for each class of genes from Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>: we chose the AREcontaining genes TNFsf9, TNF-α and IL-1β, while the AREnegative gene CCL-5 served as control.</s><s>We infected wt and MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs with wt P12 and P12ΔcagPAI and performed time course analysis of gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).</s><s>In wt BMMs, TNFsf9 showed early, TNF-α showed intermediate and IL-1β showed late response kinetics in response to infection with both strains (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A-C</ref>).</s><s>By contrast, in MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs, all three of these genes showed early response kinetics after infection with the cagPAI positive wt P12 H. pylori; after infection with P12ΔcagPAI, onset of expression was significantly delayed for all three ARE-containing genes (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E-G</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The maximum peak of IL-1β and TNFsf9 expression was also significantly lower during P12ΔcagPAI infection.</s><s>CCL-5 on the other hand did not show a differential response to the two H. pylori strains at the time points tested (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D and H</ref>).</s><s>Thus, only MyD88/Trif -/macrophages are able to differentiate between cagPAI positive and negative strains via different expression kinetics of ARE-containing genes.</s></p><p><s>To exclude that the observed effect could be due to different motilities of the two bacterial strains, we synchronized bacterial contact to MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs by centrifugation for 5 min prior to a 40 min infection time.</s><s>In congruence with our results for the 1 h infection time point in Fig. <ref type="figure">1 E-G</ref>, TNF-α, IL-1β and TNFsf9 were more strongly up-regulated in response to wt P12 than to P12ΔcagPAI (Supporting Information Fig. <ref type="figure">2A-C</ref>).</s><s>Thus, our results are not due to impaired motility of the P12ΔcagPAI deletion mutant.</s></p><p><s>To test whether the effect on the transcriptional level is also reflected on the protein level, we examined the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β by Western blot analyses.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> demonstrates that TNF-α expression on the protein level mimicked the observed RNA expression, being up-regulated at ~60 min p.i. and peaking at 90 min p.i. in the wt P12 infection in MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>), followed by a decline at 3 h p.i.. Up-regulation upon P12ΔcagPAI infection first occurred at 90 min p.i., peaking at 3 h p.i..</s><s>For both strains, levels remain slightly elevated as late as 5 h p.i.. Translation of IL-1β can be detected at ~90 min p.i. with wt P12 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s><s>By 3 h, both strains induced a similar up-regulation that was maintained until at least 5 h p.i.. Thus, for IL-1β and TNF-α, the early and stronger RNA up-regulation in response to wt P12 compared to P12ΔcagPAI infections is reflected on the protein level, whereas for IL-1β, the later time points in particular show evidence of increased protein stability, presumably due to higher complexity of posttranslational responses.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Early regulation is contact dependent and partially nuclear factor-κB dependent</head><p><s>To examine the mechanism of up-regulation of the early response genes TNFsf9, IL-1β and TNF-α, we first tested whether this effect was dependent on direct contact of H. pylori with the host cell or on phagocytic uptake of the bacterium.</s><s>To this end, we used bafilomycin A1 (BafA1),  an inhibitor of phagosomal maturation that blocks the host cell proton pump.</s><s>When we pre-treated MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs with BafA1 1 h prior to infection with P12 wt for 60 min, we could not detect any difference in RNA expression of TNF-α and TNFsf9 and only a moderate, but non-significant, decrease of IL-1β (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A-C</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, pre-treating MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to inhibit the NF-κB pathway, we observed a strong decrease in IL-1β and TNFsf9 expression during wt P12 infection, but no reduction in the expression of TNF-α (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A-C</ref>).</s><s>Thus, these results further underscore that the response depends on direct contact between H. pylori and macrophages, independently of phagosomal maturation.</s><s>Moreover, while IL-1β and TNFsf9 expression seems to be critically dependent on NF-κB activity, TNF-α activation seems to require an independent component.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CagT4SS but not its CagA effector protein is necessary for virulence discrimination</head><p><s>To assess which feature of the cagPAI is involved in the signalling process, we first used Western blotting to test if CagA is translocated and phosphorylated in mouse BMMs.</s><s>Using antibodies against phospho-tyrosine motifs and CagA, we detected a major band at ~40 kDa (Supporting Information Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4</ref>), indicating that phosphorylated CagA is effectively translocated but fragmented in these BMMs, consistent with our previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Moese et al., 2001)</ref>.</s><s>As we wanted to know whether CagA influences the expression pattern of the early response genes TNF-α, and TNFsf9 in anergic macrophages, we infected MyD88/Trif -/-BMMs with P12 wt, P12ΔcagPAI, P12ΔcagA or the cagL deletion mutant P12ΔcagL.</s><s>CagL is a structural element of the CagT4SS</s></p></div>
