(2014)</ref> showed a subfoveal thinning of the choroid in three patients with high-grade CAS and OIS by enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT (Heidelberg Spectralis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we did not investigate the choroid thickness because our images were recorded without EDI mode.</s><s>Furthermore, there are currently no reliable automatic segmentation methods available for the choroid.</s><s>Instead, we analyzed state-of-the-art retinal OCT parameters, which were successfully applied to detect retinal neurodegeneration in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases, and established optic nerve ultrasound measures.</s></p><p><s>The significant side-to-side differences of ONSD ( = 0.028) and OND ( = 0.027) in Group 2 (CAS ≥ 80%/CAO, nonretrograde OA) seem not to be related to the reduced blood flow in the CRA.</s><s>If this was the case, there should be a significant side-to-side difference of ON thicknesses as well in Group 3 (CAS ≥ 80%/CAO, retrograde OA), since we found significant PSV reduction in this group in contrast to PSV in Group 2 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>However, patients with initial CAS/CAO diagnosis in the last 15 months seem to show a thickening of the TMV on the CAS/CAO side compared to no-CAD side (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>That might be explained by an initial retinal edema, an excessive vascularization, or venous dilatation (overall diameter of retinal vessels is included in TMV) due to ischemia, which were regressive during time.</s><s>Vascular changes and retinal edema are possible manifestations of an early stage of OIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, RNFL thickness in the nasal quadrant tended to show a thinning on CAS/CAO side compared to no-CAD side; however, this difference was not significant.</s></p><p><s>This study shows that PSV reduction in the CRA correlates significantly with the degree of CAS ( = 0.002).</s><s>Blood flow velocities in the downstream CRA in CAS ≥ 80% or CAO are lower if the OA flow is retrograde compared to those with a nonretrograde OA.</s><s>To assess whether this was an effect relevant to the perfusion of the eye, additional parameters like pulse pressure or ocular perfusion pressure, assessed by, for example, oculoplethysmography, would have been desirable but were not assessed in our patient group.</s><s>However, data from the literature in fact suggest that PSV in the CRA significantly correlates with the systolic pressure in the CRA and OA, supporting our hypothesis of impaired ocular circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Results of the small CCA-O cohort support the hemodynamic findings and extent of blood flow reduction, which might occur in such a "worst case scenario."</s><s>In this constellation the ocular blood supply is severely impaired and collateral compensation can only be provided via anastomoses from the contralateral external carotid artery.</s><s>Unfortunately, our cohort size was small and the drop-out rate did not allow analyzing retinal structure and visual function.</s><s>Patients with such a specific condition tend to be clinically less stable which might have been the reason for the low recruitment numbers.</s></p><p><s>In our study we were not able to perform a full ophthalmologic examination including measurement of intraocular pressure.</s><s>It is therefore possible that we missed mild glaucomatous changes that would have not been apparent in OCT.</s><s>Spherical refraction was compensated by manually focusing on the fundus but spherical refraction was not assessed independently.</s><s>Consequently we did not employ exclusion criteria, that is, in regard to high myopia.</s><s>These are two clear limitations of our study.</s><s>However, given the negative results (also in comparison to normative data in the device which makes clinical diagnosis of major confounding conditions improbable), we do not believe that influence on our results is relevant.</s><s>The negative findings in morphological and functional analyses may also be explained with the small cohort size.</s><s>To detect small changes, bigger cohort sizes might be necessary.</s><s>The decision to choose the intrasubject comparisons (no-CAD side versus CAS/CAO side) instead of intersubject comparisons (CAS/CAO eyes versus eyes from healthy control subjects), which could have gained a larger cohort size, was made with respect to the comparability due to the comorbidities.</s><s>Individual systemic factors have a greater comparability in intrasubject than in intersubject comparisons.</s><s>Still, the lack of a healthy control cohort might be considered a weakness, because some patients might have had CAD &lt; 50% on the no-CAD side.</s></p><p><s>The cohort in this study matches the expected demographic frame for CAD patients very well and is comparable to other CAD studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In total, twelve patients had to be excluded from the OCT analyses, mainly due to retinal pathologies in a measurementchanging extent.</s><s>This finding exemplifies, on the one hand, that the applicability of quantitative OCT analysis is limited in elderly multimorbid patients.</s><s>On the other hand, there might be more appropriate parameters as the ones chosen in this study.</s><s>Concerning the brain, CAD more often causes embolic infarctions while hemodynamic patterns with only 5-8% of cases are relatively rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Xu et al. introduced the so-called RNFL defect, a localized sector in which the RNFL contour line touched or dipped into the &lt;1% reference zone for a length of less than 180 ∘ , due to microinfarctions of the retina of which appearance correlates with arterial hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Wang et al. found RNFL defects in 48.1% (±4.0 SD,  = 154) of patients with acute and in 40.7% (±2.8 SD,  = 206) of patients with previous stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In a retrospective analysis of our data no such RNFL defects according to definition of Xu et al. could be found, even though our cohort includes patients with arterial hypertension (66.7%) and previous stroke (33.3%).</s><s>A reason for this finding could be an improper definition of RNFL defects, our small sample size, or different ethnic groups (Asian versus Caucasian).</s></p></div>
