<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Subjects</head><p><s>Twelve subjects (nine female, three male), ranging in age from 18 to 24 years with audiometric thresholds no greater than 15 dB hearing level (HL) at octave frequencies from 250 to 8000 Hz were tested.</s><s>In fact, all participants had audiometric thresholds at 8 kHz of no more than 5 dB HL, suggesting good high-frequency hearing.</s><s>No participant reported a history of neurological or hearing disorders.</s><s>Written informed consent was provided by each participant, and all participants were compensated for their time.</s><s>The experiment was conducted at the University of Minnesota -Twin Cities.</s><s>The protocol was approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Stimuli</head><p><s>The target stimulus for the experiment was a complex harmonic tone with a nominal F0 of 115 Hz, bandpass filtered with corner frequencies of 5000 and 6250 Hz and filter slopes of 72 dB/octave on either side of the passband.</s><s>The duration of the target was 300 ms (including 10-ms onset and offset raised-cosine ramps).</s><s>The level per component was set at a nominal 50 dB sound pressure level (SPL) but was roved on each presentation within a range of 66 dB to reduce potential loudness cues.</s><s>The interferer stimulus, in conditions when interferers were present, was also a bandpass-filtered harmonic complex, with passbands of 2800-4050 Hz (low), 5000-6250 Hz (middle), or 8000-9250 Hz (high), with the same spectral slopes of 72 dB/octave as the target.</s><s>All complex tones (target and interferers) were presented in sine phase.</s><s>The F0 of the interferer was either 115 Hz (SAME condition), 9 semitones below the target F0 (LOW condition), 9 semitones above the target F0 (HIGH condition), or an F0 chosen at random between 6 and 12 semitones below the target F0 (RAND condition) in each interval of each trial.</s><s>It is generally accepted that harmonics above the 12th are spectrally unresolved for F0s around 100 Hz <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Houtsma and Smurzynski, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Shackleton and Carlyon, 1994</ref>) so all the harmonics in the target as well as the interferers would be clearly unresolved.</s><s>The level of the interferer was also 50 dB SPL per component (with no roving).</s><s>The interferer was either presented synchronously or asynchronously with the target.</s><s>In the synchronous conditions, the interferer was gated on and off with the target; in the asynchronous conditions, the interferer began 200 ms before the target onset and ended 200 ms after the target offset.</s><s>The interferer was also gated on and off with 10-ms raised-cosine ramps.</s></p><p><s>All stimuli were presented in a background of threshold-equalizing noise (TEN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Moore et al., 2000)</ref> with a level of 40 dB SPL per equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) at 1 kHz (i.e., 10 dB below the nominal level per component of the stimuli).</s><s>For six of the twelve participants, the TEN was simply bandpass filtered between 20 and 12 000 Hz; for the other six participants, spectral notches were introduced in the regions corresponding to the bandpass regions of the target and interferer to improve the audibility of the target while still ensuring that any potential distortion products remained masked.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Procedure</head><p><s>Experiments were administered in a double-walled sound attenuating booth and sounds were presented via HD650 headphones (Sennheiser, Old Lyme, CT).</s><s>These headphones have a frequency response that resembles the average diffuse-field response, as confirmed by measurements with a Bruel &amp; Kjaer artificial ear (model 4153).</s><s>These headphones have been used in previous experiments where stimulus frequencies have been presented (and have been found to be audible) up to 16 kHz at levels of no more than 55 dB <ref type="bibr">SPL per component [e.g., Lau et al.
