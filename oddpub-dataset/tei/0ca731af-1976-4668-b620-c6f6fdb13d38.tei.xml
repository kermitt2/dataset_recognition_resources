<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The main findings of this MADIT-RIT sub-study evaluating the timedependent effects of CRT-D vs. ICD on mortality and ventricular tachyarrhythmias are that there is an early reduction in all-cause mortality with an implanted CRT-D; however, the reduction in VT or VF episodes is delayed and emerging only 6 months after CRT-D implantation.</s><s>This effect is evident after adjustment for relevant clinical covariates in the study.</s><s>These findings imply that even patients with an implanted CRT-D are at substantial risk of VT or VF in the first 6 months after device implantation and should be carefully monitored and treated when seen with VT or VF in the clinic.</s></p><p><s>The MADIT-RIT trial was the first large scale randomized defibrillator study that included conventional ICD and CRT-D devices according to a guideline-based indication and not with the objective to evaluate CRT-D effects in patients with a hypothetical CRT indication.</s><s>This gave us the unique opportunity to evaluate the differences in the risk of all-cause mortality and VT/VF in patients with implanted ICD vs. a CRT-D implant in a 'real life' setting in these different but equally important HF patient sub-populations.</s><s>Our results are, therefore, novel and remarkable because CRT-D indication implies the presence of severe systolic HF and delayed LV electrical activation; the combination of which had to be considered particularly arrhythmogenic and life-threatening in view of previous HF and defibrillator studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>owever, the relative reduction in mortality risk and in the risk of VT/VF in CRT-D vs. ICD patients was similar.</s><s>Interestingly, the mortality advantage was early and sustained over the follow-up period, whereas the favourable prevention of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias was time-dependent and emerged 6 months after device implantation.</s></p><p><s>This association is thought provoking and raises the question, why is there an immediate reduction in death but not in VT/VF?</s><s>It is hard to answer.</s><s>We know from previous studies that there is an immediate   reduction in LV dyssynchrony, mitral regurgitation, and LV contractility after CRT implantation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>However, the structural changes in the myocardium, including the reduction in scar tissue, fibrosis, apoptosis, as well as changes in genomics may develop over time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>We can, therefore, hypothesize that ventricular tachyarrhythmias are more related to the structural changes in the myocardium, 'arrhythmogenic substrate', and less so to the acute changes in haemodynamics.</s><s>In contrast, the early beneficial reduction in all-cause mortality may emerge from the improvement in haemodynamics, an immediate effect after CRT implantation.</s><s>But this needs further investigation.</s><s>We may also hypothesize that the lower risk of VT/VF relates to LV reverse remodelling, which is known to occur predominantly during the first 6 months of CRT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>n the MADIT-II trial, 24% of the patients experienced VT/VF over the mean follow-up period of 17.2 months, a follow-up duration very similar to MADIT-RIT.</s><s>Different causes are likely to have contributed to have only half of the risk of appropriate ICD therapy in MADIT-RIT compared with MADIT-II.</s><s>As previously published, the conservative programming in the high-rate cut-off arm and the delayed therapy arm not only reduced inappropriate ICD therapy, but also significantly reduced appropriate ICD therapy, in particular appropriate ATP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>n addition, improved medical treatment including the frequent use of beta-blockers may have contributed to the lower risk of VT/VF or sudden cardiac death (SCD).</s></p><p><s>However, in line with the recently published data from the MADIT-CRT trial in patients with mild HF <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and a matched pair analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> the present data from the MADIT-RIT trial add more substantial evidence that the treatment of delayed electromechanical ventricular activation by CRT not only lowers mortality from progressive HF, but also lowers the incidence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, that is, however, emerging only 6 months after device implantation.</s><s>It is important to note that there is an equal risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in CRT-D patients in the first 6 months as in ICD patients.</s><s>This highlights the importance of treating VT/VF in CRT-D patients early, and therefore, improve clinical outcome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>It is, however, not known whether patients with VT/VF in the first 6 months may have been CRT non-responders, or whether VT/VF is associated with more frequent hospitalization for HF or death in this particular cohort.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, CRT-D effect on mortality was similar in all programming arms; however, the reduction in VT/VF was most pronounced in the high-rate cut-off VT therapy ICD programming arm, Arm B. We do not have information on LV remodelling in MADIT-RIT, or left bundle branch block (LBBB) status in both ICD and CRT-D patients, and therefore, we do not know if this is in relation with echocardiographic outcomes.</s><s>Another explanation could be that patients in Arm B have less monitored non-treated VT episodes stored in the ICD device due to overwriting.</s><s>Even if this would be the case, monitored non-treated VT's do not seem to affect outcome, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and the pronounced beneficial effects of CRT-D on mortality and VT/VF in Arm B further stresses the everyday clinical implications of a simple one-zone VT therapy programming in patients with primary prevention ICDs.</s></p><p><s>Our study has certain limitations.</s><s>Effects of unmeasured confounders cannot be ruled out with certainty, since CRT-D and ICD treatments were homogeneously distributed, but not randomized in MADIT-RIT.</s><s>We did not collect data on LV reverse remodelling after CRT-D implantation, and the data on LBBB were partial.</s></p><p><s>It is important to note, that despite the significant reduction in death and VT/VF with CRT-D, more than 10% of CRT-D patients still received an appropriate ICD therapy for VT/VF during the 17 months of follow-up and some of them might have actually died without the defibrillator option.</s><s>There are no randomized data appropriately powered available on the prevention of SCD through the defibrillator option in CRT patients when compared with a CRT without a defibrillator. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> However, considering the abovementioned residual crude event rates, we do not uniformly advocate refraining from the defibrillator option in CRT patients, as a nonnegligible number of patients will still carry the risk of SCD.</s><s>Instead, the decision to implant a CRT-P or a CRT-D system must still be made on an individual basis taking into account co-morbidity and the patients' concept on dying.</s></p></div>
