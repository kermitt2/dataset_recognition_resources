hence they are called ''pale cells'' (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2J</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Pale cells were located in the basal endometrial glands in both groups, in between the glandular epithelial cells; they were eccentrically located in most included patients (20 of 21), away from the gland lumen and in close contact with the basement membrane of the glands (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2K</ref>).</s><s>They appeared to be concentrically located and in close proximity to the gland lumen in only 3 patients (2 with and 1 without adenomyosis;
