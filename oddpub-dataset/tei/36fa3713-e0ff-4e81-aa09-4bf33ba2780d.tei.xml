(2015)</ref> to conclude that "the positive coupling of cortisol and testosterone found in previous research is not limited to adolescence" (p.</s><s>85).</s><s>This study, however, did not present any data on adult women or on adults in middle or older adulthood.</s><s>Additionally, they focused on testosterone and cortisol responses to an experimentally-induced social stressor, and this design does not resolve whether coupling between endogenous, naturally occurring changes in testosterone and cortisol would be evident in developmental periods other than adolescence.</s></p><p><s>More generally, the expectation that testosterone and cortisol will be negatively associated in adults may be based on an overly simplistic conceptualization of the relationship between the HPA and HPG axes as purely antagonistic.</s><s>Both testosterone and cortisol follow a predictable diurnal rhythm, with concentrations peaking in the morning and declining through the afternoon and evening <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Matchock et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Smyth et al., 1997)</ref>, and "these parallel circadian changes suggest that the two hormones may routinely serve complementary rather than antagonistic functions under day-to-day conditions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gettler et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Coincident increases in both testosterone and cortisol have been observed in female collegiate (i.e., young adult) athletes following athletic competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Edwards &amp; Casto, 2013)</ref>, in middle-aged men and women following a laboratory social stress test <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lennartsson et al., 2012)</ref>, and in adult male subsistence hunters following a successful kill <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Trumble et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Yet another study found that young men (ages 21-23) who were "mating-oriented" (i.e., neither fathers nor in a pair bonded relationship) were more likely than men who were fathers to have high levels of both cortisol and testosterone <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gettler et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, in a wide variety of non-human species, biologists have observed situations in which activity in the HPG axis is maintained or even increased during periods of intense stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sapolsky, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wingfield &amp; Sapolsky, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>These studies support the perspective that coupled activation of both axes facilitates the ability of an organism -even in adulthood -to respond to adaptive challenges, such as threats to social status <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Turan et al., 2015)</ref> or mating opportunities <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gettler et al., 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Finally, how the relationship between the HPA and HPG axes changes as adults lose reproductive capacity is unknown, as previous research on testosterone-cortisol coupling has focused primarily on adolescents or adults under 50.</s><s>For organisms nearing the end of their reproductive lifespan, it would be adaptive to maintain reproductive functions even in the face of acute stress, as an opportunity deferred is potentially an opportunity lost forever <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Wingfield &amp; Sapolsky, 2003)</ref>.</s><s>However, for older adults who are unable or very unlikely to have any further offspring, co-elevated cortisol and testosterone may no longer be functional.</s><s>In addition, unlike in the early lifespan when the HPA and HPG axes follow parallel trends (i.e., fetal activity, childhood quiescence, adolescent reactivation), developmental trends seem to diverge in older adulthood, when levels of gonadal hormones decrease but cortisol reactivity increases.</s><s>These lines of evidence suggest that perhaps the biggest developmental shifts in testosterone-coupling occur after mid-life, rather than after adolescence.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Goals of the Current Study</head><p><s>The current study presents results of the first investigation to use a lifespan sample to examine potential age-related differences in the sign and strength of within-person testosterone-cortisol coupling.</s><s>Over the course of two days, adolescents and adults, ages 11 to 88 years, provided six salivary hormone samples (each day at waking, 30 minutes after waking, and in the evening).</s><s>Samples were taken at home to assess awakening responses and naturally fluctuating hormone concentrations in daily life.</s><s>Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling to account for the nested data structure (hormonal assessments nested within persons).</s><s>In particular, we tested the developmental hypothesis that adolescents would demonstrate positive testosterone-cortisol coupling, whereas adults would demonstrate no coupling or negative coupling.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants and Procedure</head><p><s>Participants were part of the longitudinal Multi-Method Ambulatory Assessment project (MMAA, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Riediger et al., 2009)</ref>, which was designed to study affective and motivational processes in daily life.</s><s>A fieldwork agency (TNS Infratest) recruited participants from three metropolitan German regions (Berlin, Duesseldorf, and Munich) based on predefined criteria to stratify the sample regarding age, gender, and educational level, and to ensure the independence of the participants (i.e., prohibiting members of the same family to take part in the study).</s><s>The Ethics Committee of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development approved the study.</s></p><p><s>2.1.1.</s><s>Hormonal Measurements-Hormone data were collected during the 2010 wave of the MMAA project.</s><s>Given the original project design and aims, there were pragmatic constraints on how much hormonal data could be collected, and only testosterone and cortisol were measured.</s><s>Participants were instructed to drool passively through a straw into a plastic tube at three times of day: immediately upon waking up, 30 minutes after awakening, and at 1930 h.</s><s>Test tubes were color and time-coded.</s><s>Furthermore, they were told to avoid eating, drinking (anything accept water), smoking, and brushing their teeth 30 minutes before taking the saliva samples and to write down the time and occurrence of any deviations in instructions (e.g., taking sample late).</s><s>Samples were kept at ambient temperature at home.</s><s>On the day after sample collection was completed, participants sent all six saliva samples directly to the assay laboratory (Labor Krohne, Bad Salzuflen, Germany) using a pre-paid envelope. 1</s><s>At the end of the study, participants received a reimbursement of 10 € or 25 € (approximately US$12 and US$30 in 2010 dollars) if they provided complete samples for one or both days, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Samples were frozen at the laboratory at −20 °C prior to testing.</s><s>For testing, samples were thawed and then mixed and centrifuged 10 min at 2000-3000 x g to remove particulate material.</s><s>Hormone concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</s><s>The reportable ranges of hormonal concentrations using this method were 0.015 -4.0 μg/dL for cortisol and 2 -760 pg/mL for testosterone.</s><s>The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 4.2% and 9.3% respectively for cortisol, and 6.9% and 12.3% for testosterone.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">Participant</head><p><s>Characteristics-Of the 400 targeted individuals, n = 319 provided at least 1 saliva sample, and 293 (92% of participating individuals) had complete data for cortisol and testosterone at all 6 occasions.</s><s>In a few cases, participants did not provide enough saliva for both hormones to be assayed, resulting in i = 1887 usable cortisol values and i = 1871 testosterone values.</s><s>Individuals and samples were excluded from subsequent analyses because of pregnancy or lactation, night shift work, very early or late waking times, or failure to adhere to instructions regarding when to provide the samples (see Supplement for more information).</s><s>The final analytic data set, therefore, used 1644 cortisol samples and 1629 testosterone samples from 292 people who were sampled on 561 days.</s></p><p><s>In the final analytic sample, age ranged from 11 to 88 years (median = 36.5 years).</s><s>Participants were approximately equally distributed across four age groups (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> in Supplement for histogram of age distribution): (1) adolescents, ages 11-19, which is the typical age range in which average circulating levels of both cortisol and testosterone are still increasing (n = 37 males, 39 females) 2 ; (2) younger adults, ages 20-39, which is often considered the peak reproductive years 3 (n = 33 males, 37 females); (3) middle-aged adults, ages 40-59, who have largely finished reproducing (n = 27 males, 48 females); and (4) older adults, age 60 to 88, who are past their reproductive years (n = 32 males, 39 females).</s></p><p><s>Twenty-one percent of the sample (n = 62, all adolescents) were still in secondary school.</s><s>Of the remaining participants who had completed or left secondary school, 35% had received their Abitur, the high school graduation certificate that permits admission to university (44% of younger adults, 32% of middle-aged adults, and 33% of older adults).</s></p><p><s>Three female participants were excluded because they were pregnant or lactating.</s><s>Of the remaining n = 163 female participants, n = 11 (7%) did not respond to questionnaire items regarding menstrual cycle.</s><s>Of the females with non-missing data, n = 5 (3%) reported that they were pre-menarcheal; n = 51 (31%) reported that they were experiencing regular menstrual cycles and not using hormonal contraceptives; n = 53 (33%) reported that they had ceased menstruating for at least 3 months due to menopause 4 ; n = 43 (26%) reported they were using oral contraceptives or were not experiencing a normal menstrual cycle for another reason.</s></p><p><s>Participants reported whether they had recently had any illness or flu, had a chronic disease, currently took any type of medication, or had any inflammation or irritation in their mouths.</s><s>Over half of the sample (n = 151, 52%) reported at least one of these things, as might be expected from a community sample that includes substantial numbers of middle-aged and older adults.</s><s>The remaining n = 141 participants will be referred to below as the very healthy sub-sample and comprised 49 adolescents [64% of total adolescent sample], 43 younger adults [61% of total], 35 middle-aged adults [47% of total], and 14 older adults [20% of total]).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Limitations</head><p><s>Results must be interpreted in light of four limitations.</s><s>First, in order to capture naturally occurring hormonal changes over the course of the day, we used an in-home collection protocol that required participants to note when they collected their saliva samples and to send samples directly to the lab.</s><s>Previous studies have found participants' self-reports of when they provided at-home saliva samples correspond highly (rs ≥ .75)</s><s>with electronically recorded times <ref type="bibr">(Karlamanga et al., 2013)</ref>, although one can never be perfectly confident that participants followed instructions or reported their compliance honestly.</s><s>However, these participants were part of a larger, on-going study that involved multiple ambulatory assessments of mood and cognition (via cellphone) on several days over the course of three weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Riediger et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wrzus et al., 2016)</ref>, and they, therefore, have an established record of being motivated participants who were accustomed to following instructions.</s><s>Additionally, the endocrine data show expected diurnal patterns (cortisol awakening response, decline from morning to evening), which is evidence for their validity and reliability.</s></p><p><s>Second, this study did not involve adequate numbers of young adolescents for us to examine how coupling between testosterone and cortisol may change over the course of pubertal development.</s><s>Although the sample ranged in age from 11 to 88, only 23 participants were under the age of 15, the average age at which boys and girls reach Tanner stage 5 <ref type="bibr">(Hollensteen &amp; Lougheed, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>That is, there was minimal variation in pubertal status for the vast majority of our participants, and participants were not young enough to capture the first hormonal changes of puberty (i.e., adrenarche).</s><s>Future research that focuses on 6-to 16year-olds would be informative regarding the contribution of pubertal development, rather than age per se, to testosterone-cortisol coupling.</s><s>More generally, a larger sample would increase power to detect age-related differences in coupling, particularly non-linear age associations.</s></p><p><s>Third, the only output of the HPG axis that was measured in this study was testosterone; we do not have information on other gonadal hormones, including estradiol or progesterone.</s><s>Coupling between estradiol and cortisol would be particularly interesting to examine in future research.</s><s>Just as testosterone, which is typically considered a "male" hormone, is consequential for females, estradiol, which is typically considered a "female" hormone, is consequential for males <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(de Ronde et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>In fact, many of testosterone's effects in the brain and body occur via its aromatization to estradiol <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(de Ronde et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Research with adolescents has found that high levels of estradiol are associated with higher levels of externalizing behavior problems only among youth who are also low in cortisol <ref type="bibr">(Tackett et al., 2015)</ref>, a finding that mirrors results from previous studies of testosterone × cortisol interactions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mehta &amp; Josephs, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Tackett et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Some studies of cortisol reactivity to standardized acute stress have found evidence that estradiol dampens cortisol reactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Juster et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kajantie &amp; Phillips, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kirschbaum et al., 1992</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kirschbaum et al., , 1995))</ref>, whereas another study found no association between baseline estradiol and cortisol reactivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Stephens et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, estradiol was positively correlated with diurnal change in cortisol (specifically, the cortisol awakening response) among women experiencing a menstrual cycle, but not among men <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Juster et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>Overall, coupling between cortisol and other outputs of the HPG axis remain to be clarified.</s></p><p><s>Finally, although we controlled for major error sources in hormonal data (e.g., time, pregnancy, illnesses, shift work), the current analysis does not include further potentially relevant covariates, including menstrual cycle phase or irregularities for menstruating females, relationship status, physical exercise, sexual activity, sleep, acute or chronic stress, and diet and nutrition.</s><s>Moreover, information about whether the participant was menstruating at all was missing for 7% of women.</s><s>Any of these could contribute to the positive coupling observed between testosterone and cortisol, and considering these specific mechanisms as explanations for the current results seem to be important directions for future investigations.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Conclusions</head><p><s>Although the average within-person correlation between cortisol and testosterone was positive, there were inter-individual differences in the strength of this correlation, and the distribution of within-person correlations indicated that testosterone and cortisol were negatively correlated in a minority of individuals.</s><s>Identifying the biological and social sources, and the behavioral and/or experiential implications, of such individual differences in intra-individual coupling between the HPA and HPG axes is an interesting topic for future research.</s><s>For example, early life stress might affect the pattern of testosterone and cortisol coupling over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Ruttle et al., 2015)</ref>, as well as the magnitude of this relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dismukes et al., 2015b)</ref>.</s><s>Overall, these results add to a growing body of literature calling for a more nuanced understanding of the HPA-HPG relationship that considers species, social context, individual differences, and source of variation (inter-individual versus intraindividual, exogenous versus endogenous, acute versus chronic).</s></p></div>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">See the Supplement (TableS2) for more information about variation in pubertal development among adolescents. 3 The mean age at first birth in Germany is 29.2 years. Less than 3% of live births in Germany are to mothers ages 40 or older; 93.5% of births are to women ages 20 to 39(Eurostat, 2015). 4 The criterion for menopause is often given as one year without a menstrual period, so this measure may overestimate the number of women who are menopausal. However, the median age of women in this group was 62.5 years, and over 90% of women in this group were older than 52 years old. For comparison, previous research has found that 75% of women reach menopause by age 52.4 years, and 95% of women by 54.7 years<ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Weinstein et al., 2003)</ref>. Given their age, we are thus reasonably confident that these women had actually ceased menstruating due to menopause.</note>
