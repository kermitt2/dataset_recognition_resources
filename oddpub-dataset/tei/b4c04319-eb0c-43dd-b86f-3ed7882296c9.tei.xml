properties.</s><s>However, CSPG4 expression in metastases was not significantly higher as compared to primary melanoma.</s><s>Although CD271 expression may facilitate melanoma cell migration, CD271 knock-down cells (BRAF wild type) retained a residual migratory capacity, suggesting that additional, CD271-independent factors determine melanoma cell migration.</s><s>Since FGF13, CSPG4 and HMGA2 were not among the top up-regulated genes in the CD271 high subset of brain metastases, these factors may not be involved in melanoma brain metastasis.</s></p><p><s>The exploration of solitary and multiple brain metastases clearly demonstrated that CD271 + cells colonize and disseminate within the brain and are supposedly involved in distant and intracerebral metastasis.</s><s>We observed that CD271 high BM showed a mutually exclusive expression of CD271 and MITF, hence a MITF low phenotype.</s><s>This was further supported by the finding that MITF-target genes were decreased in CD271 high
