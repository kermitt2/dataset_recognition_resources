<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this study, we introduced a novel multiplexed SCODA mutation detection platform that identifies ctDNA in patient plasma with high sensitivity and specificity.</s><s>Application of this assay in an exploratory analysis of CRC patients revealed lower rates of ctDNA detection in plasma from non-metastatic patients, despite the analytical capabilities of our assay, suggesting a biological cause.</s><s>By contrast, the assay reliably detected ctDNA in the plasma of patients with metastatic disease, and longitudinal assessments in metastatic patients undergoing surgical resection and chemotherapy provide a rationale for prognostic and tumor monitoring applications, which warrant further study in this patient population.</s></p><p><s>In some clinical settings, the measurement of plasma ctDNA can be very challenging due to the low level of signal and the high background level of circulating wildtype DNA.</s><s>Through enrichment of mutant alleles, the SCODA method effectively removes background wildtype DNA, leading to a reduction in the false-positive rate and ultimately enabling detection of as little as single copies of mutant DNA.</s><s>As such, this method is extremely sensitive (with a limit of detection as low as 0.001%) that meets -and in some cases exceeds -what has previously been reported for droplet digital PCR, BEAMing, and next generation sequencing approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, this level of sensitivity and specificity is achieved without previous knowledge of each patient's tumor mutation profile from tissue, which, together with multiplexed assessment of a large and expandable panel of defined mutations, should readily enable generalized application without patient-specific assay development, as is required for other methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several groups have studied ctDNA in nonmetastatic and metastatic CRC patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Our observed concordance of 54% between tissue and plasma mutations in non-metastatic patients is consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s>Bettegowda et al. used a combination of methods, including BEAMing and SafeSeq <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, to show that 49-78% of patients with localized disease had detectable ctDNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Lecomte et al.</ref> found that 63% of a group of stage I, II and III CRC patients had ctDNA detectable by mutant allele-specific amplification directed against KRAS and methylationspecific PCR for p16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Based on the technical performance of our assay, the absence of detectable ctDNA signal in the plasma of the early-stage patients appears to be likely related to differences in tumor burden, anatomy, or biology, rather than inadequate analytical sensitivity.</s><s>Similar considerations have been described for circulating tumor cells, which are also much less abundant in early stage disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.
