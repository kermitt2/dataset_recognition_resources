<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Endpoints</head><p><s>The primary endpoint was the effect of the two treatments (placebo vs active compound) on the score obtained at the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.</s><s>Secondary endpoints were the effects on other neuropsychological tests, arterial stiffness, as evaluated by SphygmoCor technology, and metabolic parameters.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>Based on preliminary data and previous studies assessing the impact of hypertension on cognitive functions, we hypothesized that 50% of patients treated with the nutraceutical preparation would experience an increase of at least one equivalent score (ES) of MoCA test (primary endpoint) with respect to 10% of subjects assuming placebo.</s></p><p><s>On this assumption, a sample size of 17 subjects in each group would have provided a power of 80% with a two-tailed α-error of 5%.</s><s>In addition, expecting a dropout rate of about 5%, due to the documented good tolerability of nutraceutical therapies, the total number of patients enrolled was of 36 (18 in each group).</s><s>Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 22.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) and expressed as number and percentages or means ± SD.</s><s>Differences between the two groups at baseline were evaluated by independent sample t-test or chi-square test, as appropriate.</s><s>A general linear model (GLM) for repeated measures with correction for treatment was performed to evaluate the treatment effect in both groups.</s><s>Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess correlations between changes in clinical variables and changes in neuropsychological tests.</s><s>For all tests, a p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>All the 36 patients enrolled completed the entire protocol of the study.</s><s>Patients included in the study were predominantly males (75%) with a mean age of 58.1 ± 7.2 years, mean body mass index of 26.9 ± 3.0, mean SBP of 134.4 ± 15.1, and mean DBP of 85.0 ± 10.7 mmHg.</s><s>At baseline, the patients of the two arms were comparable for all clinical and metabolic characteristics, arterial stiffness, and neuropsychological evaluation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Also antihypertensive treatments were not different between the two study arms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>After 6 months, patients were subjected to the assessment of the same clinical and biochemical variables, as well as the cognitive profile.</s><s>All the variables resulted unchanged in both placebo and active treatment groups, with respect to the baseline condition (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), with the exception of AI which was significantly reduced in patients receiving the active nutraceutical compound (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>When tested for the cognitive functions, the hypertensive patients in the active treatment group performed significantly better test than the placebo group, as compared to the baseline condition (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>In particular, there was a significant improvement in the performance obtained at the MoCA test and Word Match Testing (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) for patients receiving the nutraceutical active compound.</s><s>With a trend toward significance, the same group of hypertensive patients executed the Stroop test with improved scores, whereas no variation was observed for patients receiving the placebo.</s><s>The psychometric assessment with the EQ-VAS scale revealed a significant amelioration in the active treatment group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) but not in the control group receiving placebo (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</s><s>When we analyzed the potential correlations between changes of clinical and biochemical parameters with changes in neuropsychological scores obtained in the active treatment group, a positive relationship between SBP variation (from baseline to 6 months values) and EQ-VAS change was observed (r = 0.554, p = 0.017, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present randomized, double blind, placebocontrolled study demonstrated that a 6-month treatment with the novel nutraceutical preparation (AkP05, IzzeK®), containing dry plant extracts of Bacopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba and Green tea, plus Phosphatidylserine and Catechins, significantly improved the cognitive performance at MoCA test, Word Match Testing, Stroop test, and EQ-VAS, in a population of hypertensive patients on satisfactory blood pressure control.</s><s>In contrast, the hypertensive patients treated with the placebo composition, had no significant modification in the scores obtained at the various cognitive tests.</s><s>Thus, the improvement observed in patients treated with the active nutraceutical preparation could be ascribed to positive effects Values are means ± standard deviation SBP = systolic blood pressure; DBP = diastolic blood pressure; HDL = high-density lipoprotein; LDL = low-density lipoprotein a = active treatment versus placebo, GLM analysis  on cognitive performance, ruling out the possibility of a placebo effect or potential habituation effects in performing the tests.</s><s>In addition, hypertensive patients on active nutraceutical treatment displayed a significant improvement of arterial stiffness, as assessed by AI.</s><s>In this study, cognitive function was assessed accordingly to the most common measures used in general studies testing the impact of hypertension on cerebrovascular homeostasis.</s><s>Basically, we tested how the nutraceutical compound under examination affected the most typically impaired cognitive domains of memory, executive function, and processing speed.</s><s>The results obtained at the MoCA test after 6-months of treatment (active compound vs placebo), showed a significant improvement in the group of hypertensive patients receiving the nutraceutical preparation and no variation in the placebo group.</s><s>Taking into consideration the fact that the battery of MoCA tests comprises a series of assessments capable to discriminate among different cognitive domains (memory and attention, visuospatial and executive functions, and language), we also evaluated more specific subdomains of cognition.</s><s>Word-matching test highlighted a similar significant trend of improved learning abilities of the memory domain in patients receiving the active nutraceutical compound as compared to the placebo.</s><s>The better performance in executive functions and processing speed was also confirmed when patients were subjected to the Stroop test, which showed enhanced functions in patients on active nutraceutical preparation.</s><s>Lastly, the significantly increased score obtained in the VAS scale, indicative of patients' awareness on their health status, was also suggestive that the benefit obtained with the 6months treatment with the active nutraceutical compound was positively perceived by patients themselves.</s></p><p><s>Although several mechanisms may be involved in the improved overall cognitive function displayed by hypertensive patients treated with the nutraceutical compound, it could be envisaged that the concomitant reduction in arterial stiffness may be causally related.</s><s>In fact, at the clinical level, indexes of aortic and large-artery stiffening are considered valuable predictors of cerebrovascular events and VCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, we observed that a 6months treatment with the active nutraceutical compound induced a significant reduction in the AI, a parameter correlated with arterial stiffness.</s><s>No significant variation of the AI was found in the group of patients receiving the placebo for 6 months.</s><s>Although we failed to detect significant correlations between the changes in AI and any of the measured cognitive parameters, we could speculate that the improvement in arterial stiffness positively influenced cerebral circulation, eventually enhancing cognitive functions.</s><s>Chronic hypertension is also accompanied with hypertrophic remodeling of cerebral arteries and arterioles, a phenomenon well described in experimental models of hypertension and supported by evidence in patients.</s><s>A critical aspect regarding cerebral circulation at the level of smaller arterioles consists in the disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), often leading to a potent inflammatory reaction, typically associated with the production of reactive oxygen species.</s><s>A trait that can be commonly found in all the phenomena described above (hypertension, arterial stiffness, VCI and arterial stiffness) is the presence of a chronic low-grade inflammation, a process thought to contribute to pathogenesis of several diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>Several experimental evidence suggests that the use of nutraceutical compounds can be effective in hampering cognitive decline in experimental models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the possibility that hypertension could influence onset/progression of late-life dementia/ sporadic AD by promoting neuroinflammatory processes through an increase in oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, accounts for the use of nutritional supplements with antioxidant action to counteract the development of cognitive decline in hypertensive patients.</s><s>The nutraceutical preparation tested in the present study contains different molecules with potent antioxidant properties which, although with mixed results, have shown to have positive effects on cognitive function also in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>The potential to counteract cognitive decline in hypertensive patients is of utmost importance.</s><s>Although some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> have shown little benefit from using antioxidant or anti-hypertensive drugs, they are often generally not well accepted as long-term preventive tools by the general population.</s><s>By contrast, the use of dietary supplements and nutraceutical preparations is becoming more common and widespread, since they are often seen as a useful tool, associated with a healthy lifestyle, to deal with health problems that inevitably arise over time, in the presence of predisposing risk factors.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we demonstrated that the therapy with a novel nutraceutical preparation (AkP05, IzzeK®) containing Bacopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba, Phosphatidylserine, Green tea and Catechins is able to significantly increase the scores of important neuropsychological tests such as the MoCA battery of tests, the Word Match Testing and Stroop test.</s><s>The positive variation in the EQ-VAS was also suggestive that patients increased their perception of a better health status.</s><s>The fact that an enhancement of performance in specific cognitive domain was obtained in patients already on satisfactory control of blood pressure levels, could reflect that the effect was exerted at the level of target organ damage, probably supporting cerebrovascular function by reducing oxidative stress at the level of brain microcirculation.</s><s>Future pharmacological and pathophysiological studies are needed to better clarify the mechanisms underlying this effect.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Augmentation index at baseline and after 6 months in the active treated group.</s><s>* p = 0.028 for treatment effect (active treatment vs. placebo), GLM analysis</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,314.19,94.85,214.99,137.37" type="bitmap" /></figure>
