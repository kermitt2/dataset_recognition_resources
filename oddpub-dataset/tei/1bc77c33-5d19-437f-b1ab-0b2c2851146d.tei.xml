<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>inTrODUcTiOn</head><p><s>In recent years, a steady increase in research addressing the phenotype and function of marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has been observed.</s><s>MAT is present in the bone marrow of all mammals and paradoxically its volume increases during both skeletal growth, which is associated with bone acquisition and sexual development, and aging, which is associated with bone loss and decline in gonadal activity.</s><s>MAT can accumulate in the bone cavity in response to a variety of cues including hormonal (e.g., estrogen, parathyroid hormone), environmental (e.g., overnutrition, malnutrition, ambient temperature), and pharmacological (e.g., TZD and glucocorticoid therapies) [reviewed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>].</s></p><p><s>In healthy human adults, MAT constitutes up to 10% of total adipose tissues which translates to approximately 1 kg of mass.</s><s>There is a significant difference in the volume, distribution, and appearance of marrow adipocytes between species.</s><s>In humans, adipocytes represent up to 45% of cellular components in hematopoietic or red marrow, and up to 90% of adipocyte-rich yellow marrow.</s><s>The yellow marrow gradually repopulates the marrow cavity of long bone during skeletal maturation and involution of hematopoietic marrow, and almost completely fills the cavity in the third decade of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>Marrow adipocytes in humans start to be visible in extremities (phalanges) of newborns and their postnatal accumulation is associated with a regression of hematopoiesis in these skeletal sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s>The accumulation of MAT in humans progresses continuously during growth and aging in direction from appendicular to axial skeleton, and within the long bone from diaphysis to metaphysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to humans, murine MAT accumulates in the direction from metaphysis toward diaphysis.</s><s>MAT is present in distal tibia of C57BL/6 mice at very early age, but in proximal tibia it become visible with skeletal maturation which occurs around 3 months of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It has been recently shown that MAT located in proximal tibia (pMAT) differs from MAT located in the distal part (dMAT) with regard to fatty acids composition and response to low temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>The dMAT has higher fraction of unsaturated fatty acids when compared with pMAT, which may suggest different metabolic function of these two MAT depots.</s><s>Moreover, pMAT, but not dMAT, responds to the cold exposure with decreasing in volume.</s><s>On the other hand, caloric restriction increases MAT volume predominantly in proximal but not in distal location <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>The differences between these two MAT depots may be attributed to the heterogeneity of marrow adipocytes with respect to their origin and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One of the unique features of MAT is that it is simultaneously involved in the regulation of energy metabolism and bone homeostasis which may, at least in part, explain skeletal response to pathologic changes in energy balance (e.g., obesity, diabetes, caloric restriction, anorexia nervosa).</s><s>MAT role in the regulation of energy balance comprises production of insulin sensitizing adiponectin at the levels that significantly contribute to the circulating pools of this adipokine especially in conditions of decreased peripheral fat mass due to either caloric restriction or anorexia nervosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, MAT futile metabolic phenotype correlates positively with bone health and negatively with bone loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>BAT-like (energy production and dissipation) characteristics of MAT are compromised with diabetes and aging despite significant MAT expansion in the bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>This supports a notion that there is a relationship between MAT metabolic profile and bone health.</s><s>Indeed, marrow adipocytes have a capacity for conversion to beige-like phenotype either upon expression of specific transcriptional regulators, e.g., FoxC2 transcription factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, or as a result of manipulation with PPARγ transcriptional activity by either pharmacological use of selective agonists such as telmisartan <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, or by manipulation with PP5 phosphatase activity which controls PPARγ protein phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Increase in the expression of beige fat markers in bone marrow MSCs was associated with increased expression of bone anabolic factors including Wnt10b, IGFBP2, and BMP4, and secretion to the growth media of pro-osteoblastic activities as assessed in co-cultture experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, conversion of AD2 cells, representing marrow adipocyte cell line, to beige phenotype by either overexpression of FoxC2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> or by shRNA knockdown of PP5 ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) was associated with secretion of similar pro-osteoblastic activities strongly supporting the hypothesis that MAT with beige phenotype may possess beneficial for bone endocrine/paracrine activities.</s></p><p><s>Extramedullar adipose tissue serves several functions: it may store energy, it may dissipate energy, and it may regulate glucose metabolism in the endocrine manner.</s><s>Fat tissue is categorized as of white (WAT), brown (BAT), or beige/brite phenotype which represent energy storing, dissipating, or both activities, respectively.</s><s>The functional distinctions between different types of fat are reflected in a profile of expression of specific gene markers.</s><s>With an exception of Zic1 which is specifically expressed only in BAT, and Tcf21 which is specifically expressed in WAT, the phenotype-specific expression of other markers is determined based on the relative levels, when compared with other fat types, and in combination with other markers.</s><s>For example, Ucp1 coding for uncoupling protein 1 is relatively high in BAT, low in WAT, but it can be induced in beige fat to the levels comparable in BAT and in beige fat it is associated with an increased expression of Hoxc9, Prdm16, Tmem26, Dio2, and/or Tbx1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>As of now, MAT has not been characterized neither for its phenotype, nor function, nor profile of gene biomarkers expression.</s></p><p><s>Sex steroids are essential for adolescent bone growth and the maintenance of bone mass in adulthood.</s><s>Postmenopausal bone loss or bone loss after removal of ovaries are the best examples of estrogen importance for bone metabolism in females.</s><s>However, bone homeostasis in men also depends on estrogen, as mutations in the estrogen receptor or the aromatase affect maturation of skeleton and correlate with low bone mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, removal of testes or low levels of testosterone in men with hypogonadism result in low bone mass, whereas high levels of circulating androgens in women with polycystic ovary syndrome correlate with high bone mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Both estrogens and androgens regulate body composition and ultimately energy metabolism.</s><s>Postmenopausal decrease in ovary function is associated with accumulation of WAT, especially in visceral location.</s><s>On the cellular level, WAT expansion occurs due to an increased lipogenesis in adipocytes, the process which can be reverted by estrogen supplementation, indicating that lipogenesis and the associated gene expression are under the negative control of estrogen [reviewed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>].</s><s>On the molecular level, it has been shown that estrogen receptor and pro-adipocytic transcription factor and nuclear receptor PPARγ compete for the same steroid receptor coactivator Src-2, thus explaining at least in part their opposite activity in regards to adipocyte differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, testosterone may either control lipolysis or lipogenesis in a depot-specific manner [reviewed in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>].</s><s>In subcutaneous WAT of males and females, testosterone decreases lipolysis regulated by catecholamine, whereas in vitro testosterone decreases adipogenesis and adipocyte-specific gene expression.</s><s>With respect to bone, there is a positive correlation between MAT accumulation in both appendicular and axial skeleton and postmenopausal bone loss and increased fractures <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, MAT volume decreases with estrogen replacement therapy giving a strong indication that MAT similarly as visceral WAT is under a negative control of estrogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>With respect to androgens however, there are no available systematic studies for the correlation between their levels and MAT volume.</s></p><p><s>In this manuscript, which is a part of a special issue on bone being an endocrine target and organ, we present studies on the correlation of MAT phenotype and bone mass, and MAT responsiveness to the sex steroids deficiency in males and females.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DiscUssiOn</head><p><s>The presented studies are a continuation of characterization of MAT activities in physiological and pathological conditions.</s><s>They have been designed based on previous observations that MAT is characterized by significant plasticity, and that its metabolic profile follows changes in systemic energy metabolism in conditions of aging and diabetes, and that MAT of beige characteristics secretes bone anabolic activities which may support bone remodeling in endocrine/paracrine manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>.</s><s>Here, we extended our analysis by comparing MAT phenotype-specific gene markers profile in different locations within tibia bone and with respect to the presence of sex steroids in males and females.</s><s>We used MAT of tibia bone as a model because of its unique distribution which correlates with the presence and the absence of bone remodeling process.</s></p><p><s>First, we have showed that pMAT, which is juxtaposed to the remodeling bone, consists of adipocytes dispersed between trabeculae.</s><s>In contrast, MAT in distal tibia, where bone remodeling is practically absent, consists of densely packed osmium tetroxide-stained adipocytes occupying entire marrow cavity and being in physical contact with the endosteal bone surface.</s><s>This distribution correlated with the profile of gene markers expression which appeared to be more beige-like in proximal when compared with the distal location.</s><s>In this case, we have applied expression patterns of gene markers previously identified as specific for either white, or brown, or beige adipocytes in peripheral fat depots <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Our studies represent first attempt to apply biomarkers identified in peripheral adipocytes for phenotyping bone marrow adipocytes.</s><s>We have showed, that MAT does not express BAT-exclusive Zic1 marker, and WAT-exclusive Tcf21 marker, and beige-specific Tmem26 marker, suggesting different phenotype of marrow adipocytes from peripheral adipocytes.</s><s>Moreover and as we showed previously, the expression of Ucp1, although detectable, is relatively low when compared with other fat depot <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, as well as expression of Hoxc9, indicating that marrow adipocytes differ from classical brown and beige adipocytes (not showed).</s><s>At the same time, the expression of other brown/ beige markers, such as Prdm16, Tbx1, and Dio2, was at the relatively high levels and showed differential regulation in pMAT vs dMAT, and in males vs females.</s></p><p><s>Second, we showed that high BV/TV correlates inversely with MAT volume in the same locations in a sex-specific manner.</s><s>In age-matched 4-month old C57BL/6 mice, pMAT volume was 10-fold lower while BV/TV was 50% higher in males vs females.</s><s>Interestingly, dMAT volume, as well as CtTh measured in close proximity to dMAT, did not differ between sexes.</s><s>However, pMAT volume correlated inversely not only with BV/TV, but also with relative increase in the expression of beige fat markers.</s><s>This together with our previous observation that marrow adipocytes of beige phenotype secrete bone anabolic factors support attractive hypothesis that the metabolic profile of MAT contributes to the regulation of bone mass, and by proxy, that MAT can be a therapeutic target to increase bone mass.</s></p><p><s>Third, we have tested whether MAT volume and its phenotype are under gonadal control.</s><s>To this end, we have showed that MAT volume is under a negative control of ovary hormones.</s><s>In the absence of ovaries, MAT volume was significantly increased in both proximal and distal location.</s><s>We attributed the expansion of pMAT rather to de novo differentiation of adipocyte progenitors, as indicated by increased expression of Fabp4 and Adip, than increase in volume of already existing adipocytes which may constitute a characteristic response of dMAT and gWAT to estrogen deficiency.</s><s>Indeed, this would be consistent with previous observation that peripheral fat depots respond to the absence of estrogen with increased lipogenesis but not adipocyte differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>However, it can be debated whether relative decrease in beige markers expression in pMAT suggests a direct effect of estrogen on beige adipocyte phenotype or a relative decrease of beige adipocyte fraction as a result of increased fraction of newly differentiated white-type adipocytes.</s><s>Solving these possibilities requires further investigation.</s><s>In contrast, a loss of testes led to a loss of peripheral WAT and BAT mass, but did not affect and even modestly increased MAT volume suggesting that MAT, unlike peripheral fat, is rather resistant to the effects of androgens deficiency.</s></p><p><s>Most importantly, we did not observe in both models that bone loss due to the absence of gonadal hormones is coupled to MAT expansion in the same location.</s><s>Thus, it is possible that the targets and mechanisms by which sex steroids control bone  mass are different from those which control MAT expansion leading to the conclusion that unlike in other models, e.g., aging, diabetes, or treatment with antidiabetic TZDs, MAT may not play a significant role in the bone loss and its expansion is merely a byproduct of sex steroids deficiency.</s><s>However, MAT expansion and changes in the metabolic profile toward lipid accumulation and away from lipid utilization may contribute to bone loss via increased lipotoxicity and increased pro-inflammatory signaling in the marrow environment.</s><s>Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that MAT contains a population of PTHr1-positive adipocytes which have a capacity to secrete RANKL cytokine <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Perhaps, it is provocative at this point to hypothesize that sex steroids deficiency increases pool of RANKL producing adipocytes which may significantly contribute to the increased bone resorption and bone loss.</s><s>Such possibility requires further testing.</s></p><p><s>The presented studies carry certain limitations and caution should be applied in the interpretation of the results.</s><s>The analysis of gene markers was conducted using RNA isolated from either proximal or distal half of tibia.</s><s>These isolates, especially from proximal tibia, were characterized with high cellular heterogeneity and our results required normalization to the expression of adipocyte-specific gene markers Fabp4 and Adip, whose expression we assumed was relatively similar in pMAT and dMAT adipocytes.</s><s>Such experimental design was applied previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> and also chosen for these studies because a very limited quantity of adipocytes in the murine proximal tibia prohibits isolation of adipocyte fraction suitable for analysis.</s><s>Moreover, not all cells of adipocyte lineage with endocrine activity contain lipid droplets.</s><s>We consider this as a limitation of our studies which results should be interpreted rather as a relative comparison.</s><s>Recently, significant advances have been made in characterization of marrow adipocyte lineage, which appears to be closely related to the osteoblast lineage based on an expression of osteoblast gene markers such as Osterix and Prx1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>.</s><s>We believe, that these findings will result in a development of reliable method of marrow adipocyte identification and with a specific lineage tracing we will be able to follow changes in their phenotype in physiological and pathological conditions.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, MAT is a heterogeneous tissue which may play different functions in bone depending on its location and metabolic phenotype.</s><s>This heterogeneity suggest that MAT may play a role in regulation of bone remodeling and may contribute either beneficially to the maintenance of bone homeostasis, e.g., in "healthy" conditions it may support bone remodeling by providing energy and perhaps bone anabolic cytokines, or negatively in conditions of "unbalanced" bone remodeling, e.g., during aging which skews marrow mesenchymal cells toward adipocyte and at the expense of osteoblast differentiation.</s><s>However, our studies argue against direct association between the mechanisms by which sex steroids control MAT expansion and bone mass, although indirect effect on modulation of marrow environment is not excluded.</s><s>Moreover, these studies emphasize MAT uniqueness, when compared with peripheral fat depots, in respect to gene markers expression and response to hormonal control by sex steroids.</s></p></div>
