<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Since 30 years chronic infection with HBV leading to liver cirrhosis has been linked epidemiologically to the development of HCC.</s><s>Although several mechanisms of a direct and indirect hepatocarcinogenic role of HBV have been hypothesized, the precise ways by which HBV infection triggers HCC is not completely known and a wide understanding of HBV infection effects is needed.</s></p><p><s>HBV is a member of the Hepadnaviridae family, with a small circular partially double stranded DNA genome, containing four overlapping open reading frames encoding for the core protein, forming the viral capsid, for the small (SHBs), medium (MHBs) and large (LHBs) envelope proteins, forming subviral particles, for the viral polymerase and for the protein HBx <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies demonstrated a strong connection between the transcriptional activator HBx, able to trans-activate the expression of numerous cellular and viral genes, and liver cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the excessive production and accumulation of the HBV envelope proteins, or truncated forms of the MHBs and LHBs proteins, have been ascribed to have oncogenic potential, increasing cell proliferation and strong ER stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>It is known since long time that liver of people with chronic HBV infection frequently contains individual hepatocytes with accumulated LHBs, causing the formation of so called ground glass hepatocytes, with altered ER structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, liver damage and subsequent HCC occurred in mice overexpressing the LHBs protein in hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Despite many different groups have described so far a link between HBV envelope proteins and stress cellular pathways, like ER stress, and have speculated about a connection with HCC evolution, the molecular pathways underlying these processes have not been fully elucidated yet.</s></p><p><s>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a specific signaling pathway activated, owing to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon different physiological and pathological conditions which endanger ER functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>UPR is driven by three ER-transmembrane transducers, IRE1α (Inositol Requiring 1α), PERK (PKRlike ER Kinase) and ATF6α (Activating Transcription Factor 6α), that under physiologic conditions are kept inactive by the binding with the chaperone BiP/GRP78 (Binding Immunoglobulin Protein/Glucose-Regulated Protein 78) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As a consequence of stress, BiP binds the hydrophobic residues of unfolded proteins, to facilitate proper protein folding, to prevent protein aggregate formation and to drive misfolded proteins to the final proteasomal degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The ER transducers, then, dissociate from BiP and activate the UPR signal, triggering the activation of their downstream targets eIF2α, ATF4 (Activating Transcription Factor 4 (tax-responsive enhancer element B67)) and XBP1, giving a prompt response to raise protein folding capacity, degrade misfolded proteins and slow down de novo protein synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>However, when stress is protracted and ER functions are severely impaired, the organelle triggers apoptotic cell death, through a mechanism that has not been completely elucidated and that involves different proteins like the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, leading to elimination of cells unable to handle the unfolded protein accumulation through the UPR intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The endocannabinoid system includes the CB receptors, the endocannabinoids and the enzymes involved in their synthesis and degradation, all located in the brain and peripheral tissues, including the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>It has been widely demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system is involved in a broad range of biological processes, like food intake, energy balance and immune responses, as well as in the pathogenesis of different human diseases including cancer, neurological disorders and cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in the patho-physiological processes associated with acute and chronic liver diseases, stimulating inflammation, liver damage and fibrogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>CB1 and CB2 receptors expression, the responsive elements to endo-cannabinoids, is quite low in normal liver and strongly upregulated in experimental liver injury and cirrhosis due to alcohol, hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, some authors demonstrated that cannabinoids are able to activate the ER stress response in different models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref

of the hepadnaviridae family, with a genome that contains four overlapping open reading frames, encoding for the core protein, for the viral polymerase, for the HBx protein, known to be involved in HBV-associated carcinogenesis, and for the envelope proteins.</s><s>Specifically, HBV genome owns three co-carboxyterminal HBV envelope proteins, named LHBs, MHBs and SHBs proteins that differ for their distinct domains and glycosylation status <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>HBV infection can lead to HCC development through direct mechanisms, including viral DNA integration

through indirect processes, like inflammation, regeneration and fibrosis associated with cirrhosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, excessive production of HBV envelope proteins LHBs and SHBs or mutated/truncated forms of LHBs, MHBs and SHBs, can activate cellular signal stress response pathways, like ER stress, that alter hepatocyte physiology and may stimulate neoplastic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins inside the ER, due to many different perturbations of this organelle homeostasis, leads to a cellular condition known as ER stress that triggers a series of adaptive mechanisms, named unfolded protein response (UPR), designed to restore standard protein folding <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref> and orchestrated by three signaling proteins, IRE1α, PERK and ATF6.</s><s>If ER stress is chronically protracted, cells undergo cell death and one of the main player of ER stress-mediated apoptosis is the transcription factor CHOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>UPR is activated in several acute and chronic liver diseases and the activation of ER-stress downstream molecules such as ATF-6, BiP and XBP-1 is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Despite the huge amount of data demonstrating a connection between HBV infection and HCC development and the great breakthrough in this field, the precise underlying processes and molecular pathways linking HBV and HCC are not completely highlighted yet.</s><s>The major obstacle is the lack of in vitro and in vivo experimental models that reliably mimic human HBV infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, we used Huh-7 and HepG2 cell lines that were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding for HBV envelope proteins; the first one was expressing LHBs and minor amounts of MHBs and SHBs proteins and the second one expressing MHBs alone.</s><s>The proposed models were used to analyze ER stress path.</s></p><p><s>Here, we show that pSVM and pSVL plasmids are able to trigger an ER stress response in Huh-7 cells, comparable to the effects of the well known ER stress inducer thapsigargin, upregulating the chaperone BiP and the transcription factor CHOP, two gold standard ER stress markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, probably as a consequence of HBV envelope proteins accumulation inside the ER compartment as shown by the detection of ER-Tracker, a specific ER dye.</s><s>On the contrary, none of the ER stress factors analyzed are activated in HepG2 cells, but they are rather reduced after HBV envelope proteins exogenous expression.</s><s>One of the ER stress mediator, IRE1α is involved in the processing of XBP-1 mRNA and in the recruitment of TRAF2/ASK1 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2/ Apoptosis signalregulating kinase 1) to mediate the activation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>.</s><s>XBP-1 spliced form can induce the expression of several genes involved in different aspects of UPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>XBP-1 splicing was clearly detectable in Huh-7 cells, but not in HepG2 after expression of HBV envelope proteins, strengthening that HBV envelope proteins are able to trigger an ER stress response only in Huh-7 cells.</s></p><p><s>PERK, one of the three ER stress sensors, activated after BiP dissociation, is the major protein responsible for attenuation of mRNA translation under ER stress.</s><s>Once activated, it phosphorylates eIF2α, inhibiting the initiation phase of polypeptide chain synthesis and allowing the preferential translation of UPR-dependent genes, such as ATF4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s>HBV envelope proteins expression leads to the increase of PERK and phospho-eIF2α level in Huh-7 cells, confirming the activation of ER stress pathway.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, it has been shown a link between ER stress induction and the endocannabinoid system <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The cannabinoids are a group of different lipidic compounds, acting via the G-protein-coupled receptors CB1 and CB2 and other putative targets, playing a role in a wide range of cellular processes, like food intake, energy balance, nociception, intestinal motility and immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the cannabinoids play a role in inflammatory processes and cancer progression.</s><s>In particular, it has been shown that cannabinoids are strongly involved in liver diseases and related pathophysiological conditions, as altered hepatic haemodynamics, cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, metabolic syndrome and ischaemia/reperfusion disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s>The endocannabinoids synthesis and CB1 and CB2 hepatic expression have been demonstrated to be increased in several conditions characterized by chronic liver damage, such as alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver, viral hepatitis and fibrosis <ref type="bibr">[18-20, 50, 51]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, it has been reported that activation of CB1 or CB2 receptors can modulate the activation of ER stress pathway in human tumors including glioma, leukemia, pancreatic and colorectal cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, CB1 or CB2 receptors are able to stimulate de novo synthesis of ceramide, a pro-apoptotic lipid that causes upregulation of the stress protein p8 (also named candidate of metastasis 1, Com-1) and its downstream target, the pseudokinase TRB3 (tribbles homologue-3), and several other downstream ER stress-related genes, like ATF4 and CHOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we also analyzed the possible involvement of CB1 receptor in ER stress induced by HBV envelope proteins.</s><s>Here, we show that CB1 is highly upregulated after HBV envelope proteins expression in Huh-7 cells, while its level is not detectable in HepG2 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Inhibition of CB1 using a specific CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251, counteracts the effects of HBV envelope proteins expression on ER stress induction, restoring BiP and CHOP basal levels, strongly supporting the hypothesis that CB1 can modulate the ER stress response in our model.</s><s>In HepG2 cells, where CB1 is weakly expressed, the HBV envelope proteins are not able to induce the ER stress pathway.</s><s>Additionally, the block of CB1 receptor caused a significant down-regulation of BiP transcript level in HBV infected PLC/PRF/5 cells, while no variation of BiP was observed in HBV negative HLF cells.</s><s>It has been reported that CB receptors can inhibit the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, thus preventing ER stress blocking and, instead, leading to its activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, based on our findings, we show that HBV envelope proteins trigger the ER stress response, activating two arms of UPR mechanism, specifically PERK/eIF2α and IRE1α/XBP-1.</s><s>We could speculate that CB1 expression, in cells infected by HBV, could counteract the inhibitory action of Akt on ER stress pathway and trigger proliferation arrest through ER stress; while the absence of CB1 in HepG2 could not block the survival mechanism of Akt.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we could confirm that ER stress plays an important role in cell transformation, especially in HCC and in chronic viral hepatitis B infection in the proposed model.</s><s>Furthermore the mechanistic role of cannabinoid system, a crucial checkpoint in liver diseases, would need to be clarified in correlation with ER stress after HBV infection.</s></p></div>
