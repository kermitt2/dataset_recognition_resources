<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Prediction of Reaction Specificity of Mammalian ALOX15 Orthologs.</s></p><p><s>The evolutionary concept of alox15 specificity (3) suggests that mammals ranked low in evolution (mice, rats, pigs, cattle), including lower primates (rhesus monkeys), express 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 orthologs.</s><s>In contrast, higher primates (recent and extinct humans, orangutans) express 15-lipoxygenating isoforms (3).</s><s>To test this concept, to characterize its mechanistic basis, and to explore the possible biological relevance of the evolutionary specificity alterations we used a research strategy involving multiple sequence alignments, cloning, and functional characterization of ALOX15 orthologs and in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</s><s>First, we extracted cDNA sequences of ALOX15 orthologs from three major genomic databases.</s><s>From the list of hits, incomplete sequences were eliminated and multiple amino acid alignments were carried out.</s><s>A total of 63 complete ALOX15 sequences were retrieved for which all triad determinants have been sequenced (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>The degree of amino acid conservation to human ALOX15 varied between 60% and 99% (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), and all sequences involved the iron liganding amino acids.</s><s>Next, we compared the triad determinants [Sloane determinants (SL), Borngräber determinants 1 (BG1), Borngräber determinants 2 (BG2)] and found that, in lower mammals, at least one of the two major triad determinants (SL, BG1) is occupied by a small amino acid (Leu instead of Phe at the BG1 position, Val-Val, Ala-Val, Val-Met, Ala-Met instead of Ile-Met at the SL position).</s><s>These data suggest that, according to the triad concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39)</ref>, the ALOX15 orthologs of these mammals exhibit dominant 12-lipoxygenating activities.</s><s>The only exception was the rabbit.</s><s>For this species, two distinct ALOX15 cDNAs can be retrieved, and previous studies indicated pronounced differences in the reaction specificity of these ALOX15 isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Summarizing the currently available data on the reaction specificity of mammalian ALOX15 orthologs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), one may conclude that the evolutionary change from 12-to 15-lipoxygenation has happened during later primate evolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Macaca mulatta is the most highly developed nonhuman primate for which a 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 has been identified, and Pongo pygmaeus is the lowest nonhuman primate for which a 15lipoxygenating ALOX15 has been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34)</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately, the ALOX15 ortholog of the gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys), which is flanked in evolution by M. mulatta and P. pygmaeus, has not been specified.</s><s>To test the evolutionary concept of ALOX15 specificity, we addressed the following problems: (i) What is the reaction specificity of the ALOX15 ortholog of Papio anubis, which precedes M. mulatta during primate evolution?</s><s>The evolutionary concept of ALOX15 specificity suggests a 12-lipoxygenating ortholog.</s><s>(ii) What is the reaction specificity of the ALOX15 ortholog of N. leucogenys?</s><s>Such functional data are of particular interest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> To characterize the later stages of mammalian ALOX15 evolution, we first compared the amino acid sequences of selected highly developed mammals with that of the human enzyme (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The corresponding sequence of the ancient human subspecies Homo neanderthalensis and Homo denisovan are 99.7% and 99.5% identical to that of modern humans (Homo sapiens), and mutagenesis data suggested that neither of the observed amino acid exchanges altered the reaction specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the two extinct human subspecies express a 15-lipoxygenating ALOX15 ortholog.</s><s>Chimpanzees (Pan) are the closest living relatives of  modern humans.</s><s>When we compared the amino acid sequences of P. paniscus ALOX15 with that of P. troglodytes, we did not find any differences.</s><s>Comparison with human ALOX15 indicated a 99.7% amino acid identity.</s><s>Here only two different amino acids were detected (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), and these exchanges were unlikely to be of functional relevance.</s><s>The two orangutan subspecies (P.</s><s>abelii, P. pygmaeus), which have identical amino acid sequences, share a 98.6% amino acid identity with the H. sapiens ortholog (eight different amino acids).</s><s>For gibbons (N.</s><s>leucogenys), rhesus monkeys (M.</s><s>mulatta), and baboons (P.</s><s>anubis), significantly lower degrees of amino acid conservation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) were calculated.</s></p><p><s>To predict the reaction specificities of the ALOX15 orthologs of these Catarrhini, we compared the amino acid sequences of the triad determinants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) and found that the sequences of the three amino acid clusters for H. sapiens, H. neanderthalensis, H. denisovan, P. troglodytes, P. paniscus, P. pygmaeus, and P. abelii were identical (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</s><s>Thus, according to the triad concept, these enzymes should exhibit major 15-lipoxygenating activity, which is consistent with the functional data shown previously for the enzymes of H. sapiens and P. pygmaeus <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>.</s><s>The ALOX15 orthologs of M. mulatta and Mus musculus contain at least one small amino acid at the Sloane positions (i.e., SL), classifying these enzymes as 12-lipoxygenating ALOX15 variants.</s><s>Moreover, in mice, the Borngräber 1 position (i.e., BG1) is occupied by a Leu, the side chain of which is less space-filling than the side chain of Phe present in 15-lipoxygenating ALOX15 orthologs.</s><s>Baboons (P.</s><s>anubis) have almost identical sequences around the triad determinants as rhesus monkeys (M.</s><s>mulatta; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), and thus, on the basis of sequence comparison, arachidonic acid 12lipoxygenation could be predicted.</s><s>The gibbon (N.</s><s>leucogenys) ALOX15 ortholog shows interesting sequence differences at the triad determinants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), which made predictions of the reaction specificity risky.</s><s>At the BG1 position, a bulky Phe is present, suggesting arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenation.</s><s>At the SL positions, Ile418 is conserved, but, instead of Met419 (van der Waals radius of 124 Å), a Thr (van der Waals radius of 93 Å) is found, suggesting a gain of space at the active site.</s><s>At the BG2 position, the Ile593 is conserved, but a Val instead of a Thr occupies the adjacent position.</s><s>This situation does not allow a precise prediction of the reaction specificity on the basis of the triad concept, and thus, direct experimental data are required.</s></p><p><s>To obtain such data, we cloned the ALOX15 orthologs of P. anubis, P. abelii, and N. leucogenys, expressed them as recombinant proteins, and performed in vitro activity assays.</s><s>As predicted, ALOX15 of P. anubis converted arachidonic acid mainly to 12-H(p)ETE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>), whereas the chimpanzee (P.</s><s>troglodytes) ortholog produced mainly 15-H(p)ETE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the gibbon ALOX15 oxygenated arachidonic acid to a product mixture consisting of almost equal amounts of 12-and 15-H(p)ETE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</s><s>Such pronounced dual reaction specificity of arachidonic acid oxygenation has never been described for any naturally occurring LOX isoform to our knowledge.</s><s>For comparison (i.e., positive control), the specificity of the human ALOX15 was also tested (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4D</ref>), and our data confirmed dominant arachidonic acid 15-lipoxygenation.</s><s>Because RP-HPLC does not reliably separate 12-and 8-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) we carried out additional straightphase (SP)-HPLC, which confirmed our conclusions.</s><s>For more detailed quantification, for determination of the relative specific activities, and for statistical evaluation of the interspecies differences, we repeated expression and activity assays several times (Materials and Methods), and the results are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>All enzyme preparations exhibit similar relative specific activities (the specific activity of the human enzyme was set at 100%).</s><s>The ALOX15 orthologs of humans and chimpanzees are major 15-lipoxygenating enzymes.</s><s>In contrast, gibbons express an ALOX15, which converts arachidonic acid to almost similar amounts
