<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Most physiological processes in mammals are temporally regulated by means of a master circadian clock in the brain and peripheral oscillators in most other tissues.</s><s>A transcriptional-translation feedback network of clock genes produces near 24 h oscillations in clock gene and protein expression.</s><s>Here, we aim to identify novel additions to the clock network using a meta-analysis of public chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), proteomics and protein-protein interaction data starting from a published list of 1000 genes with robust transcriptional rhythms and circadian phenotypes of knockdowns.</s><s>Results: We identified 20 candidate genes including nine known clock genes that received significantly high scores and were also robust to the relative weights assigned to different data types.</s><s>Our scoring was consistent with the original ranking of the 1000 genes, but also provided novel complementary insights.</s><s>Candidate genes were enriched for genes expressed in a circadian manner in multiple tissues with regulation driven mainly by transcription factors BMAL1 and REV-ERBα, β.</s><s>Moreover, peak transcription of candidate genes was remarkably consistent across tissues.</s><s>While peaks of the 1000 genes were distributed uniformly throughout the day, candidate gene peaks were strongly concentrated around dusk.</s><s>Finally, we showed that binding of specific transcription factors to a gene promoter was predictive of peak transcription at a certain time of day and discuss combinatorial phase regulation.</s><s>Conclusions: Combining complementary publicly-available data targeting different levels of regulation within the circadian network, we filtered the original list and found 11 novel robust candidate clock genes.</s><s>Using the criteria of circadian proteomic expression, circadian expression in multiple tissues and independent gene knockdown data, we propose six genes (Por, Mtss1, Dgat2, Pim3, Ppp1r3b, Upp2) involved in metabolism and cancer for further experimental investigation.</s><s>The availability of public high-throughput databases makes such meta-analysis a promising approach to test consistency between sources and tap their entire potential.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p><s>We started our meta-analysis from the list of 1000 putative clock genes identified by Anafi et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein-protein interaction data</head><p><s>For a gene to be an integral part of the TTFL, it might interact at the protein level with known clock members.</s><s>Therefore, we complemented the gene interaction study used by Anafi et al. with publicly available protein-protein interaction data.</s><s>In particular, we searched for protein interactions with a list of 46 core circadian genes gathered by Wallach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Note that this list of core circadian genes is longer than the exemplar list of 17 used by Anafi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Wallach et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> compiled the list of all proteins interacting with the 46 core circadian genes from the Unified Human Interactome (UniHi) database <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> that was mined from 14 different sources using four different approaches.</s><s>We looked for evidence of interactions between genes in the master list and these 46 core clock genes (the list of interactions of the core clock genes was provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>).</s></p><p><s>From the Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA) database <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, we were able to obtain complementary data on interactions identified in M. musculus alone that is similarly drawn from multiple public resources.</s><s>As before, genes in the master list with at least one interaction with the 46 core clock genes were sought in the PINA database.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Combining the sources and scoring</head><p><s>We drew our data from multiple sources that are generated using different techniques, as described above, which makes integrating them a non-trivial task.</s><s>It is particularly difficult to assign confidences to these different measurements.</s><s>We therefore resorted to a very simple scoring scheme where the presence of a gene in a particular data set (termed a 'hit') gets a score of one and its absence, a score of zero, otherwise.</s><s>Thus, we give equal weight to a data set, whether ChIP-seq, proteomic or PPI.</s><s>The only exception to this weighting rule is the data set from Rey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, which is given a weight of three, since it is a particularly detailed and thorough study of a central transcription factor (BMAL1).</s></p><p><s>Whenever time-resolved data were available, we restricted our attention to binding, concentrations or interactions that were identified to be circadian at the appropriate statistical level (see details above).</s><s>We mapped all protein data back to coding gene and assigned ChIP-seq peaks to the nearest gene, and used the ENTREZ gene ID as the common unified index for each gene (using Bioconductor annotation package org.Mm.eg.db (v3.1.2)).</s><s>The final score for each gene in the master list was computed as the sum of gene score within each constituent data set and reflects simply the number of studies that provide evidence supporting the circadian nature of that gene.</s><s>A gene under this scheme can receive a maximum score of 21.</s></p><p><s>We were able to attach a p-value to the total score for each gene using the following randomized shuffling procedure.</s><s>We assigned the total number of hits obtained from each data set randomly to genes in the master list.</s><s>Iterating this procedure, we produced an empirical distribution of scores and the probability of achieving a more extreme total score (the p-value) can be thus computed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selecting genes robust to the choice of weighting scheme</head><p><s>We used a simple binary scoring scheme for each gene within a data set that resulted in a much heigher weight being assigned to the ChIP-seq data compared to the other two.</s><s>We therefore tested if genes were particulary sensitive to the relative choice of weights for the different types of data sets.</s><s>We therefore introduced pre-factors for each class of data: α for ChIP-seq, β for proteomic, and γ for protein-protein interaction (PPI), respectively.</s><s>Then, the total score for a gene g for this choice of pre-factors is</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S(g) = α [ChIP-seq data score]+β [Proteomics data score] + γ [ PPI data score] = α ChIP-seq data i I i (g) + β Proteomics data j I j (g) + γ PPI data k I k (g),</formula><p><s>where I l (g) is one, if the gene g is present in a data set l, zero if it is not.</s><s>We further fix α + β + γ = 1.</s></p><p><s>Our original scoring described above and in Additional file 1 is equivalent to a choice of equal pre-factors for all three classes, i.e., α = β = γ = 1 3 .</s><s>We then altered each pre-factor randomly while restricting changes to at most 50 % above or below the original equal pre-factors.</s><s>In other words, we generate random (α, β, γ ), such that 0.165 &lt; α, β, γ &lt; 0.5.</s><s>Care was taken while generating these random pre-factors to ensure that the pre-factors were truly uniformly distributed over the simplex.</s><s>Finally, for each random choice of pre-factors, we computed a background distribution of scores S using the randomized shuffling procedure while keeping the (α, β, γ ) fixed.</s><s>Significant candidate genes for that particular choice of pre-factors were those genes with a p-value &lt; 0.001.</s><s>Finally, we retained only genes that were found to be significant in each of 100 random choices of (α, β, γ ).</s><s>This list of genes was thus robust to variations in the choice of pre-factors and are listed in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s></p></div>

reflects mainly transcriptional rhythmicity and as such the ChIP-seq data would be expected to be consistent with it, since they relate to the same process of transcription.</s><s>However, binding to

statistically significant fit to the data and described how the presence of the different TFs quantitatively tuned the expression phase of a gene (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>It must be borne in mind that for this analysis of phase regulation, we pooled all the transcript phases and assumed that ChIP-seq binding in the liver implies similar binding in all tissues.</s><s>Moreover,

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>We combined multiple high-throughput public data sources of circadian data to filter the shortlist of 1000 potential circadian genes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> to obtain 11 novel robust candidate genes.</s><s>In particular, we suggested Por, Mtss1, Pim3, Dgat2, Ppp1r3b and Upp2 for further experimental studies as potential clock genes.</s><s>These genes appear to have a role in either metabolism or cancer or stress response making them a potential link between the circadian clock and these physiological processes.</s><s>We also showed from the different ChIP-seq data that phase regulation of transcription of circadian genes is driven by specific transcription factors in a combinatorial manner consistent across multiple tissues.</s></p><p><s>Although we focused our discussion on the significant candidate genes, we have assigned scores based on our analysis for the all 1000 shortlisted genes that can serve as a starting point to integrate additional data sources as they or tools to integrate them (for e.g., to integrate metabolomics data <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>) become available.</s><s>In order to keep the scoring in the meta-analysis simple we used binary scoring of hits from various data sources.</s><s>A Bayesian analysis might be performed in order to consistently combine final scores from <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> for a better consolidated final ranking.</s><s>Meta-analyses of the ever growing publicly available data targeted at different aspects of the regulatory network has the potential to aid functional network discovery in the circadian and other contexts and utilize these data to their fullest potential.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.</head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. Phase of circadian transcripts.</s><s>aThe distribution of the expression phase of genes that are significantly circadian in different tissues (FDR JTK &lt; 0.05)<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> classified according to the combinations of transcription factors (TFs) binding their promoter based on ChIP-seq data.</s><s>E-box: BMAL1 or NPAS2 or CLOCK, D-box: E4BP4, RRE: REV-ERBα or REV-ERBβ or RORα.</s><s>The grey vertical lines represent the median phase of expression within each group of transcripts and the line width increases with increasing significance of the mean-direction (Rayleigh test).</s><s>The number of transcripts in each group is also provided.</s><s>b The estimated distribution of phases for each combination of TFs from the generalized linear model fit of the transcript phases to the normalized scores for each TF group within the ChIP-seq data in our meta-analysis.</s><s>Under the model, the phase of expression within each group is assumed to follow a von Mises distribution, whose mean is linearly dependent on the normalized scores (see "Method" section)</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
