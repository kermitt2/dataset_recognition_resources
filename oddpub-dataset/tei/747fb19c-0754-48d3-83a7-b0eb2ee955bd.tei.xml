<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In our study early exposure to pasteurized hen's egg at 4 to 6 months of age was neither effective in preventing hen's egg allergy nor safe.</s><s>To reduce the risk for allergic reactions during the trial, we measured sensitization to hen's egg before the start of the intervention at 4 to 6 months of age.</s><s>Surprisingly, we observed a very high prevalence of hen's egg sensitization of 5.7% at this early age.</s><s>In addition, the adjusted prevalence of clinically relevant hen's egg allergy in the current HEAP study, namely 5.3% at 4 to 6 months, is much higher than the observed prevalence rate of 2.0% in the EuroPrevall birth cohort in older German children at a mean age of 14 months. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>Even more alarmingly, two thirds of the allergic infants had an anaphylactic reaction during the challenge.</s></p><p><s>We found a highly significant difference in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis between the hen's egg-sensitized and allergic infants and the nonsensitized infants, a finding consistent with prior scientific knowledge that early infantile atopic dermatitis is an important risk factor for food allergy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>However, a third of the sensitized infants had no atopic dermatitis at the screening visit.</s><s>In these ''healthy'' children no prediction of allergic reactions on feeding hen's egg would be possible without general screening for sensitization.</s></p><p><s>Among the nonsensitized infants at 4 to 6 months of age, there were only 4 confirmed cases of hen's egg allergy at 12 months of age, 3 of those in the verum group and 1 in the placebo group.</s><s>Because 2 infants in the verum group reacted at the very first exposure and one at the fifth exposure in the updosing phase, it can be assumed that exposure to the study powder elicited symptoms of a pre-existing hen's egg allergy rather than actually causing the disease.</s><s>Logically, cases of pre-existing hen's egg allergy after screening for sensitization in both groups can only be determined in the verum group.</s><s>Thus we do not know whether the allergic child in the placebo group was already allergic at 4 to 6 months of age.</s><s>The 3 allergic children in the verum group reacted at home, 2 with an anaphylactic reaction.</s></p><p><s>Our most important finding was that the majority of infants with egg allergy were already sensitized and allergic to hen's egg before the introduction of solid foods at 4 to 6 months of age, and therefore a prevention strategy starting at this age is too late.</s><s>In contrast, feeding hen's egg to these children for primary prevention would have led to a large number of allergic reactions in the community.</s></p><p><s>According to the concept of a ''window of opportunity,'' there might be a specific time period during which oral exposure to potentially allergenic foods leads to persistent oral tolerance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>ssuming that this concept is true, this window seems to differ in its duration and termination depending on each specific food and might vary depending on the infant's environmental exposure to food allergens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>An Israeli observational study suggested a protective effect of oral exposure to cow's milk during the first 14 days of life;
