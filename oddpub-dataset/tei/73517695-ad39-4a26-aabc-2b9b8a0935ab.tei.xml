<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Pedophilia is a disorder of sexual preference (ICD-10) or a paraphilia (DSM-5) that is characterized by sexual impulses, urges and fantasies involving male (attracted to boys) or female (attracted to girls) sexually immature children or children of both sexes.</s><s>Note that in ICD-10, these definitions include prepubertal and early pubertal children, while the DSM-5 specifically states 'prepubertal children (generally age 13 and younger)'.</s><s>These interests can occur either exclusively or non-exclusively, that is, in combination with sexual interest in adults.</s><s>Pedophilia is a diagnosable mental disorder when accompanied by significant distress, social function impairment or harmful behaviors.</s><s>Although recent population-based studies suggest that the prevalence of pedophilic interest is 1-5% in men, the generalizability of these findings remains questionable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>Pedophilia is a major risk factor for committing repeated-contact sexual offenses against children.</s><s>However, only approximately 50% of convicted child sexual offenders (CSO) are pedophiles, and clinical sexology and psychiatry have revealed the existence of pedophiles who never commit child sexual offenses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Non-offending pedophiles show better social functioning, greater empathic abilities and greater sexual self-control than pedophilic CSOs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The available neurobehavioral data from pedophilic CSOs remain widely inconclusive.</s><s>Typically, general and fronto-temporal neurobiological perturbations appear to be linked to pedophilia and/or child sexual offending. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>General neurodevelopmental disturbances in pedophilic CSOs are supported by findings of impaired general processing speed, lower general IQ and a higher prevalence of non-right handedness, which suggests disturbed brain lateralization and higher second-to-fourth (2D:4D) digit ratios that indicate lower prenatal androgen exposure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>The evidence of reduced cognitive flexibility and lowered inhibitory control abilities in pedophilic CSOs suggests frontal lobe alterations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Moreover, lesions in the temporal lobe have been linked to child sexual offending in previously healthy men. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> In three studies that compared pedophilic CSOs with either healthy controls or other nonsexual offenders, only the reduction in gray matter (GM) in the right amygdala was replicated, whereas differences in the orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and the temporal and limbic cortex were inconsistent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Three studies including pedophiles with and without a history of child sexual offenses identified no reduction in global or regional GM volumes in the pedophilic groups, and in all the studies, the authors did not control for or systemically control for the potentially confounding effects of medication, incarceration and sexual orientation (pedophiles attracted to boys are known to bear a greater risk of re-offending <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Apart from some correlational data, the differential relationship between sexual preference (pedophilia) or offending behavior in pedophilic men and alterations in brain structure thus remain unclear.</s></p><p><s>The aim of the present study was to overcome the previously mentioned limitations by systematically distinguishing structural brain anomalies associated with pedophilia from those associated with sexual offending in pedophiles.</s><s>Therefore, we assessed the following three groups of men: (i) pedophilic men who committed sexual offenses against children (P+CSO), (ii) pedophilic men who did not commit sexual offenses against children (P − CSO) and (iii) non-offending teleiophilic (that is, sexually attracted to mature adults) men (HC).</s><s>Based on the literature, we expected that structural differences within the amygdala would be associated with child sexual offending, pedophilia or other factors, such as incarceration or sexual orientation, that have not been controlled for in the previous studies.</s><s>Finally, we aimed to analyze structural markers that are potentially related to the risk of re-offending in pedophiles who have already committed offenses against children.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to differentiate brain structural anomalies in pedophiles with and without a history of CSO.</s><s>Consistent with the conceptualization of the DSM-5, which specifies CSO as most the prominent criterion that differentiates pedophilia from pedophilic disorder, there were no significant differences between the GM volumes of the nonoffending pedophiles and the teleiophilic controls.</s><s>In contrast, the pedophiles who had engaged in CSO showed a significantly reduced relative GM volume in the right TP compared with pedophiles who did not.</s><s>This difference was not attributable to age, level of education, IQ, sexual orientation, drug misuse/ dependence, other Axis I or II disorders or general criminality.</s><s>However, the GM volume in the right TM was negatively associated with self-focused sexual behavior in both healthy controls and offending pedophiles and the VRT index, which is a measure of pedophilic tendencies in healthy controls.</s><s>Moreover, the GM volume in the right TM was positively correlated with affective empathic skills and the propensity to inhibit sexual behavior due to potentially negative consequences of sex in nonoffending pedophiles.</s><s>Finally, the risk of re-offending, which was predicted by the SSPI-2 scores, was significantly associated with decreased local GM volume in the right dorsomedial PFC/ACC.</s><s>The pattern of above vs below 'normal' GM volume of the right TP of the non-offending vs offending pedophiles potentially suggests that the risk for CSO in pedophiles is modulated by GM volume or the function of this area.</s><s>Supporting this notion, the development of Klüver-Bucy syndrome in men and in nonhuman primates following lesions in the TP is characterized by impairments in deciphering social cues and sexual disinhibition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>In functional MRI research, this finding is also supported by evidence showing that TP deactivation is a precondition for sexual response to visual sexual stimuli and activation in theory of mind and empathy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref></s><s>The location in the temporal pole region does not readily connect to the findings associated with antisociality/ psychopathy, which are pathologies that are also characterized by a lack of empathy and high sexual behavioral output but are typically associated with prefrontal and limbic gray matter deficits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref></s><s>One finding of interest may be the apparent differential distribution (CSO by sexual orientation interaction) of the relative GM volume in the right TP with respect to sexual orientation.</s><s>Although this association was not statistically significant, there is a more pronounced reduction in GM in pedophiles who are attracted to boys, which is consistent with the literature showing this population is at greater risk for committing multiple contact sexual offenses.</s><s>The pattern of correlations in our study lends further support to an interpretation of these findings that is specific for pedophilic sexual offending.</s><s>The items pertaining to the SIS-1 mainly represent self-focus in sexual behavior.</s><s>This association with self-focus in offending pedophiles and healthy controls contrasts with an inverse association with measures of other-focused tendencies, such as empathic concern and sexual inhibition due to performance consequences in pedophilic nonoffenders.</s><s>The divergence between the three groups may be driven by some latent function that differentially influences response behavior and helps non-offending pedophiles to abstain from contact sexual offending.</s><s>However, caution in the interpretation of these associations is warranted, as the SIS/SES questionnaire has not yet been validated in pedophilic samples.</s><s>The association between reduced TP volume and increased pedophilic response behavior in an indirect measure of sexual preference in healthy controls is intriguing and may indicate a finding relevant to the etiology of pedophilia.</s></p><p><s>In our study, the GM volume in the dorsomedial PFC/ACC was negatively correlated with a quantitative marker for pedophilia that is associated with the risk to re-offend (SSPI-2).</s><s>This finding is related to antisociality and contributes to the existing literature on the deficient inhibitory control in pedophilic CSOs.</s><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> In contrast to prior work, there were no GM volume differences between the groups in the right amygdala. 9,11</s><s>However, as indicated by our post hoc analysis, the previously reported differences may be due to unbalanced group designs regarding sexual orientation, although the research thus far has failed to establish clear-cut neuroanatomical differences between teleiophilic men attracted to men or women. <ref type="bibr"

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The cross-sectional design of this study impedes causal explanations or predictive interpretations of the between-group differences.</s><s>Moreover, the differences in the white matter and the gray matter, which can be detected with other methods, are possible and may add to the results of our study.</s><s>As a third methodological concern, more effective methods to control for the influence of MRI analyses than regression modeling have been proposed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref></s><s>iven that our finding held in the matched group analysis with a well-balanced group distribution between the sites (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), a bias introduced through the different acquisition sites appears unlikely.</s></p><p><s>Recruiting pedophiles from the community to distinguish between pedophilia and CSO is a major strength but also a limitation because evidence for or against self-reported offenses is unavailable.</s><s>However, the probability that some participants in the P − CSO group may have falsely denied sexual offenses seems to be rather small due to the clear-cut findings, guaranteed confidentiality of all information and the possibility of anonymous participation.</s><s>A similar argument can be made for the influence of Axis I or II disorders.</s><s>Although our model did not allow for the clarification of the influence of Axis I or II disorders on the GM differences, the pedophilic groups did not significantly differ in their psychiatric comorbidities, which indicates that these issues were unlikely to contribute to the difference in the GM volume in the temporal pole.</s><s>The proportions of the 'classic' pedophilic and hebephilic (attracted to early pubescent rather than strictly prepubescent children) men were similar within both pedophilic groups and therefore probably did not affect the between-group differences detected in this study.</s><s>However, the similar proportions may have diluted differences between these groups and the teleiophilic group; one study demonstrated that the white matter differences between hebephilic and teleiophilic men were smaller than those between pedophilic and teleiophilic men. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref></s><s>In addition, the lack of clear correlations between the TP volume and psychological or behavioral measures does impede the direct application of this result to therapeutic approaches.</s><s>Further studies are needed to elucidate this connection.</s><s>Finally, while the results of the current study are valid for pedophilic CSOs, the generalizability of these findings to non-pedophilic child molesters should be addressed in other studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>The present study substantiates the idea that CSO in pedophilia rather than pedophilia alone is associated with changes in GM integrity, particularly in the right temporal pole.</s><s>The risk of (re) offending was associated with a GM reduction in the dorsomedial PFC/ACC.</s><s>Both findings indicate that morphometric markers associated with CSO in pedophiles may be potentially useful for the treatment or prevention approaches that aim to reduce the risk of (re)offending in pedophilia.</s></p></div>
