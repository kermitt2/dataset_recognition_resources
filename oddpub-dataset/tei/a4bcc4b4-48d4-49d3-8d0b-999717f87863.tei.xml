<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation, such as upper extremity and face transplantation for reconstruction of devastating tissue defects, has evolved as a valid treatment option for patients not amendable to conventional reconstructive procedures.</s><s>Technical advances in the field of reconstructive microsurgery as well as a vast experience with potent immunosuppressive and immune modulatory therapies in solid organ transplantation, now enables long-term allograft survival in this unique patient population 3,21</s></p><p><s>. However, significant side effects of long-term immunosuppression required for allograft maintenance and survival still limit the broader application of these life enhancing but not life-saving reconstructive modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, the success of VCAs in contrast to solid organ transplants also depends on timely regeneration of recipient nerves into the allograft to re-innervate both muscles for motor function, as well as sensory components for touch and temperature sensation to regain function.</s><s>From an immunologic perspective, as in all of transplantation medicine, the overarching goal in reconstructive transplantation is to achieve a state of operational tolerance allowing for acceptance of an allograft without the need for long-term maintenance immunosuppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>In this regard, the mouse has evolved to represent the main in vivo model system in transplant immunology research to investigate ways of achieving alloantigen specific tolerance in an intact immune system.</s><s>Furthermore, the mouse H2 complex closely resembles the human MHC complex.</s><s>Thus, inbred and genotyped mouse strains allow to model clinical scenarios of related and non-related living and cadaveric donor settings by employing various degrees of alloantigen mismatching from a syngeneic to a fully allogeneic strain combination.</s><s>The availability of transgenic animals and specific knockout animals additionally allows investigation of the roles and effects of individual molecular pathways and regulatory mechanisms on immune acceptance and rejection by providing the possibility of selective activation or depletion of cell or protein components.</s><s>This is paralleled by a broad availability of diagnostic and therapeutic agents (e.g., antibodies) uniquely developed for the mouse system for in vitro and in vivo studies 24 .</s><s>Overall, these aspects make the murine system the "gold standard" for basic transplant immunology research.</s></p><p><s>Although there have been various small 13,16,18,20,25,26 and large animal 14,27-29 models described for VCA as recently reviewed by Brandacher et al. 30 only very few are actually applicable for basic mechanistic immunological research <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Due to the small vessel diameter of the mouse femoral artery and vein, it requires advanced surgical and super-microsurgical training and skills to perform successful anastomosis as the key component of orthotopic hind limb transplantation.</s><s>While meticulous and careful dissection of the anatomical structures is as critically relevant in this model as in previously published models <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , the cuff technique has shown a less steep learning curve compared to suture anastomosis of sub-millimeter vessels 16,25 and can be achieved in a couple of months training with rigorous daily practice.</s><s>Based on our experience, an untrained microsurgeon will need 30 -50 procedural attempts to acquire sufficient and reliable skills to perform this model with high success rates.</s><s>For the experienced and highly trained microsurgeon 15 -30 attempts should suffice to master this cuff-based mouse hind limb transplant model.The reduced complexity of the procedure presented here is further reflected by the fact that this approach requires limited vessel length and thus dissection.</s><s>We found taking the donor vessels at the inguinal ligament and the recipient vessels at the level of the superficial epigastric vessels provides sufficient length, despite the common notion that the cuff technique requires extensive additional length to be applicable.</s><s>For example, one previously published approach describes the necessity to harvest donor vessels at the level of the external iliac vessels and recipient vessels at the level of the popliteal vessels 32 .</s><s>Furthermore, with the cuff technique, performing the anastomosis requires less time compared to the suture technique and leads to an overall reduced operating time.</s><s>In experienced hands, both donor and recipient procedures can be completed in an average of 90 min.</s><s>This is a significant improvement compared with previously reported methods in which extended duration of recipient anesthesia was a key determinant for success and perioperative survival; making the necessity of a two-surgeon approach a prerequisite <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, minimal to no bleeding from the anastomosis further contributes to significantly reduced blood loss and thereby reduces the need for fluid resuscitation of the recipients, as described previously as another determinant for success in this model 33 .</s><s>Finally, the cuff technique represents a method with a significant cost advantage compared to the high costs of 11-0 micro-suture material.</s><s>Thus, the nonsuture cuff technique represents the most critical step of the underlying protocol.</s><s>In an elegant study by Tung et al., various different myo-and osteomyocutaneous flaps including a vascularized groin skin flap have been described based off of the mouse femoral vessel pedicle 32 .</s><s>While the method presented here focuses exclusively on the transplantation of the entire mouse hind limb, the presented principles may be easily translated and employed in various other anatomical flap designs.</s><s>Noteworthy is the fact that while previous authors report automutilation or autophagy of the graft as a significant complication during post-operative survival 31,32 this has not been observed in our experience.</s><s>Additionally, rapid recovery and limited impairment of the animal's capability of feeding and grooming underlines that the orthotopic inset of the transplanted leg inflicts only minimal recipient morbidity.</s></p><p><s>The model described in this video publication additionally introduces distinct advantages to the mouse setting compared to previously published techniques.</s><s>First and foremost, as reported previously by our group <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , the cuff technique can be employed in vessels with a lumen diameter smaller than 1 millimeter, allowing for orthotopic transplantation of a hind limb allograft.</s><s>This approach provides the basis for employing this model combined in both immunological as well as functional studies of nerve regeneration related to VCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Nerve regeneration is of key importance to the field of reconstructive transplantation, as these are non-life saving procedures whose success is primarily determined by the restoration of functional and aesthetic defects.</s></p><p><s>The heterotopic inset of an osteomyocutaneous flap originating from the hind limb is an additional model available to the surgeon <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>In this approach however, surgical removal of structures of potential interest, such as the nails and the glabrous skin of the footpad, limits the versatility of this method compared with the orthotopic transplantation of an anatomically unaltered hind limb allograft.</s><s>This is of particular interest in reconstructive transplantation as these structures have been described as the target of atypical rejection processes in patients inflicting mechanical stress to their hand allografts .</s><s>Inherently unique to a vascularized composite tissue allograft is the bone component, as vascularized bone contains viable bone marrow and is a constantly renewing source of components and precursors of the donor immune system.</s><s>While this was cautiously regarded as a possible source for graft versus host disease (GvHD), this has not been observed in both animal models 35,36 as well as humans 37</s></p><p><s>. Much to the contrary actually, as shown in preclinical 36 and clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> , the combination of organ transplantation with donor bone marrow transplantation or the transfusion of selected bone marrow-derived cell products actually shows advantageous effects regarding the amount of immunosuppression needed 21 ; some protocols have even shown operational tolerance without the need for drug-based immunosuppression 41 .</s></p><p><s>The model and methodology shown by this publication yielded 100% long-term animal survival in syngeneic donor -recipient combinations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) as well as demonstrated a well characterized patterns of graft acceptance and rejection in the allogeneic strain combinations as outlined in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2 &amp; 3</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, the skin as a visible primary target of rejection in VCA, follows a reproducible pattern of 4 distinct clinical scenarios of rejection correlating with those for human VCA as outlined by the Banff 2007 working classification of skin-containing VCA 42 , making this model particularly translatable.</s><s>Thus, this highly reliable mouse model for reconstructive transplantation above all, introduces the availability of a versatile immunological model system of genetically defined inbred and transgenic mouse strains which opens the possibilities for diagnostic and interventional studies with translational impact on clinical VCA.</s></p><p><s>The need for basic microsurgical skills prior to embarking on mastering the described technique may be regarded as a limitation to this model, however, it is the same main obstacle to any mouse microsurgical model.</s><s>Thus, this video protocol is primarily intended to provide the seasoned microsurgeon with an alternative approach to microvascular anastomosis in a murine in vivo model for vascularized composite allotransplantation.</s><s>Furthermore, the model allows for transplantation of an intact vascularized bone marrow component, as well as the use of a functional model in nerve regeneration research.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we established a novel, versatile, and reliable mouse model for orthotopic hind limb transplantation using a non-suture cuff technique that opens the door to basic mechanistic, as well as translational research related to any aspect of VCA.</s></p></div>
