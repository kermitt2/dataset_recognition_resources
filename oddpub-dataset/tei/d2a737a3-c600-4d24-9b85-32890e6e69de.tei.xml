<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background.</s><s>Pathobionts, bacteria that are typically human commensals but can cause disease, contribute significantly to antimicrobial resistance.</s><s>Staphylococcus epidermidis is a prototypical pathobiont as it is a ubiquitous human commensal but also a leading cause of healthcare-associated bacteremia.</s><s>We sought to determine the etiology of a recent increase in invasive S. epidermidis isolates resistant to linezolid.</s></p><p><s>Methods.</s><s>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 176 S. epidermidis bloodstream isolates collected at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, between 2013 and 2016.</s><s>Molecular relationships were assessed via complementary phylogenomic approaches.</s><s>Abundance of the linezolid resistance determinant cfr was determined in stool samples via reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction.</s></p><p><s>Results.</s><s>Thirty-nine of the 176 strains were linezolid resistant (22%).</s><s>Thirty-one of the 39 linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis infections were caused by a particular clone resistant to multiple antimicrobials that spread among leukemia patients and carried cfr on a 49-kb plasmid (herein called pMB151a).</s><s>The 6 kb of pMB151a surrounding the cfr gene was nearly 100% identical to a cfr-containing plasmid isolated from livestock-associated staphylococci in China.</s><s>Analysis of serial stool samples from leukemia patients revealed progressive staphylococcal domination of the intestinal microflora and an increase in cfr abundance following linezolid use.</s></p><p><s>Conclusions.</s><s>The combination of linezolid use plus transmission of a multidrug-resistant clone drove expansion of invasive, linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis.</s><s>Our results lend support to the notion that a combination of antibiotic stewardship plus infection control measures may help to control the spread of a multidrug-resistant pathobiont.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Emergence of Linezolid Resistance Among S. epidermidis and Use of Linezolid</head><p><s>Our clinical microbiology laboratory began routine species designation of coagulase-negative staphylococci in 2011.</s><s>Thus, we analyzed the rate of linezolid resistance among S. epidermidis bloodstream isolates starting in 2011 and found a statistically significant increase beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Given that linezolid use has previously been shown to correlate with linezolid resistance in S. epidermidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, we determined the total amount of linezolid use at our hospital starting in 2007.</s><s>There was a significant increase in linezolid use over time, particularly between 2007 and 2010 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linezolid Resistance Was Primarily Found in ST5 Isolates</head><p><s>To determine whether linezolid resistance was restricted to a specific S. epidermidis subtype, we determined the MLST of our 176 invasive isolates.</s><s>Consistent with published data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, 3 major clonal complexes (CCs) accounted for the majority of infections (CC2, CC5, and CC83) (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>However, CC5 strains made up nearly 50% of our isolates, an unusually high percentage compared with other reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s>Linezolid resistance was identified in 39 strains (22%) with the vast majority of resistance occurring in ST5 isolates, with the remainder present in ST2, ST6, and ST22 strains (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The 90% MIC for the LR isolates was ‚â•256 mg/L, consistent with high-level linezolid resistance.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole-Genome Characterization of a cfr-Containing LR ST5 S. epidermidis</head><p><s>Because the MLST data showed both linezolid-susceptible and -resistant ST5 strains, we could not distinguish between adaptation of previously susceptible strains to linezolid vs spread of a LR clone.</s><s>Thus, to determine the evolutionary and genomic mechanisms that contributed to the proliferation of LR ST5 S. epidermidis, we determined the complete genome of strain MB151, which was the first ST5 LR strain from our collection.</s><s>The MB151 genome is comprised of an approximately 2.5-mb circular chromosome along with 3 plasmids (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A and  3B</ref>).</s><s>MB151 differs from other complete S. epidermidis genomes primarily in its phage content and in the region of the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>We identified cfr on a 49-kb plasmid, pMB151a, which was confirmed by S1 nuclease digestion followed by hybridization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>; Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>pMB151a showed significant sequence similarity to various plasmids previously reported from staphylococci including near 100% identity over 6000 bp in the cfr-containing region with plasmid pSS-01 from Staphylococcus cohnii isolated from swine in China (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>Additional antibiotic resistance genes present in pMB151a included the bifunctional aaC(6 π)-Ie-aph(2 π π)-Ia gene mediating aminoglycoside resistance and dfrC, which encodes for resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolution of Clonal LR S. epidermidis Revealed Through WGS</head><p><s>Using strain MB151 as a reference, we constructed a whole-genome phylogeny of all 176 isolates, which clearly revealed a dominant, LR subclade of 29 ST5 strains, which we have called ST5R for resistant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Strains within the ST5R lineage were separated from each other by an average of &lt;2 SNPs.</s><s>Two LR ST6 strains also clustered with the ST5R isolates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>), as ST6 varies from ST5 by only a single-nucleotide variant in the gtr gene.</s><s>Linezolid-susceptible ST5 strains, which we have termed ST5S for susceptible, also clustered tightly and were clearly separated from the ST5R strains using multiple methodologies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>; Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 and 5</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we detected ST2, ST5, and ST22 strains, which were genetically most closely related to a linezolid-susceptible strain and distinct from the ST5R strains, suggesting that these strains had evolved from genetically diverse parental strains (see isolated arrows in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>The ST5R isolates exhibited multidrug resistance including to methicillin, levofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and gentamicin (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the vast majority of LR S. epidermidis was due to a clone that had likely been transferred to patients on multiple occasions rather than independently arising from linezolid-susceptible isolates.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Clinical Correlation Between Linezolid Use and Infection by ST5R Strains</head><p><s>The near-genetic identity of the ST5R strains suggested that coming into contact with the strain, rather than linezolid exposure, might be the main contributing factor to infection with LR S. epidermidis.</s><s>Indeed, all but 2 of the patients infected by an ST5R isolate had leukemia, which is treated in a distinct area of our hospital.</s><s>To examine the potential role of linezolid use, we compared the amount of linezolid received at 30, 60, and 90 days preceding infection.</s><s>We limited our analysis to ST5 strains as nearly all of the patients infected by these strains had a hematologic malignancy and thus would be expected to have similar clinical characteristics.</s><s>Among the 56 ST5 isolates, 79% of patients with a LR isolate received linezolid within the preceding 90 days, in comparison to 19% of those with linezolid-susceptible isolates (P &lt; .001).</s><s>Similarly, the cumulative exposure to linezolid in the preceding 90 days was significantly higher among patients with LR isolates (median, 12 days) compared with those with sensitive isolates (median, 0 days; P &lt; .001; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>No significant difference in categorical or cumulative daptomycin exposure was observed (data not shown).</s><s>Similar findings were observed at 30 and 60 days for both antimicrobials (data not shown).</s><s>Together with our whole-genome analyses, these data suggest that both exposure to an ST5R strain and prior linezolid use drive infection by ST5R isolates rather than adaption of a previously colonizing S. epidermidis strain to linezolid.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of cfr Expansion in the Microbiome of Leukemia Patients Treated With Linezolid</head><p><s>Our data to this point led us to hypothesize that linezolid exposure in patients with leukemia could result in a proliferation of staphylococci in the commensal microbiota that might ultimately lead to an infection with LR S. epidermidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, we analyzed 16S rRNA data of serial stool samples from our previously published cohort of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>We sought to identify patients whose gastrointestinal microbiome became dominated by staphylococci over the course of the study (see Materials and Methods for definition of staphylococcal emergence).</s><s>Of 98 patients, 10 met our criteria for staphylococcal emergence.</s><s>The median duration of linezolid use in the patients with staphylococcal emergence was significantly higher compared with patients who did not experience staphylococcal emergence (P &lt; .001</s><s>by Mann-Whitney test; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, all of the patients with staphylococcal emergence associated with linezolid therapy received linezolid prior to having staphylococcal proliferation (examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>We observed no significant relationship between daptomycin use and staphylococcal emergence (data not shown).</s><s>As our 16S rRNA data could not determine which staphylococcal species was emerging, we tested the stool samples using quantitative PCR with primers specific for S. epidermidis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> and identified 6 patients in whom staphylococcal dominance was due to S. epidermidis (data not shown).</s><s>Next, we measured the amount of cfr in the stool samples and found a marked increase in cfr during or following linezolid therapy in 5 of the 6 cases (example shown in (green), SEI (light blue), 14.1.R1 (turquoise), 1457 (dark blue), and BPH0662 (pink).</s><s>Reference genome landmarks for MB151 are labeled including the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette composite island (SCC-CI).</s><s>B, Three plasmids identified by sequencing including one with cfr.</s><s>C, S1 nuclease assay followed by cfr hybridization with cfr band identified at ~49 kb as predicted by sequencing data.</s><s>Lanes 2-5 are serial isolates of MB151 collected during prolonged bacteremia.</s><s>Lane 6 is an ST5 S. epidermidis strain that lacked cfr by sequencing data.</s><s>Lanes 7 and 8 are strains harboring cfr in plasmids.</s><s>Lane 7 is Enterococcus faecalis 603-50427X <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> and lane 8 is Staphylococcus aureus 004-737X <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s>D, Atlas for cfr-containing plasmid pMB151a.</s><s>Innermost circles are as detailed for panel (A).</s><s>Areas of significant homology between pMB151a are identified for the following plasmids: Staphylococcus cohnii pSS-01 (pink), S. epidermidis 426-3147L (light blue), Staphylococcus scuri pSCFS1 (dark blue), S. epidermidis SAP108A (red), and S. aureus pMI (yellow).</s><s>Green indicates location of cfr.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>, with all patients shown in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>The single patient who had staphylococcal emergence but did not have cfr identified in their stool had not received linezolid.</s><s>Taken together, we conclude that domination of the gastrointestinal microbiome by cfr-containing S. epidermidis can occur following linezolid therapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Here, we sought to merge the strengths of molecular and clinical epidemiology by performing WGS on a large number of invasive S. epidermidis isolates combined with patient-specific data to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying proliferation of LR S. epidermidis.</s><s>Our data indicate that a combination of a significant increase in linezolid use along with transmission of a LR S. epidermidis clone resulted in high rates of linezolid resistance among invasive S. epidermidis.</s><s>Our approach of combining microbiome and genomic analyses to investigate the emergence of a multidrug-resistant pathobiont provides a pathway for investigating the spread of a broad array of antimicrobial-resistant organisms in the healthcare setting.</s></p><p><s>Given the high prevalence of S. epidermidis as a human commensal and the diverse genetic background of S. epidermidis isolates <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>, the highly clonal nature of our invasive isolates was surprising.</s><s>For example, we identified numerous instances of invasive S. epidermidis strains differing by 0 or 1 SNPs over the 2.5 million base pair genome.</s><s>However, less sensitive genetic epidemiology methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and MLST have also indicated that invasive S. epidermidis strains can be highly clonal, with ST2, ST5, and ST83 being most common <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25]</ref>.</s><s>A recent report from France that used WGS also indicated clonal transmission of LR S. epidermidis, although it failed to distinguish among the ST5R and ST5S genotypes, possibly due to the small number of isolates characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Conversely, analysis of the skin data from the Human Microbiome Project, which sampled healthy human volunteers, showed highly diverse S. epidermidis strains and only identified a single instance of a colonizing ST5 strain and no ST2 or ST83 strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Recent information helps reconcile this discrepancy as serial sampling of patients admitted from the community found a lack of hospital-associated S. epidermidis clones  upon admission but rapid colonization of patients' skin with such organisms after 3 days in the hospital <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, patients are likely exposed to, colonized by, and infected with isolates belonging to clonal, hospital-adapted lineages, supporting the assumption of a healthcare-transmitted origin that may be susceptible to strict infection control practices.</s></p><p><s>In addition to being exposed to a LR S. epidermidis clone, linezolid use seems to play an important role in dissemination of resistant strains.</s><s>Indeed, our microbiome and antibiotic use data show that prolonged linezolid exposure is strongly associated with proliferation of S. epidermidis in the microbiome (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>) and with infection by an LR strain of S. epidermidis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>).</s><s>Together with our identification of highly related clones of LR S. epidermidis, these data lead us to postulate that linezolid removes competing microflora, resulting in a permissive environment for proliferation of a LR S. epidermidis clone.</s><s>Moreover, our microbiome data do not indicate that linezolid use removes linezolid-susceptible staphylococci, as we observed essentially no staphylococci in the commensal microbiota prior to linezolid initiation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>).</s><s>Identification of the precise microflora critical to controlling staphylococcal emergence is an ongoing effort in our laboratory that could help explain susceptibility to or even be used to prevent invasive S. epidermidis disease.</s></p><p><s>The ST5 clone causing the majority of our infections carries a heretofore undescribed plasmid that has significant homology to numerous staphylococcal plasmids, including pSS-01 from S. cohnii containing cfr <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>pSS-01 was originally identified in a strain isolated in 2010 from swine in China and has since been described in various coagulase-negative staphylococci causing human infections in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Like pMB151a, in pSS-01 cfr is flanked by IS256-like elements that appear capable of mediating excision and integration of cfr.</s><s>Recently, LR S. aureus strains causing human infection and containing a similar Cfr-encoding DNA element were identified in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>, indicating that coagulase-negative staphylococci could serve as a source of linezolid resistance in S. aureus.</s><s>Fortunately, it appears that pMB151a is not capable of such dissemination.</s><s>However, the ability of the ST5R clone to cause numerous invasive infections over the past several years suggests that it could either be present in or spread to other healthcare settings, leading to a marked increase in linezolid resistance.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we present here the largest whole-genome analysis of invasive S. epidermidis isolates to date.</s><s>Our results provide a framework for understanding how antimicrobials can promote the emergence of AMR in typically commensal organisms that can become major healthcare-associated pathogens.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
