<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Patients.</s><s>This study was conducted under the approval of institutional review board, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.</s><s>A total of 83 chronic hepatitis B patients receiving long-term telbivudine were analyzed retrospectively.</s><s>These patients were under regular out-patient follow-ups at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Liver Clinic.</s><s>The duration of telbivudine treatment was &gt;2 years for all patients enrolled.</s><s>The clinical data was collected by reviewing medical records.</s><s>The KLK8 protein levels and eGFR changes before and after &gt;2 years of treatment were assayed and compared Measurement of KLK8 protein levels.</s><s>KLK8 protein levels were assayed using human plasma samples derived from patients before or after telbivudine treatment.</s><s>Plasma samples were retrospectively retrieved from the serum bank, Liver Research Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</s><s>Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (AMRESCO, Inc., Solon, OH, USA).</s><s>Equal amounts of protein were loaded on gels.</s><s>Proteins were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane.</s><s>Western blot analysis was performed using KLK8 antibody (Bioss Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) overnight at 4˚C.</s><s>Blots were washed and incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibody.</s><s>Enhanced chemiluminescence was applied for signal detection.</s><s>The density of Western-blot bands was quantified using GeneTools Image Software.</s><s>All experiments were technically repeated more than twice.</s><s>Representative blots are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>There were totally 83 patients receiving telbivudine treatment for chronic hepatitis B for at least 2 years.</s><s>The baseline characteristics of these patient are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">I</ref>.</s><s>Of these 83 patients, all had paired KLK8 data before and after treatment, whereas only 53 patients had paired eGFR data.</s><s>The KLK8 and eGFR levels in each patient were compared before and after treatment.</s><s>Both serum KLK8 and eGFR levels were increased significantly after &gt;2-years of telbivudine therapy (paired t-test before and after treatment: KLK8, p&lt;0.001; eGFR, p=0.001) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B and C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The KLK8 protein levels were analyzed by linear regression in relation to age, gender, duration of treatment, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), HBV e antigen (HBeAg), antibody against HBeAg (anti-HBe), initial HBV DNA levels, serum total bilirubin, liver cirrhosis, albumin, body height (BH), body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">II</ref>).</s><s>Univariate analysis revealed that the change of KLK8 protein levels was significantly correlated to AST (p=0.012),</s><s>ALT (p=0.017),</s><s>BH (p=0.030), and BW (p=0.018).</s><s>Multivariate analysis including variables with p&lt;0.1 revealed increase of KLK8 protein levels was positively associated with AST (p=0.004) and BH (p=0.008).</s></p><p><s>Accordingly, the change of eGFR levels was analyzed by linear regression in relation to age, gender, duration of treatment, AST, ALT, HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBV DNA levels, serum total bilirubin, liver cirrhosis, albumin, initial KLK8 levels, final KLK8 levels, changes of KLK8 levels, BH, BW and BMI (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref>).</s><s>Univariate analysis revealed that the change of eGFR levels was significantly correlated with gender (p=0.009),</s><s>BH (p=0.002), and BW (p=0.006).</s><s>Multivariate analysis including variables with p&lt;0.1 revealed that the increase of eGFR levels was positively associated with final KLK8 levels (p=0.017) and negatively associated with BH (p&lt;0.001).</s></p><p><s>According to these data, no direct correlation between the increase in KLK8 levels and the increase in eGFR levels was found.</s><s>However, eGFR change was positively associated with the post treatment KLK8 levels following adjustment for BH (Linear regression, p&lt;0.001) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We further analyzed the relation between initial the KLK8 value (before telbivudine treatment) and BH.</s><s>It was found that KLK8 initial value was negatively correlated with BH (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study, serum KLK8 levels were found to be significantly increased after prolonged telbivudine treatment.</s><s>However, despite that both KLK8 and eGFR were increased after treatment, there was no simple linear in vivo 32: 955-960 (2018) correlation between the two changes.</s><s>Instead, correlation was found between BH-adjusted, post-treatment KLK8 levels and eGFR changes.</s><s>The relation between the initial KLK8 value (before telbivudine treatment) and BH was further examined.</s><s>It was found that KLK8 initial value was also correlated with BH (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, KLK8 levels are a BH-dependent factor and adjustment by BH is needed when correlation with other clinical factors is assessed.</s><s>The present results suggested that after telbivudine treatment, KLK8 levels had to increase to a certain level (posttreatment KLK8 level, adjusted by BH), before significant eGFR increase could occur, while a simple increase of KLK8 levels, if will not reach a sufficient degree, will not associate with eGFR change.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, in the mostly used equation for eGFR, the MDRD equation, BH is not an independent predictor for eGFR <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the finding that the eGFR change was positively associated with the post-treatment KLK8 levels, following adjustment for BH, was not biased by the association between eGFR and BH.</s></p><p><s>KLK8 is a biomarker for prognosis of several cancers (4, 5).</s><s>And, the results of the present study indicate that an increase of KLK8 protein levels occurs after long term telbivudine treatment.</s><s>Assuming that KLK8 plays a role in pathogenesis of cancers, the telbivudine-induced increase of KLK8 levels can influence the prognosis or associate with progression/regression of the related cancers.</s><s>Alternatively, telbivudine usage could interfere with the predictive value of KLK8 as a prognostic marker.</s><s>In the treatment of several cancers, chemotherapy is associated with hepatitis B reactivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and antiviral therapy is recommended in all therapeutic guidelines.</s><s>The present study suggests that  telbivudine might be a better choice for this purpose in certain type of cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> and ovarian cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, where the increase of KLK8 has been associated with a better prognosis.</s></p><p><s>in vivo 32: 955-960 (2018)</s></p><note type="other">958</note></div>
