<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>The Euro-Esli study was an exploratory, pooled analysis of data from European clinical practice studies (both prospective and retrospective) that evaluated the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of ESL as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures.</s><s>There were no exclusion criteria for the studies chosen for the analysis in terms of the epilepsy type of the patients studied and/or the number of prior AEDs they had received.</s><s>Effectiveness was assessed after 3, 6, and 12 months of ESL treatment and at final follow-up.</s><s>Safety and tolerability were assessed for the duration of ESL treatment.</s><s>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Universitario y Politécnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain, as an extension of the local audit.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study assessments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effectiveness</head><p><s>Assessments of effectiveness comprised: retention, evaluated in terms of retention rate and time to ESL discontinuation; number and type of seizures (total, simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>); the percentage reduction from baseline in monthly seizure frequency (for total, simple partial, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures); responder rate; seizure freedom rate; and the percentage of patients whose seizure frequency remained unchanged and whose seizure frequency worsened, relative to baseline.</s><s>At baseline (i.e., prior to ESL initiation), monthly seizure frequency was calculated based on the number of seizures experienced during the previous 3 months.</s><s>At other timepoints, monthly seizure frequency was based on the number of seizures experienced since the previous visit, i.e., during the previous 3 months for the 3and 6-month visits and during the previous 6 months for the 12-month visit.</s><s>For the final assessment, monthly seizure frequency was based on the last visit, which could have been at 3, 6, or 12 months; therefore, seizure frequency at the last visit was based on the number of seizures experienced during at least the previous 3 months.</s><s>Response was defined as ≥50% seizure frequency reduction from baseline and seizure freedom was defined as the occurrence of no seizures since at least the prior visit (either 3 or 6 months).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety and tolerability</head><p><s>Safety was assessed by the evaluation of adverse events (AEs) and tolerability was assessed by evaluating the discontinuation of ESL due to AEs.</s><s>AEs reported by participating clinicians were also classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version <ref type="bibr">16.0 [31]</ref>.</s><s>AEs were classified as being related to ESL treatment if they started after ESL initiation and were considered by the participating clinician(s) to be ESL-related.</s><s>Certain AEs of special interest were also assessed, which were hyponatremia, psychiatric AEs, and the presence of ESL-related AEs in patients with poor tolerance to previous AEDs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional assessments</head><p><s>Additional assessments included evaluation of information relating to ESL dosing, ESL treatment adherence, and changes to concomitant treatment(s) (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) after initiation of ESL treatment.</s><s>Information on treatment adherence was collected in clinical charts.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subgroup analyses</head><p><s>Several subgroup analyses of the pooled data were conducted.</s><s>These included, first, analysis of data for elderly patients (≥65 years) versus non-elderly patients (&lt;65 years); second, comparison of the subgroups of patients who were using, versus not using, other sodium channel blockers (SCBs) during ESL treatment; and third, assessment of outcomes in terms of how refractory to treatment the patients were at baseline, where refractoriness was defined in terms of the number of baseline AEDs patients were receiving when ESL was initiated (less than two versus at least two concomitant AEDs).</s></p><p><s>For all subgroup analyses, effectiveness was assessed as responder and seizure freedom rates (as previously defined), safety was assessed by evaluating AEs, and tolerability was assessed by evaluating discontinuation of ESL due to AEs.</s></p></div>
