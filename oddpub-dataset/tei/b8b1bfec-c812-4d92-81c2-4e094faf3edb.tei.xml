<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RF Hardware</head><p><s>This study was conducted with a wide-bore (70 cm) 3T whole-body MR system (MAGNE-TOM Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a gradient system that offers a maximum slew rate of 200 mT/m/ms and a maximum gradient strength of 45 mT/m.</s><s>Three RF coil configurations were employed: 4TX/4RX: Four-channel local transceiver surface RF coil array.</s><s>A local transceiver RF coil array (4TX/4RX) comprising four loop elements meeting the needs of patient comfort and ease of clinical use was built (f 0 = 123 MHz).</s><s>The four coil loops were constructed on two slightly curved lightweight formers to conform to an average torso.</s><s>Two pairs of rectangular loops were mounted each on the anterior and the posterior former (Fig 1A <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">-1C</ref>).</s><s>The loop size was set to H-F = 180 mm and L-R = 120 mm to enable whole heart coverage and appropriate depth penetration <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Coil decoupling for neighboring loops was achieved by a common conductor with a shared decoupling capacitor (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>After tuning and matching the largest reflection and coupling parameters of the RF coil, (n = 5 subjects) were S 11 = -10 dB and S 34 = -21 dB.</s><s>The RF transmit power was provided by an RF amplifier (P max = 8 kW, Anaren1, Syracuse New York, USA) and was equally split by hybrid couplers (Stark Contrast, Erlangen, Germany) into four feeding ports highlighted by the red numbers in Fig 1B <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">and 1C</ref>.</s><s>With the four independent feeding ports the transceiver array offers three degrees of freedom for basic B 1 + -phase shimming, which was realized by inserting phase shifting cables into the transmit path between the power splitter and the transmit/receive switch (Stark Contrast, Erlangen, Germany).</s><s>BC/4RX: Large volume TX body RF coil in conjunction with a four-channel RX surface array.</s><s>For this configuration a large volume body RF coil (BC) was used for transmission (f 0 = 123 MHz).</s><s>The body RF coil is a birdcage volume RF coil consisting of 16 equidistant rungs with a total length of 45 cm (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>The body RF coil is driven by a 35 kW RF power amplifier at two feeding ports.</s><s>The RF phase between these ports is fixed resulting in an elliptical polarized excitation without allowing modifications of the B 1 + -field distribution.</s><s>To facilitate high receive sensitivities, signal reception was performed with a home-built four-channel receive-only RF coil array (4RX, f 0 = 123 MHz).</s><s>This receive array resembles the geometry of the 4TX/4RX RF coil (Fig 1D  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> were included (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>With a total simulation mesh cell number of 34 million for Duke and 30 million for Ella the mesh resolution inside the body models was ~3 mm in the axial plane and ~5 mm along the z-direction.</s><s>To consider potential interactions a detuned model of the 4RX RF coil was incorporated in the simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For EMF simulations of the 4TX/4RX setup the voxel models Duke and Ella were truncated along the head-feet axis (Fig 1B <ref type="figure">)</ref> to save computational time.</s><s>The total mesh count was 28 and 23 million mesh cells for Duke and Ella, which translates into an isotropic mesh resolution of ~2 mm inside the body models.</s></p><p><s>For all simulations k = max(SAR 10g )/P in was calculated and transferred to the scanner, which uses it to determine the maximum RF input power P in = P forward −P reflected for the in vivo measurements according to the IEC guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>To avoid dominating local SAR hotspots for the local TX/RX coil, the distance between the RF coil array and the body surface of the human voxel was adapted.</s><s>For this purpose a distance of 1cm between the body and the RF coil array was realized for the anterior section.</s><s>For the posterior coil section a distance of 2 cm between the body surface and the RF coil array was accomplished.</s></p><p><s>Transmit Phase Settings for the Four-Channel TX/RX RF Coil Array Phase setting F 1 .</s><s>This phase setting was derived from in vivo data obtained for a healthy male subject (54 years, BMI: 24 kg/m²) with a parallel TX system (3T MAGNETOM Verio, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany).</s><s>Relative transmit phase maps <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> of each channel were acquired for a four-chamber view of the heart.</s><s>The relative transmit phase of each channel was averaged inside a ROI accommodating the heart.</s><s>The differences of these calculated phase shifts were compensated in order to induce maximal constructive B 1 + -interference in the given ROI.</s><s>Hence F 1 maximizes B 1 + -efficiency in the heart and does not take B 1 + -homogeneity nor local SAR 10g considerations into account.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F 1 : φ 1 = 0°, φ 2 = −265°, φ 3 = −92°, φ 4 = −358°P hase setting F

Duke and Ella and interpolated on an equidistant 3 mm grid.</s><s>A matrix A was generated containing all N voxels of Duke's and Ella's heart for all channels resulting in a (N x 4) matrix, so that B

averages <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>With these (4 x 4)-SAR-matrices for both simulation models (Duke and Ella), a merit function f(F) was constructed to optimize B 1 + -homogeneity versus B 1 + -efficiency and local SAR 10g : As part of the validation of the phase optimization an isotropic raster search was performed using phase increments of 5°to examine each sub-term with varying β.</s><s>For β !</s><s>0.6 a balance between B 1 + -homogeneity, B 1 + -efficiency and SAR was observed, meaning that the phase setting to reach this balance stays unchanged.</s><s>The TX phase setting deduced from the raster search (0°,-270°,-145°,-25°) and from the optimization procedure (0°,-271°,-142°,-25°) were equivalent (within a 3°variance), demonstrating that the optimization
