V. [www.betweenkompas.de]).</s><s>Furthermore, a minority (38/121; 31%) use information technology to facilitate communication with YP; mainly Short Message Service (SMS), web platforms, email, or apps and the remainder tend to communicate by telephone.</s></p><p><s>Among the rheumatology centers from different models of care, some differences regarding transition care were observed.</s><s>In comparison to children's hospitals, University affiliated practices provided somewhat less often transition services (69% vs. 78%), had less often a written transition policy (22% vs. 41%) and used significantly less frequently a checklist as part of individualized transitional care (23% vs. 48%, p = 0.011).</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is a pragmatic attempt to compare the data from our survey and previous published data from North America <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Notably the majority of North American respondents (89%) work in a University-affiliated practice in contrast to 49% of their European colleagues (p &lt; 0.01; 99% CI: 0.29, 0.49).</s><s>Current transitional care services in Europe and North America show significant differences; the presence of a designated staff member who coordinates transition (64% in Europe vs 30% in North America; p &lt; 0.01; 99% CI: -0.45, −0.22) and the availability of a  written transition policy (26% in Europe vs 8% in North America; p &lt; 0.001; 99% CI: -0.26, −0.08).</s><s>Nevertheless, the percent of informal transition process is similar across surveys (46% vs. 42%; non-significant).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This is the first survey to focus on the current practices (rather than solely attitudes or opinions) in transitional care among European pediatric rheumatology providers.</s></p><p><s>As in other chronic diseases that start in childhood, YP with jRMD need specific care during the period of transition from pediatric services to the adult specialty care setting.</s><s>However, research about current practice and the implementation of transition recommendations are scarce and almost half of the YP with jRMD do not make a successful transfer to adult rheumatology and are, therefore, at increased risk of unfavorable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, EULAR/PReS recommendations were issued for transitional care throughout Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>These recommendations were published after the e-survey was conducted and so our data serve as useful benchmark of current practice.</s><s>The recommendations highlight the need for a written transition policy, and yet less than a third of respondents in our survey indicated that their department had a formal transition program; an 'informal approach' was reported to be more common although further information was not given in the survey.</s><s>It is hoped that the use of the recommendations and a consistent approach to the transition program is more likely to address the structure, assessments of patient readiness and service outcomes.</s><s>We note that only a small percentage of transition clinics receive funding or reimbursement for the service and it is possible that one barrier to implement more ambitious transition programs may be insufficient resources.</s><s>Interestingly, the EULAR/PReS recommendations include the need to secure funding for provision of transitional care, in order to avoid some of the major barriers as highlighted by the North American survey and a frequent shortcoming in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The presence of a transition coordinator is another key element of transition and one of the EULAR/PReS recommendations; the aim being to ensure implementation and evaluation of the transition program and improving communication between health professionals, YP and families <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Most respondents of the survey have a designated staff member as transition coordinator.</s><s>However, in contrast to the recommendations, emphasizing the important role of allied health professionals in transition coordination, we note that the designated staff member is often a doctor rather than a nurse, youth worker or other professional.</s><s>The EULAR/PReS recommendations do not specify whether the coordinator is a doctor or allied health professional but that the individual is clearly identified within the team and has the appropriate skills to facilitate liaison between the pediatric and the adult care teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Information and education of YP about their disease, treatments and promotion of independent visits to clinic without parents are ideal components of an individualized transition plan.</s><s>However, it is important to include systematically other important areas of adolescence health, such as risk behavior, substance use, sports, nutrition or sexuality.</s><s>The HEADSS assessment (Home, Education/ Employment, peer group, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/depression) was developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and has since been successfully used to facilitate communication with YP and as guide to cover all topics pertinent to young people in the transition process.</s><s>However, to address all relevant transition issues, it might be necessary to have a multidisciplinary team (i.e., psychologist to handle mental health or physiotherapist to advice about sports and routine exercises).</s><s>This approach is clearly recommended in the EULAR/PReS document <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Our survey revealed that currently only a minority of centers offers multidisciplinary transitional care services; 35% of the centers have a nurse, 15% a psychologist and 8% a social worker available for addressing transition-relevant issues.</s></p><p><s>Our survey did not specifically address timing of transfer.</s><s>However, it should be noted that only 9.5% use a readiness instrument to validate transfer, reflecting the informal approach to transition in the majority of centers.</s><s>This issue was heavily discussed in the development of the EULAR/PReS recommendations, as some countries had a designated age for transfer in all cases and independently of YP readiness.</s><s>Ultimately the EULAR/ PReS recommendations propose that age per se is not specifically used as the trigger for timing of the transfer.</s><s>Conversely, age is an important indicator for the initiation of transitional care; namely that the transition process should start as early as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>The recommendations also propose strategies to facilitate transfer including communication with adult services before actual transfer with relevant information about the YP or shared clinics between pediatric and adult health care professionals.</s><s>In this way, the timing of transfer could be more flexible, and could be deferred until the disease is stable and/or the transition team consider the patient to be "ready".</s></p><p><s>Where possible and with the questions that can be compared, we were able to comment on differences between European and North American respondents.</s><s>European providers more often do have a transition coordinator (often a doctor) and are more likely to use a written transition policy statement.</s><s>In both surveys, respondents manifest a strong desire for rheumatologyspecific guidelines for transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and for these to be implemented across pediatric, adolescent and adult rheumatology health care settings.</s></p><p><s>In summary, this survey has demonstrated limitations of existing transition practices and paucity of resources.</s><s>Nonetheless there is a strong commitment within the rheumatology communities (both adult and pediatric), to improve existing transitional care provision.</s><s>The EULAR/ PReS recommendations are therefore timely and important as a much needed catalyst for change within the rheumatology community.</s></p></div>
