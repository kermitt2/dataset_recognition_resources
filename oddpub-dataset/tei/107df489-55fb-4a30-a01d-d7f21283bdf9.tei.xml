<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>BACKGROUND: Giant thoracic disc herniation (gTDH) is a rare condition.</s><s>It is defined by a herniation that occupies at least 40% of the thoracic spinal canal and is usually calcified.</s><s>Several surgical techniques have been described to date but this surgery remains a technically difficult procedure.</s><s>OBJECTIVE: To report the long-term outcome of 53 patients with myelopathy due to gTDH who were operated on by a thoracoscopic approach.</s><s>The technical details of the preoperative assessment and the surgical procedure are presented.</s><s>METHOD: We present a retrospective study of a database of 53 patients operated for symptomatic gTDH by a thoracoscopic approach.</s><s>The following clinical parameters were assessed initially and used during follow-up: Frankel grade and JOA score adapted to the thoracic spine (mJOA), pain in the lower limbs and limitation of the walking perimeter to less than 500 meters.</s><s>The quality of spinal cord decompression was assessed postoperatively by magnet resonance imaging (MRI).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS:</head><p><s>The mean follow-up was 78.1 mo (SD 49.4).</s><s>At the last follow-up visit, clinical examination showed a mean improvement of 0.91 Frankel grade (P &lt; .001)</s><s>and 2.56 mJOA score respectively (P &lt; .001).</s><s>Lower limb pain and walking perimeter were also improved.</s><s>Postoperative MRI revealed that the resection was complete in 35 cases, subtotal in 13 cases, and incomplete in 5 cases.</s><s>CONCLUSION: gTDH is a condition that often evolves favorably after surgery.</s><s>The thoracoscopic approach is a feasible alternative technique.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p><s>Our series consisted of 53 patients, whose preoperative clinical characteristics are detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Thirty-nine patients had preoperative limitation of their walking distance: This was assessed by the following question: "how many meters can you walk on a flat ground?"</s><s>We considered the patient was limited if he could not walk more than 500 meters.</s><s>Surgical treatment was offered in cases of initial severe myelopathy or deterioration of the neurological status during followup.</s><s>For patients with only slight symptoms at the time of the discovery of the herniation, the motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded to search for an infra-clinical myelopathy.</s><s>In this case, the surgical indication was considered if electrophysiological monitoring revealed new degradation during follow-up.</s><s>In our team, an endoscopic approach is always considered first except in cases with histories of pleural pathologies.</s><s>All our patients had a computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative stage.</s><s>These two examinations allowed us to appreciate the calcified nature of the herniation and its impact on the spinal cord.</s><s>The distribution of the lesions is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</s><s>One patient was operated at 2 levels during the same operative time.</s><s>Radiological data are listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>Spinal cord arteriography was performed in all cases in order to identify afferent arteries to the anterior spinal arterial axis.</s><s>This information was taken into account in the surgical planning.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Operative Technique for Giant TDH</head><p><s>The main steps of this surgery are similar to that of an open approach.</s><s>The patient is placed in lateral decubitus with an axillary roll and all pressure points are padded.</s><s>The side of approach is determined by the lateralization of the herniation, the presence of an arterial supply to the anterior spinal axis on the spinal cord angiogram, and the situation of the aorta if a left thoracoscopy is considered.</s><s>The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and requires ipsilateral pulmonary exclusion.</s><s>All patients of our series received intravenous methylprednisolone during surgery (on average 240 mg of methylprednisolone).</s><s>The main operator faces the patient and his assistant is positioned at the patient's back (see Video, Supplemental Digital Content).</s><s>The spinal level is determined in two ways: the first registration was originally performed preoperatively by placing a metal marker during a preoperative scan, the second check being performed at the beginning of the procedure by endopleural counting of the ribs.</s><s>Since September 2010, the preoperative installation of a radio opaque marker has been replaced by perioperative Multiplan acquisition (O-Arm).</s><s>Classically, 4 working channels are used: 1 for the camera, 2 operator channels, and 1 retractor for the pulmonary parenchyma or the diaphragm according to the treated level.</s></p><p><s>The posterior parietal pleura are incised with the monopolar on the lower border of the rib's head.</s><s>The intercostal vascular pedicle is coagulated and sectioned if it does not supply the spinal cord.</s><s>Bone resection begins with the resection of the lower rib head.</s><s>In our first cases, bone drilling began at the pedicle but the technique was later modified and the opening of the canal is now performed only at the end, after resection of the vertebral plates on both sides of the herniation in an oblique plane over the entire height of the herniation in the sagittal plane.</s><s>Bone drilling may be extended to the contralateral pedicle depending on the width of the herniation.</s><s>Drilling is planned according to the height of the herniation and must be large enough to allow visualization of the entire ventral dura.</s><s>Finally, the herniation is retracted anteriorly into the drilled cavity.</s><s>An illustration of the steps of bone resection is given in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, while Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> illustrates the modification adopted since 2006.</s><s>Once the posterior longitudinal ligament has been exposed, it is sharply opened, giving access to the anterior and lateral face of the dura.</s><s>The herniation then becomes slightly more mobile and its excision is most often carried out by fragmentation using micro-instruments dedicated to endoscopy</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION Decision Criteria for Surgical Treatment in Case of gTDH</head><p><s>Calcific TDH is one of the most dangerous procedures in spine surgery.</s><s>To perform it by thoracoscopy requires extensive experience.</s><s>If endoscopy is considered less invasive, the wish to diminish the surgical trauma should not lead to an undertreatment of the affection.</s><s>For this reason, this surgery should be performed only by surgeons with solid experience in endoscopic surgery, in centers with large experience.</s><s>For other cases, mini open approach seems to provide an acceptable alternative. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>n case of disabling myelopathy, it seems logical to offer surgery.</s><s>Surgical treatment may be more difficult to decide in cases of a large lesion in an asymptomatic patient: some will evolve towards a progressive myelopathy, while others will remain asymptomatic.</s><s>In rare cases, these lesions may resolve spontaneously and no predictive factors have been precisely identified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>For asymptomatic lesions, our attitude is to carry out regular neurological, radiological, and electrophysiological monitoring as it has been proven that electrophysiological degradation precedes  clinical degradation for degenerative pathologies with spinal cord stenosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>The addition of an anterior arthrodesis is variable in the literature.</s><s>Our attitude is to fuse it if more than 50% of the surface of the vertebral plate has been drilled, since biomechanical studies show a correlation between the extent of vertebral body damage and instability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>The decision for complementary arthrodesis was thus taken during the operation, according to the size of the bone resection.</s><s>Since September 2010, perioperative Multiplan acquisition by O-arm has allowed the extent of the bone resection to be ascertained as this was previously described by other authors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>This device also helps us at the beginning of the surgery for the identification of the level.</s><s>The 2 cases of level error occurred prior to the acquisition of this tool.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Measures</head><p><s>Many authors have published data about surgery of TDH but few series have focused on giant TDH.</s><s>It is a rare clinical entity, the surgical difficulty of which is greatly affected by its calcified nature and the large volume of the herniated disc.</s><s>Given that these patients tend to present with myelopathy and an already compromised spinal cord, careful planning of the procedure is critical.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> lists previously published series.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge, we report the largest series of patients operated for gTDH by thoracoscopy.</s><s>The majority of authors use the mJOA score, ASIA score or Frankel grade to evaluate postoperative findings.</s><s>In order to obtain a more complete view, we used other parameters, such as walking limitation, as some patients for whom no problem is revealed during consultation may nevertheless be limited after several minutes of walking.</s><s>Other factors, such as the presence of pain in the lower limbs, are not mentioned in the literature.</s><s>This pain, due to spinal cord compression, could lead to surgery, given that it is refractory to any treatment.</s><s>In our series, 58% of the patients complained of painful symptoms in the lower limbs and this was the main reason for consultation in 13% of the cases.</s><s>Although the endoscopic approach is considered less invasive, some of our patients reported parietal pain related to the surgical approach.</s><s>This was greatly improved in the second part of our experience by employing a single-use flexible trocar.</s><s>Like other authors, we find that one important prognostic factor is the severity of the initial myelopathy.</s></p><p><s>The influence of neuralgia is more surprising.</s><s>In fact, we think that patients who have this symptom come to consult earlier, when their myelopathy is less severe.</s></p><p><s>Another possible explanation is that those herniation are more lateralized and easier to access.</s></p><p><s>The presence of a transient neurological worsening is of classic finding in the surgery of tumors or vascular malformation of the thoracic spinal cord.</s><s>For permanent deficit, the role of the intraoperative neuromonitoring in the prevention of this outcome is controversial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>One patient of our series presented a rapidly evolving paraparesis over a few days.</s><s>He was operated emergently by thoracoscopy.</s><s>After the surgery, he presented a definitive paraplegia.</s><s>We reviewed the case and attributed the worsening to rapid decompensation of myelopathy aggravated by surgical intervention.</s><s>The risk of rapid decompensation of these lesions is very rare (4% to 15% of TDH operated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ), and, in our opinion, requires 2-stage surgery: first posterior decompression without attempting to resect the herniation and then removal of the lesion by thoracoscopic approach in the days that follow.</s><s>This strategy was adopted for 6 patients in the series and the clinical outcome was good. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Surgical Resection Technique</head><p><s>]<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> For this reason, all our surgical procedures are carried out with a cell saver system.</s><s>Initially, the approach to the epidural space was performed early, by resection of the pedicle, but we are currently using a more anterior approach and the posterior extension to the pedicle is added only if necessary.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the modification of our drilling technique.</s><s>On the other hand, the use of thrombin gel has proved to be a valuable aid in obtaining rapid hemostasis of epidural bleeding.</s><s>Therefore, blood loss due to this intervention was reduced from an average of 1100 mL for the first 18 cases to 413 mL after modification of the drilling technique.</s><s>The second limiting factor for the resection of these lesions is the transdural character of the herniation.</s><s>There is no reliable imaging finding that identifies this condition.</s><s>The issue of dural repair in the event of a durotomy was raised by Yoshihara <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> in a literature review and this risk is described by almost all authors who present their results on giant herniations.</s><s>Several modalities of repair were used during our endoscopic experience.</s><s>At the beginning of our experience, we used a local pleural flap.</s><s>Currently, we prefer a fascia lata flap held in place by biological glue.</s><s>In our series, one-third of the operated herniations were transdural.</s><s>When the lesion is easily mobilizable we continue the resection and perform a plasty at the end of the procedure according to the above-mentioned technique, then we fill the bony cavities with fat.</s><s>Sometimes the herniation cannot be dissected from the spinal cord and, in this situation, we prefer to leave the part of the herniation adherent to the spinal cord because of the high risk of neurological aggravation.</s><s>This was the case for 18 patients who had subtotal or incomplete resection.</s><s>In these cases, we left the resection chamber free without placing a graft in the cavity in order to promote spinal cord re-expansion.</s><s>The reappearance of perimedullary CSF spaces was observed in all cases of subtotal resection and in 4 out of 5 cases of incomplete resection.</s><s>The only case of insufficient decompression benefited from secondary laminoarthrectomy and posterior arthrodesis.</s><s>These 5 patients showed an improvement in postoperative neurological function at last follow-up.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>We present a series of 53 patients operated for giant calcified TDH.</s><s>These data provide a better understanding of this rare disease, which is technically difficult to treat.</s><s>We propose decision-making criteria and present the long-term evolution of these patients.</s><s>Preserving neurological function is the main goal of this functional surgery.</s><s>A subtotal or incomplete resection must be considered if the risk of neurological worsening is high and if spinal decompression has been achieved.</s><s>Our results suggest that the thoracoscopic approach is a valid therapeutic option in giant symptomatic TDHs.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1.
