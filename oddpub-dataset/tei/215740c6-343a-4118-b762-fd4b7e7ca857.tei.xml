<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p><s>Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk for smoking cigarettes, but there is little longitudinal research on the array of smoking characteristics known to be prognostic of long-term smoking outcomes into adulthood.</s><s>These variables were studied into early adulthood in a multisite sample diagnosed with ADHD combined type at ages 7-9.9 and followed prospectively alongside an age-and sex-matched local normative comparison group (LNCG).</s><s>Methods: Cigarette smoking quantity, quit attempts, dependence, and other characteristics were assessed in the longitudinal Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA) eight times to a mean age of 24.9 years: ADHD n = 469; LNCG n = 240.</s><s>Results: In adulthood, the ADHD group had higher rates of daily cigarette smoking, one or more quit attempts, shorter time to first cigarette of the day, and more severe withdrawal than the LNCG.</s><s>The ADHD group did not appear to have better smoking cessation rates despite a higher proportion quitting at least once.</s><s>Smoking quantity and nicotine dependence did not differ between groups.</s><s>The ADHD group reported younger daily smoking onset and faster progression from smoking initiation to daily smoking across assessments.</s><s>Finally, ADHD symptom severity in later adolescence and adulthood was associated with higher risk for daily smoking across assessments in the ADHD sample.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhoodonset disorder characterized by pervasive and functionally impairing inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Children with ADHD are more likely to smoke cigarettes in adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and adulthood, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> but little prospective longitudinal research has fully characterized their prognostically important smoking behaviors into adulthood when smoking patterns become more firmly established. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>As a result, little is known about the specific characteristics of smoking (eg, quantity, success in quitting) as smokers with childhood ADHD become adults.</s><s>One prospective study recently reported group differences in smoking characteristics as a function of childhood ADHD (eg, younger age of smoking initiation, faster progression to regular smoking), but nearly half of the sample was under 18 years old with a mean age of 17.75 years. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>As such, failure to find other group differences (eg, quit attempts) may have been hampered by a limited number of adults with prolonged smoking histories.</s><s>Indeed, the mean age of daily smoking onset is 18.2 years with about one-third of smokers progressing to daily smoking after age 18. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Studies that examine a broad array of smoking outcomes in adults are needed to better capture childhood ADHD smoking outcomes that do not fully emerge until adulthood.</s><s>The current study addresses this need with a prospectively studied multisite sample of children with ADHD followed to their mid-20s.</s></p><p><s>Although ADHD persists into adulthood for about 60% of children with ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and places individuals at risk for worse substance use outcomes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> the impact of ADHD symptom persistence over time with cigarette smoking is an understudied area.</s><s>Persistent ADHD was not associated with daily smoking in the Rhodes and colleagues sample, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> but this question needs to be examined in an adult sample.</s><s>Moreover, a dimensional approach to symptoms may provide a more sensitive analysis for daily smoking given the potential functional importance of subthreshold symptom persistence for ADHD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>The current study provides an important contribution by being the first to examine ADHD symptom severity over adolescence and into adulthood in relation to daily smoking-a smoking variable associated with significantly higher risk of adult death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>he longitudinal follow-up of the children in the Multimodal Treatment study of ADHD (MTA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> repeatedly assessed cigarette smoking through adolescence into early adulthood when participants were about 25 years old.</s><s>It therefore provides an opportunity to address the aforementioned gaps in the literature.</s><s>The MTA began as a 14-month randomized controlled trial of treatments for children with ADHD and continued as a prospective observational study with regular assessments for 16 years.</s><s>The MTA features a well-characterized, large multisite sample and a local normative comparison group (LNCG) of classmates matched for age and sex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>revious publications from the MTA demonstrate the high rates of daily smoking in late adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> in the ADHD group compared to the LNCG.</s><s>The MTA therefore provides an excellent opportunity to determine whether prognostically relevant smoking characteristics, such as high quantity of cigarette consumption, greater nicotine dependence, and failed quit attempts, are related to childhood ADHD.</s><s>Our first aim was to compare a variety of young adult smoking outcomes (ie, smoking quantity, nicotine dependence, quit attempts, a smoking relapse indicator variable, and withdrawal symptoms) between those with and without childhood ADHD.</s><s>Our second aim was to compare time to the following events between those with and without childhood ADHD: smoking initiation, daily smoking onset, and progression from initiation to daily smoking.</s><s>Across both of these aims, we predicted worse smoking outcomes among those with childhood ADHD compared to the LNCG, including earlier onset and more rapid smoking progression for the ADHD group than the LNCG.</s><s>Our third aim was to examine the association between ADHD symptom severity at different developmental stages (eg, adolescence and adulthood) and the probability of daily smoking over time within the ADHD sample.</s><s>We predicted a positive association between ADHD symptom severity and daily smoking through adolescence and early adulthood within the ADHD group.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tobacco Smoking</head><p><s>Tobacco smoking was assessed at each assessment with the selfreported Substance Use Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (SUQ) adapted for the MTA.</s><s>The SUQ assessed daily smoking in the past year, smoking amount in the past year (ie, about a half pack or more per day; about a full pack or more per day), quit attempts, and withdrawal symptoms (ie, craving, difficulty concentrating, and restlessness).</s><s>For analyses involving the 12-through 16-year assessments, participants were coded as daily smokers if they smoked "once a day" or more in response to "In the past year, how often did you smoke cigarettes?" or if they responded "yes" to "Are you currently a daily smoker?"</s><s>For the 2-through 10-year assessments, participants were coded as daily smokers if they smoked at least one cigarette per day in response to "During the past month, how many cigarettes have you smoked on an average day?"</s><s>Responses to the restlessness question were followed by, "Are you normally a restless person (i.e., don't like to sit for long periods of time, need to move about frequently)?" on a 4-point Likert scale.</s><s>We examined quit attempts among those who were ever weekly smokers for the 12-through 16-year assessments (i.e., those who responded "once a week or more" in response to "In the past year, how often did you smoke cigarettes?") given that there are significant health effects among such non-daily smokers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>Smoking initiation age was the earliest age when smoking was first endorsed or retrospectively reported.</s><s>Age of daily smoking onset was based on age at the time daily smoking was first reported.</s><s>Latency to daily smoking was the difference between these two variables.</s><s>Test-retest reliability of the SUQ smoking items is good (eg, kappa for ever tried cigarettes = .87). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nicotine Dependence Severity</head><p><s>The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> assessed nicotine dependence severity among daily smokers in adulthood.</s><s>Total scores ≥5 indicate moderate to high dependence.</s><s>The FTND is both reliable and valid in cigarette-smoking samples. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>The first item from the FTND assesses time to first cigarette upon waking (ie, ≤5 min, 6-30 min, 31-60 min, and ≥60 min).</s><s>This item was separately analyzed because it has predictive validity for smoking relapse during quit attempts and is an index of ability to quit smoking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>HD Symptom Severity ADHD symptom severity was assessed by collateral reporters (&gt;80% mothers) using common items from the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS).</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> These measures have adequate to excellent internal reliability (α ranging .71-.93 for the SNAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> and .74-.92 for the CAARS <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> ), as well as validity.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> The SNAP was administered 2 to 10 years after baseline for participants under age 18; the CAARS was administered at 8 to 16 years after baseline for participants age ≥18.</s><s>The 18 DSM-IV items from the SNAP were matched with parallel CAARS items.</s><s>Response options ranged from 0 (not at all/ never) to 3 (very often/very frequently).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p><s>Aims 1 and 2 Analytic Plan Adulthood smoking outcomes were compared between ADHD and LNCG using ANOVA and logistic regression.</s><s>Progression of smoking initiation and daily smoking were examined via Cox proportional hazards regression.</s><s>As we have done elsewhere, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> household disadvantage was accounted for by including weighted effects-coded variables comparing children from two-parent households and at least one college-educated parent to the sample average (household advantage), and children from single-parent households with no college-educated parents to the sample average (household disadvantage).</s><s>Presence of a baseline diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct disorder (CD) was covaried as we have done in previous studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> as well as sex (Female=0, Male=1) and race (dummy-coded: Black=1, All other=0; Hispanic/Other/Mixed ethnicity=1, All other=0).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim 3 Analytic Plan</head><p><s>The longitudinal association between ADHD symptom severity and probability of daily smoking in the ADHD group was tested via latent growth modeling in Mplus v.8.0. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref></s><s>First, we established an appropriate model for change over time in daily smoking.</s><s>Preliminary data inspection suggested that the probability of daily smoking increased through adolescence but leveled off in adulthood.</s><s>We used a piecewise linear function of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> with an inflection or "knot" point at the 12-year assessment to separately estimate rates of change in daily smoking through adolescence up to the 12-year follow-up and in early adulthood after the 12-year follow-up.</s><s>Second, we estimated the association between ADHD symptom severity and daily smoking at each wave of assessment (a time-varying covariate relation), to determine whether more severe symptoms at specific points in time were linked to a greater chance of daily smoking at the same time.</s><s>As in our analyses for Aims 1 and 2, household (dis)advantage, baseline ODD or CD, sex, and race were included as covariates.</s><s>We also tested their effects on rates of change in daily smoking, but only retained statistically significant terms.</s><s>Diagonally weighted least squares estimation was used to obtain parameter estimates and standard errors.</s><s>Cases with missing values were retained and estimates were unbiased under a missing at random mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study was a longitudinal analysis of a multisite sample of children comprehensively diagnosed with ADHD and followed over eight assessment points into their mid-20s when smoking behaviors become more firmly established.</s><s>Our findings indicate that, by adulthood, those with childhood ADHD endorse higher rates of daily cigarette smoking, no differences in smoking cessation rates despite higher rates of quitting at least once, shorter time to first cigarette of the day (an index of greater likelihood of relapse during quit attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> ), and more severe smoking withdrawal symptoms.</s><s>Collectively, these findings are novel for a prospectively followed sample diagnosed with ADHD in childhood.</s><s>We speculate that greater withdrawal severity in the ADHD group is particularly relevant in the context of the results indicating greater difficulty quitting.</s><s>Additional findings were that group differences for daily smoking onset and progression to smoking were replicated, which extend past ADHD longitudinal studies in an older cohort.</s><s>The current study was also the first to demonstrate that ADHD symptom severity was associated with probability of daily smoking across adolescent and adulthood assessments, which suggests that management of ADHD symptoms over development may affect daily smoking rates.</s><s>We expand on these findings below.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age of Daily Smoking Onset</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Smoking Outcomes in Young Adulthood</head><p><s>Young adults with childhood ADHD experienced mixed smoking outcomes.</s><s>Rates of daily smoking were high (also reported in Molina et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> ), which extends prior findings to a multisite sample. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s>Contrary to cross-sectional findings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> the quantity of cigarettes smoked among daily smokers did not differ between groups.</s><s>However, this finding does replicate results from a single-site study that included younger participants at follow-up. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>ne possibility for these null findings is that group differences among daily smokers may emerge as individuals continue to age into their 30s.</s><s>Another possibility is that cigarette smokers with a history of ADHD may less accurately report on their smoking behavior.</s><s>In addition to cigarette smokers' inaccuracy recalling specific aspects of smoking behavior, including the number of cigarettes smoked, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> individuals with a history of ADHD are often inaccurate reporters of their own behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref></s><s>Future studies of smoking in real time, such as ecological momentary assessments, could address this methodological limitation.</s><s>These explanations should be examined prior to concluding that smoking quantity is not higher among daily smokers with a history of childhood ADHD.</s></p><p><s>Nicotine dependence did not differ between the ADHD group and LNCG.</s><s>These findings are consistent with some, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> but not other longitudinal studies of ADHD cohorts that either included nonsmokers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> or smaller sample sizes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s>Mean scores on the same measure (ie, FTND) were comparable in other ADHD cohorts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> but relatively lower than national trends. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s>Overall, these findings suggest that children with well-characterized ADHD, and prospectively followed to smoker status in adulthood, have similar levels of nicotine dependence as their peers without a history of ADHD.</s><s>In contrast, the ADHD group reported more severe withdrawal symptoms (ie, craving, difficulty concentrating, and restlessness).</s><s>Here again, findings from the MTA converge with Rhodes and colleagues' report that also found greater difficulty concentrating and craving during periods of abstinence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Together, these parallel findings across two prospectively followed ADHD cohorts may indicate that rates of nicotine dependence are not higher in ADHD, but ADHD is more relevant when withdrawal symptoms emerge following periods of smoking abstinence.</s></p><p><s>Results pertaining to aspects of smoking cessation were among the most novel findings of adult smoking outcomes that have yet to be identified in prospective studies of childhood diagnosed ADHD.</s><s>Adult smokers with childhood ADHD more often reported attempting to quit at least once compared to the LNCG.</s><s>In contrast to previous research, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> we may have detected this difference because our participants were older, which extended the timeframe for observation of quit attempts.</s><s>We also found that despite differences in quit attempts, the ADHD group did not appear to have better smoking cessation rates-this suggests that the ADHD group was more likely to relapse when they attempted to quit.</s><s>This interpretation is consistent with the finding that the ADHD group had a shorter time to first cigarette, which is a potent predictor of smoking relapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>ore failed quit attempts for adults with ADHD histories may reflect their increased difficulties with withdrawal symptoms, particularly when those symptoms appear to be an unmasking of ADHD symptoms previously "treated" by nicotine.</s><s>Therefore, our findings of greater withdrawal experience by ADHD could be due to the reemergence of baseline ADHD severity during abstinence.</s><s>However, laboratory-based protocols where change in baseline ADHD symptoms are examined against smoking withdrawal symptoms over the same period of time during biochemically confirmed smoking abstinence show that withdrawal symptoms are more severe and independent of ADHD symptoms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref></s><s>The current study was not designed to address this issue, but our findings converge with cross-sectional studies that withdrawal is more severe.</s></p><p><s>More quit attempts should allow for more opportunities to experience withdrawal symptoms, which are more severe in those with ADHD.</s><s>This implies a greater number of instances in which cigarette smoking  would be negatively reinforced (ie, smoking relieves withdrawal symptoms) in those with ADHD.</s><s>This may explain why smoking cessation rates are lower in adult samples with retrospectively diagnosed childhood ADHD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref></s><s>Related to this latter point, the difficulty quitting that characterized our prospectively followed sample is notable because it overcomes limitations of cross-sectional studies of adult samples that relied on retrospective diagnosis of ADHD in childhood.</s><s>Future studies are needed to examine relevant topographical aspects of quitting not measured here, such as whether quit attempts were planned and duration of abstinence.</s><s>In addition, studies are needed to address how quit attempts are associated with smoking cessation rates in ADHD samples.</s><s>For example, in addition to negative reinforcement processes, pre-existing motivational deficits and delay aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> in ADHD may make smoking abstinence disproportionally more difficult.</s><s>Also, ADHD may lower the ability to tolerate aversive emotional and somatic sensations experienced during smoking abstinence (eg, emotion dysregulation), which is consistent with past studies of ADHD smokers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref></s><s>Smoking cessation treatments for those with a history of ADHD may be improved by targeting these processes.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Daily Smoking as a Function of ADHD Symptom Severity Across Development</head><p><s>The association between ADHD symptom severity and daily smoking across assessments is a novel finding that extends previous reports that relied on retrospective self-reported symptoms in a nonclinical sample. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref></s><s>Notable strengths of the current study include a prospectively followed sample and ADHD symptoms assessed by collateral reporters.</s><s>A novel finding was that ADHD symptoms in late childhood were weakly or unrelated to daily smoking, but by late adolescence, participants exhibiting more severe ADHD symptoms had a higher probability of being daily smokers, an effect that remained strong and stable in adulthood.</s><s>For example, at the 16-year followup, the chance of being a daily smoker for those with elevated ADHD symptoms was 39.6% in adulthood, compared to 20.3% for those with low ADHD symptoms within the ADHD group.</s><s>Consistent with a broader examination of substance use in the MTA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> patterns of use increased in adolescence and became relatively stabilized by young adulthood.</s><s>These findings implicate the importance of ADHD symptom management into late adolescence and young adulthood on daily smoking.</s><s>Our sensitivity analyses examining differential effects of ADHD symptoms build on previous studies (see Flory et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> for a review) and indicate that inattentive symptoms may be particularly important for the development of daily smoking in late adolescence.</s><s>Although prior studies have demonstrated stronger effects for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in the early stages of smoking, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> inattentive symptoms may play a more prominent role in progression to daily use due to the attention-enhancing effects of nicotine.</s><s>By adulthood, however, after withdrawal symptoms become more pronounced, all ADHD symptom difficulties may be reflected in the experience of withdrawal (eg, restlessness).</s><s>Although we caution against over-interpreting the modestly different findings for inattention versus hyperactivity-impulsivity (ie, the symptom domain by time interaction terms yielded beta values that differed by .011</s><s>units), the exclusion of children with differential elevations in symptom domains, particularly those with the inattentive subtype of ADHD, should have made this finding harder to detect.</s></p><p><s>A few effects of demographic covariates emerged.</s><s>Women were less likely to smoke as adults, and Black adolescents progressed to daily smoking at a faster rate than other adolescents.</s><s>Those with baseline ODD or CD were slower to progress to daily smoking in adolescence due to higher rates of daily smoking at the earliest assessment.</s><s>At the 16-year follow-up, those from single-parent families with no college-educated parents were more likely to smoke than those from two-parent families with at least one college-educated parent.</s><s>These variables need to be considered in greater detail in future studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>Future studies should also consider limitations not already identified.</s><s>First, smoking status was not biochemically verified.</s><s>Second, ADHD combined type was the only subtype allowed at study entry.</s><s>Those with the inattentive type in childhood may have different smoking profiles.</s><s>For example, daily smoking onset may be different in a sample with the inattentive type at baseline.</s><s>Third, future research on reasons for ADHD vulnerability to daily smoking may benefit from considering the role of parental smoking and in-utero exposure that could affect rates of smoking.</s><s>Fourth, though we considered baseline ODD and CD, later diagnosis may differentially affect the relationship between childhood ADHD and smoking.</s><s>Future studies should consider timing of ODD and CD diagnosis and impact on smoking behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref></s><s>Finally, our analyses did not consider stimulant medication effects.</s><s>Although meta-analytic results do not support that stimulant treatment for ADHD increases the odds of daily smoking in adulthood, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> future analyses will consider the impact of MTA treatment group status and naturalistic stimulant medication use effects.</s></p></div>
