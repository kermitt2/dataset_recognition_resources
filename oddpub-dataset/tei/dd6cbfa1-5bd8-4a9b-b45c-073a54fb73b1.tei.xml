<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>A model for lipid-driven endocytic protein dynamics.</s><s>Cell biological and genetic data suggest that endocytic membrane remodelling during CCP maturation may require partial PI conversion from PI(4,5)P 2 to PI(3,4)P 2 (refs 13,38), a process that depends on the local synthesis of PI(3,4)P 2 by PI3KC2a (ref.</s><s>29).</s><s>PI (3,4)P 2 is thought to recruit dynamin-binding BAR domain proteins such as SNX9 (and its close paralogue SNX18) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> to mediate the initial constriction of the membrane underlying the transition from U-shaped to O-shaped CCPs that are the substrate for membrane fission by dynamin in vivo.</s></p><p><s>The local PI(3,4)P 2 concentration at CCPs that may serve to recruit endocytic proteins including BAR domain proteins such as SNX9 and SNX18 in CME depends on the activity of PI3KC2a, which produces this lipid.</s><s>Local production of PI(3,4)P 2 by PI3KC2a within the protein-dense environment of a CCP raises the question if, given PI(3,4)P 2 production and diffusion rates, a local PI(3,4)P 2 gradient can be generated and maintained.</s><s>Moreover, if such a lipid gradient were to exist, how would it influence the recruitment of PI-binding endocytic proteins such as SNX9 to CCPs?</s></p><p><s>To address these basic questions, we designed a computational reaction-diffusion master-equation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> that captures the complex interplay between PI lipids and PI-binding endocytic proteins in an assembled 2-dimensional clathrin lattice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The model describes the locations and diffusional motion of all lipid and protein copies involved, as well as lipid production and protein-ligand binding/dissociation events.</s><s>The size of the model clathrin lattice corresponds to a coated vesicle of 150 nm in diameter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), consistent with the outer diameter of invaginated O-shaped CCPs and coated vesicles in non-neuronal cells that we determined by electron microscopy (161 ± 20 nm, n ¼ 30).</s><s>Membrane binding of proteins is treated by a model, which describes both, the non-specific binding affinity of proteins to the membrane (for example, due to charge complementarity) and specific binding of PI lipids to each of the protein's PI-binding domains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-d</ref>).</s><s>The binding model parameters were determined for all endocytic proteins used here by fitting to experimentally known binding constants (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Since the PI-binding affinity has not been available for the dynamin-associated PI-binding PX-BAR and SH3 domain protein SNX9, a candidate membrane remodelling PI(3,4)P 2 effector <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , we determined it here experimentally.</s><s>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements revealed that purified recombinant SNX9 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>) binds to PI(3,4)P 2 and PI(4,5)P 2 with nearly equal affinity of about 1-1.5 mM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), consistent with prior qualitative data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Protein copy numbers determined by quantitative proteomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> were used as a reference for most endocytic proteins (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The average copy number of PI3KC2a and SNX9 at CCPs were determined using genome-engineered SK-MEL-2 cells expressing mRFP-clathrin light chain (mRFP-CLC) with its endogenous locus <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Previous data using genome-engineered SK-MEL-2 cells co-expressing dynamin2-GFP together with mRFP-CLC have shown that peaks of dynamin 2-GFP recruitment correspond to an average recruitment of about 35 dynamin molecules per CCP <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1i-k</ref>).</s><s>We confirmed that a similar number of dynamin 2 molecules is recruited to CCPs upon plasmid-based re-expression of siRNA-resistant dynamin 2-GFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> in genome-engineered cells depleted of endogenous dynamin 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1l</ref>), validating our approach.</s><s>Expression of GFP-PI3KC2a in SK-MEL-2 cells depleted of endogenous PI3KC2a revealed an average recruitment of about 33 PI3KC2a molecules per CCP.</s><s>When depleted of endogenous SNX9 and its close paralogue SNX18 and  <ref type="table">1</ref> for further details).</s><s>(e) Purity of recombinant SNX9 PX-BAR domain (SNX9  ).

(Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) prior to PI3KC2a arrival at CCPs, corresponding to the most conservative assumption.</s><s>Given fixed PI concentrations and cytosolic protein concentrations, the simulation will settle in a steady state, in which the copy numbers of endocytic proteins at the CCP fluctuate around a mean.</s><s>The cytosolic protein concentrations were set such that this steady state achieves the reference protein numbers on average, corresponding to a strong population of PI(4,5)P 2 binders such as AP-2, whereas SNX9 was set to 20 molecules initially, corresponding to half its peak value (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, timescale 0-10 s).</s></p><p><s>As not all modelling parameters were unambiguously set by experimental data, the

of PIP 2 phospholipids in the recruitment of SNX9.</s><s>The time course of PI3KC2a recruitment measured by live cell total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> implies that PI(3,4)P 2 is produced during CCP maturation.</s><s>We determined the PI(3,4)P 2 production rate by expressing catalytically active PI3KC2a recombinantly in insect cells and purifying the enzyme to homogeneity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>).</s><s>Purified PI3KC2a synthesized PI(3,4)P 2 with a k cat of 4 s À 1 (V max ¼ 1,803.6 nmol min À 1 mg À 1 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>).</s><s>These data allowed us to computationally model PI(3,4)P 2 synthesis at endocytic sites and its effect on protein populations.</s><s>The PI(4,5)P 2 concentration was kept constant as PI(4)P 5-kinases are absent from CCPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Unrestricted lipid diffusion in a membrane bilayer is fast <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and combined with the determined production rates for PI(3,4)P 2 and PI3KC2a copy numbers leads to rapid loss of PI(3,4)P 2 .</s><s>In this scenario, PI(3,4)P 2 production would have no effect on endocytic protein populations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>).</s><s>Recent data, however, suggest that early-acting endocytic proteins result in the formation of stable lipid microdomains as a consequence of lowered lateral lipid diffusion by at least two, possibly three orders of magnitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>The presence of a dense clathrin coat will likely restrict diffusion even further.</s><s>Our simulations demonstrate that with a 200-fold slowdown of lipid diffusion underneath the assembled endocytic protein coat, the activity of 33 PI3KC2a kinases is sufficient to sustain a local pool of PI(3,4)P 2 with a concentration roughly half of that of PI(4,5)P 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>In control simulations, using 500fold diffusion slowdown, PI(3,4)P 2 rises to about 3/4 of the concentration of PI(4,5)P 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>).</s><s>These results suggest that PI3KC2a recruited to nascent CCPs can indeed generate a stable local pool of PI(3,4)P 2 , if lipid diffusion is restricted by endocytic protein coats.</s><s>In all subsequent simulations, we used the more conservative 200-fold diffusion slowdown.</s><s>Note that our protein recruitment simulations are conducted on a flat membrane, which also corresponds to a conservative setting.</s><s>Endocytic intermediates are U or O-shaped, which involves an additional diffusion bottleneck around the clathrin coat that reduces the flux of produced PI(3,4)P 2 outside the CCP, and thus enhances the effects described here.</s></p><p><s>How does such local enrichment of PI(3,4)P 2 then affect endocytic protein copy numbers?</s><s>Computational modelling of endocytic protein copy numbers under these conditions revealed a prominent enrichment of SNX9 at CCPs concomitant with rising levels of PI(3,4)P 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>The copy numbers of other endocytic PI-binding proteins also respond, but experience very little relative change (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>).</s><s>Strong PI(3,4)P 2 -dependent SNX9 recruitment was observed under a wide variety of parameter combinations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c,d,f</ref>;
