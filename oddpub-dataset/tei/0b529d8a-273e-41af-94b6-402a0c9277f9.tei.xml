Ketone substrates 8-11 and products 12-15 of PpYerE-catalyzed transformations.</s><s>Conditions: ketone (8-11, 20 mM), pyruvate (6, 50 mM), PpYerE (1 mg/mL), KPi buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0, containing 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ThDP), 20% DMSO (only added for assays with -tetralone (10) and 1phenoxypropan-2-one [11]), total volume 1.5 mL; <ref type="bibr">[a]</ref> Cyclohexane-1,2-dione (9, 100 mM), pyruvate (6, 20 mM).</s><s>Conversions (%) were determined after 24 h by GC-MS analysis; ee values (%, in brackets) were determined by chiral-phase HPLC analysis.</s><s>Results for YpYerE were published by Lehwald et al. and added for comparison. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref></s><s> summary, YpYerE and PpYerE exhibit high amino acid sequence identity, are located in homologous biosynthetic gene clusters, and behave largely similar with respect to substrate range and stereoselectivity in biocatalytic C-C bond formations.</s><s>Most probably, these enzymes are homologues and are involved in the biosynthesis of yersiniose or a structurally related derivative.</s><s>Hence, we set out to elucidate the structure of both enzymes, but obtained crystals only of PpYerE.</s></p><p><s>Structure determination and quality of the models Crystals of N-terminally His-tagged, full-length PpYerE (2 × 588 amino acids, 129.7 kDa) were grown in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM ThDP, using PEG 4000 as precipitant.</s><s>They diffract to 1.55 Å resolution, belong to space group P21, and contain two polypeptide chains (one homodimer) per asymmetric unit.</s><s>With unit cell dimension a being equal in length to c, these crystals fulfill one of the possible sets of requirements that allow twinning in the P21 space group, and twinning was indeed observed.</s><s>Structure determination was achieved by molecular replacement using a subunit of Arabidopsis thaliana AHAS (PDB accession code 1ybh, 32% sequence identity) as search model.</s></p><p><s>The final model was refined to Rcryst/Rfree values of 15.1%/17.4% and has excellent stereochemistry (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref> in the Supporting Information).</s><s>It contains one FAD, one ThDP, and one magnesium ion per chain, and a total of 878 water molecules.</s><s>The observed electron density is well-defined for all cofactors and almost the entire polypeptide chains, with the exception of a ~10residue stretch that links the first two domains in both subunits (A183-192, B182-194), and parts of a loop and helix located at the entrance to the active site in chain B (B483-491).</s><s>The Nterminal His tags, as well as the three C-terminal residues of chain A, are not visible in the electron density map.</s></p><p><s>Overall structure The structures of the two crystallographically independent monomers per asymmetric unit are essentially identical, with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) for the corresponding Cpositions of 0.  PpYerE is a homodimer in the crystalline state as well as in solution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>), a feature it shares with, e.g., transketolase but not the majority of known ThDP-dependent enzymes, which instead are homotetramers assembled from two such dimers.</s><s>The mode of dimer assembly is shared by all ThDP-dependent enzymes and is also conserved in PpYerE, with the interface being formed between the respective Pyr and PP domains of the two monomers.</s><s>It buries ~3400 Å 2 (15.8%) of the solventaccessible surface area of each monomer and involves formation of 57 hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges.</s><s>ThDP binding Binding of the ThDP cofactor is mediated by the Pyr and PP domains, with residues of the former surrounding the pyrimidine ring whereas the diphosphate is, primarily via a Mg 2+ ion, anchored in the PP domain of the respective other subunit (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>), resulting in binding of two ThDP molecules per homodimer.</s><s>The two hydrogen bonds between protein and the ThDP pyrimidine ring, formed by E48 to the N1' and by G420 to the N4' nitrogen atoms, are crucial for catalytic activity.</s><s>They are conserved in almost all ThDP-dependent enzymes and are known to induce the 1',4'-imino tautomer <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> and orient the 4'-imino group, respectively, which facilitates the deprotonation of the thiazolium C2 atom to a carbanion as the first step in the reaction cycle.</s><s>In PpYerE, M422 is the hydrophobic residue that stabilizes the canonical V-conformation of the ThDP.</s><s>For the present structure of PpYerE, additional electron density was observed extending from the thiazolium ring of ThDP indicating covalent attachment of an unknown moiety, possibly an oxygen atom (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Thiazolone derivatives of ThDP have also been observed in other crystal structures of ThDP-dependent enzymes and are likely a result of the exposure to intense X-ray radiation during data collection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref></s><s>AD binding FAD is located in a deep crevice at the interface between all three domains, with most of the enzyme residues involved in its binding originating from the central domain, which is therefore also termed FAD-binding domain.</s><s>The surface of this crevice is covered by a ~20 residue segment inserted between strand 4 and helix 5 of the Pyr domain that protrudes from the second subunit in the dimer.</s><s>It largely sequesters what would otherwise be the more exposed face of the flavin cofactor from the surrounding solvent.</s><s>FAD is bound in an extended conformation with the flavin ring placed near the thiazolium ring of ThDP, which is basically identical to the conformation observed in the crystal structures of other flavin-containing ThDP-dependent enzymes.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> All residues located within van der Waals distance to the FAD are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref> in the Supporting information.</s></p><p><s>As for ScAHAS, no catalytic function for FAD has been discerned as no electron transfer to or from FAD is required for the catalyzed carboligation reaction.</s><s>The hypothesis of FAD being an evolutionary relict from POX-like ancestors formulated for AHAS by Chang and Cronan may thus also apply to FAD binding by PpYerE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref></s><s>he substrate-binding site The active site can be accessed by substrates through a relatively narrow tunnel, whose walls are formed by residues from the PP and FAD-binding domains of one subunit and the Pyr domain of the other subunit.</s><s>The catalytically crucial C2 and N4' atoms of ThDP as well as the C7-methyl group of FAD are thereby most solvent-exposed.</s><s>Part of the helix 22 and the following loop that contribute to formation of the active site entrance are disordered in the B subunit, which does, however, not affect the regions of the active site nearest to the cofactors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>It is feasible that the partial disorder of this residue stretch is indicative of a mobility with functional importance, e.g., in terms of facilitating exchange of products by substrates after the reaction has occurred and closing off the active site during catalysis, or of adjusting active site dimensions to the sizes and shapes of different acceptor substrates, especially as the corresponding residue stretch in the crystal structure of ScAHAS is also partially disordered.</s><s>In the immediate vicinity of the cofactors, the active site of PpYerE is highly similar to that of AtAHAS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>).</s><s>From the residues forming this part of the cavity, all but L22' and I23', are conserved at (almost) the same position in the two enzymes.</s><s>The degree of sequence conservation is significantly lower at the outskirts of the substrate-binding cavity towards the herbicide-binding site identified for plant (and also yeast) AHAS.</s><s>Here, the PpYerE residues M26, F482, and Y264 are replaced by alanine, tryptophan, and histidine, respectively, which may indicate differing substrate specificities or inhibition behavior of both enzymes.</s></p><p><s>Mutagenesis studies to invert enantioselectivity PpYerE catalyzes the formation of (R)-PAC (7a) with high enantioselectivity (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>) which can be explained by a parallel orientation of the donor (pyruvate, 6) and acceptor (benzaldehyde, 5a) side chains prior to C-C bond formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref></s><s>In many ThDPdependent decarboxylases a potential antiparallel acceptorbinding pocket (also referred to as the "S-pocket") has been found that is blocked by amino acid side chains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref></s><s>The pocket can be opened by a few amino acid exchanges enabling antiparallel orientation of substrate side chains, which is a prerequisite for S-selectivity.</s><s>This concept has been successfully applied to the Rselective pyruvate decarboxylase from Acetobacter pasteurianus (ApPDC) as well as 2-succinyl-5enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate synthase from both E. coli and B. subtilis (EcMenD, BsMenD), yielding S-selective variants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24]</ref></s><s>n PpYerE the S-pocket is defined by L22, I23, G24, G25, L476, and V479 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2A</ref> in the Supporting Information).</s><s>V479 is located at the standard position 477 (according to the standard numbering scheme for ThDP-dependent decarboxylases of the BioCatNet database system), which was found to be decisive for the inversion of enantioselectivity of ApPDC, EcMenD, and BsMenD.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref> In PpYerE the size of the S-pocket is restricted by the backbone of helix 22 that is shifted about 2 Å into the area of the potential pocket compared to ApPDC.</s><s>Modelling of benzaldehyde (5a) into a pocket that was opened by a single amino acid exchange of V479 to alanine and glycine, respectively, indicated that the available space is not sufficient for antiparallel binding of 5a, as it clashes with the -helix (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2B</ref> in the Supporting Information).</s><s>This was confirmed by experimental results in which the ee value of (R)-PAC (7a) was not altered for the variant V479G and only slightly reduced for variant V479A (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Consequently, propanal (16) and n-pentanal (17) were tested as smaller, aliphatic acceptors.</s><s>The respective products, 3hydroxypentan-2-one ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>) and 3-hydroxyheptan-2-one (20), are

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Although many ThDP-dependent enzymes catalyze carboligation reactions of pyruvate as donor with aldehydes as acceptors, only few ThDP-dependent enzymes, such as YpYerE and PpYerE (59% amino acid identity), utilize ketones to form tertiary alcohols.</s><s>Numerous attempts to crystallize YpYerE have not been successful; nevertheless, we were able to crystallize PpYerE and determine its structure to 1.55 Å resolution.</s><s>PpYerE displays similar catalytic activity as YpYerE, i.e. benzaldehyde and derivatives, as well as cyclic and acyclic ketones and 1,2diketones, as acceptor and pyruvate as donor were converted into the respective secondary or tertiary 2-hydroxy ketones.</s><s>In the frame of site-directed mutagenesis studies, the S-pocket concept could also be applied to PpYerE, but was limited for larger acceptor substrates due to the structurally restricted size of the pocket.</s></p><p><s>The detailed structural and catalytic characterization of PpYerE and comparison with the homologous YpYerE shows that both enzymes share the same amino acid residues in their active site, have a very similar substrate range, and are encoded by genes that are located in highly similar biosynthetic gene clusters.</s><s>Hence, our results pave the way for the identification of putatively related enzymes which should be able to accept ketones as substrates, too.</s><s>Moreover, the rational modification of ThDPdependent decarboxylases and related enzymes resulting in ketone-accepting enzymes, as previously shown by Loschonsky et al. for the variant CDH-H28A/N484A, could enlarge the product range towards sterically demanding 2-hydroxy ketones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref></s><s>perimental Section</s></p></div>
