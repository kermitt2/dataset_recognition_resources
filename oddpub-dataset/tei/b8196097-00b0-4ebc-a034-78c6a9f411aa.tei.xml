<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Ulcerative colitis [UC] is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized mostly by bleeding and diarrhoea.</s><s>Contemporary therapies focus on anti-inflammatory strategies.</s></p><p><s>The pathogenesis of UC is unknown.</s><s>The traditional view is that a primary deregulation or overactivation of the gut immune system, e.g. the T cells, is responsible.</s><s>An alternative view proposes as the underlying cause a defective mucosal barrier which, after bacterial invasion, may secondarily activate the immune system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Mucus hydrophobicity as a key component of the mucosal barrier is established by the phosphatidylcholine [PC] content therein. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The fact that &gt;90% of the phospholipids in mucus are represented by PC species <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> suggests that they are actively transported there.</s><s>In animal studies, it was shown that PC is predominantly secreted into the ileal mucus and only marginally in the colon, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> which is probably due to the significantly higher surface area in the ileum and not to an intrinsic PC secretory defect in colon.</s><s>This is remarkable because the mucus barrier shield is most needed in colon, where it faces one trillion bacteria per gram of stool.</s><s>It was therefore proposed that the PC secreted in the ileum moves to the colon to provide sufficient protection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s>t the molecular level, it was recently shown that the apical transport of PC into the mucus compartment occurs along a newly described unique paracellular route between mucosal epithelial cells and across tight junctions [TJs]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>PC transport is stimulated by an electrochemical gradient with apical accumulation of negative charge through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>After translocation across the TJ complex, PC is first bound to membrane-associated mucin 3, from where it is handled to secretory mucin 2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> The PC-mucin 2 complex is capable of moving within the mucus distally along the colonic wall to the rectum.</s><s>During this transport to the rectum, mucus PC can be broken down by ectophospholipases of the commensal bacterial flora similarly as was shown for Helicobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>This means that the hydrophobic mucus PC shield is lowest in the rectum, and that is where the mucosa is most vulnerable to infection.</s></p><p><s>It was surprising to see that rectal mucus of UC patients in remission -but not Crohn's disease patients -revealed a 70% reduction of its PC content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>This finding indicates that decreased PC is intrinsic to UC.</s><s>The resulting reduced mucus hydrophobicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> allows for invasion by colonic microbiota and subsequent inflammation that begins in the rectum and extends proximally according to the degree of PC depletion and the corresponding mucosal vulnerability.</s></p><p><s>The observation that PC is predominantly secreted by the ileal mucosa -which is impaired in UC -may explain the phenomenon of backwash ileitis in cases of pancolitis where opening of the ileocecal valve allows higher microbiota exposure to a potentially more vulnerable terminal ileum mucosa.</s><s>Moreover, it also explains the phenomenon that pouchitis -the inflammation of an ileal reservoiroccurs only in patients after colectomy for UC, and never in pouches of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP].</s></p><p><s>To support the idea that UC is caused by diminished paracellular transport of PC to the intestinal lumen, we generated mouse models with intestine-specific deletion of kindlin 1 and 2, which, among other functions, activate integrins and serve cell adhesion to the basal membrane or at cell-to-cell junctions, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> .</s><s>Due to a higher biological priority of basal attachment it was assumed that in case of kindlin 1 deletion, kindlin 2 translocates from the lateral to the basal membrane, and secondarily impairs cell-to-cell adhesion.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> Thus, the loss of adherence junctions finally impairs TJs, which causes disturbed paracellular PC translocation to the luminal side of mucosal cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>n fact, constitutive kindlin 1 (−/−) mice have been reported to develop a severe UC phenotype during the neonatal period. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>Kindlin 2 (−/−) mice, however, experience embryonic death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>Therefore, in this study, we chose time-and tissue-selective conditional knockout mice models with tamoxifen-sensitive, intestinal-specific kindlin 1 or 2 deletion for evaluation of the initiating events leading finally to an adult UC phenotype.</s><s>The pathogenetic features of defective PC secretion into mucus and its pathophysiological consequences were analysed.</s><s>The results were compared to biopsies from patients with UC in complete remission, Crohn's disease and control subjects.</s><s>Charles
