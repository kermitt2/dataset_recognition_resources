<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The occurrence of allergic multimorbidity (coexistence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema) has not been evaluated longitudinally from early childhood up to adulthood in a population-based study sample.</s><s>We aimed to determine the prevalence of allergic multimorbidity up to age 20 stratified by parental allergies and sex/gender using extensive prospective follow-up data from two decades of a birth cohort study.</s><s>Methods: In 1990, we recruited 1314 healthy newborns from 6 maternity wards across Germany for the population-based MAS birth cohort study.</s><s>The sample was purposely risk-enriched by increasing the proportion of children at high allergy risk (i.e. at least 2 allergic family members among parents and siblings) from 19% in the source population to 38% in the final sample.</s><s>The remaining 62% of all MAS children had a low or no allergy risk.</s><s>Symptoms, medication and doctor's diagnoses of allergic diseases have been assessed using standardized questionnaires including validated ISAAC questions in 19 follow-up assessments up to age 20.</s><s>Allergic multimorbidity at each time point was defined as the coexistence of at least 2 of the following diseases in one participant: asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema.</s></p><p><s>Results: Response at age 20 was 72% (n = 942) of all recruited participants.</s><s>At age 20, 18.5% (95% CI, 15.0-22.5%) of all participants with allergic parents had 2 or 3 concurrent allergies as compared to only 6.3% (95% CI, 4.3-9.0%) of those with nonallergic parents.</s><s>At this age, allergic multimorbidity was similar in women and men (12.7% (95% CI, 9.7-16.2%)</s><s>vs. 11.6%</s><s>(95% CI, 8.9-14.8%)),</s><s>whereas single allergic diseases were slightly more common in women than men (24.2% (95% CI, 20.2-28.5%) vs. 20.1% (95% CI, 16.6-24.0%)).</s><s>Asthma occurred more frequently with coexisting allergic rhinitis and/or eczema than as a single entity from pre-puberty to adulthood.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>Having parents with allergies is not only a strong predictor to develop any allergy, but it strongly increases the risk of developing allergic multimorbidity.</s><s>In males and females alike, coexisting allergies were increasingly common throughout adolescence up to adulthood.</s><s>Particularly asthma occurred in both sexes more frequently with coexisting allergies than as a single entity.</s></p><p><s>The past several decades have seen an increase in the prevalence of allergic diseases among children and teenagers across the world with the highest prevalence being observed in Anglo-American countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s>Although a number of birth and child cohort studies have been initiated to better understand this high prevalence, research has been almost exclusively on single allergic entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>The coexistence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema has rarely been specifically targeted in longitudinal investigations.</s><s>Few prospective cohort studies have looked at allergic multimorbidity such as asthma and concurrent rhinitis or asthma and concurrent eczema but mostly in early childhood and never beyond 12 years of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Ballardini et al. found in the Swedish BAMSE cohort that coexisting allergies occurred more often in school rather than in preschool children <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>Analyses of combined European birth cohort data by the EU-funded MeDALL consortium showed that the coexistence of asthma, rhinitis and eczema in the same child at age 4 and 8 was more prevalent than expected by chance alone, suggesting that these diseases share common mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Latent class analyses of UK birth cohort data identified temporal patterns of coexisting allergies up to age 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>The progression of these coexisting conditions into adolescence and adulthood and the influence of parental allergies or sex/gender have not yet been studied.</s><s>Therefore, the purpose of the current analysis was to investigate the prevalence of current allergic multimorbidity throughout childhood and adolescence up to age 20 stratified by parental allergies and by sex/gender using the comprehensive prospective follow-up data from two decades of a German birth cohort study.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with other studies</head><p><s>The BAMSE birth cohort study from Sweden examined the development of coexisting allergic diseases in children up to the age of 12 and found that 7.5% of the study population had at least two of these diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>This was similar to the prevalence of 8.5% (95% CI, 6.6-10.7%) in our risk-enriched study population of the same age.</s><s>Interestingly, several findings from BAMSE on allergic multimorbidity in childhood were confirmed for adolescence and adulthood by our results.</s><s>Firstly, coexisting allergies continue to become more prevalent with age; secondly, asthma occurs more often with coexisting allergies than as a single allergic entity; and thirdly, parental allergy remains a strong predictor for allergic multimorbidity up to adulthood.</s><s>Also, sex/gender differences known to play a distinguished role in the prevalence of single allergic entities (i.e.</s><s>male predominance in childhood versus female predominance in adolescence and adulthood) do not seem to have much influence on the prevalence of coexisting multiple allergic diseases in the same individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(28)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The British MAAS birth cohort has previously shown for 5-year-old children that more than half of those with asthma symptoms had coexisting rhinitis and/or eczema <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>With UK data from 9801 ALSPAC and MAAS birth cohort children up to the age of 11 years, Belgrave et al. highlighted the fact that the commonly used term 'atopic march' may reflect the natural history and progression of eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis on a cross-sectional, population-based level rather than the trajectory of disease development in individuals.</s><s>Using latent class analyses, they were able to group 16% of children aged 8-11 years in classes with 2 or 3 coexisting allergies.</s><s>The two groups of children with persistent eczema and wheeze as well as persistent eczema and rhinitis showed a female predominance, whereas the group of children with persistent wheeze and rhinitis included more males than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An earlier analysis of our cohort at early school age showed the lack of an association between gender and coexisting allergic respiratory symptoms such as rhinitis and concurrent wheeze <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An international collaborative population-based cohort data analysis including 12 European birth cohorts showed that half of the allergic multimorbidity (asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema) at 8 years of age was not a result of chance.</s><s>Additionally, this study found that allergic sensitization (i.e. the presence of specific IgE against common allergens in serum) only accounted for 38% of comorbidity in 8-year-old children <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>These findings suggest that there are non-IgE-mediated mechanisms associated with the development of allergic multimorbidity.</s></p><p><s>Apart from an allergic predisposition (e.g.</s><s>family history), sex/gender and allergic sensitization, further potential risk or protective factors including environmental and psycho-social determinants have not been examined for allergic multimorbidity as a primary outcome.</s><s>There still exists a lack of knowledge with respect to allergic multimorbidity and genetic determinants; however, a study from Dizier et al. in participants with a positive family history of asthma identified a statistically significant association of eczema with 11p14 genetic variants <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref>.</s><s>Further investigation is needed in this area to confirm such findings and to explore the relationship of genetic determinants for coexisting eczema and asthma.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>The strengths of the current analysis include the use of stringent epidemiological definitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> to determine allergic outcomes and the large number of assessments (n = 19) in a 20-year time period, which is unique for a birth cohort study and reduces potential recall bias.</s></p><p><s>However, several limitations have to be considered.</s><s>Firstly, due to the allergy risk-enriched sampling strategy, the MAS cohort as a whole is not representative of the population of the 5 cities where families were recruited from.</s><s>However, A stratifying for parental allergy status leads to more generalizable prevalence estimates for the 2 subgroups of children and adolescents with allergic and with non-allergic parents.</s></p><p><s>Secondly, loss due to follow up in an observational birth cohort study over 20 years can have a considerable effect on the estimated prevalence of diseases.</s><s>Study participants suffering from allergic diseases may be more likely to continue participating (in regular follow-up assessments to check progress of their allergic condition).</s><s>Our relatively high response rate at 20 years of age (72% of all children recruited at birth) may have reduced but cannot exclude a possible response bias.</s><s>Furthermore, most of the basic characteristics of the study participants compared to non-participants were similar, with the exception of parental eczema and maternal rhinitis which were more common among the participants than those lost to follow-up at the last assessment.</s></p><p><s>Thirdly, information regarding non-allergic comorbidities has not been assessed in detail in previous follow-ups of MAS but will be included in future assessments during adulthood as non-allergic comorbidity of asthma and allergies is becoming of more clinical and public health relevance with increasing age.</s><s>A nationwide survey in Germany showed recently that almost 50% of all adults with asthma reported coexisting gastrooesophageal reflux disease in the last 12 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref>.</s><s>The existence of an association between asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis has also been demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref>, and possible mechanisms causing systemic spread of upper airway disease with subsequent asthma, including staphylococcal superantigens, have been explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(34)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>The MAS birth cohort study showed that allergic multimorbidity in the same individual was increasingly common through school age and adolescence up to adulthood.</s><s>Particularly asthma occurred in both sexes more often in conjunction with other allergies than as a single entity.</s><s>A positive parental history of allergy is not only a predictor to develop any allergy but also a strong determinant to develop coexisting allergic diseases.</s><s>Sex/gender does not seem to be associated with the prevalence of current allergic multimorbidity as it is with single allergic entities.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Characteristics of study participants who completed 20-year follow-up (n = 942) compared with those who did not (n = 372) in German MAS birth cohort</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Study participants</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Study participants who</cell><cell>who completed</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>did not complete 20-year</cell><cell>20-year follow-up</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>follow-up (n = 372)</cell><cell>(n = 942)</cell></row><row><cell>Characteristic</cell><cell>% (absolute number)</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Male sex</cell><cell>51.3 (191)</cell><cell>52.4 (494)</cell></row><row><cell>One or more</cell><cell>40.1 (149)</cell><cell>41.5 (391)</cell></row><row><cell>older sibling</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Maternal rhinitis</cell><cell>22.3 (83)</cell><cell>27.3 (250)</cell></row><row><cell>Paternal rhinitis</cell><cell>24.2 (90)</cell><cell>24.0 (218)</cell></row><row><cell>Maternal asthma</cell><cell>8.3 (31)</cell><cell>8.2 (75)</cell></row><row><cell>Paternal asthma</cell><cell>6.5 (24)</cell><cell>6.6 (60)</cell></row><row><cell>Maternal eczema</cell><cell>4.8 (18)</cell><cell>7.4 (67)</cell></row><row><cell>Paternal eczema</cell><cell>1.9 (7)</cell><cell>4.5 (40)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Eczema</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Asthma</cell><cell>Allergic rhinitis</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Allergic</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>Asthma</cell><cell>rhinitis</cell></row></table></figure>
