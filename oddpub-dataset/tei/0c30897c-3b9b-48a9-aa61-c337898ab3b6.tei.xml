<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety</head><p><s>The primary objective of Study 015 was to investigate long-term safety of CZP treatment of active RA, as measured by adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs).</s></p><p><s>The safety population in this report included all patients who received C1 dose of CZP in either the RCT or OLE.</s><s>All events experienced between first CZP exposure and 24 weeks after the last visit/patient withdrawal were included.</s><s>AEs and SAEs were assessed at every visit and classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the MedDRA dictionary v9.0.</s><s>AEs are reported as exposure-adjusted event rates (ER) per 100 patient-years (PYs), which include multiple occurrences of an AE in the same patient.</s></p></div>

304.</s><s>Maintenance of response was similar between the CZP ITT, CZP?MTX, and CZP monotherapy groups in virtually all measures, especially depth of response as measured by ACR50 and ACR70 response rates.</s></p><p><s>PROs measure aspects of disease that cannot be easily assessed by physicians, as they quantify reports of patient health provided directly by the patient.</s><s>Assessing PROs is

target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Sustained efficacy in terms of PRO measures (HAQ-DI, PtGADA, pain, and fatigue) was observed to week 304 in CZP ITT and both CZP?MTX and CZP monotherapy groups, and was

convenient for some patients, and therefore has the potential to ease the burden of treatment for RA patients.</s></p><p><s>A number of limitations of the study design, previously described for the RCTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8]</ref>, also apply to the present report of Study 015.</s><s>The 1-5 Likert scale, which is much less sensitive to change than continuous VAS assessments as used in the RAPID trials, was used to collect the PtGADA and PhGADA in both the RCT and OLE studies.</s><s>In addition, a combination of low initial CRP levels and the assay sensitivity resulted in a potential floor effect in terms of CRP level <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, three of the seven core ACR components had a limited sensitivity to change, and may have impacted the absolute response size observed.</s><s>This limitation in data collection also impacted the post hoc analyses of CDAI and SDAI, as PtGADA and PhGADA needed to be converted to VAS-like outputs in order to calculate CDAI/SDAI change from baseline and remission rates.</s><s>Therefore, TJC and SJC scores are reported in order to provide a more comparable measure of efficacy across studies.</s><s>The safety population initially comprised 427 patients, of whom only 167 completed the OLE, which raises the possibility of selection bias in the safety analyses.</s><s>Additionally, the OLE study design has limitations, such as the open-label nature of the study and the inherent survival bias, and the lack of a placebo control.</s><s>However, given the ethical and regulatory restrictions for long-term placebo-controlled trials in rheumatology, OLE data are still valuable in informing long-term treatment choices.</s><s>Comparisons between
