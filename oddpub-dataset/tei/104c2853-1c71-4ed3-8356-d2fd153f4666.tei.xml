<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objectives: Psoriasis is a papulosquamous skin disease characterized by recurring thick, itchy and dry red patches covered with silvery scales.</s><s>It has been shown that patients with psoriasis have a reduction in their quality of life similar to patients with other chronic diseases, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes.</s><s>The objective of this study was to evaluate how health-related quality of life (HRQL) was taken into consideration in the evaluation of psoriasis products approved by the FDA and the EMA since 1995.</s><s>MethOds: The websites of the FDA and the EMA were explored to identify all psoriasis products approved.</s><s>PROLabels was used to identify products with a PRO claim in label.</s><s>All corresponding clinical reviews (FDA), and assessments reports (EMA) were reviewed for HRQL evaluation.</s><s>Results: Twenty-seven products have been approved since 1995 (18 FDA, nine EMA).</s><s>Six products were common to both agencies (i.e., adalimumab, apremilast, etanercept, infliximab, secukinumab, ustekinumab).</s><s>For the products approved by both agencies, the same clinical studies were submitted.</s><s>PRO claims were found in nine products (eight EMA, one FDA).</s><s>HRQL was mentioned in the label of all EMA products (mainly, improvement in QOL), but not the FDA's.</s><s>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was used for all products, and the SF-36 for six products.</s><s>Among the eight EMA products with a HRQL claim, five products have been also approved by the FDA.</s><s>In two cases (apremilast, ustekinumab), the medical review was not available.</s><s>Therefore, reasons for not including HRQL in the label could not be retrieved.</s><s>For the three other products (adalimumab, infliximab, secukinumab), HRQL was not mentioned in the review.</s><s>cOnclusiOns:</s></p><p><s>The EMA seems to consider HRQL as a valuable endpoint in the evaluation of psoriasis products in contrast with the FDA.</s><s>More harmonization between agencies might be beneficial to patients' information.</s></p></div>
