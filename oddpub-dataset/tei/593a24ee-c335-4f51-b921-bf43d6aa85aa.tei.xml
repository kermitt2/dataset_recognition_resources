<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPORTANCE</head><p><s>Cannabis use during adolescence is known to increase the risk for schizophrenia in men.</s><s>Sex differences in the dynamics of brain maturation during adolescence may be of particular importance with regard to vulnerability of the male brain to cannabis exposure.</s><s>OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the association between cannabis use and cortical maturation in adolescents is moderated by a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia.</s></p><p><s>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observation of 3 population-based samples included initial analysis in 1024 adolescents of both sexes from the Canadian Saguenay Youth Study (SYS) and follow-up in 426 adolescents of both sexes from the IMAGEN Study from 8 European cities and 504 male youth from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) based in England.</s><s>A total of 1577 participants (aged 12-21 years; 899 [57.0%] male) had (1) information about cannabis use; (2) imaging studies of the brain; and</s></p><p><s>(3) a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia across 108 genetic loci identified by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium.</s><s>Data analysis was performed from March 1 through December 31, 2014.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</head><p><s>Cortical thickness derived from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images.</s><s>Linear regression tests were used to assess the relationships between cannabis use, cortical thickness, and risk score.</s></p></div>
