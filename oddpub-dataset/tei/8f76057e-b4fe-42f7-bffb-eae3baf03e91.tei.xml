<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Introduction: This is the first long-term randomized controlled trial to evaluate dentin-like glass-fiber posts (GFP) compared to rather rigid titanium posts (TP) for postendodontic restoration of severely damaged endodontically treated teeth (ETT)    with two or less remaining cavity walls.</s></p><p><s>Materials and Methods: Ninety-one subjects in need of post-endodontic restorations were randomly assigned to receive either a tapered GFP (n = 45) or TP (n = 46).</s></p><p><s>Posts were adhesively luted using self-adhesive resin cement followed by composite core build-up and preparation of 2mm ferrule design.</s><s>Primary endpoint was loss of restoration for any reason.</s><s>Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed, and log-rank test was calculated (p &lt; .05).</s></p><p><s>Results: After a follow-up of 132 months, 17 GFP and 20 TP restorations survived, 19 failed (12 GFP; 7 TP).</s><s>Failure modes were for GFP: root fracture (n = 4), core fracture (n = 1), secondary caries (n = 1), endodontic failure (n = 2), extraction due to tooth mobility grade III associated with insufficient design of removable partial denture (n = 1), tooth fracture (n = 1), changes in treatment plan (n=2); for TP: endodontic failure (n = 5), root fracture (n = 1), one extraction for other reasons.</s></p><p><s>Cumulative survival probability was 58.7% for GFP, and 74.2% for TP.</s><s>Log-rank analysis revealed no significant differences between both post systems (p= 0.156).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Follow-up Procedure</head><p><s>The date of post placement was defined as the baseline for all further analyses.</s></p><p><s>Participants were recalled at 3, 6 and 12 months, thereafter in a yearly recall up to 132 months after post placement for clinical examination.</s><s>Significant efforts were made to retain patients in the study, using a number of approaches that also evolved somewhat over time.</s><s>Up to six attempts were made to contact patients by phone at various times and days of the week, including weekends.</s><s>If this was unsuccessful, letters were sent requesting patients to contact the study centre.</s><s>If contact data were not valid, Web-based phone number registers and social networks (facebook.com,</s><s>stayfriends.de,</s><s>plus.google.com,</s><s>xing.com) were consulted to enhance the possibility of finding lost participants.</s></p><p><s>Patients were offered a check-up and a free professional tooth cleaning as well as reimbursement of travel expenses.</s><s>If patients were unwilling to attend a follow-up appointment, survival of the restoration/tooth was ascertained by patient's self-report.</s></p><p><s>The 132-to 144-month clinical examination was performed by a blinded calibrated operator (MvS).</s><s>Follow-up examinations were performed with a dental probe to detect marginal gap formations of restorations.</s><s>Radiographs were taken when indicated and examined by one operator (MN) to exclude the possibility of radiographic signs of failure (e.g.</s><s>periodontal or periapical lesions).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome Measures</head><p><s>The primary endpoint was the loss of restoration for any reason.</s><s>Secondary endpoints were tooth loss, post debonding, post fracture, vertical or horizontal root fracture, endodontic or peri-radicular conditions requiring endodontic retreatment, secondary caries and failure of core build-up, and loss of restoration because of technical failures.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Size Calculation</head><p><s>No a priori sample size calculation was performed for this pilot study.</s><s>Restricted random allocation was performed (MN) by blocking with a block length of 4 based on a computer-generated random list to achieve a balance of size between groups.</s></p><p><s>Then, randomization and allocation concealment according to the participant identification number were established.</s><s>Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 intervention groups.</s><s>For allocation concealment consecutively numbered, sealed envelopes were utilized.</s><s>They were stored and opened by the dental assistant immediately before post placement.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>Summary statistics were calculated for all variables at baseline for each group as appropriate.</s><s>For the primary endpoint, data were censored for the survival time of the final restoration according to the intention-to-treat analysis.</s><s>Kaplan -Meier survivaltable and plots were generated using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</s><s>Annual failure rates were calculated based on Kaplan -Meier estimate.</s></p><p><s>Differences between survival functions were evaluated using the log-rank test.</s><s>For testing the impact of baseline parameters on survival of restorations, Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox regression analyses.</s></p><p><s>All statistical tests and confidence intervals were double-sided.</s><s>The level of significance was set at α=0.05.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>A total of 98 participants gave written informed consent to participate.</s><s>Two withdrew consent to participate before randomization and five did not match the inclusion criteria.</s><s>Ninety-one participants were included for randomization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</s><s>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows descriptive data of participant and tooth characteristics.</s><s>Four participants in the glass-fiber group dropped out prematurely and were not available for the first recall after 3 months.</s><s>One participant was unavailable and did not return for the first recall.</s><s>Two participants did not receive the final restoration within 3 months after post placement and were therefore excluded according to the inclusion criteria.</s><s>Two teeth failed after 9 (secondary caries) and 10 (horizontal tooth fracture at gingival level) months.</s><s>One tooth was extracted due to a change of the prosthetic treatment plan.</s></p><p><s>Hence, 87 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>The overall mean observation time was 98 months (SD; min/max: 43;12/154).</s><s>A total of 31 participants did not complete the 132-month follow-up period (35.6%) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>Two participants with GFP restorations and 7 participants with TP restorations gave self-report by phone.</s><s>The modified intention-to-treat analysis revealed a survival rate of 58.7% for GFP and 74.2% for TP restorations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>There was no statistically significant difference between the survival functions (p =.156; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The calculated overall annual failure rate up to 154 months amounted to 4.2% (GFP) and 2.3% (TP).</s><s>Cox regression analyses between different baseline characteristics and calculated HRs revealed no statistically significant differences between Hazard ratios of different baseline parameters (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>Failure modes (secondary endpoint) and characteristics of corresponding teeth are displayed (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The present study investigated the survival of endodontically treated, severely damaged teeth with glass-fiber vs. titanium post-based restorations.</s><s>An adhesive approach was chosen using self-adhesive resin cement and composite core-build-up to ensure an adhesive mono-block.</s><s>No statistical comparisons of the data are presented.</s><s>Because of the small sample size and lack of power no conclusions can be drawn.</s><s>The danger of presenting statistical analysis of an underpowered study is that "no statistical difference" may be interpreted by the reader as equivalence, which is not the case.</s><s>A much larger sample size would be necessary to show equivalence.</s><s>Data from this pilot study are useful to calculate sample size calculations for future studies.</s><s>For example, to detect a difference in survival of 60% vs. 70% (corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.7) at alpha=0.05 with 90% power, assuming a drop-out of 35% would require enrolment of 1094 patients (n=547 per group).</s><s>After a minimum time of observation of 132 months, 35.6% of subjects were lost to follow-up (29.3% (GFP), 41.3% (TP)).</s><s>Failures mainly occurred due to loss of restoration for any reason in 29.3 % (GFP) and 15.2% (TP), corresponding to an average annual failure rate of 4.2 (GFP) and 2.3%, respectively.</s></p><p><s>The drop-out rate in long-term studies is a well-known challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, and attrition as high as approximately 50% has been recently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>Participants of the present study were not in a recall program associated with a general check-up.</s></p><p><s>Most patients had their own dentist in private practice or consulted the university clinic on an irregular basis.</s><s>Most drop-outs were due to missing current contact data (address, phone number).</s><s>In addition, over the years, study participants became more and more reluctant to return for follow-up visits, due to a lack of perceived direct benefit.</s><s>Offers of free check-ups, including free professional tooth cleaning and reimbursement for travel expenses did persuade some participants to return to the study centre, but were not sufficient to persuade many.</s><s>Payment of participants has been demonstrated to increase retention markedly, and should be considered in future studies where possible.</s><s>Nine participants were assessed by self-report on the phone.</s><s>A former prospective study reported 39 cases of clinical examination of GFPrestored teeth in accordance with the patient's self-report <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Based on these results we decided to include the nine cases of self-report.</s><s>The cumulative survival rates in this study of GFP (59.8%) are comparable to a 10-year prospective observational study on GFP restorations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> in which the survival rate was 59.6%.</s><s>The annual failure rate of GFP restorations was 4.6% and the amount of remaining coronal hard tissues was identified as predictor of tooth survival.</s><s>Anterior teeth failed three times more frequently than posterior teeth.</s><s>To the best of our knowledge these data from 2012 are the only published prospective longterm data on "dentin-like" GFPs.</s><s>One limitation of this study was, that if needed no crown lengthening was performed to ensure a ferrule design of 2mm dentin height. in cases with insufficient residual crown height no crown lengthening was performed to ensure a ferrule design of 2mm dentin height.</s></p><p><s>Short-term clinical studies with a maximum follow-up time of 36 months report survival rates comparable with as the present study for this time interval <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>An RCT comparing the survival of glass-fiber and metal screw posts (25) over 5 years showed notably lower survival rates for glass-fiber (71.8%) and metal screw posts (50%) compared with the present study after 5 years (glass fiber 86.4%; titanium 92.5%).</s><s>An RCT on prefabricated and customized glass-fiber posts placed in premolars only showed an overall survival rate of 94.1% after 6 years of observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>These data show that more "flexible" fiber post-based restorations can achieve a wide range of survival rates from only fair to high in the midterm.</s><s>For comparison, 10-year results of retrospective study with very rigid zirconia ceramic posts as a tooth-colored, non-metallic alternative to fiber posts show a survival probability of 81.3% <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>However, the drop-out rate in this study was high at 49.4%.</s></p><p><s>Overall, there appears to be marked heterogeneity with regard to the longterm survival rates of post-based restorations in the literature, and the reasons for this are unclear.</s><s>Reasons for failure are diverse, and many failures appear to be related to factors other than the choice of post material or the restoration itself, such as caries and changes in treatment plans due to failures elsewhere in the dentition.</s></p><p><s>These competing risks for failure increase sample size requirements for any definitive randomized trial of post materials on restoration survival.</s><s>While the results of the present pilot study have to be cautiously interpreted, we certainly found no evidence that fiber posts perform better than titanium posts in terms of long-term restoration survival.</s><s>The study also provides data for sample size calculations for future studies, e.g., to detect a difference in survival of 60% vs. 70% (corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.7) at alpha=0.05 with 90% power, assuming a drop-out of 35% would require enrolment of 1094 patients (n=547 per group).</s></p><p><s>ETT supporting prosthetic restorations present reduced survival rates compared with vital teeth (27).</s><s>Nevertheless, overall the survival rates up to 8 years emphasize that the reconstruction of severely damaged teeth -if appropriately treated -can achieve satisfying results prior to considering the option of choosing a dental implant <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is known from the 10-year observational study mentioned above, that anterior teeth have a higher risk of failing than posterior teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>This finding is supported by other research <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29)</ref>.</s><s>Higher non-axial loads in the anterior region were described as beiing a source of mechanical failures <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30)</ref>.</s><s>Within our sample, the failures occured among all types of restoration and tooth types.</s><s>However, the present study did not achieve enough power to discuss hazard ratios. in the present study there was no statistically significant difference between anterior and posterior teeth.</s><s>It may be explained by strictly following of the ferrule concept.</s><s>It is well known, that the ferrule and its effect is one of the key factors in post-endodontic restorations in particular on teeth with severe hard tissue loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(31)</ref>.</s><s>Due to the small sample in the present study, a statistical testing of correlations between failure and type of restoration could not be performed.</s></p><p><s>Regarding the number of remaining cavity walls, i.e. defect size, the distribution was well balanced with 42 cases with no and 45 cases with one or two cavity walls.</s><s>Our analyses showed -in accordance with other prospective studies -a slightly, not significant higher risk to fail for teeth with no remaining cavity wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study mechanical failures occurred such as four horizontal nonrestorable root fractures.</s><s>General practitioners report endodontic failures and fractures as the main problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s>Intracanal loss of hard tissues due to endodontic and post space preparation increases the deformability of the root <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(31)</ref>.</s><s>A recently published systematic review concluded that the incidence of root fractures does not differ between metal and fiber posts <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, although for years a favorable biomechanical behavior of glass-fiber posts due to a dentine-like Young's Modulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33)</ref> was postulated.</s><s>Finite element analyses revealed that this property may lose its impact when -due to aging processes -the bonding of the post / cement / root dentin interface fails and concentrates higher stress within the root <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, no baseline-parameters had a statistical significant effect.</s><s>This may seem unsatisfactory, but shows that within our sample either the effect of these baseline parameters is too low or it is the consequence of adhesive monoblock, post as such, irrespective of its Young's modulus, and ferrule

The sample size in this study was too small to draw any statistical inferences, but the data has value in designing a larger, statistically strong study and may have value for meta-analysis if pooled with other data sets.</s><s>Tables <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Primary outcome at the 132-month follow-up Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Failure modes and characteristics of teeth in both intervention groups</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>4 .</head><label>4</label><figDesc><div><p><s>January 2003 and April 2004, participants were recruited for postendodontic treatment in the Department of Prosthodontics, Geriatric Dentistry and Craniomandibular Disorders, Charité -Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.</s><s>Subjects 18 years and older were assessed for eligibility.</s><s>The following inclusion criteria applied: 1.
