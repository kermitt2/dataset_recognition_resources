<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Occupational stress</head><p><s>Occupational stress has gained more attention in the recent years, as the number of employees experience it increasingly since globalization takes place.</s><s>An occupationally upsetting environment drives an organization toward devastation and obliteration.</s><s>An occupationally stressful leader fails to ensure fulfilling the productive and gainful outcomes in an organization.</s><s>Occupational stress takes place due to professional variables relating with the employees to adjust their psychological and physiological conditions which usually cause the mind or body of the individual to go amiss from its normal functioning.</s><s>Research has revealed that turnover rates of the working forces increase when occupational stress increases.</s><s>Therefore, occupational stress contributes to a number of difficulties and hindrances to organization in the shape of non-attendance, loss of efficiency and poor health resources.</s><s>The notions i.e., occupational stress, organisational stress, job stress, and work-related stress are conceptualized interchangeably on the grounds that occupation, job, work and organisation are commonly indistinguishable concepts.</s><s>Occupational stress is a kind of emotional, behavioural and physiological reactions to foreboding and disparaging aspects of working environment, work association and working conditions.</s><s>The main accentuation is given on the work environment as it goes about as the wellspring of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Occupational stress is unending condition caused by the conditions in workplace that tangles antagonistically influences on the workers' employment progress and their general thriving.</s><s>Occupational stress is interminable condition created by the conditions in workplace that can belligerently influence the employment progress of the employees and their general prosperity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Occupational stress alludes to the disagreeable physiological and psychological consequences that rise in individuals because of their powerlessness to oversee and satisfy the demands being forced on them.</s><s>It is caused by the mutual connection of individuals, or as a result of managing organizational plans and environmental conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are numerous factors that contribute to occupational stress in working situation.</s><s>A number of research studies have explored different underlying causes contributing to occupational stress in various organization such as, workload, conflicts among workers and organizations, role ambiguity, undesirable and disappointing interpersonal relationships, customer contact, job independence, locus of control and social support.</s><s>Different factors that are leading and powerful stressors composed of five events yielding stress i.e., home-developed issues and demands, family-based issues, marital issues and clashes between family demands and employment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The stressors which are constantly perceived in the literature are workload, time pressure, educational change, investigation, leadership styles, innovation, re-organization, and insufficient resources.</s><s>Investigating the causes of occupational stress, Willis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> documented stressors as anxiety, narcissism, hate, guilt feelings, over-sensitivity, desire, sufferings, frustration, terror, disappointment and yearning for endorsement.</s><s>In addition, he laid out methods of change events which add to extreme stress i.e., personal injury or aliment, demise of life partner, divorce, wedding, sex issues, pregnancy, gain of a new family member, issues with supervisors, issues with managers, monetary commitments, change in working conditions, changes in school and minor infringement of the law.</s><s>Among these, sexual harassment and belligerent behavior at home are the important sources of stress.</s><s>The underlying causes for stress in workplace comprise of maltreatment, feeling weak and uninvolved in choosing one's own responsibilities, harassment, lack of viable communication, lack of effective conflict resolution, unreasonable performance demands, instability of employer, politics among staffing, long working hours, passing more time away from family, a feeling that one's compensation is not equivalent with one's responsibilities, and pressures disturbing life-balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Occupational stress may be caused due to extraordinary or too little work, time pressure, deadlines and physical strain created by the working place and its conditions.</s><s>Employment environment likewise goes about as hotspot for making social and psychological stress <ref type="bibr"

family issues, poor social relationships, health problems and unproductive organization.</s><s>Although the outcomes of stress are different relying upon the circumstances and attributes of the people involved, the outcomes for the people are reliably unexpected.</s><s>Depression, anxiety, downheartedness, tension and disappointment are conceivable results.</s><s>Stress has unfavorable effects on the prosperity of the employees.</s><s>Occupational stress is a global and frequently has recognized a debilitating human phenomenon.</s><s>Stress that takes place in the working environment has harmful effects on employees' behaviour which ultimately effect personal and organizational productivity negatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Among numerous occupational antagonistic impacts of work stress are employment dissatisfaction, poor social relationships, decreased profitability, non-attendance; high staff turnover; nervousness, depression, and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Perceived occupational stress is reported to have adverse and pessimistic effect on mental health, as measured by insomnia, depression, psychological well-being, anxiety, happiness, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Consistent extraordinary level of occupational stress can bring about veritable wellbeing conditions including hypertension, cancer and mental diseases, for example, downheartedness or downfall.</s><s>Stress has adverse effects on the organization as well as individuals' mental and physical condition which bring about unsatisfactory performance, non-attendance, accidents, dishonest conduct, discontentment and sickness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In a nutshell, occupational stress can be classified into three classes i.e., psychological strain, physical strain and behavioural strain.</s></p><p><s>Psychological strain is the main type of strain which is caused by stressors which also known as psychological health.</s><s>Strain refers to the abnormality from normal reactions and psychosocial strain includes reactions i.e., job dissatisfaction, anxiety, melancholy, low selfregard and unsettled issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>A huge assemblage of literature proposes that work stress is firmly identified with nervousness and downheartedness.</s><s>Encountering of stress is associated with the mental areas of exhaustion, depression, low self-respect, outrage, lethargy, touchiness, blame, ill-temperedness, accidents, fatigue, withdrawal and burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Psychological strain comprises of dissatisfaction, apprehension, tension, dysphoria, sleeping disorder, impatience and restlessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>The outcomes of stress might be of emotional appearances-feelings of indistinct nervousness, disappointment, discouragement, fear and dissatisfaction and low self-regard with a conceivable outrageous result being burnout.</s></p><p><s>Physical strain is the second major strain caused by exposure to stressors.</s><s>It is also known as physical health.</s><s>Physical or physiological strain is theorized to appear in indications, for example, hypertension, abnormalities in blood eosinophils, and raised serum cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Stress has been physically related to cardiovascular disorder, ulcers, hypertension, asthma, and headache cerebral agonies.</s><s>Generally, investigators have a tendency to concur what the major physical strains brought on by stress are dysphoria, sleeping disorder and restlessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Physiological indicators are; heart illness, psychosomatic ailment, fatigue and depleted energy reserves.</s><s>Occupational stress is supposed to assume a critical part in bringing on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Physical exhaustion may occur in the form of headache, shaking, incapability to think clearly and relax, lack of natural communication, anger resulting in short-tempered talk, vulnerability to common cold, cancer automotive diseases and experience of gastrointestinal problems.</s><s>Stress can cause chronic fatigue, risk of stroke, worsen an asthma attack, proneness to accidents and athletic injuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The third characterization of strain is behavioral strain.</s><s>Behavioral modifications are among the most effortlessly and effectively perceived indications of stress increasing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s><s>Research revealed that increased cigarette smoking, increased alcohol and recreational medication abuse, hesitating, violence, overeating and regular visits of healthcare services are the symptoms of behavioral strain.</s><s>Not all behavioral reactions to stressors ought to be organized as strain reactions, and only those reactions that are particularly and specifically dangerous to the individuals are the strain reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Behavioral problems are, for example, craving issue, exorbitant smoking and liquor failure to rest, and possible displays of withdrawal indications (i.e.</s><s>absenteeism and resignations from the employment).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model of occupational stress</head><p><s>The person-environment fit model.</s><s>The Person-Environment Fit Theory (P-E Fit Theory) was introduced by French, Rose, and Blackmore <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>It is one of the most primitive supported conceptual models regarding job stress.</s><s>It is a comprehensive idea that essentially consists of one's compatibility with numerous frameworks in occupational environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s><s>P-E fit refers to a compatibility between an individual's capabilities and the necessities of occupation.</s><s>The key evidence of the theory is that stress emerges from the fit or consistency with the individual and environment and not from the individual or the environment disjointedly <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>It proposes that unsatisfactory fit may contribute to physiological stress or mental stress or both.</s><s>People are more successful, powerful, more fulfilled and more dedicated to their employments when their own characteristics match the characteristics of their situational surroundings.</s><s>Research about the person-environment has been condemned fundamentally for lack of conceptualization of the environmental element of fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The job characteristics model.</s><s>Job Characteristics Model emphasizes on the crucial aspects of job characteristics.</s><s>For example, expertise assortment (what number of various aptitudes are required) task identity (how well usual functionalities are linked to overall work goals), task significance (how important the employment is), autonomy (how free the individual is to deal with their own working), and feedback (the amount of reward, commendation, or remarks the employee receives).</s><s>These characteristics are endorsed to contribute to Critical Psychological States' of experienced importance, experienced obligation with respect to results, and information of employment outcomes.</s><s>These characteristics may be positive or negative values.</s><s>Positive attributes boost the mental states contributing to scholarly and behavioural outcomes e.g.</s><s>satisfaction, inspiration, low level of absenteeism, sufficiency, productivity, advancement, turnover and so on.</s><s>In conjunction with the model, Hackman and Oldham designed the Job Diagnostic Survey, a questionnaire for determining one's occupation, the outcomes of which propose five principal sorts of employment redesign: development of working units; joining assignments; making feedback techniques; making a client centered structure; and employment advancement <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Effort reward imbalance model (ERI).</s><s>Effort Reward Imbalance (ERI) was introduced with aim to focus on cardiovascular disorders.</s><s>The main idea of this model is one of reciprocity, or work as a component of a social change process.</s><s>Echoing the balance orientation of the P-E fit model where a misfit between an individual's capabilities and the essentials of his employment causes strain, the important supposition of ERI is that efforts at work ought to be compensated by appropriate compensation, and a discrepancy between these will contribute to upsetting and distressing occurrences <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>A condition which is specifically to be anticipated when an individual gets low rewards because of high efforts.</s><s>Rewards are referred to career opportunities, money, respects and security.</s><s>Effort is composed of two components i.e., intrinsic efforts and extrinsic inspirations.</s><s>Intrinsic efforts take place from the personal motivation of an individual e.g., a need for control and over commitment (an inclination to make exceptional efforts or be dedicated on unpractical objectives).</s><s>Extrinsic inspirations, or external pressures i.e., workload.</s><s>ERI does not give a comprehensive redesign theory, yet like the DCS model, it supposes primary design principles in the light of essential interventions only, i.e. reasonable reward for effort, constructive criticism frameworks, and additional rewards and advancement prospects and so forth <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Job demand-control model.</s><s>The Job Demands-Control Model was designed by Karasek based upon the supposition that the relationship between employment demands and employment control will describe strain consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Job demand is defined as the independent variable that gauges stressors, for example, workload demands.</s><s>Job control was initially conceptualized under the expression job decision latitude and characterized it as a control that the working personnel has completed tasks and their execution during their functioning day.</s><s>Karasek recommended that when employment demands are high than employment control, strain will take place, contributing to both psychological and physical health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>The idea of job control has for quite some time been recognized as a vital factor in the process of occupational stress, but a question arises that how to operationalize this model and how the relationship between demands and control ought to be measured have contributed to conflicting findings and trouble in replicating Karasek's proposed model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Job Demand-Control Model classifies jobs into four kinds in the light of various blends of demands and control.</s><s>The primary sort called "active" and happens when the workforces have high demands and high control in the meantime.</s><s>Alternately, the second sort called "passive" and takes place when the workforces encounter little demands and they do not need high control.</s><s>The third sort called "relaxed" and takes place when the workers encounter little demands and they have high control.</s><s>The fourth kind which is the most stressful and upsetting situation called "Job strain" and occurs when the workforces experience too high demands while they have little control to deal with over-burden, conflict, ambiguities and stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Job-demands-resources model.</s><s>Job-Demands-Resources Model is one of the prominent models of occupational stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> and is linked to the Burnout Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Continuous stress is emotionally depleting and eventually prompts to a condition of 'burnout'.</s><s>Burnout has been conceptualized as a mental disorder created because of interminable interpersonal stressors at work and is described by three key measurements.</s><s>Firstly, burnout is described by incontrollable exhaustion, secondly by emotions of cynicism and separation from the employment, lastly by a feeling of incapability and lack of accomplishment.</s><s>The exhaustion component denotes the stress dimensions of burnout, that the cynicism component describes the interpersonal context of burnout, and that the incapability and lack of accomplishment components describe the self-evaluation dimension of burnout <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s>This model suggests that the two processes are responsible for the development of burnout.</s><s>Firstly, intense employment demands prompt to consistent straining of the individual and, ultimately to emotional exhaustion.</s><s>Secondly, inadequate resources accessible to the workers confounds the fulfilling of employment demands which then contribute to withdrawal behaviours and finally to discontinuation of work.</s><s>The Job-Demands-Resources Model accepts that despite the fact that workers in various associations might be gone up against with various working conditions, the characteristics of these working conditions can be ordered into two classifications-job demands and job resources.</s><s>Job resources are characterized as similar parts of one's employment (physical, mental, social or organizational) but those parts are useful in accomplishing work objectives, diminishing employment demands, or animating self-improvement and development.</s><s>Like the models of occupational stress introduced over, the Job-Demands-Resources Model deals with the supposition that stress in the working environment is caused due to interaction between individual and their surroundings <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Transactional theory of stress and coping.</s><s>The Transactional Theory of Stress and Coping was presented by Lazarus and Folkman <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>This model stresses the progressing and the mutual collaboration between the individual and the environment.</s><s>In view of this theory, stress is not occurred in individual or condition independently, however in the connection between the condition of people's appraisal of the working and ceaseless attempts to manage issues that develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In this theory, two processes distinguished the association between the individual and environment.</s><s>In the first process "cognitive appraisal", one assesses the significance and effect of a specific experience with the environment to the prosperity of the individual.</s><s>This includes evaluation of potential stressors as undermining and representing some sort of risk to the person.</s><s>Cognitive appraisal is proposed to assume a vital role in the coping process.</s><s>As the working environment is continuously changing, individuals observe diverse distressing circumstances in various ways and differ their utilization of adapting techniques crosswise over upsetting circumstances.</s><s>This implies that flexible stress appraisal encourages flexible coping responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The second process "coping" accomplishes certain internal and external requirements that are subjected to measure as stimulating and surpassing one's resources by changing cognitive and behavioral efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>This includes the assessment of coping resources and alternate reactions.</s><s>If a man sees that a circumstance is undermining, but can cope it, then trouble is not faced and this circumstance is seen as interesting and challenging.</s><s>In this model, coping is viewed as a vital technique on how people associate with the circumstances and is a continuous developing process that happens within the line of modifying people and situational demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Likewise, Folkman and Moskowitz <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> has characterized coping as the thoughts and behaviours utilized by people to control both the internal as well as external demands of conditions which are assessed as unpleasant.</s><s>Wilhelm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> found that some people have a tendency to change their methods of coping in various circumstances, while others tend to utilize similar courses regardless of situational characteristics.</s></p><p><s>A difference is normally created between problem focused coping that resolves the demands of a stressor while emotion focused coping assists the individual to feel better about the stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Stress and problems emerge when a man assesses the demands of a circumstance as going to surpass the existing resources and to be a risk for his/her prosperity, demanding an adjustment in individual working to return balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Fickova <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref> expressed that affectivity (positive and negative) indicates that which coping technique to be operated at the time of upsetting and distressing circumstances.</s><s>If feelings were rigorous, they modify the nature of the data processing approach and understanding to the individual that something is not right.</s><s>Furthermore, if feelings were of low strength, they indicate that all is going well.</s><s>Folkman and Lazarus <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> summarized the process in this model.</s><s>A potentially distressing occasion will produce the primary appraisal process in which a man assesses the degree of danger in connection to his/her prosperity.</s><s>When an occasion is seen as aggressive or a challenging, the secondary appraisal process gives a worldwide assessment of the individual's coping resources and capability to deal with the risk and challenge.</s><s>Coping responses begin after the cognitive appraisals and the stress consequences of this potentially upsetting occasion depend on the competency of one's cognitive appraisals and coping processes.</s><s>In spite of the fact that the transactional theory can anticipate individual contrasts in the experience and response to stress, it cannot foresee which facets of the workplace will be distressing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The transactional theory of stress and adapting system is the most suitable on account of its flexibility and mental enquiry about convictions, perspectives and practices related stress.</s><s>Besides, the transactional model has a few qualities; it clarifies adapting in steps, underlines the significance of thinking, recognition, and assurance of controllability, accentuates the role of ceaseless stressors or day by day disturbances as being more essential than every so often life occasions; tracks into account the association amongst individual and environment; and has a feedback system in the form of assessment or appraisal <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s></p></div>

move from physical to psychological wellsprings of pressure at work.</s><s>From various perspectives, pressure at work is psychologically healthy.</s><s>It gives individuals a chance to experience a feeling of challenge and accomplishment, both of which are crucial for high level of psychological well-being.</s><s>However, when pressures turn out to be excessively troublesome or frequent to deal with, psychological well-being is badly affected rather than improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>Well-being has turned into a mainstream point in logical research as it is seen

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample and sampling techniques</head><p><s>In educational research, multi-stage sampling technique is extensively practiced globally as it is more systematic, convenient and trustworthy.</s><s>Multistage sampling is used when the population is widely scattered and adequate resources are not available.</s><s>Different sampling techniques may be used for selecting sample at each stage according to the nature of the population i.e., simple random sampling technique, stratified sampling technique etc. Simple random sampling is the simplest of the probability sampling techniques.</s><s>A complete sampling frame is required for such sampling technique which is difficult to construct for larger populations.</s><s>A simple random sample is a sample selected in such a way that every possible sample of the same size is equally expected to be selected.</s><s>On the other hand, stratified sampling is used when the population may heterogeneous due to some characteristics i.e., gender, locality, income level, educational level etc.</s><s>It refers to the breakdown of the population into homogeneous and non-overlapping groups (i.e., strata) and after stratification of the population, simple random sampling is used to generate the entire sample.</s><s>In current study, the population was widely scattered and it was not possible to select sample randomly.</s><s>So, multistage sampling was adopted for selecting sample.</s><s>According to Gay <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, if the population had around 500 subjects, then 50% of the subjects may be sampled.</s><s>If the size of the population is 1,500, then the sample should be taken 20%.</s><s>Beyond a certain point (at approx.</s><s>N = 5,000), a sample size of 400 will be sufficient.</s><s>Hence, a researcher needs to take sample at smaller percentage if the population is larger.</s><s>Additionally, Gay and Diehl <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref> expressed that sample comprised of 10% of the population is adequate for a descriptive research.</s><s>However, if the population size is small then 20% should be taken.</s><s>On the other hand, in correlational research, at least 30 subjects are sufficient to examine a relationship between the variables.</s><s>But for the sake of validation of the findings, in current study, adequate sample size was taken.</s><s>So, at first stage 10 (40%) out of 25 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa i.e., Kohat, Karak, Bannu, Abbottabad, Peshawar, Lakki Marwat, Nowshera, Charssada, Malakand and Hangu were carefully chosen randomly as a primary sampling unit.</s><s>At second stage, 60% Boys and 60% Girls secondary schools were selected with the help of stratified sampling technique as secondary sampling unit.</s><s>At third stage, 75% male and 75% female secondary school heads were selected randomly from the said selected secondary schools as tertiary sampling unit.</s><s>In this way, the total sample comprised of 402 secondary school heads (Male n = 260; Female n = 142) selected from 534 government secondary schools located in the sample districts (See Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1)</ref>.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows the population and sample size of the study.</s></p></div>
