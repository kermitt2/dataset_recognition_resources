<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Along with the worldwide change toward increased reliance upon ultra-processed foods and increased awayfrom-home intake, a shift in food preparation and cooking behaviors has emerged in recent decades in industrialized countries, including France <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>This change could have an important impact on dietary quality and therefore health.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that lower frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and less time spent on meal preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, lower cooking skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and lower cooking enjoyment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> have been associated with unhealthier diet, such as poorer adherence to nutritional guidelines, more frequent fast-food use, higher intakes of fat and lower intakes of fruits and vegetables, fiber, folate, and vitamin A. Food preparation behaviors therefore appear to be a noteworthy determinant of dietary intake and may consequently influence weight status.</s></p><p><s>In spite of beneficial changes in dietary intake (mainly fruit and vegetables and energy intakes), intervention studies on cooking and home food preparation rarely highlight impact on adult Body Mass Index (BMI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>According to Reicks et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, these results should be interpreted with caution based on the weakness in the study design, varying duration of follow up and the lack of rigorous assessment.</s><s>The few cross-sectional studies in adults have shown that time spent in food preparation was inversely related to BMI in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> while higher consumption of foods prepared away from home was associated with higher BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>This may be in relation with their higher content in total fat and saturated fat compared with home prepared foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>As cross-sectional design does not allow causal inferences, longitudinal studies assessing the influence of food preparation behaviors on weight change are therefore needed.</s><s>To our knowledge, no study has investigated the association between food preparation behaviors and weight change with a prospective design.</s><s>In addition, the contribution of dietary intake to explain the influence of food preparation behaviors on weight status has never been explored.</s></p><p><s>Food preparation behaviors are complex to define and the research literature reports on a range of indicators to assess food preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s>Most studies assessed food preparation behaviors by measuring time spent on food preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and cooking skills and knowledge <ref type="bibr">[13, 14, 17-19, 30, 34-36]</ref>.</s><s>Some authors were interested in enjoyment of cooking <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>, others studied use of raw or fresh ingredients requiring no or minimal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, or the complexity of food preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Together, these dimensions may reflect many important elements of a food preparation behavioral pattern.</s><s>However, most studies used only one dimension to capture food preparation behaviors.</s><s>The conceptual model developed by Mills et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> illustrates the complex, inter-linked relationships between potential determinants and outcomes of home cooking.</s><s>Thus, time spent on food preparation is not only an indicator of food preparation behaviors but also a determinant of food preparation behaviors as time constraints play a major role in home cooking, particularly preparation from raw or fresh ingredients.</s><s>Also, this review underlined a probable conceptual misunderstanding in that researchers conflate 'cooking skills' and 'cooking' , and hence do not explicitly state and measure both concepts because they assume the two to be interchangeable <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, Short <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> explains that the relationship between skills and knowledge and practices is not straightforward: cooks do not necessarily use convenience foods because they cannot cook, but for other reasons, including, for example, a lack of time or a lack of enjoyment, that underlies the importance of considering all these dimensions together.</s></p><p><s>The aim of our study was therefore to assess the prospective association between food preparation behaviors, captured by several dimensions, and the 5-year relative weight change and the risk of developing obesity, in a large population of French adults.</s><s>In addition, we also investigated the mediating effect of dietary intake on the relationship between food preparation behaviors and weight status.</s><s>Since literature has shown that gender is a much stronger determinant of food preparation behaviors than other socio-demographic variables <ref type="bibr">[32-34, 38, 41]</ref>, the influence of food preparation behaviors on weight change was assessed separately for men and women.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design, setting and population</head><p><s>We used data from the NutriNet-Santé study, a large web-based prospective observational cohort launched in France in May 2009 among volunteers from the general population of internet-using adults (&gt; = 18 y).</s><s>The cohort was designed to investigate the relationship between nutrition and health, as well as determinants of dietary behavior and nutritional status.</s><s>The design, methods and rationale have been described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Briefly, eligible participants were recruited by different means.</s><s>At launching, a vast multimedia campaign (television, radio, national and regional newspapers, posters, and internet) called for volunteers and provided details on the study's specific website (http://www.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>Then, multimedia campaigns were repeated every 6 months.</s><s>Further information is being maintained on a large number of websites (national institutions, city councils, private firms, web organizations).</s><s>A billboard advertising campaign is regularly updated via professional channels (doctors, pharmacists, dentists, business partners, municipalities, etc.).</s><s>The key message delivered in the call for volunteers was the following: "The purpose of our study is to identify nutritional risk factors or protective factors for these diseases, which is an essential step in establishing dietary recommendations to prevent the risk of disease and improve the health of the current and future generations.</s><s>This is the ambitious goal of the NutriNet-Santé study and that is why researchers need you".</s><s>Aspects related to convenience of participation (ie, &lt; 20 min each month) and confidentiality were also emphasized.</s><s>In addition, a system of boosting motivation and retention was implemented <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>In order to forge a sense of community that helps advance research, participants receive a NutriNet-Santé membership card at inclusion and a «diploma» upon completion of each follow-up year/wave.</s><s>They also receive by monthly e-mail with scientific information regarding health and nutrition, and invitations to press conferences about the study results.</s><s>For purposes of retention, free screening tests for cholesterol, triglycerides, and diabetes are offered to participants (the results are sent back with a special notice in case of abnormal test results).</s><s>In case of an "undelivered email" problem, participants are contacted by telephone and by post to avoid drop-out.</s><s>In order to be included in the cohort, participants had to complete a set of questionnaires assessing dietary intake, physical activity, anthropometry, smoking and socio-economic conditions, along with health status at baseline and each subsequent year.</s><s>Additionally, each month participants were invited to complete complementary questionnaires related to the food behaviors, nutritional and health status.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethics, consent and permissions</head><p><s>This study was conducted according to guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (IRB Inserm n°0000388FWA00005831) and the Commission Nationale Informatique et Libertés (CNIL n°908,450 and n°909,216).</s><s>This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov</s><s>(n°NCT03335644).</s><s>Written electronic informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all subjects.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>This longitudinal analysis focused on participants included in the NutriNet-Santé cohort study between May 2009 and May 2011.</s><s>Food preparation behaviors were assessed in May 2011.</s><s>Data regarding sociodemographic, lifestyle and behavioral characteristics and dietary intake used in this analysis were also collected in 2011.</s><s>Weight and height data were collected in 2011 and 5 years later, in 2016.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Food preparation behaviors</head><p><s>Based on published literature available at the time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>, food preparation behaviors were captured by several dimensions: cooking frequency, daily time spent on food preparation, preparation from scratch, cooking skills, cooking enjoyment, willingness to cook better or more frequently, and kitchen equipment.</s><s>Recently, the area of measuring cooking skills and food preparation behaviors has been advanced in terms of development and validation, including new dimensions such as food self-efficacy, food attitude and the influence of non-food barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Face validity was assessed by experts and subjects.</s><s>A team of multidisciplinary researchers (nutritionists, dieticians, economists and sociologists) developed the questionnaire.</s><s>They evaluated whether the items were relevant to assess the measured concept, and only that concept, and whether they constituted a representative sample of a set of items describing the concept.</s><s>Experts also evaluated the quality of the visible features of the items: length, items' wording, and categories of response.</s><s>Acceptability and feasibility were also measured in 100 subjects using specific questions on the perceived complexity and difficulty of filling in the questionnaire and whether the questionnaire was too long or any items were redundant, using a 4-point Likert scale from "I strongly disagree" to "I strongly agree".</s><s>For 97% of the sub-sample who assessed the feasibility of the questionnaire, the questionnaire was not difficult; only 1% found it difficult.</s><s>For 93% of the participants, the questionnaire was not annoying; only 6% found it annoying.</s><s>Finally, 82% thought the questionnaire was not too long but 10% found it too long.</s><s>Test-retest reliability (repeatability) on variables was assessed in 22 subjects who filled out the questionnaire twice at a two-week interval, by computing the prevalence-and bias adjusted kappa coefficient (PABAK) for each item of the questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Repeatability was considered satisfactory for a PABAK higher than 0.40, with an interpretation similar to Cohen's kappa coefficient.</s><s>Only four items had a PABAK &lt; 0.40 (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>).</s><s>PABAK for other items was between 0.35 and 0.67.</s></p><p><s>Frequency and time for meal preparation Participants were asked who the main cook in the household was and how often they prepared meals during a typical week, including preparation of a cold dish or reheating a prepared dish (two or more times per day, once a day, several times a week but not every day, once a week, less than once a week, never).</s><s>If participants answered never, no further questions regarding food preparation behaviors were asked.</s><s>Otherwise, participants were asked how much time (in minutes) they usually spent preparing meals, including cooking time.</s><s>To assess average daily time preparing food, we multiplied the duration for meal preparation by the frequency and divided by 7.</s></p><p><s>Preparation from scratch The definition of "preparation from scratch" generally suggest cooking with raw, fresh or minimally processed foods and without the use of ultra-processed foods for which consumption is known to be associated with lower nutritional quality and higher risks of obesity and chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>To assess preparation from scratch participants were asked about their use of foods (fruit, vegetable, fish and meat) according to their processing level.</s><s>In addition, among unprocessed meat and fish, we have distinguished forms of unprocessed meat or fish according to the investment and the techniques to prepare them (for instance whole fish not cleaned out vs. fish fillets, sliced, pavers or steaks).</s><s>Use of fruit or vegetables with no or minimal processing was assessed with the questions "Among the following fruits/vegetables, which ones do you use unpeeled, uncut, unprocessed?".</s><s>The ten groups of vegetables proposed covered the foods more consumed in France categorized by groups usually purchased by French consumers (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s>Use of unprocessed fruit and use of unprocessed 'tomato, pepper, eggplant' , 'cucumber, zucchini' , 'garlic, onions, shallots' and potatoes were excluded from the score calculation as more than 95% of the participants used these items.</s><s>When a participant self-reported the use of an unpeeled, uncut, unprocessed vegetable group, 1 point was allocated (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>For fish, participants had to determine what forms of fish they usually use (whole fish not cleaned out, whole fish cleaned out, fish fillets, sliced, pavers or steaks, breaded fish).</s></p><p><s>Participants also had to assess what forms of meat they usually use (chunky uncut pieces, whole poultry not cleaned out, whole poultry cleaned out, cut poultry or meat, ready to cook poultry or meat such as ultraprocessed meat and nuggets).</s><s>Participants were allowed to select several types of fish and meat.</s><s>When a participant self-reported the use of whole fish, 2 points were allocated (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>When a participant self-reported the use of breaded fish and the use of other forms, 1 point was allocated, whereas when participants only reported breaded fish or no other form of fish, no points were allocated.</s><s>When a participant self-reported the use of chunky uncut pieces, whole poultry not cleaned out, whole poultry cleaned out, cut poultry or meat (even if participant also used ready to cook poultry or meat), 1 point was allocated whereas, when participants only reported ready to cook poultry or meat such as ultra-processed meat and nuggets, no points were allocated.</s><s>A score of preparation from scratch was calculated from 0 to 12 points according to answers regarding use of raw vegetables, forms of fish and meat used (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As Pearson correlations are not adapted to noncontinuous variables and tend to underestimate the relationships between ordinal variables, polychoric correlations were used in this analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Internal consistency for preparation from scratch was therefore estimated with the ordinal alpha coefficient <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>, which is more accurate in estimating alphas for measurements involving ordinal variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>.</s><s>Although it is calculated using polychoric correlations, it is conceptually equivalent to Cronbach's alpha and has a similar interpretation, i.e. a value higher than 0.70 is considered adequate <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</s><s>Ordinal alpha value was 0.72 for the dimension assessing preparation from scratch, indicating adequate internal consistency (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>Then, polychoric correlations between the items and their respective dimension corrected for overlap (i.e., the modified subscale after removal of the studied item) were also computed.</s><s>The aim of this analysis was to verify that items were substantially correlated with their assigned dimension.</s><s>A polychoric correlation ≥0.40, corrected for overlap, is considered adequate.</s><s>For this dimension, corrected item total polychoric correlations were all above 0.40 (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S3</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Cooking skills Participants were also asked to assess their cooking skills regarding 7 dishes, 8 pastries and sweets, 7 sauces and 4 cooking techniques (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>).</s><s>A large range of foods was used, both including generic items previously used in studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54]</ref> and specific dishes/pastries frequently consumed in France <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, to assess the ability to cook the dishes rather than ability to choose the healthier dishes and to therefore avoid desirability bias to self-report preparation of healthy vs. unhealthy dishes/pastries.</s><s>Skills to cook dishes and pastries were evaluated using two types of questions, according to the dishes/pastries and sweets.</s><s>For instance, to the question 'Do you know how to make pancakes or waffles?' participants could answer "Yes, I know", "Yes, I know but only with ready for use pancake batter", "No, I don't know" and "I've never tried".</s><s>Individuals tend to adopt a more time-efficient food preparation behavior that influence their cooking skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To reflect this behavior in assessment of cooking skills, when a participant reported making the more complex variant of the dish/pastry/sweet, i.e. entirely homemade, without ready for use ingredients, 2 points were allocated whereas, when participants reported preparing the variant with ready for use ingredients, 1 point was allocated.</s><s>When ready for use preparation does not exist for a dish/ pastry, participants could answer "Yes, I know", "No, I don't know" and "I've never tried".</s><s>Some dishes such as omelet and vegetable soup were not included in the score as more than 90% of the participants declared making these dishes.</s><s>The same answers were proposed to evaluate cooking techniques.</s><s>When a participant answered "Yes, I

appeared to substantially explain this relationship.</s><s>Results have also shown that there was no significant association between other indicators of food preparation behaviors and 5-year relative weight change after adjustment for sociodemographic, lifestyle and behavioral factors, suggesting a poor impact of food preparation behaviors (as measured in this study) on weight change over time.</s></p><p><s>No study has explored the influence of use of fresh or minimally processed foods on weight change.</s><s>However, our finding is in line with previous works which reported higher obesity prevalence in subjects with greater household availability and higher intake of ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat foods known as ultra-processed foods, compared with those who mainly used and consumed fresh or minimally processed foods <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, ready-to-eat

consequences on body weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>.</s><s>Unlike for the risk of obesity, association between preparation from scratch and 5-year relative weight change in women was not significant after adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, due to the confounding effects of age, education, smoking status and history of dieting.</s><s>Indeed, these factors were positively associated with score of preparation from scratch and inversely associated with 5-year relative weight change (lower weight change with increased age and education and among never-smokers and never-dieters) while they were not significantly associated with obesity risk.</s></p><p><s>Women with greater cooking skills and women who did not wish to cook better or more frequently gained less weight than those with low skills and those with willingness to cook better and more frequently, but this association did not remain significant after adjustment for confounding factors.</s><s>In particular, we observed a strong confounding effect of age in these relationships, when adding this variable in the model.</s><s>Descriptive analysis showed that older women gained less weight over 5

potential beneficial effect of cooking skills on weight gain may therefore be due to generational influence.</s><s>Compared with women of older generations, young generations had less acquired cooking skills (score of cooking skills in women &lt; 25 years: 4.0 (1.1) vs. women &gt; 65 years: 5.2 (1.3), P &lt; 0.0001).</s><s>This may be due to a decline in the intergenerational transmission of basic

subjects included in the analysis sample were less likely to be current dieters and were more physically active than the overall sample.</s><s>Thus, weight changes may have been underestimated in this

type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, a previous work regarding participants in our cohort showed that the exclusive use of the Internet for data collection and follow-up may help to increase the proportion of population groups which are often underrepresented in volunteer cohorts such as men and older subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, previous work showed a great geographic and socio-demographic diversity in participants at baseline in the NutriNet-Santé study, which showed resemblance in terms of age and income distribution with the French general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As food preparation behaviors and confounding factors have been assessed at baseline, we did not have the evolution of food preparation behaviors over the 5-year period, which could vary differently in subjects who became obese during the follow-up, compared with others.</s><s>However, baseline food preparation behaviors of excluded obese individuals and participants who became obese were compared and no significant difference has been found (data not shown).</s><s>This suggests that causal relationships between food preparation behaviors and risk to become obese is explained by differential exposure at baseline to specific dimensions of food preparation behaviors.</s><s>Although the follow-up time was appropriate to perform our analyses, it did not necessarily guarantee this sufficient delay.</s><s>In addition, this study was based on an observational cohort and thus residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out even though a wide range of confounding factors were taken into account.</s><s>Another limitation was that the data were self-reported, which may induce misreporting.</s><s>Bias associated with social desirability is lower in studies using self-reported questionnaires, rather than face to face interviews, because it introduces distance between the investigator and the subject <ref

different indicators such as frequency and time spent preparing food, self-estimated cooking skills and knowledge, enjoyment of cooking, preparation from scratch or complex food preparation techniques was performed to develop the questionnaire.</s><s>However, the validity and reliability of the questions used to assess food preparation behaviors have not been explored.</s><s>Although cooking skills and preparation from scratch showed adequate internal consistency, questions used here may not adequately capture these complex constructs, particularly cooking skills.</s><s>Even though cooking skills regarding several common dishes, pastries and sweets, sauces and cooking techniques were assessed, they may be too specific to capture the full complexity of cooking skills.</s><s>Also, people with different cooking skills may have responded similarly to the same questions because some people may prepare their meals from basic ingredients, while others may use ready to use foods.</s><s>However, to avoid this bias, participants could report preparing the dishes entirely homemade or preparing the variant with ready for use ingredients.</s><s>However, a comprehensive and

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In the unfavorable context from reduced time spent preparing meals over recent decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, our prospective study does not show effect of food preparation behaviors on relative weight change and obesity risk over 5 years, except for preparation from scratch.</s><s>Our findings highlighted that preparation from scratch was associated with a decreased risk of obesity after 5 years of follow up in women and healthier dietary intake in women with greater preparation from scratch largely explained this relationship.</s><s>Our study therefore provides useful information about the long term implications of food preparation behaviors on health and should be corroborated by future studies.</s><s>In addition, as suggested by several reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, there is a clear need for longitudinal studies to identify causal relationships, particularly to establish whether food preparation behaviors are associated with risk of chronic diseases such as incident diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular diseases, compared with other determinants.</s><s>Our findings emphasize the need to consider the use of fresh and minimally processed foods in the management and prevention of obesity.</s><s>In addition to the health impact, the displacement of minimally processed foods and home prepared dishes and meals by ultra-processed products may be troublesome from social, cultural, economic, political and environmental points of view <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s>Further researches focusing on the impact of food preparation behaviors on these dimensions should be conducted.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Flowchart</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Flowchart</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
