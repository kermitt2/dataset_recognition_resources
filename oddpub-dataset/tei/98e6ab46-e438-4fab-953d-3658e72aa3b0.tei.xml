<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the most important biological barrier between the blood circulation and the central nervous system (CNS), consisting of specialized blood endothelial cells (ECs) that line the cerebral capillaries and are connected by very dense tight junctions (TJs).</s><s>Anatomically, the BBB is part of the neurovascular unit, which maintains the physiological function of the brain capillary ECs and includes cellular components such as pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, and microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hawkins and Davis, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The main functions of the BBB are the maintenance of CNS homeostasis and the prevention of penetration of neurotoxic substances as well as pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses.</s><s>Besides functioning as a physical barrier, the BBB plays a major role as a transport and metabolic barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Neuhaus and Noe, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Models of the BBB serve as very strong tools in drug development and are important to elucidate further physiological and pathophysiological molecular mechanisms.</s><s>Besides in silico and in vivo models, a variety of cellular in vitro BBB models are available, such as transwell models, dynamic flow-based hollow-fiber models, or microfluidic devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Avdeef et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>So far, primary porcine, bovine, and rodent ECs are characterized by the best func-tionality, tightest barrier integrity, and lowest permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Vastag and Keseru, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Disadvantages associated with the use of primary cells are the time-and cost-intensive isolation processes, the variabilities between cells of different isolations, and the high consumption of animals for each new isolation.</s><s>Access to human primary brain material is very limited and restricted to biopsy or autopsy material from patients with diseases such as epilepsy or brain tumors.</s><s>The use of EC lines for BBB modeling helps to circumvent the disadvantages of primary cells.</s><s>Immortalized cells of different species, such as murine EC lines (MBEC4, b.END3, b.END5, cEND, cerebEND) as well as cell lines from rat (RBE4), cow (t-BBEC-117), pig (PBMEC/ C1-2), and human (hCMEC/D3, hBMEC, TY10, and BB19) exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eigenmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Avdeef et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>These cell lines have the advantage of being usable over many passages with a higher reproducibility of the results compared with primary cells.</s><s>Notably, almost all immortalized cell lines form barriers with a transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) below 150 U cm 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Deli et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>For drug transport and barrier functionality studies, a minimal tightness of the BBB models with TEER values between 150 and 200 U cm 2 has been defined <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gaillard and de Boer, 2000)</ref>.</s><s>However, compared with physiological TEER values of more than 1,500 U cm 2 , which have been measured in capillaries of rat or frog brains <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Crone and Olesen, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Butt et al., 1990)</ref>, the discrepancies with current in vitro models are significant.</s><s>Another important aspect is the species differences that exist between humans and other mammalian subsets.</s><s>In particular, the expression and functionality of important BBB transporters such as P-glycoprotein are described <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Takeuchi et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Warren et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Therefore, there is a significant need for adequate human BBB models for academic research and the pharmaceutical industry.</s><s>Minimal requirements would be the reproducibility of results, characteristic permeability of reference components, expression of main BBB transporters, and physiological cell morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cecchelli et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In recent promising studies, various stem cell types have been used as an alternative source for BBB remodeling.</s><s>Stem cells are self-renewable, can be subsequently differentiated into mature somatic cell types, and serve as a virtually unlimited independent cell source.</s><s>In particular, hematopoietic stem cells from human umbilical cord blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cecchelli et al., 2014)</ref>, circulating endothelial progenitor cells mobilized from bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boyer-Di Ponio et al., 2014)</ref>, as well as human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lippmann et al., 2012)</ref> have been used for BBB modeling with promising in vivo-like characteristics, e.g.</s><s>TEER values up to 5,000 U cm 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lippmann et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The addition of stimulating compounds such as retinoic acid (RA) during differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lippmann et al., 2014)</ref> and co-culturing with individual niche cell types, such as pericytes, astrocytes, and neural cells, have further improved BBB properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lippmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cecchelli et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the individual impact of the different cell types on hiPSCderived BBB endothelial cell (hiPS-EC) function as well as gene expression and therefore establish the most predictive BBB model.</s><s>Furthermore, we standardized the methods to differentiate the corresponding BBB cell types from hiPSCs as well as human multipotent stem cells.</s><s>Thus, it will be technically feasible to generate large quantities of human cell types from a single cell source and, in combination with new detection methods, to develop standardized higher-throughput in vitro assays in drug discovery and toxicity testing.</s></p></div>

(2016)</ref>.</s><s>Morphology of hiPS-NSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>) appeared as typical rosette-like structures, whereas fNSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1L</ref>) were more heterogeneous, some of them with elongated processes.</s><s>After culturing both NSC types in NSC medium containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), NSCs could be further expanded in vitro.</s><s>NSC identity was confirmed by staining for early NSC markers such as SOX1 <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1E and 1I),</ref><ref type="bibr">SOX2 (Figures 1F and 1J),</ref><ref type="bibr">and NESTIN (Figures 1G and 1K)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the expression of pluripotency and astroglial markers could not be detected (data not shown).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BBB Modeling and Tightness Characterization</head><p><s>To investigate the influence of different cell types on BBB hiPS-EC integrity, diverse sets of BBB co-cultures were es-tablished.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, the differentiated hiPS-ECs were cultured on a collagen IV-/fibronectin-coated transwell membrane.</s><s>The different types of co-culture cells were seeded in coated wells in the bottom compartment without direct contact with the hiPS-ECs.</s><s>We studied the influence of primary fetal brain astrocytes, hiPS-As, primary fetal brain pericytes, and NSCs derived from hiPSCs (hiPS-NSCs) or isolated from fetal brain (fNSCs) on BBB hiPS-EC integrity.</s><s>Moreover, we established several combinations of the above-mentioned cell types to study synergistic effects.</s></p><p><s>After 2 days of co-culture, the TEER was measured as the first important readout characterizing the paracellular tightness of hiPS-ECs.</s><s>The cell density of co-culture cells was kept constant independent from the co-culture system.</s><s>A significant increase in TEER compared with the hiPS-EC monocultures (TEER = 1,198 ± 265) could be obtained by triple culture of hiPS-ECs, hiPS-NSCs, and pericytes (1,723 ± 90 U cm 2 ) as well as by quadruple culture of hiPS-ECs, hiPS-NSCs, astrocytes, and pericytes (1,757 ± 320 U cm 2 ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>Maximal absolute TEER values ranged between 2,000 U cm 2 (mono-culture) and 2,500 U cm 2 (triple and quadruple culture), approximately (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition to TEER measurements, we analyzed BBB models according to a characteristic gene expression profile via qRT-PCR.</s><s>Genes included the efflux transporter ABCB1, the glutamate transporter SLC1A1, the glucose transporter SLC2A1, and TJ component OCLN.</s><s>The hiPS-EC mono-culture (100%) was compared with the different co-culture settings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>), and a 1.5-fold regulation in gene expression was set as an arbitrary biological threshold.</s><s>In concordance with the TEER experiments, the most robust upregulation was observed for the quadruple culture, indicating effective modeling of the BBB phenotype.</s><s>Under these conditions, the expression of ABCB1 was on average upregulated by 1.5-fold, SLC1A1 by 1.3-fold, SLC2A1 by 1.7-fold, and OCLN by 1.6-fold compared with hiPS-ECs from mono-cultures, however statistical significance was reached only for SLC2A1.</s><s>The triple culture of hiPS-ECs, hiPS-NSCs, and pericytes revealed only moderate upregulation of 1.3-fold for ABCB1, 1.5-fold for SLC1A1, 1.2-fold for SLC2A1, and 1.4-fold for OCLN.</s><s>Other co-culture systems also yielded moderate upregulation in expression of these genes, however, with higher variances as in the quadruple culture.</s><s>Noteworthy, no significant effects were observed on gene expression and TEER of hiPS-ECs using the control colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>As the quadruple culture showed the strongest enhancement of the phenotypical development of BBB properties, (F-H, J-L, and N-P) The astrocytic proteins GFAP (F and J) and S100b (G and K) were expressed by hiPS-A as well as by human primary brain astrocytes.</s><s>Human primary brain pericytes were characterized by staining for aSMA (N) and PDGFRb (O).</s><s>Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI in blue.</s><s>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of astrocytic protein GFAP (H and L) and pericyte marker PDGFRb (P) reveals quantification of 53.8% GFAP-positive hiPS-As (H), 99.9% GFAP-positive primary astrocytes (L), and 85.2% primary pericytes.</s><s>Scale bars, 100 mm.</s><s>further analyses focused on the comparison between the mono-culture and the quadruple setup.</s><s>To characterize the functionality of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, we performed transport studies with the substrate rhodamine 123 with and without inhibiting the transporter by use of verapamil (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>).</s><s>The permeability coefficients (PC cell ) for rhodamine 123 could be significantly increased in the mono-culture setup as well as in the quadruple culture by adding verapamil, indicating the correct transporter functionality and polarization in the cell membrane.</s></p><p><s>To characterize the paracellular permeability of the cell layers in a molecular size-dependent manner, transport studies with several paracellular marker molecules such as lucifer yellow ($0.44 kDa), fluorescein ($0.33 kDa), and FITC-labeled dextrans (4 and 40 kDa) were accomplished (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>As expected, lucifer yellow and fluorescein permeated very similarly (PC cell $1.5 mm/min).</s><s>FITClabeled dextran (4 kDa) migrated about 100-fold slower than these two small paracellular markers, and the PCs for 40 kDa FITC-labeled dextran were even smaller (PC cell 0.003-0.0054</s><s>mm/min).</s><s>Corresponding to the TEER values, comparison with the mono-culture revealed a lower, statistically significant different permeability of 40 kDa FITClabeled dextran across the quadruple cultures.</s></p><p><s>Paracellular permeability is functionally linked to the expression of junctional molecules, especially of claudins (CLDN).</s><s>Therefore, the expression of major TJ and TJassociated molecules was analyzed.</s><s>In addition to occludin (OCLN, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>), we determined mRNA expression of CLDN3, CLDN4, CDH5, and TJP1 (ZO-1) of quadruple cultures in direct comparison with mono-cultures, however upregulation was mostly below the threshold of 1.5-fold, and no statistical significant effects were detected (data not shown).</s><s>The expression of all analyzed genes could be qualitatively confirmed representatively in mono-cultures by gel electrophoresis of PCR products (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s><s>At the protein level, the presence of the TJ proteins CLDN1, CLDN4, and CLDN5 was also confirmed, again without any statistically significant change in contact with co-culture cells).</s><s>At day 1, the growth factor concentration in the growth medium was reduced to stop hiPS-EC proliferation.</s><s>The models were analyzed at day 2 by TEER measurement, qRT-PCR, western blot, electron microscopy, and transport studies.</s><s>expression as shown by western blot analysis (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A  and 4B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In order to confirm the role of claudins for paracellular tightness from BBB hiPS-EC layers, the effects of claudin-specific TJ modulators on TEER were investigated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</s><s>These TJ modulators were based on the claudin-binding domain of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Protze et al.,
