<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>In bacteriophages related to T4, hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) is incorporated into the genomic DNA during DNA replication and is then further modified to glucosyl-hmC by phage-encoded glucosyltransferases. Previous studies have shown that RB69 shares a core set of genes with T4 and relatives.</s><s>However, unlike the other "RB" phages, RB69 is unable to recombine its DNA with T4 or with the other "RB" isolates.</s><s>In addition, despite having homologs to the T4 enzymes used to synthesize hmC, RB69 has no identified homolog to known glucosyltransferase genes.</s><s>In this study we sought to understand the basis for RB69's behavior using high-pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and mass spectrometry.</s><s>Our analyses identified a novel phage epigenetic DNA sugar modification in RB69 DNA, which we have designated arabinosyl-hmC (ara-hmC).</s><s>We sought a putative glucosyltranserase responsible for this novel modification and determined that RB69 also has a novel transferase gene, ORF003c, that is likely responsible for the arabinosyl-specific modification.</s><s>We propose that ara-hmC was responsible for RB69 being unable to participate in genetic exchange with other hmC-containing T-even phages, and for its described incipient speciation.</s><s>The RB69 ara-hmC also likely protects its DNA from some anti-phage type-IV restriction endonucleases.</s><s>Several T4-related phages, such as E. coli phage JS09 and Shigella phage Shf125875 have homologs to RB69 ORF003c, suggesting the ara-hmC modification may be relatively common in T4-related phages, highlighting the importance of further work to understand the role of this modification and the biochemical pathway responsible for its production.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>T-even bacteriophages were the source of the first discovered epigenetic modifications of DNA-a significant finding as it formed the basis for the discovery of the first phage DNA-targeted host restriction-modification enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In T-even phages, all cytosine (C) positions in the genomic DNA are completely substituted by hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, which can be further modified, or "hypermodified", by conversion to glucosyl-hmC (g-hmC).</s><s>These g-hmC modifications are believed to function primarily to protect the phage DNA from restriction endonuclease (RE) attack, as evidenced by the number of enzymes unable to cleave T-even phage DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, g-hmC modification proved a major hindrance to initial efforts to sequence the T4 genome until the creation of T4 strains with multiple gene mutations for which DNAs have no modified cytosine (T4C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>However, the g-hmC modification does not ensure escape from all restriction enzymes and recent studies have identified a remarkable diversity of type IV restriction enzymes that specifically target hmC and g-hmC modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Illustrating the complexity of phage-bacterial interactions is the observation that specific protein inhibitors of type-IV REs that attack glucosylated hmC DNAs are injected by T-even phages into the E. coli cell with the genomic DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>.</s><s>Recent studies have also highlighted another likely advantage of g-hmC for evasion of host CRISPR-Cas systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The creation of T-even phage g-hmC is a multi-step process and differs from other well-known phage DNA modifications which result from a multitude of phage and host biochemical pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>T-even hmC is synthesized by a phage-encoded thymidylate synthase homolog (dCMP hydroxymethylase, gp42 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">12]</ref>) which adds a hydroxymethyl group to deoxycytidine monophosphate.</s><s>This is then incorporated into the genomic DNA during replication by the phage DNA polymerase gp43 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The hmC is further modified to alpha-and beta-stereospecific glucosyl-hmC (g-hmC) by phage-encoded glucosyltransferases that employ uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) synthesized by the E. coli host <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Among the "classical" T4, T2, and T6 phages that have been intensively studied at the enzyme and biochemical level, it has been reported that the hmC glucose modifications vary in extent (T4, 100%, T2 and T6, 75% hmC modification) as well as type of linkages <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>.</s><s>T4 DNA has 70% alphaand 30% beta-stereospecific glucosyl hmC produced by its alpha-glucosyltransferase (a-gt) and beta-glucosyltransferase (b-gt), respectively.</s><s>The T4 hmC is first modified by its a-gt DNA immediately after replication (as inferred by its interactions with gp45, the replicative sliding clamp) but as the a-gt is unable to modify neighboring hmC residues, these unmodified residues are then modified by the b-gt <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>.</s><s>T2 and T6 have β-1,6-glucosyl-α-glucose (gentiobiosyl) hmC (72% in T6 and 5% in T2) produced by homologous beta-alpha glucosyltransferases (ba-gt), as reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Despite these g-hmC variations between T4, T2, and T6, viable genetic crosses can easily be made between these three phages.</s></p><p><s>Based on the characterization of T2, T4, and T6, the DNA modifications in other closely related bacteriophages with hmC DNAs have generally been supposed to also be glucosylations, although their chemistries have only been poorly if at all characterized.</s><s>However, reflecting on the diversity of DNA modifications that have been identified in the small sample size of T4-related phages for which DNAs have been studied, we hypothesized that there may be a greater diversity of sugar modifications in these phages than previously realized.</s><s>We were particularly intrigued by the E. coli phage RB69-one of the famous "RB" phages isolated by Rosina Berry from sewage from Long Island, NY, USA <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref>-which is presumed to have modified DNA despite having no reported glucosyltransferases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>That RB69 DNA is modified has been inferred from it having homologs to T4's two hydroxymethyltransferases (dCMP-hydroxymethylase and dCTPase-dUTPase) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, in addition to the T4 genes implicated in degradation or inhibition of expression of unmodified (dCMP) DNA (Alc, DenA, and DenB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Further support that RB69 DNA is likely modified is that it is cleaved by type-IV restriction enzyme GmrSD which does not cleave unmodified DNAs, such as that of the Lambda phage <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, restriction of RB69 infection by this and related enzymes is prevented by its internal protein I (IPI*) which is very similar (four residues different) to T4 IPI*, a GmrSD inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22]</ref>.</s><s>Based on our previous work on type-IV restriction enzymes and T4 IP proteins, we were motivated to clarify if RB69 hmC DNA underwent hypermodification, and if so what the nature of that modification was.</s></p><p><s>In this work we demonstrate the existence of a novel epigenetic phage DNA modification, arabinosyl-hmC (ara-hmC), that extends the repertoire of the T-even phage family modifications and suggests the likelihood of other, possibly even more complex, sugar modifications decorating the hmC residues of other phages.</s><s>We have identified a novel transferase, likely responsible for this arabinosyl-specific modification, and a novel gene module unique to RB69 and its relatives located between the DNA polymerase and UvsX genes that may have a role in the generation of the UDP-arabinose employed by the novel transferase.</s></p></div>
