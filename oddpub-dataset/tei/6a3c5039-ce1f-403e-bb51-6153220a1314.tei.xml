<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In Brief</head><p><s>Transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) leads to the phosphorylation of Smad proteins and thereby facilitates the formation of different trimeric Smad complexes.</s><s>By combining quantitative mass spectrometry with mathematical modeling, the identities of the formed trimeric Smad complexes are resolved and the link of these transcription factors with target gene expression is established.</s><s>This approach allows predicting based on gene expression data that in hepatocellular carcinoma the abundance of Smad proteins and their phosphorylation is elevated, which was experimentally validated.</s><s>The receptor Smad proteins, Smad2 and Smad3, interact with the common Smad (Smad4), form trimeric complexes, and translocate to the nucleus, where they interact with other proteins including other transcription factors and regulate transcription of hundreds of genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Moustakas and Heldin, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Smad2 and Smad3 are regulated by phosphorylation, but not Smad4.</s><s>Based on the three Smad proteins with three phosphorylation states for Smad2 and Smad3 (n = 7) and the trimeric complexes (k = 3), the theoretical number of different Smad complexes can be calculated according to the formula for unordered sampling with replacement:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">n + k À 1 k = 84 (Equation 1)</formula><p><s>Thus, in principle, 84 different trimeric Smad complexes can form, but it has not been determined which Smad complexes indeed occur in particular cell types such as hepatocytes.</s></p><p><s>Depending on the cell type, only distinct sets of target genes are induced by TGF-b.</s><s>This could be mediated by the interaction of Smad complexes with other transcription factors or crosstalk with other signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Feng and Derynck, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the amount, composition, or dynamics of Smad complex formation could differ.</s><s>Therefore, systematic studies are required to decipher the contribution of individual Smad complexes to gene expression.</s></p><p><s>Numerous intragenic mutations and homozygous deletions of Smad2 and Smad4, as well as downregulation of Smad3 mRNA, were reported for different forms of carcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Levy and Hill, 2006)</ref>.</s><s>While attempts were made to quantify Smad expression levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dzieran et al., 2013)</ref>, potential alterations in the abundance of Smad proteins in liver cancer tissue and hepatoma cell lines compared with primary hepatocytes have not been addressed.</s><s>So far the impact of TGF-b stimulation was only examined in proteome-wide studies that analyzed changes in proteins and phosphorylation sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ali and Molloy, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">D'Souza et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However, comprehensive information on the abundance and the degree of phosphorylation of Smad proteins is currently not available.</s></p><p><s>TGF-b-induced signal transduction has been approached by mathematical modeling that addressed the dynamics of ligandreceptor interaction, identified the role of negative feedbacks, and provided insights into nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Schmierer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zi et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, most of these mathematical models were primarily based on literature knowledge, and only few of these studies included experimental data.</s><s>None of the previously published mathematical models accounted for the composition of the trimeric Smad complexes and the specific link to Smad complex-mediated gene expression.</s></p><p><s>Combining mass spectrometric data and mathematical modeling as utilized for the analysis of mechanisms governing dimerization of phosphorylated Stat5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boehm et al., 2014)</ref>, could provide valuable information on Smad complex formation.</s><s>In such an approach, proteomics provides data on protein abundance, while mathematical modeling provides a tool for an unbiased selection strategy for the identification of transcription factor complexes that are present in a given cell type.</s><s>Since the number of candidate models grows exponentially with the number of model parameters, finding the exact solution of such a model selection task is very challenging.</s><s>We developed a method to distinguish non-essential from essential model parameters by combining nonlinear mathematical modeling with L 1 regularization <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Merkle et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Steiert et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s>The L 1 regularization approach can be employed to investigate which model reactions are required to describe experimental data.</s><s>Therefore the L 1 regularization approach could be utilized to statistically assess which individual reaction parameters leading to complex formation are necessary and sufficient and thereby identify essential protein complexes.</s></p><p><s>Here we combine quantitative experimental techniques with mathematical modeling approaches to resolve complexity in Smad complex formation and to establish a quantitative link to transcriptional activities in hepatoma cell lines and primary hepatocytes.</s></p></div>
