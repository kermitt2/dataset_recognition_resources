being conducted in patients with advanced cancer in Korea.</s><s>Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of MCP in patients with pancreatobiliary cancer.</s><s>We examined emotional distress and QoL before MCP and 2 months after its completion.</s><s>The MCP group showed significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and anxious preoccupation related to mental adjustment to cancer, global QoL, cognitive function, and social function, although the group had scored relatively poorly for emotional distress and QoL at the initial assessment.</s><s>In contrast, no clinically significant changes in emotional distress and QoL were found between the initial and follow-up assessments in the non-MCP group.</s><s>Although not statistically significant, a trend of increasing distress, based on the MAC-AP and QLQ-C30-EF scores, was observed in the non-MCP group.</s><s>These results suggest that patients with advanced cancer, who experience clinically significant emotional distress and decreasing QoL, need an appropriate psychosocial intervention.</s><s>In addition, the MCP group showed significantly higher scores in the initial assessment of QLQ-PAN26 pain, jaundice.</s><s>Higher anxiety and distress scores in the MCP group may be induced by severe physical symptoms.</s><s>In addition, although not statistically significant, it is possible that MCP was assessed in severe physical symptoms because the time from cancer diagnosis to initial assessment was shorter than non-MCP.</s><s>The important finding is that QLQ-PAN26, an evaluation item related to physical symptoms, did not show any significant improvement in any, while there was improvement in EF score.</s><s>The results suggest that therapeutic effects of MCP may primarily involve relieving psychological symptoms, which can change the cognitive approach process and improve emotional state even if actual physical symptoms are similar.</s></p><p><s>MCP is a psychotherapeutic intervention that helps patients cope with distress by enhancing meaning of life and spiritual well-being.</s><s>So far, few psychological interventions have been developed, with psychological care more often being focused on providing psychoeducational or supportive interventions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>hese interventions have rarely considered meaning of life and spiritual well-being an important issue.</s><s>MCP is based on the writings of Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and holocaust survivor, and he suggested that people desire to find meaning in

<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The result of ANCOVA for assessing MCP effectiveness showed that only MAC-AP was significantly improved in patients after receiving MCP.</s><s>MAC-AP is characterized by constant preoccupation with cancer and feelings of anxiety, fear, and devastation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref></s><s>Previous studies have shown that a higher score on AP domain was associated with both anxiety and depression, and has a negative impact on well-being, irrespective of phase of illness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26</ref></s><s>In this study, we attempted not only to get a meaning of life from different perspectives through MCP, but also to understand the causes of anxiety and to learn how to control anxiety effectively through stress management.</s><s>These attempts seem to have worked together to improve cancer-related anxiety.</s><s>Other variables, except MAC-AP, did not show a significant difference in ANCOVA.</s><s>This may be attributed to the fact that only the patients who reported clinically significant distress in the initial assessment were selected for the MCP group.</s><s>Approximately 66% of the participants completed all sessions of MCP, which is much higher than the completion rate of the grouped format of MCP reported by previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>enerally, MCP is provided in a group format.</s><s>In the present study, however, patients missed or were unable to complete their sessions due to difficulties of scheduling or illness-related problems.</s><s>This suggests the need for a more flexible and personalized therapy for patients with advanced cancer.</s><s>In our study, MCP was provided individually, and in many cases, patients were able to receive MCP after their outpatient visit to the surgery department.</s><s>It is expected that this form of therapy will have positive effects on treatment compliance in clinical practice.</s><s>A previous study on MCP, however, showed that patients who received the individual format of MCP no longer showed improvement 2 months after its completion, whereas patients who received the grouped format showed continued improvement when they were followed up after more than 2 months. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Our study demonstrated the effectiveness of MCP up to 2 months after its completion, and further investigation in a long-term follow-up study may provide a better understanding of the patterns of MCP effectiveness.</s></p><p><s>This study has several limitations.</s><s>Firstly, the subjects were limited to patients with pancreatobiliary cancer, and the results may not be generalizable to all patients with cancer.</s><s>Moreover, the small sample size of the MCP group lowers the statistical power.</s><s>As mentioned above, ANCOVA showed significant therapeutic effect in terms of MAC-AP scores alone, whereas the ttest showed otherwise.</s><s>More statistically significant results may be expected when larger sample sizes of MCP and control groups with clinically significant emotional distress are compared to assess therapeutic effects.</s><s>In addition, although the patients of this study were recruited from three hospitals, the number of patients that the psychologists at each hospital were assigned to was not equal because different numbers of patients were recruited at each hospital.</s><s>The therapist may influence the therapeutic effect and patient satisfaction.</s><s>To minimize the effect related with differences between therapists, we initiated this study after each therapist had had sufficient time to discuss the MCP program during the study preparation step.</s><s>The MCP group was reassessed two months after the completion of the MCP, while the non-MCP group was reassessed two months after the baseline.</s><s>Therefore, there is a difference in the evaluation interval for each group, and these factors may have affected the outcome.</s><s>Lastly, the MCP was only recommended to the patients who showed clinically significant levels of depression, anxiety, and distress in this study, and the results of the current study do not provide evidence for the effectiveness of MCP in patients without clinically significant psychiatric symptoms.</s></p><p><s>Despite these limitations, our study showed that MCP helps patients with advanced cancer regain their sense of meaning in life and may reduce emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and increase QoL.</s><s>Our study is the first to attempt MCP intervention in patients with pancreatobiliary cancer in Korea.</s><s>The
