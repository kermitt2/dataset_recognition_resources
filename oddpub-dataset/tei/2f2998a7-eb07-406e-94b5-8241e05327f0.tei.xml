<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>TACE constitutes a generally well-tolerated procedure.</s><s>The incidence of major complications is described in the literature as 2% to 7% <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and the risk of death is approximately 1%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> We had one death among all the procedures (563), which corresponds to a mortality rate of 0.18%.</s><s>It occurred in a patient who developed hepatic and perihepatic abscesses and sepsis after the procedure.</s><s>Infectious complications are rare after TACE because of antiseptic measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and the incidence of liver abscess is described in literature as 0.26%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s>However, the incidence of post TACE liver abscess is higher among patients with bilio-enteric anastomoses, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> which was the case of this patient.</s></p><p><s>The overall incidence of PES varies in the literature and is described to occur in up to 60% -80%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>In this study we found an incidence of PES of only 6.2%.</s><s>Some studies show that the complication rates (including the incidence of PES) are similar when comparing doxorubicin drug-eluting beads TACE (DEM-TACE) with conventional TACE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref></s><s>A study from Odisio et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref> where they used 70 -150 μm drug-eluting beads, pointed out an incidence of PES of 67.4%, which is also in the described range of 60% -80%.</s><s>However, a study from Padia et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> that compared the safety of small (100 -300 μm) and mediumsize (300 -500 μm) particles, showed that the incidence of postembolization syndrome was lower in the first group and corresponded to 8%.</s><s>In our study, we also used 100 -300 μm beads and this rate compares better with our results.</s><s>On the other hand, there are no specific findings or laboratory values to identify PES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>The diagnosis is made clinically, based on the presence of some symptoms and signs in the post procedural period (abdominal pain, fever, nausea and/ or vomiting) and absence of other significant findings.</s><s>In our study, we included in the PES group only the procedures that were associated with a prolongation of the hospitalization time or need for emergency department visiting and/or rehospitalization in the postprocedural period.</s><s>This is probably the main reason why our PES incidence is much lower than the overall described 60% -80%.</s><s>However, we think that with these criteria we are including only the cases of PES that have significant clinical and economic impact.</s></p><p><s>In our study, we found that a doxorubicin dosage above 75 mg (more than one vial) is a risk factor for the development of PES.</s><s>The maximum dose used was 150 mg (two vials).</s><s>Several previous studies also showed that a higher dose of chemoembolization agents (which also included doxorubicin) is associated with a higher risk of PES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17</ref></s><s>Taking into account that the pathogenesis of PES is multifactorial and related to the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drug itself, which also induces an inflammatory response, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> it is expected that a higher dose of chemotherapeutic drug will be associated with an increased risk of PES.</s><s>The cut-off of one vial that we found may be helpful for decision making in clinical practice, whenever it is possible to avoid a higher dose without compromising the efficacy of the treatment.</s></p><p><s>We also concluded that the size of the largest nodule treated is a risk factor for PES, although we could not find a cut-off.</s><s>At least two previous studies also pointed out this risk factor and established a cut-off of 5 cm, above which the risk of PES increases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Another study by Li et  al. demonstrated that a tumor size &gt; 3 cm was associated with a higher risk of PES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref></s><s>On one hand, a larger tumor size is generally associated with a higher dose used, which we already found is a risk factor for PES development.</s><s>On the other hand, we saw that tumor necrosis and associated inflammatory response are also thought to be involved in PES pathogenesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> and a larger tumor is expected to be associated with a higher volume of necrotized tissue, if the treatment is successful.</s></p><p><s>Our results showed that female gender is related with a higher risk of PES and this association was confirmed in multivariate logistic regression.</s><s>This finding was also pointed out in a previous study by Siriwardana et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Another study by Wang et al 18 also showed that female gender correlates with a higher incidence of postprocedural nausea, particularly in premenopausal women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref></s><s>In that study, they found no statistically significant difference in the incidences of nausea and vomiting between male over 50 years and female patients who have entered menopause, a finding that raised the suspicion that these associations could be due to hormonal causes, namely the estradiol level.</s><s>However, in our study, all women included both in the cases and control groups were postmenopausal, so this explanation is not applicable.</s><s>Another aspect that would be interesting to investigate is the potential influence of body mass index (BMI), which is general lower in female patients.</s><s>It was not possible to investigate this association in the present study since it is a retrospective study and the necessary data (height and weight) was not present in the clinical charts.</s><s>We could also consider the possibility of this association being related with other confounding factors that can differ by gender, like the cause of cirrhosis.</s></p><p><s>In our study, the proportion of patients who had a previous TACE procedure was lower in the group that developed PES, but with no statistical significance.</s><s>A previous study by Leung et al 5 achieved similar results.</s><s>Another study showed no relation between the number of previous TACE procedures and PES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>he embolization of the cystic artery was also pointed out as a possible risk factor for the development of PES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> In our study, this relation was not observed, although there were only three procedures associated with embolization of the cystic artery (two in the PES group and one in the control group).</s></p><p><s>The use of additional embolics (lipiodol and/or PVA particles) was not associated with the risk of PES.</s><s>Some studies showed that lipiodol dose was associated with the risk of PES <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref> and a study by Jun et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> established a dose ≥ 7 ml as a cut-off.</s><s>In our study, both in the PES and control group, the procedures in which injection of lipiodol occurred, the dose was always small (≤ 6 ml) and so it was not expected to increase the risk of PES.</s></p><p><s>Child-Pugh and MELD scores were not associated with the risk of PES.</s><s>A previous study also did not find relation between Child-Pugh score and the development of PES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The presence of ascites was pointed out in a previous study as a potential risk factor for PES. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> In our study we did not find this relation, but it is important to refer that all our cases of ascites were of small/medium volume.</s></p><p><s>The presence of segmental portal vein thrombosis and the age of the patient were not associated with PES.</s><s>These factors were also not related to PES in previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>he main limitation of our study is its retrospective design.</s><s>We had to rely on the information of the clinical charts of the patients.</s><s>For the definition of PES, we applied uniform criteria to every patient to reduce our dependence on the medical registrations (time of hospitalization and emergency department visits/re-hospitalization).</s><s>But if, for example, a patient had resorted to another institution with symptoms of PES in the post-procedural period, we would not have access to that information if the surgeon did not register it in the clinical chart in the usual followup appointment (one/three months after the procedure).</s><s>Furthermore, regarding the laboratory data, we could only analyse the results from the blood tests performed prior to the procedure (that all patients do routinely).</s><s>It was not possible to perform laboratory tests in the post-procedural period and relate them to the development of PES.</s><s>Another limitation of the study is the relative small sample, although our initial group of participants was large, which is directly related to the small number of procedures associated with PES.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 -On the left computed
