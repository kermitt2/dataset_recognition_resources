<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IL-13 regulates Cldn-2 and Tric via different signaling pathways</head><p><s>To elucidate the regulation beyond the decreased Tric expression in UC, we concentrated on IL-13, which is a key cytokine in UC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Treatment with IL-13 increased Cldn-2 as described earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and we show here that it also decreased Tric expression.</s><s>This effect was demonstrated in cell cultures as well as in mice treated with IL-13.</s></p><p><s>After analyzing the influence of blocking antibodies, knockdown of IL13Ra2, inhibitors of reported signaling pathways and mice lacking STAT6, we found that two pathways are involved and that each had distinct effects.</s><s>Based on the established signaling cascades of IL-13 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> we conclude that (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>) (i) Cldn-2 expression and trans-TJ pore pathway flux are upregulated via IL-13 binding to the IL4Ra/ IL13Ra1 complex and the subsequent activation of STAT6, PI3K, and MAPK.</s><s>(ii) Tric is downregulated and trans-TJ leak pathway flux is enhanced via IL-13 binding to IL13Ra2.</s><s>The subsequent signaling involved ERK1/2, JNK, and AP-1.</s></p><p><s>The transcription factor AP-1 may be composed of dimers of proteins belonging to the family of Fos, Jun, or ATF proteins.</s><s>Analysis of the most common AP-1 sub-proteins revealed that in Tric downregulation by IL-13, higher expression levels of c-Fos as well as the phosphorylation status of FRA-1 and c-jun (position S63) are involved as inhibition by U0126 affected these alterations as well as the Tric decrease.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, IL-13 affects both, the bTJ and the tTJ.</s><s>Cldn-2 as size-restrictive channel for small cations and water is a main factor in enhancing the high-capacitive pore-pathway, as by upregulation of Cldn-2 permeability for Na þ increases.</s><s>This can also be retraced by TER decrease, as TER depends on ions.</s><s>The further influence of IL-13 on the tTJ via downregulation of Tric affects the leak pathway as permeability for macromolecular solutes is increased.</s><s>However, as in tight epithelia the occurrence of bicellular conductive channels is low (tight epithelia possess a lower paracellular than transcellular conductance), opening of the tTJ also affects ion permeability.</s></p><p><s>Thus, both effects of IL-13 need to be taken in account when developing new strategies of intervention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demand of new receptor-specific IL-13-based intervention strategies</head><p><s>Our findings indicate that the increased macromolecule passage in UC is at least partly caused by Tric downregulation and that, among all cytokines tested in HT-29/B6 cells, only IL-13 causes Tric downregulation.</s><s>In contrast, Cldn-2 expression can be upregulated by several cytokines involved in IBD.</s><s>The role of Cldn-2 in IBD has been linked to leak flux diarrhea as Cldn-2 increases permeability for small cations as well as for water.</s><s>On the other hand, recent studies on Cldn-2-overexpressing mice suggested that Cldn-2 also may have protective properties, as these mice were protected against dextran sulfate sodiuminduced colitis.</s><s>Besides feasible dilution of the dextran sulfate sodium by enhanced paracellular water flux by Cldn-2, it might be speculated whether the additionally described lower immune activation and increased colonocyte proliferation in these mice were leading to the protection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref></s><s>Increase of Cldn2 and water flux in IBD might in conclusion have two effects, it may contribute to leak-flux diarrhea and by this may serve as a beneficial rinsing of the inflamed mucosa (''enteric tears'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> ).</s><s>IL-13 had been proposed as key player in both UC and asthma, and great hope has been linked to the development of IL-13-focused biologics.</s><s>However, to date, all approaches have failed: (i) Anrukinzumab, an antibody blocking the attachment of IL-13 to IL4Ra by binding to IL-13, showed no significant therapeutic effect in active UC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> which is not surprising on the basis of our present data, since the binding to IL13Ra2 was unaffected.</s><s>(ii) A second antibody, tralokinumab which binds and neutralizes IL-13, induced no clinical improvement in UC but at least led to higher clinical remission rates in a subset of patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref></s><s>(iii) A third antibody, GSK679586, was directed against the IL-13 binding to both receptors, but was only tested in asthma patients so far. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref></s><s>e hypothesize that the earlier attempts to develop biologics targeting IL-13 have failed because they did not differentiate between the two pathways.</s><s>Targeting solely the IL-13 receptor a1 might be less beneficial or even harmful, because blocking the UC-induced Cldn-2 increase hinders the beneficial rinsing of the inflamed mucosa.</s><s>In contrast, targeting the IL-13 receptor a2, however, would block the UC-induced decrease of Tric and by this would restore the barrier against the uptake of inflammatory macromolecules.</s><s>We suggest that inhibiting the IL-13 receptor a2 pathway may be effective in UC, maybe most effective in early stages or in an attempt to achieve remission, when after healing of gross lesions this macromolecule leak is functionally essential.</s><s>Therefore, new approaches differentiating the two receptors are required for successful treatment.</s></p><p><s>Not less importantly, Tric itself might be another potential candidate for intervention, targeting the loss of the macromolecular barrier and at the same time uncontrolled luminal uptake of macromolecular agents, especially in early disease states before gross lesions develop.</s></p></div>
