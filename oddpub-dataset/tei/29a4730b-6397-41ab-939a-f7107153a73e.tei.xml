<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study population</head><p><s>AHA was defined by the presence of a neutralizing FVIII inhibitor $ 0.6 Bethesda units (BU)/mL (lower limit of detection) and a FVIII activity , 50 IU/dL (lower limit of normal).</s><s>Patients were eligible if they had AHA, gave informed consent, and were enrolled #7 days after starting IST.</s><s>Patients developing AHA while on steroids for a concomitant disorder before the occurrence of AHA could be enrolled if IST according to the treatment protocol was initiated #7 days before enrolment.</s><s>We excluded patients with congenital hemophilia A (with or without FVIII inhibitors) and patients planned to be enrolled in studies with investigational drugs.</s></p><p><s>One hundred and fifty-four patients were screened by the study centers between April 2010 and April 2013 (36 months).</s><s>The number of patients per center varied between 1 and 17.</s><s>Twenty-nine patients were not enrolled for various reasons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Of the 125 initial study patients, 5 were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (diagnosis of AHA not confirmed) or had insufficient baseline and follow-up information.</s><s>Two study centers did not follow the GTH treatment protocol, and it was decided in November 2010 to collect their data but to exclude all patients from these centers from analysis (n 5 18).</s><s>The resulting 102 patients were included into the primary and all secondary analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>End points</head><p><s>The primary end point was the time to achieve partial remission (PR), defined as FVIII activity restored to .50</s><s>IU/dL and no active bleeding after stopping any hemostatic drug for .24</s><s>hours.</s><s>Secondary end points were time to complete remission (CR), defined as PR plus negative inhibitor test, prednisolone tapered to ,15 mg/day, and any other IST stopped; overall survival (OS); adverse events (AEs); and causes of death.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment</head><p><s>Consensus statements published at the time of protocol development recommended starting IST with either steroid alone or steroids plus cyclophosphamide  and to add either cyclophosphamide or rituximab once first-line treatment was unsuccessful. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>The GTH AH 01/2010 protocol used here was developed based on that statement.</s><s>Treatment started with prednisolone alone (daily dose 75 mg for patients ,60 kg, 100 mg for 60-100 kg, 150 mg for .100</s><s>kg) in weeks 1 to 3.

Treatment escalation was withheld if a steady increase of FVIII activity was observed during 7 days before the planned escalation, but it had to be started whenever no further improvement was noted during a 7-day period.</s><s>As soon as PR was achieved, cyclophosphamide and rituximab were stopped, if applicable, and prednisolone was tapered over 6 weeks (descending daily doses of 50, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5 mg for 1 week each).</s></p><p><s>If AHA was first diagnosed while on prednisolone .15</s><s>mg/day, patients were immediately escalated to treatment according to week 7 (prednisolone/rituximab).</s><s>If cyclophosphamide was contraindicated, patients started on prednisolone (weeks 1-3) and were escalated in week 4 to prednisolone/rituximab (according to week 7).</s><s>If prednisolone was contraindicated, patients started on rituximab alone from week 1.</s><s>Cyclophosphamide was to be interrupted in case of neutropenia (,1000/mL) or thrombocytopenia (,100/nL).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>Data were collected using standardized case report forms.</s><s>We collected demographic and baseline data (age, gender, conditions, concomitant disorders, World Health Organization performance status [WHO-PS], local laboratory baseline FVIII activity, and Bethesda inhibitor titer) at study entry of each patient.</s><s>FVIII activity was determined by 1-stage or chromogenic substrate assay; inhibitor concentration was measured using the Bethesda assay according to standard procedures at the local laboratory.</s><s>Until CR was achieved, follow-up data were collected weekly, including treatment information (calendar dates of start and stop, dose, frequency and route of administration for any IST, hemostatic drug, and transfusion), laboratory data (FVIII activity and inhibitor concentration), and outcome data (calendar day of PR and CR; number, duration, and severity of bleeds and AEs including serious adverse events [SAEs]; and calendar day and cause of death).</s><s>After achieving CR, data were collected in months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 after achieving CR.</s><s>Individual patient data as entered into the database were provided back to the local study coordinator for source-data verification.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study is the first to establish baseline characteristics as predictors for outcome in AHA.</s><s>We demonstrate that baseline FVIII activity has a strong impact on the time needed to achieve PR and CR.</s><s>A baseline FVIII activity of ,1 IU/dL was also associated with poor survival.</s><s>In contrast, a higher FVIII activity and a lower inhibitor concentration at baseline increased the chance to achieve PR within 21 days while on treatment with steroid alone.</s><s>We found a weak correlation between baseline FVIII activity and inhibitor concentration and, in fact, FVIII activity was a better predictor of outcomes than the Bethesda inhibitor titer.</s><s>This may be due in part to the high variability of inhibitor measurement, in particular with type 2 inhibitors that are often seen in AHA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Nevertheless, inhibitor concentration appeared useful, similar to FVIII activity, to predict early PR within 21 days while on treatment with steroid alone.</s><s>In particular, a low FVIII activity and a high inhibitor concentration at baseline provided a high negative predictive value (.0.9) to exclude early PR.</s><s>This finding may provide a basis to treat those patients with more intensive IST up front, as their probability of obtaining remission with steroids only is very low.</s><s>Clinical management of AHA, in particular IST, has been mainly based on expert opinion and limited information from registries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s> single controlled study has been performed that lacked statistical power to compare the

IST regimens of variable intensity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>The data suggested that lower baseline FVIII activity and higher inhibitor concentration were associated with a longer time to inhibitor eradication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>o our knowledge, this potentially important finding has not changed clinical practice guidelines, possibly because this analysis could not be adjusted for treatment regimen, which may have had an impact on time to remission as well.</s><s>In fact, EACH2 investigators reported that a combination of steroid and cyclophosphamide resulted in faster remission than steroid alone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>A meta-analysis of 249 published cases came to the same conclusion, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> whereas the UK surveillance study did not detect a difference between these regimens. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Of note, the latter study found that combination therapy was used more often in patients with higher inhibitor concentrations, indicating that disease severity may have confounded the effect of treatment.</s><s>A survey among hemophilia centers in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland showed that many factors, including severity of bleeding, the required duration of expensive hemostatic treatments, and inhibitor concentration influence the physician's choice of IST. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> If physicians tailor the intensity of treatment to the perceived severity of disease (including suspected prognostic factors), the analysis of prognostic factors can be seriously confounded, unless it is stratified for treatment.</s><s>We therefore aimed to study prognostic factors in a group of patients treated according to a uniform IST protocol.</s></p><p><s>The GTH-AH 01/2010 treatment protocol was designed in 2008.</s><s>It was influenced by consensus recommendations and data from the UK surveillance study indicating that steroid alone vs steroid plus cyclophosphamide were treatments of similar efficacy and safety.</s><s>We followed a simple escalation strategy, starting with steroid alone (weeks 1-3), adding cyclophosphamide (weeks 4-6) and rituximab (weeks 7-10), as long as PR was not achieved.</s><s>Escalation had to be withheld per protocol if patients showed a continuous increase of FVIII, which turned out to be a feasible strategy.</s><s>Further exceptions were allowed per protocol in the presence of contraindications.</s><s>Importantly, however, no choice of treatment was allowed because of perceived severity of disease, bleeding tendency, laboratory parameters, or other baseline characteristics.</s><s>Enrolment was strictly prospective, and all cases from study sites were excluded if the site did not follow the protocol.</s><s>Outcomes achieved with the GTH protocol were largely similar to other recent studies: CR was achieved by 61% of patients (UK surveillance study 71%, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> French Surveillance des Auto antiCorps au cours de l'Hémophilie Acquise [SACHA] study 61% [reported after 1 year], 10 EACH2 study 72%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> ; mortality was 33% (United Kingdom 43%, SACHA 33%, EACH2 26%); death due to infection occurred in 16% of the whole cohort (United Kingdom 11%, SACHA 12%, EACH2 4%); and death due to bleeding occurred in 2.9% of the whole cohort (United Kingdom 9.1%, SACHA 3.5%, EACH2 4.5%).</s><s>Compared with the historic collection by Green and Lechner, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> who found in 22% their patients death directly or indirectly attributable to the presence the inhibitor, we recognize infection as the major cause of death in AHA today.</s></p><p><s>Our prognostic factor analysis demonstrates a significant effect of baseline FVIII activity on the time to achieve PR or CR.</s><s>Even more relevant for clinical practice, baseline FVIII activity and inhibitor concentration could be used to define a subgroup of patients with better prognosis.</s><s>This group, characterized by a lower inhibitor titer (,20 BU/mL) and a higher baseline FVIII activity ($1 IU/dL), comprised about one-third of patients and was found to have .50%</s><s>chance of achieving PR with steroids alone by day 21.</s><s>Patients not belonging to this group had a ,10% chance of achieving PR early as further supported by ROC analysis.</s><s>Given the risk of prolonged IST exposure, it appears justified to consider more aggressive regimens in the latter patients, eg, by starting a combination of steroids and other immunosuppressants from the beginning.</s><s>This is supported by observations in other disease areas, eg, rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrating that not only intensity but also duration of IST determined the risk of serious infection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref></s><s>TH 01/2010 is the first study to prospectively assess predictors of survival in AHA.</s><s>It was not unexpected that malignancy and poor WHO-PS at baseline were associated with reduced OS.</s><s>More surprisingly, baseline FVIII activity was an independent and strong predictor of OS.</s><s>This was not due to bleeding, as bleeding was not a frequent cause of death and the number or severity of bleeds did not correlate with risk of death (data not shown).</s><s>More likely, a lower FVIII activity may be a surrogate marker for a more robust autoimmune reaction that could be more difficult to treat and require longer IST, thus implying a greater risk of infection.</s><s>In fact, infections were significantly associated with mortality in our study.</s></p><p><s>It should be noted that the prognostic baseline characteristics assessed here would not necessarily have the same impact on patients treated with different regimens.</s><s>Using more intense treatment at baseline for patients with a low FVIII activity could increase the risk of mortality from other causes, eg, in people of advanced age or with comorbidities.</s><s>Therefore, the analysis of prognostic risk factors should be continued in future studies.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our study established clinically useful prognostic factors for remission and survival of AHA.</s><s>However, it also confirmed that current IST regimens often require a very long time to remission and that side effects still cause considerable morbidity and mortality.</s><s>The challenge for future studies will be to develop IST regimens that reduce the burden of side effects, potentially by tailoring their intensity to prognostic baseline characteristics established in the current study.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
