<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Myoglobin facilitated the ANG II-induced vasoconstriction in isolated perfused afferent arterioles of mice but did not influence the NE response.</s><s>Accordingly, ANG II-induced cytosolic calcium transients were increased by myoglobin application in afferent arterioles.</s><s>Myoglobin treatment increased superoxide and reduced NO bioavailability in the vessel wall.</s><s>These myoglobin effects may have particular importance for renal vasoconstriction in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI.</s><s>The finding supports our hypothesis that increased superoxide and lack of NO due to myoglobin treatment are important components in the signaling responsible for the enhanced reactivity of arterioles to ANG II.</s></p><p><s>Manifold mechanisms pave the way of rhabdomyolysisinduced AKI.</s><s>In our in vitro setup, systemic influences can be excluded, and factors such as pH and oxygen pressure are controlled.</s><s>Under these conditions, the acute treatment with myoglobin from the luminal site of the vessel increased the ANG II-induced contraction of the afferent arteriole.</s><s>This may be due to the reduced NO bioavailability because ANG II via   angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) activates not only constrictor but also NO-mediated dilator pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(24)</ref>.</s><s>The finding that myoglobin does not increase the NE response supports this conclusion.</s><s>Interestingly, the luminal diameter slightly increased during the 20-min treatment period with myoglobin, similar to the control group, although the NO-related fluorescence of DAF-FM was reduced under the same conditions by 50%.</s><s>Such rather small effects of NO deficiency on the diameter of mouse afferent arterioles has been described in other studies before, suggesting that in the contractile state these vessels do not depend so much on NO in the absence of vasoconstrictors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26)</ref>.</s><s>The present study underscores this observation.</s><s>However, the latter fails to clarify the diameter difference between the L-NAME-treated and myoglobintreated vessels, which are visible after 20 min treatment.</s><s>We cannot exclude the existence of dilating mechanisms acting during the myoglobin perfusion.</s><s>Notably, ANG II responses of afferent arterioles are more sensitive to NO deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(26)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, L-NAME induced significantly stronger ANG II responses compared with myoglobin.</s><s>Furthermore, there was an additive effect of L-NAME and myoglobin on the ANG II response.</s><s>This additive effect suggests an additional mechanism, probably activated by superoxide, which strengthens the ANG II-induced reaction.</s><s>It also implies that NO deficiency may significantly worsen any myoglobin effect on the renal microvasculature.</s></p><p><s>The absolute basal diameters of the arterioles differed comparing the control, myoglobin, L-NAME, and myoglobin ϩ L-NAME group in the beginning of the experiment.</s><s>Also, after the 20-min period, i.e., before performing the ANG II concentration-response curve, the basal luminal diameter of the myoglobin ϩ L-NAME group was significantly greater compared with the other groups.</s><s>This is mainly due to two vessels of this group showing a diameter of ~15 m.</s><s>However, because body mass of mice was within the limits of 25-30 g and the age was below 6 mo, these vessels were not excluded from the study.</s><s>The relative changes in the diameter in response to ANG II were similar to the other experiments of the same group.</s><s>Therefore, we think that differences in the absolute diameters do not influence the result and conclusion of this study.</s></p><p><s>The mechanisms behind the reduction in the NO bioavailability in myoglobin-perfused arterioles are NO scavenging by myoglobin and a possible chemical interaction with myoglobin derivates such as metmyoglobin <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Our study shows an increased DHE fluorescence during myoglobin treatment that may mainly be due to the generation of superoxide, since tempol was able to prevent this effect.</s><s>Superoxide, which was increased in the wall of afferent arterioles during myoglobin perfusion, scavenges NO <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>It is also well established that the superoxide anion attenuates soluble guanylyl cyclase stimulation by NO, and this may contribute to the reduced NO bioavailability in the present study <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23)</ref>.</s><s>Tempol dilated the vessels during resting conditions compared with the control, and it prevented partly the myoglobin-induced strengthening of the ANG II response.</s><s>This indicates a substantial role of superoxide in the myoglobin action on afferent arterioles.</s><s>The superoxide action includes NO scavenging; however, because treatment with myoglobin ϩ L-NAME induced stronger ANG II responses than the combined treatment of myoglobin, L-NAME, and tempol, additional ways of superoxide action can be assumed.</s></p><p><s>L-NAME and tempol together exerted a similar effect on the ANG II-induced constriction compared with myoglobin ϩ L-NAME ϩ tempol.</s><s>This observation suggests that the increased superoxide and reduced NO bioavailability are the main mechanisms of the myoglobin-induced increase in the ANG II response of afferent arterioles.</s><s>Notably, superoxide produced by NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) may be involved in the contractile response to ANG II in renal vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>ANG II activates NOX2 via AT 1 R in the vasculature, which in turn influences downstream signaling targets such as MAPK and RhoA/Rho kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(22)</ref>.</s><s>These groups of kinases are involved in the calcium-sensitizing pathways of smooth muscle contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>.</s><s>We tested the role of p38 MAPK, a prominent member of this group that is activated by several stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>It was shown previously that the adenosine-induced enhancement of ANG II responses in afferent arterioles involves an increased F914 phosphorylation of p38 MAPK <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Also, reactive oxygen species-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in the development of vascular resistance in the apolipoprotein E-deficient mouse (28).</s><s>However, inhibition of the p38 MAPK by a specific blocker did not influence the effect of myoglobin in present study, suggesting no significant contribution of p38 MAPK in the myoglobin-enhanced ANG II response.</s><s>We used the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB-220025 because it is more specific than SB-203580 and does not inhibit adenosine transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>We cannot exclude that SB-220025 influences other kinases than p38 MAPK.</s><s>It also may influence signaling pathways via p38 MAPK, which are not primarily involved in the modulation of smooth muscle cell contraction but exert effects via modulation of inflammatory and other systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The fura 2 measurements indicate an increased response in the cytosolic calcium concentration to ANG II in myoglobinperfused arterioles.</s><s>Thus, the stronger ANG II response in the myoglobin-perfused arterioles is, at least partly, calcium mediated.</s><s>These fura 2 measurements agree with the finding of a reduced NO bioavailability in the arterioles.</s><s>The fluorescence studies in this study have limitations.</s><s>We could not distinguish between endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells.</s><s>The fluorescence transients originate from both cell types.</s><s>ANG II acts not only via stimulation of AT 1 R and subsequent cytosolic calcium increase in vascular smooth muscle cells but may modulate the endothelial NO synthase activity via AT 1 R or AT 2 R, and cytosolic calcium concentration.</s><s>The volume part of endothelial cells is relatively small compared with vascular smooth muscle cells, which restricts their influence on the measured fluorescence.</s><s>One of the main mechanisms of NOinduced dilatation is decreasing the cytosolic calcium concentration via cGMP-and non-cGMP-dependent signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, reduced NO bioavailability would go along with increased cytosolic calcium, as seen in the present study.</s><s>Also, ANG II and superoxide share pathways of contractile apparatus activation, which may influence cytosolic calcium concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s>It was shown that superoxide also increases the calcium entry through L-type channels activated by membrane depolarization in rat cortical afferent arterioles of rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref>.</s><s>This would fit our observation of increased cytosolic calcium, when vessels were treated with myoglobin.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, myoglobin enhances the contraction of mouse isolated afferent arterioles to ANG II.</s><s>This goes along with increased superoxide concentration in the vessel wall and with reduced NO bioavailability.</s><s>The greater calcium transients to ANG II support the findings of increased reactivity of myoglobin-treated arterioles and reduced NO bioavailability.</s><s>The local effect of myoglobin on afferent arteriolar reactivity may contribute to the reduced renal perfusion in rhabdomyolysisinduced AKI.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
