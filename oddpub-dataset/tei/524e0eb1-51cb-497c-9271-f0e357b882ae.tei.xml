<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Study population and measurement</head><p><s>Adult PWE were recruited at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology, Charite ´University Hospital Berlin, which serves as a tertiary referral center.</s><s>Patients were consecutively enrolled into this study between February 2011 and March 2012.</s><s>Inclusion criteria were age !18 years, definite diagnosis of epilepsy as defined by the International League against Epilepsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and the physical, mental, and language ability to complete the interview adequately.</s><s>Patients under legal guardianship were excluded.</s><s>All patients signed informed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee (EA2/133/10).</s><s>Data considered in this analysis were obtained by standardized selfreport questionnaires.</s><s>Adverse events of AED were assessed by patients' perception (''Have you ever/in the last 3 months experienced side effects of your antiepileptic medication?'').</s><s>Additional clinical data were obtained from medical records of the epilepsy outpatient clinic.</s><s>We collected demographic and clinical information including age at epilepsy onset, age at interview, sex, body mass index (BMI), epilepsy syndrome and etiology, epilepsy duration, seizure frequency (occurrence of all types of seizures in the last 3 months and generalized tonic-clonic seizures more than once/year as dichotomized variables), adverse events, and current AED treatment.</s><s>To take potential psychiatric side effects possibly influencing depressive symptoms and anxiety into account, we performed a subanalysis in patients treated with AED-monotherapy since side effects can hardly be disentangled in polytherapy.</s><s>AED were categorized with respect to potential for psychiatric side effects based on current literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>: AED given in monotherapy with ''potential favorable psychotropic effect'' (e.g.</s><s>mood-stabilizing, anxiolytic) were carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, pregabaline and valproic acid.</s><s>The group of AED-monotherapies with ''potential unfavourable psychotropic effect'' (e.g.</s><s>affective symptoms) comprised phenobarbital, primidone, levetiracetam and topiramate.</s><s>Levels of education were categorized into three groups: Low, medium and high educational level representing up to 9 years, 10 years and 13 years of schooling, respectively.</s><s>Quality of life was assessed by means of the QOLIE-31-P.</s><s>In the present analysis, we focused on the QOL subscales ''seizure worry'' (e.g.</s><s>''How fearful are you of having a seizure during the next month?'')</s><s>and ''medication effects'' (e.g.</s><s>''How worried are you, that medications you are taking will be bad for you if taken for a long time?'').</s><s>To assess general anxiety, we used the anxiety module of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS-A <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, a standardized questionnaire which has shown a high validity in evaluating symptoms of anxiety in patients with chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and also in PWE <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The HADS-A consists of seven questions, each question offering four possible answers, which are scored from 0 to 3 points, generating a total score from 0 to 21 points, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety.</s><s>To assess the severity of depressive symptoms we used the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9, a standardized nine-item scale based on DSM-IV-criteria for diagnosis of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Items are endorsed on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from ''not at all'' to ''nearly every day''.</s><s>The sum score ranges from 0 to 27 points, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The main aim of this study was to assess possible gender differences in anxiety and depression in PWE.</s><s>We have identified three key findings.</s><s>First, men in our population do not exhibit lower levels in anxiety than women, as opposed to the general population.</s><s>On the other hand, the expected gender difference in depression, with higher depression scores in women, is actually also seen in PWE.</s><s>Second, the most important predictors for anxiety and depression are QOL medication effects (worries about AED adverse effects and perceived adverse effects) and QOL seizure worry (worries about possible seizures) and not the actual health status.</s><s>Third, in men QOL medication effects and QOL seizure worry are stronger predictors for anxiety than in women.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Anxiety in men and women with epilepsy</head><p><s>High levels of anxiety in PWE without a gender difference is striking because in the general population men and women show a pronounced and consistent difference in anxiety, with women experiencing higher anxiety levels than men <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Commonly, this gender difference is even more pronounced in patients with other chronic medical conditions such as coronary heart disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>c AED psychotropic = antiepileptic drugs with potential favorable psychotropic effects.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Depressive symptoms in men and women with epilepsy</head><p><s>Our results indicate that women with epilepsy report more depressive symptoms than men, a finding which is also present in the general population (PHQ norm sample N = 2066, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Similar to anxiety, QOL seizure worries were independently predictive of depression in both genders.</s><s>In men, depression was also independently associated to medication effects, in particular to worries about medication effects.</s><s>In both genders, the explanation of variance in depression was not due to sociodemographic factors, but almost exclusively due to epilepsyand medication-related variables.</s><s>In clinical practise, it can be very difficult to define the main reason for psychiatric disorders in PWE, because many factors may have a significant impact.</s><s>However, this study shows some interesting associations, and as most of the detected predictors for depression seem accessible to modification, the findings provide further support for the importance of educational interventions.</s><s>In order to increase quality of life and to prevent suicide, which is still one of the main causes of death in PWE <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, screening for depression and searching for possible causes should become part of the clinical routine.</s><s>This is still not the case as almost 80% of US neurologists do not routinely screen for depressive symptoms in their epilepsy outpatients <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Of course, the association between depression and medication effects is likely to be bidirectional: medication effects and worries about medication effects may enhance depressive symptoms, whichvice versa -may well also reinforce the perception of adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Limitations</head><p><s>There are possible limitations to this study which should be taken into account when interpreting its results.</s><s>First, the PHQ-9 is a brief screening instrument to assess severity of depressive symptoms.</s><s>It does not replace the need to make a formal clinical diagnosis of depression.</s><s>However, given the strong evidence for its high sensitivity and specificity, this instrument seems appropriate for investigating epidemiological questions.</s><s>Another limitation refers to the norm samples for depression and anxiety that are not differentiated by age and education.</s><s>This might influence the comparability.</s><s>However, many studies have shown that the effect of gender in this context is usually greater than the effect of age and education.</s><s>Second, the cross-sectional design does not allow for causal interpretations.</s><s>Further studies are needed to clarify the direction of the influence.</s><s>Third, all patients were recruited at a single center in a specialized outpatient clinic hampering generalizability of our findings.</s><s>It is possible that difficult-to-treat epilepsies are overrepresented and that the study sample reflects a slightly selected, less healthy population.</s><s>Fourth, some basic demographic and epilepsy variables differed between men and women well reflecting the everyday clinical setting.</s><s>However, we carefully controlled for these differences, which allows for reliable interpretation of the current findings.</s><s>Finally, we are well aware that data on favorable and unfavorable neuropsychiatric medication effects are not homogeneous, with new evidence still coming up.</s><s>Nevertheless, we consider the potential influence of AED on neuropsychiatric symptoms a very important issue.</s><s>In spite of some inconsistencies, we therefore included this aspect in patients treated with AED-monotherapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p><s>Men with epilepsy exhibit markedly higher levels of anxiety than healthy male controls eventually equalling those of female epilepsy patients.</s><s>Particularly in men, anxiety and depression are significantly associated with seizure and medication worries.</s><s>Further studies are needed to show whether comprehensive information about antiepileptic drugs and epilepsy itself may improve quality of life and thereby yield a positive impact on anxiety and depression.</s><s>Our results suggest that such interventions should be tailored to the different needs of men and women. of interest to disclose that is related to the content of this work.</s><s>We confirm that we have read the Journal's position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Gender differences in sociodemographic, psychosocial, and epilepsy related variables.</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Domain/variable</cell><cell>Total (N = 302)</cell><cell>Men (N = 141)</cell><cell cols="2">Women (N = 161)</cell><cell>p</cell></row><row><cell>Demographic variables</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Age, mean AE SD</cell><cell>44.5 AE 16.6</cell><cell>49.2 AE 17.3</cell><cell cols="2">40.4 AE 14.9</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Without partner, n (%)</cell><cell>96 (32.5)</cell><cell>48 (34.0)</cell><cell cols="2">50 (31.1)</cell><cell>.580</cell></row><row><cell>Children, n (%)</cell><cell>145 (48.0)</cell><cell>66 (46.8)</cell><cell cols="2">79 (49.1)</cell><cell>.730</cell></row><row><cell>Low educational level, n (%)</cell><cell>22 (7.3)</cell><cell>8 (5.7)</cell><cell cols="2">14 (8.7)</cell><cell>.527</cell></row><row><cell>Medium educational level, n (%)</cell><cell>177 (58.6)</cell><cell>82 (58.2)</cell><cell cols="2">95 (59.0)</cell></row><row><cell>High educational level, n (%)</cell><cell>103 (34.1)</cell><cell>51 (36.2)</cell><cell cols="2">52 (32.3)</cell></row><row><cell>Somatic comorbidity, n (%)</cell><cell>175 (57.9)</cell><cell>90 (63.8)</cell><cell cols="2">85 (52.8)</cell><cell>.062</cell></row><row><cell>Epilepsy related variables</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Age at epilepsy onset (yrs), mean AE SD</cell><cell>24.2 AE 18</cell><cell>28.6 AE 20.8</cell><cell cols="2">20.4 AE 14.2</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Epilepsy duration (yrs), mean AE SD</cell><cell>20.2 AE 16.7</cell><cell>20.4 AE 17.1</cell><cell cols="2">20.1 AE 16.5</cell><cell>.850</cell></row><row><cell>Generalized epilepsy, n (%)</cell><cell>71 (23.5)</cell><cell>16 (11.3)</cell><cell cols="2">55 (34.2)</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Partial epilepsy, n (%)</cell><cell>214 (70.9)</cell><cell>120 (85.1)</cell><cell cols="2">94 (58.4)</cell><cell>&lt;.001</cell></row><row><cell>Unclassified epilepsy syndrome, n (%)</cell><cell>17 (5.6)</cell><cell>5 (3.5)</cell><cell cols="2">12 (7.5)</cell><cell>.210</cell></row><row><cell>Seizures in the last 3 months a , n (%)</cell><cell>166 (55.0)</cell><cell>76 (53.9)</cell><cell cols="2">90 (55.9)</cell><cell>.730</cell></row><row><cell>GTCS more than once/year a , n (%)</cell><cell>87 (31.6)</cell><cell>44 (36.1)</cell><cell cols="2">43 (28.1)</cell><cell>.192</cell></row><row><cell>Seizure worry b , n (%)</cell><cell>141 (47.2)</cell><cell>77 (55.0)</cell><cell cols="2">64 (40.3)</cell><cell>.015</cell></row><row><cell>AED related variables</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Polytherapy, n (%)</cell><cell>123 (40.7)</cell><cell>68 (48.2)</cell><cell cols="2">55 (34.2)</cell><cell>.014</cell></row><row><cell>AED psychotropic c (%)</cell><cell>107 (35.4)</cell><cell>42 (29.8)</cell><cell cols="2">65 (40.4)</cell><cell>.700</cell></row><row><cell>Side effects in the last 3 months, n (%)</cell><cell>121 (40.1)</cell><cell>51 (36.2)</cell><cell cols="2">70 (43.5)</cell><cell>.239</cell></row><row><cell>Medication effects b , n (%)</cell><cell>170 (56.7)</cell><cell>84 (60.0)</cell><cell cols="2">86 (56.8)</cell><cell>.295</cell></row><row><cell>Anxiety and depression</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>PHQ-9 d , mean AE SD</cell><cell>6.7 AE 5.2</cell><cell>5.9 AE 5.2</cell><cell cols="2">7.4 AE 5.0</cell><cell>.009</cell></row><row><cell>HADS-A e , mean AE SD</cell><cell>9.00 AE 2.7</cell><cell>8.9 AE 2.8</cell><cell cols="2">9.1 AE 2.6</cell><cell>.532</cell></row><row><cell>Note.
