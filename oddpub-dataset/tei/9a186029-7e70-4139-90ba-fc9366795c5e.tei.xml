<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Here we show, for the first time to our knowledge, that septum transversum/proepicardium (ST/PE)-derived endothelial cells are required for proper coronary blood vessel morphogenesis.</s><s>We used different mouse transgenic lines to show that the ST/PE contributes to coronary endothelium and that the endocardium is not the only developmental origin of this tissue.</s><s>Our results indicate that ST/PE-derived endothelial cells preferentially incorporate into prospective coronary arteries and capillaries but not veins.</s><s>Deletion of the epicardial and coronary developmental regulator Wilms' tumor suppressor gene from both the ST/PE and embryonic endothelial cells reveals that ST/PE endothelial cells are required for the establishment of coronary arterio-venous connections through the ventricular wall and thus are necessary for the completion of coronary vascularization.</s></p><p><s>confined mainly to the mesenchyme surrounding the liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>; weak X-gal staining also is observed in the myocardium of sinus venosus horns (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>Cre recombinase protein is found only in the sinus venosus myocardium and aortic walls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 A and C</ref>) and is not present in any other cardiac region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 B-D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>G2-Gata4 Lineage Tracing Identifies the ST/PE Contribution to CoE.</s></p><p><s>To trace G2-Gata4 ST/PE cells throughout embryonic development, we crossed the G2-Gata4 Cre line with Rosa26-YFP reporter mice.</s><s>The resulting offspring (hereafter, G2 CreYFP+ ) display permanent YFP expression in the ST/PE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> C and D), epicardium, and epicardial-derived cells (EPDCs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> E and F′).</s><s>E9.5 G2 CreYFP+ ST/PE tissue and some epicardial cells express GATA4 protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>WT1 (Wilms' tumor suppressor-1) protein is ubiquitous in the epicardium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>Some ST/PE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>) and epicardial (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 E, F</ref>, and F′) WT1 + cells are G2 CreYFP− , suggesting that Wt1 expression may occur in epicardial cells that do not belong to the G2-Gata4 population.</s><s>WT1 protein is reduced progressively from E11.5 through E12.5 as G2 CreYFP+ cells migrate from the subepicardium into the myocardial layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F′</ref>).</s><s>At these stages, Wt1 gene expression is confined to the epicardium and early EPDCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</s><s>From E12.5 onwards, numerous ST/PE-derived G2 CreYFP+ intramyocardial cells incorporate into developing coronary blood vessels.</s><s>CD31 + (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 H-J</ref>) and isolectin B4 + (IB4) endothelial cells intermingled with G2 CreYFPcells in a salt-and-pepper pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> I-L and Movie S1), whereas G2 CreYFP+ /α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) + coronary smooth muscle cells (CoSM) formed continuous, large domains of the medial blood vessel wall.</s><s>Many G2 CreYFP+ /IB4 + CoE cells accumulated NOTCH1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) in their nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> K and L).</s></p><p><s>No G2 CreYFP+ cells are found in the sinus venosus endocardium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>), but some G2 CreYFP+ /CD31 + cells are present in the ventricular endocardium, suggesting an early contribution of ST/PE cells to this tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>).</s><s>Chimeric transplantation of quail PE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> G and H) or ST (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1 I-L</ref>) tissue into chick host hearts confirms that ST/PE endothelial cell incorporation in the developing coronary vessels and CoE is a normal event.</s><s>To verify the vascular potential of the ST/PE, Scl/Tal1 and Vegfr2 expression was confirmed in ST/PE cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2A</ref>), and the vasculogenic potential of ST/PE was tested in vivo and in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2 B-F</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Wt1-Driven GFP Expression Is a Bona Fide Marker for Early Epicardium, EPDCs, and Coronary Blood Vessels.</s><s>Because Wt1 is also known to be a marker of ST/PE cells (15, 16), we first studied its expression pattern in Wt1 GFP knockin mouse embryos.</s><s>At E10.5, Wt1 protein and Wt1-driven GFP expression overlap in space and time and are restricted to the primitive epicardium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>), confirming that the Wt1 GFP knockin mouse faithfully recapitulates native Wt1 gene activity.</s><s>At E11.5-E12.5,</s><s>Wt1 expression is detected in epicardial cells and EPDCs, which accumulate at the ventricular, atrio-ventricular, and interventricular subepicardium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 A-C</ref>).</s><s>No CD31 expression is detected in Wt1 GFP+ epicardium or EPDCs before E11.5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>).</s><s>At E12.5, a primary coronary vascular plexus has formed in the ventricles, and GFP expression is identified in a significant proportion of subepicardial and intramyocardial CD31 + cells of the developing coronary vasculature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> D and E-E′′).</s><s>Some Wt1 GFP+ cells display the typical spindle-shaped morphology of migratory mesenchymal cells, with their major axis oriented orthogonally with respect to the epicardial surface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2F</ref>).</s><s>Between E13.5 and 14.5, a few Wt1 GFP+ /CD31 + cells can be identified in the forming intramyocardial blood vessels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2G</ref>) with their number decreasing at perinatal stages (E18.5)</s><s>(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2H</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Wt1 Lineage Cells Incorporate in Coronary Blood Vessels.</s><s>To confirm further the ST/PE contribution to the developing coronary vasculature, we selected a Wt1 Cre mouse line that has been used previously to study PE and coronary development (15, 16).</s></p></div>
