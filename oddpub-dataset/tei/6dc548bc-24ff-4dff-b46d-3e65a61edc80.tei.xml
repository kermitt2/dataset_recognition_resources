<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>The liver is the main organ carrying out the metabolism of many drugs and toxins.</s><s>One important protein involved in phase I of xenobiotic and drug metabolism is cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1).</s><s>It is regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) which, upon stimulation with the environmental toxin 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (TCDD), translocates into the nucleus where it binds to its heterodimerization partner Arnt (AhR nuclear translocator) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</s><s>The so-formed dimer then binds to dioxin responsive elements (DREs) in the promoter region of target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>The AhR pathway induces strong expression of CYP1A and other xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes upon stimulation by ligands/toxins such as TCDD.</s><s>This leads to altered toxicokinetics of endogenous metabolites and foreign compounds whose metabolism is dependent on AhR-regulated genes.</s><s>Other effects of AhR activation include skin toxicity (especially chloracne), tumor promotion and disturbance of developmental processes, at least in laboratory animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Expression of many genes in the liver is restricted to certain regions of a liver lobule, such as the periportal and the pericentral region <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr"

proteins/mRNAs from various members of the CYP family show an expression gradient along the portocentral axis, including the members of the AhR-regulated CYP1A subfamily <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The Wnt/␤-catenin signaling pathway, which shows high activity in the perivenous region, has been identified as one of the major determinants of hepatic zonation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</s><s>In the absence of activating Wnt ligands, the free cytosolic fraction of the key protein in the pathway, ␤-catenin, is constantly phosphorylated by a large protein complex and thus marked for degradation by the proteasome.</s><s>Binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled receptors destabilizes the protein complex which in turn allows ␤-catenin to escape degradation, translocate into the nucleus and initiate target gene transcription via an interaction with T-cell factor (TCF) transcription factors.</s></p><p><s>In mice it has been observed that a deregulation of the Wnt/␤-catenin signaling pathway affects the expression of Cyp1a genes.</s><s>While mice with a hepatocyte-specific knock-out of Ctnnb1, the gene that encodes for ␤-catenin, lose the basal expression of Cyp1a <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, mouse hepatomas and transgenic hepatocytes with activated ␤-catenin show an increased Cyp1a expression even in the absence of TCDD <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>.</s><s>␤-Catenin and AhR activation synergize in the induction of CYP1A1 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>.</s><s>Five functional transcription factor binding sites related to AhR-or ␤catenin-dependent signaling have been identified within the human CYP1A1 promoter: four AhR-binding DREs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> and one site that is bound by ␤-catenin/TCF <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, both pathways can directly regulate the promoter.</s><s>Furthermore, a physical interaction between ␤-catenin and the AhR has been shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30)</ref>.</s><s>Still, the molecular details of the interplay between the transcription factors are still unknown.</s></p><p><s>Previously, there have been various successful attempts to disentangle the interactions of transcription factors with the help of mathematical models, mainly in simpler prokaryotic systems or invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster.</s><s>Thermodynamic models that are based on statistical mechanics were first introduced in the early '80s by Ackers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> and Shea and Ackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref> and further elaborated on by many others <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b47">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(48)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>.</s><s>For example, with the help of thermodynamic modeling, Giorgetti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50)</ref> showed that NF-B uses clustered binding sites non-cooperatively.</s><s>In D. melanogaster, thermodynamic models were used to explain the morphogenic gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52)</ref> and the segmentation of the embryo <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>How does the CYP1A1 promoter integrate the two signals originating from the AhR and Wnt/␤-catenin signaling pathways?</s><s>How does this integration collude with a possible cooperative interaction between various TFs binding to the promoter to regulate a multitude of expression patterns that give rise to hepatic zonation?</s><s>To answer these questions we introduced a library of mutant promoter constructs into a hepatoma cell and observed their activity in response to modulation of the two signaling pathways.</s><s>With the help of thermodynamic models we untangled the cooperative interaction between the TFs and predicted hepatic zonation patterns.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data processing</head><p><s>The raw data from the relative luciferase measurements was preprocessed as described in the following to account for measurement inaccuracies.</s><s>For each promoter configuration the means and standard deviations were calculated from at least three replicates and then normalized to data without TCDD and ␤-catenin inhibitor.</s><s>To avoid underestimates of standard deviations, we used 10 % of the mean as the lowest value for the standard deviations, and used a minimum absolute standard deviation of 0.5 for model calibration.</s><s>A linear correction error model for each promoter construct was used to express standard deviation as a linear function of the mean.</s><s>The resulting standard deviations were then converted into standard deviations of the mean by dividing by the square root of the number of replicates for each promoter construct.</s><s>For details, see supporting text and refer to the supporting Spreadsheet S13 for the data sets.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model implementation</head><p><s>To describe the expression of CYP1A1 we developed a twotier mathematical model.</s><s>Signaling is represented by massaction kinetics, comprising two reversible reactions (TCDD + AhR + Arnt ↔ TCDD/AhR/Arnt, TCDD/AhR/Arnt + ␤-catenin ↔ TF, cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), which we assume to be in thermodynamic equilibrium.</s><s>Additionally, we assumed that the total concentrations of AhR plus Arnt, TCDD and ␤-catenin in the system are constant.</s><s>Since the total concentration of ␤-catenin was not measured, we multiplied the ␤catenin concentration with a parameter describing the activity of ␤-catenin that can be modulated by an inhibitor, leaving the concentration of ␤-catenin free for fitting.</s><s>The statistical mechanics model describes the binding of TFs to binding sites on the promoter.</s><s>Each TFBS as well as a separate binding site for the RNA polymerase (RNAP) is allowed to be either bound or unbound.</s><s>For every mutant promoter construct this leads to a collection of possible binding state arrangements.</s><s>Only those arrangements in which the RNAP is bound to the DNA are assumed to lead to transcription.</s><s>Interaction of two simultaneously bound TFs is characterized by a binding free energy; all bound TFs interact with the bound RNAP through another binding free energy and with the DNA through an association constant.</s><s>The formulation of the model follows the formalism developed by Sherman and Cohen ( <ref type="formula">45</ref>) that leads to one expression for the binding probability of the RNAP for every promoter construct.</s><s>For comparison with experimental data each binding probability is normalized to the basal promoter expression, i.e. when only the RNAP is bound.</s><s>The resulting fold-change in binding probability is assumed to match the observed CYP1A1 expression.</s><s>For a detailed deduction of the model, see supporting text.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequestration is responsible for reduced transcriptional induction.</head><p><s>A counterintuitive aspect of the data is that adding more DREs to the

interacts with the RNAP, therefore transcription is only initiated if the TCDD/AhR/Arnt/␤-catenin TF complex is bound to the first DRE.</s><s>Second, the DREs only interact over short distances, i.e. with the neighboring DRE and the DRE next to its neighbor.</s><s>In the case when there are two DREs present, the second DRE can interact with the first and thus increase transcriptional output.</s><s>Similarly, if three DREs are present both the second and the third DRE can interact with the first DRE and further increase the transcriptional output.</s><s>However, if the construct

activity until TCDD concentrations rise above 10-50 nM and increases at higher doses.</s><s>In contrast, cells with 100 % ␤-catenin activity show strong and saturating expression already at 5 nM TCDD.</s></p><p><s>To compare predicted spatial expression patterns with data, we mapped the model predictions for different TCDD concentrations on hexagonal grids that are similar to liver lobules, and assumed a linear gradient for ␤-catenin from the center to the periphery of each hexagon (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, top).</s><s>This type of gradient was deduced from immunohistochemical images showing zonation of active ␤-catenin in mouse liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>For the TCDD concentration, we assumed that the applied TCDD concentration will distribute evenly over the whole lobule.</s><s>We then performed immunostainings of CYP1A in mouse livers treated with different concentrations of the AhR inducer 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> bottom).</s><s>When comparing these patterns, we saw that without stimulation, the experimental data showed a basal perivenous expression of CYP1A that was not predicted by our model.</s><s>Most probably, the reason for this is that the AhR retains basal activity in the liver due to the presence of low levels of endogenous AhR agonists (e.g.</s><s>comparable to the 5 nM TCDD in our stimulations).</s><s>For 10 mg/kg body weight 3-MC a broadening of the CYP1Aexpressing region around the central veins could be observed while higher concentrations of 3-MC only lead to an increased expression intensity (represented by darker browns).</s><s>This effect could be replicated well with the thermodynamic model.</s></p><p><s>While the thermodynamic model can accurately describe the promoter logic of the promoters in the luciferase assays, it should be noted that the fold-change of the CYP1A1 gene is higher in the promoter of human cell lines (HepG2, CaCo-2, HT116) when compared to luciferase assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the model captures the essence of the promoter logic, but additional factors such as other binding sites or chromatin composition may influence the foldchange.</s><s>It should also be noted that the kinetic details of the interactions in the promoter will determine how large the zone of expression will be and if the zone widens if toxins are present.</s><s>While the described interaction of Wnt/␤-catenin and AhR is sufficient to describe zonation of the CYP1A expression, it is likely that the zonation of other genes is controlled by different and/or additional mechanisms.</s><s>The expression of glutamine synthetase (GS), for example, is restricted to a small pericentral zone which can be explained with an additional regulatory mechanism that silences an 5 -enhancer within the GS gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(69)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we reasoned that interactions between Wnt/␤-catenin and AhR at the signaling level, together with the complex cooperative interactions between the DREs in the human CYP1A1 promoter enable the spatiotemporal expression pattern observed in vivo.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>There is currently a huge discrepancy in the level of detail for the quantitative description of signaling systems and gene regulation for mammalian cells.</s><s>There is for example a large body of literature on kinetic models of kinase signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(70)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, most models of gene regulation in mammalian cells address the behavior and dynamics of larger networks neglecting the regulatory complexity of a promoter, leaving the question open of how the regulatory logic of a promoter is established.</s><s>There have been a few notable exemptions recently that either use more complex input-output functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(71)</ref>, or make use of a thermodynamic description of the promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">64)</ref>.</s><s>An interesting aspect of our model is that it can fully describe the behavior of the promoter by a thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e. purely by binding between the proteins of the signaling pathways with each other and the promoter.</s></p><p><s>During recent years, statistical models have been developed that can be trained on genome-wide data, such as transcription factor binding data, open chromatin, and histone marks to predict gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73)</ref>.</s><s>These models are phenomenological, and it would be interesting to combine these with a thermodynamic description, as it has been done previously for gene expression in D. melanogaster development <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, our work demonstrates that statistical mechanics modeling together with combinatorial reporter libraries can be successfully applied to dissect the molecular details that establish promoter logic.</s><s>This provides insight into how physiological relevant expression patterns are established.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Cross-talk between AhR and Wnt/␤-catenin signaling pathways in zonal expression of CYP1A.</s><s>(A) Hepatic zonation schematic of ␤-catenin activity and CYP1A expression in response to TCDD treatment.</s><s>Area of cells displaying high ␤-catenin activity is thought to remain invariant to presence of TCDD while a larger amount of cells express CYP1A after TCDD exposure.</s><s>(B) Schematic representation of the two signaling pathways that converge on the CYP1A1 promoter.</s><s>TCDD can bind to the AhR and Arnt that is then assumed to recruit free ␤-catenin.</s><s>␤-catenin is activated (dashed arrow) through the binding of Wnt to its surface receptors and forms a TF complex with TCF.</s><s>The CYP1A1 promoter possesses five functional TFBS within 1.2 kbp, four for TCDD/AhR/Arnt (rectangular binding sites C, D, E, F) and one for ␤-catenin/TCF (elliptical binding site T).</s><s>The double-headed and numbered arrows depict the two reactions used in the signaling model.</s><s>The C-and D-DRE are color coded as in subsequent figures.</s><s>(C) ␤-Catenin modulates CYP1A1 expression independently of the ␤-catenin/TCF binding site.</s><s>Relative luciferase activity of a promoter construct in which the ␤-catenin/TCF binding site was inactivated by point-mutation over a series of TCDD concentrations treated with DMSO (gray circles) or 10 M of the ␤-catenin inhibitor iCRT3 (blue triangles).</s><s>(D) The interaction between AhR and ␤-catenin is increased upon TCDD treatment.</s><s>Top: Western analysis of AhR expression in lysates from 55.1c cells.</s><s>Co: solvent control; T: 250 nM TCDD for 1 h; T+i: 250 nM TCDD + 10 M iCRT3.</s><s>Bottom: western analysis of ␤-catenin after immunoprecipitation with an anti-AhR antibody (AhR AB '+').</s><s>The two bands show the wild-type (wt) and exon 3-deleted (mut) versions of ␤-catenin, i.e. the constitutively active ␤-catenin present in the cells.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,100.76,69.47,397.03,285.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
