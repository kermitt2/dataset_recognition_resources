<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Self-Control: Definition and Background</head><p><s>The terms 'self-control' and 'willpower' are often used to describe the same phenomenon.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Baumeister et al. (2007, 351)</ref> defined self-control as the "capacity for altering one's own responses, especially to bring them into line with standards such as ideas, values, morals, and social expectations, and to support the pursuit of long-term goals."</s><s>Often a dual-system perspective is explicitly or implicitly used in order to describe self-control conflicts <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hofmann et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The dual-system approach to self-control describes a "hot" impulsive system that reacts to stimuli in a direct or automatic manner and a "cool" reflective system with higherlevel goal representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Metcalfe and Mischel, 1999)</ref>.</s><s>When these two systems are in conflict, self-control needs to be exerted in order to reach high-level goals.</s></p><p><s>Self-control is an important prerequisite for successfully reaching long-term goals: people try to control themselves in situations involving conflicts between higher-level goals and immediate gratification several times per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hofmann et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Deficits in self-control may also be related to several psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Tangney et al., 2004)</ref>, such as addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bechara, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Buhringer et al., 2008)</ref>, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Schweitzer and Sulzerazaroff, 1995)</ref>, and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Konttinen et al., 2009)</ref>, highlighting the importance of self-control research.</s></p><p><s>Individual Differences in Self-Control -Domain-Generality vs. Domain Specificity</s></p><p><s>In line with the idea of the dual-system approach it has been proposed that self-control is domain-general in the sense that the same resources and mechanisms are involved independent of the specific type of self-control conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baumeister et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> cf.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kana et al., 2013</ref>, for the issue of domain generality of cognitive control).</s><s>This idea is supported by the finding that children who could resist eating one marshmallow in order to get two marshmallows later have been shown to be more successful later on in other life domains in which success requires self-control (e.g., school performance, ability to cope with stressful situations, ability to resist drugs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mischel et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>As a consequence, the strategy for measuring self-control has typically been to select any task that involves a conflict between a momentary impulse and a higher-level goal without taking into account that there may be different impulse categories requiring different control processes.</s></p><p><s>In contrast, other authors argue for domain specificity in selfcontrol.</s><s>On the one hand, this includes studies, which found rather low correlations between and within different types of task categories used for self-control assessment.</s><s>On the other hand, studies that used one task category (e.g., executive tasks) provide evidence for separable domains defined by the content of the impulsive reaction and their neural representation.</s></p><p><s>Concerning low correlations between task categories, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Duckworth and Kern (2011)</ref> found in their meta analysis consistently low correlations between self-control tasks.</s><s>They examined three different kinds of self-control measures: executive function tasks, delay of gratification tasks, and self-or informant-report questionnaires.</s><s>While self-control questionnaires correlated with each other, delay of gratification tasks exhibited very low correlations with other delay of gratification tasks, albeit still higher than correlations with executive tasks.</s><s>Convergent validity between questionnaires and self-control tasks was overall low or even non-existent.</s><s>The authors concluded that "self-control is a coherent but multidimensional construct best assessed using multiple methods" <ref type="bibr">(Duckworth and Kern, 2011, p. 1)</ref>.</s><s>Further support for this idea comes from <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Reynolds et al. (2006)</ref>, who observed low correlations between questionnaires and executive tasks of impulsivity.</s><s>Impulsivity shows a negative correlation with self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ludwig et al., 2013)</ref> and can therefore be seen as a counterpart.</s></p><p><s>Although self-report measures of self-control have been shown to have high external validity as they correlate with life achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Tangney et al., 2004)</ref>, the use of self-report measures for studying individual differences might have some disadvantages.</s><s>One reason is that self-control is a socially desirable personality characteristic and thus self-report measures of self-control might be particularly prone to social desirability effects, lack of insight, and room for interpretation of item text <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Johnson, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Furnham, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Back and Egloff, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, experimental tasks assessing different components of self-control are at least equally important for the evaluation of individual differences in self-control and the degree of domainspecificity.</s></p><p><s>With respect to findings regarding domain specificity within one task category, <ref type="bibr">Tsukayama and Duckworth (2010)</ref> provided evidence in the self-report category for the idea that people's selfcontrol success depends on the kind of impulses that need to be controlled, and that individuals react differently depending on their susceptibility to specific impulse domains (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Tsukayama et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we propose that at least three different kinds of impulses should be considered: appetitive, tempting impulses triggering an approach reaction, aversive impulses triggering an avoidance reaction, and neutral stimuli that introduce a cognitive conflict.</s></p><p><s>The distinction between appetitive and aversive motivational stimuli has already been made in the influential theory on motivational personality structure proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gray (1970)</ref>.</s><s>The theory posits two basic motivational systems: the behavioral activation system, which is responsible for facilitating behavior and generating positive affect, and the behavioral inhibition system, which is responsible for inhibiting behavior and generating negative affect.</s><s>According to this framework, individual differences in the sensitivity to reward or potential negative outcomes can be explained by differences in these two systems.</s><s>Factor analysis of the Behavioral Inhibition System and Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Carver and White (1994)</ref> revealed that the behavioral inhibition and the behavioral activation system indeed form two independent motivational forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jorm et al., 1998)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Further evidence for distinct mechanisms for control over temptations and control over aversions comes from several neuroscientific studies using experimental self-control paradigms.</s><s>These suggest that control over temptations mainly involves a regulation of striatal reward regions by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), whereas control over emotions (with most studies focusing on negative emotions), involves a down-regulation of the amygdala by the PFC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Heatherton and Wagner, 2011)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mak et al. (2009)</ref> compared emotion regulation of positive and negative emotions.</s><s>In addition to overlapping regions they observed that regulation of positive emotion was uniquely associated with activity in dorsolateral frontal regions and that regulation of negative emotions was uniquely associated with activity in regions in the left orbitofrontal gyrus, the left anterior cingulate gyrus, and the left superior frontal gyrus.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Erk et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In our study we put self-control to the test by using aversive, tempting, and neutral pictures in an eye gaze task.</s><s>We show robust behavioral effects of aversion, temptation, and neutral distraction reflected in higher error rates and RTs as compared to control conditions.</s><s>Gaze pattern analysis reveals higher gaze distance from the target location during presentation of erotic pictures as compared to neutral pictures (temptation), and for neutral pictures compared to the no-distractor condition (neutral distraction).</s><s>Additionally, there was more looking around during aversion, temptation, and neutral distraction, reflected in a higher standard deviation of the gaze distance to the target.</s><s>The eyetracking data thus indicate that the three distractor types indeed led to behavioral effects and not merely to arousal reactions.</s><s>The total self-control task score obtained from the task (reflecting the ability to resist any of the three distractions) correlated with self-reported self-control.</s><s>This indicates that our task measures a construct that is overlapping with selfreport measures.</s><s>Importantly, performance in the three selfcontrol conditions did not correlate with each other, suggesting high individual differences in the effect of different emotions on information processing.</s><s>This suggests that resisting pleasant temptations, enduring aversion, and ignoring neutral distractions are central and independent aspects of self-control.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Eye Gaze Task as a Measure of Self-Control</head><p><s>Our data indicate that our task can indeed measure individual differences in self-control, and that it might be better suited for this than conventional measures.</s><s>The score obtained from our task correlated significantly with self-reported self-control.</s><s>In contrast, neither the anagram task, nor the delay of gratification task, nor the Stroop task correlated with self-report in this study.</s><s>This is in line with a meta-analysis performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Duckworth and Kern (2011)</ref>.</s><s>They showed that many commonly used cognitive self-control tasks do not correlate with self-reported self-control or correlate only weakly.</s><s>The reason for this absence of correlations might be that conventional tasks only capture a fraction of self-control <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Duckworth and Kern, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, the advantage of our task is that we focus on attentional control assumed to be an important component of self-control and that provide a measure of various components of attentional control within one task: enduring aversive distractors, resisting tempting distractors, and ignoring neutral distractors.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, correlation of the task components (aversion, temptation, and neutral distraction) with the questionnaire score revealed that temptation by itself is correlated with selfreported self-control (r = 0.19), whereas aversion and neutral distraction are not.</s><s>This might indicate that the questionnaires used in this study mostly assess individual differences in resisting temptations, but do not measure individual differences in standing aversions or ignoring neutral distractions.</s><s>This further highlights the need for investigating different impulse types more closely, also on a questionnaire level.</s></p><p><s>Another advantage of our paradigm is that the impulse categories can easily be extended or exchanged depending on the impulse category of interest.</s><s>This can be particularly beneficial when the aim is to study patient groups whose self-control changes in reaction to particular impulse categories, for instance in addiction or eating disorders.</s><s>For example, it has been shown that addiction might lead to an increased capture of attention and automatic approach reactions regarding the addictive substance <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Field et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Friese et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Wiers et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, to study addiction, our task could be used with pictures of the addictive substance as tempting distractors.</s></p><p><s>Despite these promising findings, our task should be further validated as a measure of self-control.</s><s>One reason is that the correlation with self-report does not substantially exceed the correlations reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Duckworth and Kern (2011)</ref> and does not survive Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison.</s><s>Furthermore, a prediction of real life self-control on the basis of task results could be seen as more convincing evidence for construct validity than a correlation with self-report.</s><s>The reason is that questionnaires, although having many advantages such as high internal consistency and reliability <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Carver and White, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tangney et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Diehl et al., 2006)</ref>, still rely on subjective judgment of one's own personality.</s><s>This can be problematic, because correlations with external measures such as school performance may be spurious if the participants judge their own self-control based on their school success.</s><s>The reason is that school success might not be solely related to self-control, but is profoundly influenced by other variables such as intelligence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Spinath et al., 2010)</ref>, memory skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aronen et al., 2005)</ref>, socioeconomic status (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">White, 1982)</ref> or self-efficacy believe <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Zajacova et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>If participants judge themselves based on their school success, but school success is profoundly influenced by other factors, a positive correlation with self-report might not be meaningful for validation of the questionnaires.</s></p><p><s>Further validation in addition to questionnaires is therefore necessary.</s><s>This could be accomplished by investigating participants that face a particular self-control challenge (e.g., dieters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hare et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The task design allows exchanging current stimulus material with pictures that may challenge self-control for that particular group (e.g., in the case of dieters, snack pictures).</s><s>Another possibility for validation may be the use of experience sampling.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hofmann et al. (2012)</ref> used a beeper that samples the presence of self-control problems, the kind of problem and the executed behavior (controlled vs. not controlled) several times per day.</s><s>On average, participants reported a self-control conflict every second time they were beeped.</s><s>A correlation with these kinds of real-world self-control measures would be very convincing.</s></p><p><s>One could argue that a limitation of our task is that it refers to a relatively short time scale, as the reward for successful selfcontrol is obtained already 2 weeks after testing.</s><s>Moreover, the actual duration of active goal pursuit (i.e., the task itself) was only about 25 min.</s><s>This relatively short time frame may also result in stronger effects of state factors that may influence self-control (e.g., blood glucose, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baumeister et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, some (but certainly not all) real-life situations require the exertion of self-control over months or years (e.g., graduating, keeping a life-long healthy diet) and it was suggested that this long-term grit might be an even more essential key to life-success than relatively short-term self-control ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Duckworth et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s>Since some questionnaire items and temporal discounting items of conventional measures involve such potential long-term goals, this is one advantage of questionnaires and temporal discounting over our self-control task.</s><s>However, there are also many real-life self-control situations in which the goal can be reached relatively soon, such as resisting eating the pralines that you bought as a gift or cleaning the toilet.</s><s>Additionally, long-term goal pursuit can be decomposed into several smaller self-control situations.</s><s>For example, graduating might be a long-term goal, but writing an essay might take just a few hours and can serve the relatively short-term sub-goal to pass one particular class.</s><s>Therefore, we think that our task captures a wide range of everyday self-control problems.</s></p><p><s>A potential factor that might have resulted in a decrease of correlation coefficients in our study is the relatively homogenous group with all participants being university students or former students.</s><s>The advantage of this homogeneous sample is a reduction of confounding factors.</s><s>However, a more heterogeneous sample may result in higher variance of self-control scores and thereby a higher probability of detecting correlations.</s></p><p><s>The total task score of our task exhibited reliability similar to the reliability of the Stroop effect (our Task: r = 0.46, Stroop effect: r = 0.41) and similar to the reliability reported for Stroop in the literature (r = 0.46, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Strauss et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s>For emotional Stroop even lower reliabilities have been reported in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Strauss et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dresler et al., 2012)</ref> indicating that our task's internal coherence is comparable to commonly used tasks.</s><s>Additionally, single condition reliabilities reveal a much higher reliability (r between 0.75 and 0.90), indicating that reliabilities are lower when using difference scores than when using single task scores.</s><s>It has to be kept in mind that in single score reliability estimates, confounding factors may boost reliability-measures because general response tendencies such as fast reacting or extreme responding that do not relate to the trait of interest can be consistently high or low in particular participants leading to exaggerated correlations in split-half estimates without increasing reliability for measuring the trait of interest.</s></p><p><s>The generalizability to populations of a different moral background or a homosexual population should be further investigated, as the current study does not allow us to draw any conclusions in that direction.</s><s>See Appendix H for gender comparison (no significant difference for error rates, RTs and gaze distance, only for standard deviation of the gaze distance).</s><s>Furthermore it should be noted that, although we matched pictures on brightness and complexity and the compared categories do not differ significantly on these dimensions, stimuli could be matched even more precisely regarding these and other dimension such as color, line properties and number of people in the image in future studies, as low level image properties have been shown to guide attention and might explain why participants were more distracted by erotic and disgusting pictures than their respective control stimuli.</s></p></div>
