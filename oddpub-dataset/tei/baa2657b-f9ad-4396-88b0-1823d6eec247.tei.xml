<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and participants</head><p><s>The UK Biobank study is a prospective cohort of &gt;500,000 people aged 40-69 y, who were recruited in 2006-2010 across the United Kingdom <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>The scientific rationale and design of the UK Biobank study has been described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>In brief, persons who lived within reasonable traveling distance (∼25 km) of 1 of the 22 assessment centers across England, Wales, and Scotland were identified from National Health Service registers and invited to participate in the study.</s><s>Permission for access to patient records for recruitment was approved by the Patient Information Advisory Group (subsequently replaced by the National Information Governance Board for Health and Social Care) in England and Wales and the Community Health Index Advisory Group in Scotland.</s><s>Overall, ∼5.5% of the invitees attended a baseline visit <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> during which they gave informed consent to participate in the UK Biobank using a signature capture device and completed a touch-screen questionnaire that asked about sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle exposures (smoking, diet and alcohol intake, and physical activity), and general health and medical history.</s><s>For this study, we excluded participants who reported that they had changed their diet in the past 5 y due to illness or who did not answer this question (n = 57,907).</s><s>All of the participants also attended a computer-assisted personal interview and had physical measurements taken.</s><s>In addition to the touch-screen questionnaire, additional dietary information was collected with the use of a Web-based 24-h dietary assessment tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, which was administered ≤5 times in a large subsample of participants (∼210,000).</s><s>A participant flow chart of this study is included as Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s><s>This observational study was registered at http://www.isrctn.com/</s><s>as ISRCTN10125697.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ethnicity classification</head><p><s>On the touch-screen questionnaire, participants were asked to select their ethnicity from options of "White," "Mixed," "Asian or Asian British," "Black or Black British," "Chinese," "Other ethnic group," "Do not know," or "Prefer not to answer."</s><s>Participants were included for analyses if they identified as "white" or as "Asian or Asian British" and subsequently as "Indian."</s><s>The white population was included because it made up the majority of the UK Biobank population (∼94%), and the British Indian population was included due to the large proportion of vegetarians in this population group (24.6% compared with 1.7% in the overall cohort).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diet group classification</head><p><s>For classification of diet groups, relevant dietary information from the touch-screen questionnaire was used.</s><s>Participants were asked their frequency of consumption of processed meat, beef, lamb or mutton, pork, chicken, turkey or other poultry, oily fish, or other types of fish, in 6 categories of frequency ranging from "Never" to "Once or more daily."</s><s>Participants were also asked whether they never ate eggs or foods containing eggs or dairy products.</s></p><p><s>On the basis of these questions, 6 diet groups (regular meat eaters, low meat eaters, poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans) were defined for the white population.</s><s>To rank the participants by weekly red and processed-meat consumption based on the touch-screen, we summed the frequencies for processed meat, beef, pork, and lamb or mutton by using the following coding: "Never" = 0, "Less than once a week" = 0.5, "Once a week" = 1, "2-4 times a week" = 3, "5-6 times a week" = 5.5, and "Once or more daily" = 7. Regular meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red (beef, lamb or mutton, or pork) or processed meat &gt;3 times/wk, whereas low meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating red or processed meat ≤3 times/wk, regardless of what else they ate.</s><s>Poultry eaters were defined as participants who reported never consuming any red or processed meat but who did eat poultry.</s><s>Fish eaters were participants who reported that they never consumed any red meat, processed meat, or poultry but who ate oily or nonoily fish.</s><s>Vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they never consumed any meat or fish, and vegans were participants who reported that they never consumed any meat, fish, eggs or foods containing eggs, or dairy products.</s><s>A total of 2630 white participants who did not answer the relevant questions to be classified into a diet group were excluded from our analyses.</s><s>For the British Indian population, 2 diet groups (meat eaters and vegetarians) were defined due to the smaller numbers in this population group.</s><s>Meat eaters were defined as participants who reported eating any red meat, processed meat, or poultry; and vegetarians were defined as participants who reported that they did not eat any meat or fish but did eat eggs, dairy products, or both.</s><s>A total of 278 British Indian participants were excluded because they did not answer the relevant questions, or because they were fish eaters or vegans.</s><s>Separately, information collected with the use of the Web-based 24-h dietary assessment tool was used to estimate food and nutrient intakes in each diet group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anthropometric and physiologic measures</head><p><s>Anthropometric and physiologic measures were collected on all participants during the baseline visit by trained staff following a standardized protocol.</s><s>At the physical measures station, participants were asked to remove their socks and shoes.</s><s>Height was measured with the use of the Seca 202 height measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany).</s><s>Waist (at the natural indent) and hip (widest point) circumferences were measured over light clothes with the use of the Seca-200 tape measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany).</s><s>Weight and bioimpedance were measured by using the Tanita BC418ma bioimpedance device (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), from which percentages of body fat and lean mass were estimated.</s><s>BMI was calculated as weight (kilograms)/height (meters) squared.</s><s>Calcaneal bone density was taken on the left heel with the use of a Norland McCue Contact Ultrasound Bone Analyzer (Norland, Trumbull, Connecticut, USA), with participants sitting upright; and a heel BMD t-score was calculated on the basis of the measured BMD values.</s><s>Hand-grip strength for each hand was taken by using the Jamar Hydraulic hand dynamometer (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, Indiana, USA), and we considered both the higher grip-strength value of either hand and average grip strength of the 2 hands for our analyses.</s><s>Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate were taken with the use of the Omron HEM-7015IT digital blood pressure monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) after participants have been seated for ≥5 min, and the averages of 2 measurements, taken ≥1 min apart, were used for analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>Summary baseline characteristics of the cohort were tabulated by 6 diet groups in white women and men and by 2 diet groups in British Indian women and men.</s><s>With the use of linear regression, we estimated the age-adjusted (5-y age groups from &lt;45, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, and ≥65 y) means of the anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in each diet group.</s><s>The characteristics studied were height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, body fat percentage, lean mass, heel BMD (as original values and as a t-score), grip strength (as original values and as per kilogram of lean mass), SBP, DBP, and pulse rate, all modeled continuously.</s><s>Subsequently, we additionally adjusted for body weight (as 2.5-kg categories) in the analyses for heel BMD t-score; height (as 2.5-cm categories), lean mass (as 2.5-kg categories), and physical activity (as 5-unit categories in excess metabolic equivalent-hours per week) in the analyses for grip strength; and body fat percentage (as 2.5% categories) in the analyses for SBP, DBP, and pulse rate.</s><s>For all covariates, missing values were coded as a missing category in the adjustment.</s><s>For each baseline characteristic and each association, post hoc pairwise comparisons based on linear regression models were used to test for significant differences between the diet groups in both white and British Indian populations, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons in the white population.</s><s>All statistical analyses were performed with the use of Stata release 14.1 (Stata-Corp, College Station, Texas, USA), and 2-sided P values &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>The strength of this study is that it included a large sample size of close to 500,000 white and 5000 British Indian participants in the United Kingdom and reported on a range of anthropometric indexes and physiologic characteristics that were objectively measured following standard protocols, thereby minimizing the chance of reporting bias.</s><s>In the white population, categorization of diet was performed in 6 groups, which allowed detailed analyses of characteristics in persons across a range of dietary habits.</s><s>Despite the large overall sample size, the numbers of white vegans and British Indian vegetarians were relatively small, and therefore the possibility of false-negative findings cannot be ruled out.</s><s>Because diet group categorization was based on data collected at 1 time point, and did not take into account the length of time the participants have been in any particular diet group, misclassification bias is possible, although reported long-term abstinence from meat in this cohort was high (92% of non-meat eaters overall with &gt;5 y self-reported adherence to not eating meat).</s><s>Measurement error related to the outcomes was also possible, and little is known of the validity of bioimpedance measures of extremely underweight (BMI &lt;14) or obese (BMI ≥36) participants (5% of total cohort) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>.</s><s>As with all observational studies, some degree of self-selection bias may be present <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and there was no information to indicate whether vegetarians might be more likely to respond.</s><s>Because the analyses were based on diets of participants in one country, the results may not be generalizable to other populations or cultures, as indicated by differences between white British and British Indian vegetarians in our study.</s><s>Because the study is cross-sectional, it was not possible to determine causality, and residual confounding by other dietary or nondietary factors may be present.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In this large-population cohort in the United Kingdom, white women and men who were poultry eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, or vegans generally had lower adiposity, BMD, grip strength, blood pressure, and pulse rate than did white women and men who were regular meat eaters.</s><s>However, there were fewer differences in anthropometric and physiologic characteristics in British Indian meat eaters and vegetarians, perhaps due to the greater similarities between the 2 diets in this population.</s><s>Because the characteristics included in this study are known risk factors of long-term disease risk, the observed differences in these characteristics between diet groups may be important in determining long-term
