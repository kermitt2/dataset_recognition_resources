cardiomyocytes.</s><s>First, no interstitial fibrosis was observed in MuRF2 and MuRF3 DKO mice, which often accompanies pathological cardiac remodelling and leads to a decrease in systolic and diastolic function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref></s><s>Second, beta/slow myosin expression was increased in DKO hearts.</s><s>Normally, ventricular myocardium of rodents is mainly composed of alphaMhc/Myh6, accounting for more than 90% of all myosins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>ATPase activity of alphaMhc/Myh6 is higher compared with beta/slow myosin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> which allows greater economy in sarcomeric force generation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref></s><s>This leads to a higher contractile velocity of hearts expressing alphaMhc/Myh6 compared with hearts expressing beta/slow myosin.</s><s>Accordingly, a decrease in systolic cardiac function was reported for transgenic mice overexpressing beta/slow myosin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s>Therefore, increased beta/slow myosin expression might have contributed to the reduced systolic and diastolic function of DKO cardiomyocytes and hearts.</s><s>However, it is unknown why beta/slow myosin expression was increased in DKO hearts.</s><s>Of note, MuRF1 and MuRF2 were shown to regulate myozenin-1 and myozenin-2, 11 inhibitors of the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref></s><s>A downregulation of myozenin-1 and myozenin-2 was reported for MuRF1 and MuRF2 DKO mice possibly activating the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>Activation of calcineurin could account for increased beta/slow myosin expression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref></s><s>Because calcineurin dephosphorylates calcium channels and phospholamban leading to a reduction in intracellular calcium and calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, its activation could also be responsible for the reduction in systolic and diastolic calcium transients in cardiomyocytes of DKO mice.</s><s>This could also explain why MuRF2 and MuRF3 DKO hearts and cardiomyocytes did not respond differently when exposed to isoproterenol compared with controls.</s><s>Normally, isoproterenol mediates phosphorylation of the L-type calcium channel and phospholamban in a protein kinase-A dependent manner leading to increased calcium currents and calcium load of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</s><s>However, activation of calcineurin opposes the effects of protein kinase-A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref></s><s>Although it is tempting to speculate that MuRF2 and MuRF3 are involved in regulation of calcineurin signalling, this hypothesis needs to be proven.</s><s>In summary, our data show that MuRF2 and MuRF3 regulate systolic and diastolic cardiac function at the level of cardiomyocytes.</s></p><p><s>Finally, our proteomic data support a role of MuRF2 and MuRF3 in muscle function and sarcomeric organization.</s><s>They also provide evidence that proteolytic pathways are activated to possibly compensate for the loss of both E3 ligases.</s><s>However, the phenotype of DKO mice argues for unique non-replaceable functions of MuRF2 and MuRF3 in muscle proteolysis.</s><s>We identified MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 to be elevated in skeletal muscle and hearts of DKO mice.</s><s>In addition, proteins involved in mitochondrial function and energy supply were reduced in DKO mice, which could account for reduced muscle function in these mice.</s><s>Because decreased cardiac function is not explained by protein aggregates in DKO mice, these findings are particularly important.</s><s>Recently, we reported that cardiomyocytes of MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 DKO mice showed enhanced contractility and accelerated relaxation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>Therefore, we assume that an increase in MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 in DKO hearts leads to an opposing phenotype.</s><s>Because we also observed improved force parameters in MAPKAPK2/3 DKO soleus muscles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> increased MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 protein levels in MuRF2 and MuRF3 DKO skeletal muscle might account for decreased muscle performance.</s><s>Similarly, because of the observed positive effect of MAPKAPK2/3-deficiency on the oxidative energy metabolism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> the increase of MAPKAPK2/3 protein levels in MuRF2 and MuRF3 DKO mice might, at least in part, account for reduced mitochondrial function and energy supply in DKO skeletal muscle.</s><s>However, it remains to be elucidated how the absence of MuRF2 and MuRF3 leads to an increase in MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 because we did not observe changes in MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 gene expression and could not detect physical interaction between MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 with MuRF2 and MuRF3 in co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments.</s><s>Although physical interaction between MAPKAPK2/3 and their substrates are often difficult to detect, the increase in MAPKAPK2/3 protein amounts could also be caused indirectly because of altered p38 MAPK-MAPKAPK2/3 signalling in MuRF2 and MuRF3 DKO mice.</s><s>For example, because activated MAPKAPK2/3 shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, altered p38 MAPK-MAPKAPK2/3 signalling in DKO muscle might influence the duration time of MAPKAPK2/3 in one of the two cellular compartments and thereby affect MAPKAPK2/3 protein stabilities.</s><s>Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of increased MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3 contents in DKO muscle.</s></p><p><s>The p38 MAPK-MAPKAPK2/3 cascade not only regulates gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> but also causes post-translational modifications leading to altered protein folding and degradation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>For example, activated p38 MAPK was shown to interact with and phosphorylate E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Siah2 and MIB1, resulting in increased ligase activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref></s><s>In addition, MAPKAPK2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hdm2/Mdm2 44 resulting in increased E3 ligase activity and protein degradation.</s><s>Although it is tempting to speculate that such a relationship exists for MAPKAPK2/3, MuRF2, and MuRF3, a direct association between these proteins needs to be proven.</s><s>It would also be interesting to investigate if the observed phenotype in the skeletal muscle and heart of MuRF2 and MuRF3 DKO mice is directly associated with increased MAPKAPK2/3 protein levels, and could be abolished in compound MAPKAPK2/3 and MuRF2/3 quadruple KO mice.</s></p><p><s>We conclude that MuRF2 and MuRF3 are concomitantly involved in the regulation of structure and performance of the skeletal muscle and the heart.</s><s>MuRF2 and MuRF3 play a role in fibre type specification of slow/type I fibres in extensor digitorum longus and soleus.</s><s>Additionally, MuRF2 and MuRF3 affected mitochondrial function and energy supply in striated muscle.</s><s>Accordingly, absence of MuRF2 and MuRF3 leads to a myopathic phenotype of the skeletal muscle and the heart.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 An
