<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>To the authors knowledge, the present study represents the first attempt to simulate wave propagation in multiple muscles simultaneously, and the first to utilise FEA to investigate the variability of MRE measurements in the muscles of the human leg.</s><s>The elastograms created from the datasets in this study bear strong resemblance to those obtained in vivo, notably the artefacts associated with aliasing at the boundaries in the φ elastograms and the definition of individual muscles in the |G * | elastograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s>Importantly, definition remained good at noise levels below 5%; estimations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> demonstrated that noise for in vivo MRE of the leg was in the region of 2%.</s><s>The present study therefore acts as further validation of the robustness of ESP to noise at levels typically seen in vivo.</s></p><p><s>A previous study undertaken by this group demonstrated the dependence of MRE measurements upon the geometry of the structure under investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>This has potentially significant implications upon studies that are attempting to compare measurements from multiple individuals, since there is often a large degree of variability in the shape and size of anatomical structures.</s><s>Variability of measurements was dependent upon the muscle investigate and the level of noise applied.</s><s>The most reproducible measurements of individual muscles for |G * | typically came from muscles in the medial and hamstring muscle groups, whilst conversely, the least variable measurements tended to be made in the quadriceps muscles.</s><s>These results were reflected in the coefficient of variation values for the overall muscle groups.</s><s>In the quadriceps group, the vastus medialis obtained the highest coefficient of variation.</s><s>In several of the |G * | elastograms (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>), there appeared to be a bright artefact within this muscle that potentially caused the higher variability seen.</s><s>Further work is required to identify the source of this artefact to assess whether it is likely to be present in vivo.</s><s>Variability of φ measurements was greatly reduced in the individual muscles in comparison to |G * |.</s><s>The presence of artefacts was much more prevalent in the elastograms (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>), particularly around the boundaries between muscles, and in superficial regions.</s><s>Averaging φ values over muscle groups was a much more effective way of achieving reproducible measurements, however, the ratio of the measured values from one group to another was significantly different than expected.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T</head><p><s>This suggested that the influence of artefacts was more consistent over the larger groups than in the individual muscles.</s></p><p><s>There did not appear to be a relationship between the coefficients of variation for |G * | and φ, suggesting that measurements of these two properties are influenced by different factors.</s><s>In this regard it should be noted that noise typically had a limited, but different influence on the coefficient of variation of |G * | and φ measurements (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</s><s>Whilst it typically caused increased variability across the measurements of |G * |, it tended to decrease the variability of measurements of φ.</s><s>Inspection of the elastograms showed that in both cases, noise tended to increase the size and number of artefacts producing a less smooth elastogram, and resulting in poorer definition of individual muscles (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>As previously discussed, the coefficient of variation for φ measurements was strongly influenced by the presence of artefacts, even at zero or low levels of noise, whilst for |G * | artefacts were not as prevalent, and therefore did not have as great an influence on variability.</s><s>Inspection of the φ elastograms demonstrated that at high noise levels some muscles (such as the gracilis), were almost totally dominated by artefact.</s><s>For φ, values can only vary from 0 to 2π, with artefacts typically represented by high values.</s><s>It is therefore likely that whilst measurements were increasingly inaccurate at high noise levels, the influence of the artefact became more consistent across the set of geometries, and the variability decreased as a result.</s></p><p><s>The lack of positive correlation between expected and measured rankings for φ prompts caution in its mapping, implying that measured values from different muscles within the same individual are not directly comparable to one another.</s><s>This point is further emphasised by the lack of agreement between the measured and expected values (figure 6 a-b), with large overestimations in several of the muscles.</s><s>In contrast, the data suggests that mapping using |G * | has far greater validity.</s><s>Measurements of the individual muscles were relatively accurate, whilst there was a strong positive correlation between the measured and expected rankings.</s><s>In this respect, the influence of artefacts should again be noted.</s><s>The highest expected |G * | value for muscles studied here was in the gracilis.</s><s>In all of the elastograms, the gracilis appeared brightest (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>), however, its measurement was ranked second.</s><s>Closer inspection of the elastograms show that in each case, there is a dark artefact around the edge of the gracilis that is expected to result from aliasing, and it is likely that this artefact reduces the measurement.</s><s>Removal of such artefacts would further improve the ability to map |G * | and in all likelihood, improve the accuracy of measurements.</s><s>Future work should therefore place</s></p></div>
