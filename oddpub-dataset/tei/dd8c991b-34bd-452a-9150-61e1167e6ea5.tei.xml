<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>H</head><p><s>uman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a species-specific b-herpesvirus that has characteristic lytic and latent stages to its life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>It is a ubiquitous pathogen, infecting 50-90% of populations, depending on socioeconomic factors, maintaining a lifelong infection in the carrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Primary HCMV infection is normally well controlled by a robust humoral and T cell-based immune response and, consequently, it is often asymptomatic in healthy individuals.</s><s>Despite this, primary HCMV infection is never cleared by the immune system and results in a lifelong viral persistence that is underpinned by the ability of the virus to undergo latent infection.</s><s>Although sporadic reactivation from latency likely routinely occurs in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> , it is asymptomatic in healthy individuals.</s><s>However, virus reactivation, like primary infection, poses a severe clinical threat to immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant recipients and patients with AIDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Although HCMV has a wide cell tropism for the lytic life cycle, its latent life cycle appears more restricted.</s><s>One site of latent carriage is in cells of the early myeloid lineage that includes CD34 þ progenitor cells and CD14 þ monocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>In these latently infected cells, maintenance of viral genome is associated with expression of a relatively small number of latency-associated viral genes and no infectious virus is produced.</s><s>This in itself likely aids these sites of latency to escape host immune surveillance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>It is now also clear that, in healthy HCMV-positive donor cells, differentiation of CD14 þ monocytes and CD34 þ progenitors to dendritic cells and macrophages triggers virus reactivation from latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and that this differentiation-dependent reactivation of latent virus in the myeloid lineage is mediated by changes in post-translational modification of histones around the viral MIEP (major immediate-early promoter).</s><s>This drives viral major immediate-early (IE) gene expression, resulting in reactivation of the viral lytic gene cascade and the production of infectious virions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Latent infection is, therefore, a key aspect of viral persistence and latently infected cells are a clear threat to the immunocompromised.</s><s>Despite this, there have only been few reports describing the therapeutic targeting of latently infected cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s></p><p><s>For this reason, much attention has been drawn to viral gene products expressed during HCMV latency and the possibility that they might alter the phenotype of the latently infected cell that can then be exploited for novel antiviral therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>For instance, latent infection has been shown to induce changes in cellular RNA expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> , the cellular secretome <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> as well as cell surface protein expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>These changes are likely mediated by expression of the HCMV latency-associated genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> .</s><s>A number of these have been detected in naturally latently infected cells from healthy seropositive donors, including UL84, UL81-82ast, UL138, UL144, LUNA, UL111A, RNA4.9 and US28 (refs 16-20).</s><s>Although the functions of many of these latency-associated gene products are becoming better established, their roles in latency specifically are still unclear.</s></p><p><s>Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCTs), for example, from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-mobilized donors, are routinely used as a treatment for several high-risk leukaemias and other nonmalignant diseases.</s><s>Peripheral blood stem cells are now one of the most common sources of stem cells for allo-HSCT and comprise multipotent CD34 þ cells that expand and differentiate to reconstitute the immune system.</s><s>However, this differentiation can also result in HCMV reactivation in up to 80% of allo-HSCT patients, if not treated with antivirals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> .</s><s>Although prophylactic treatment with antivirals such as ganciclovir and foscarnet keeps CMV disease incidence below 10% in these patients, ganciclovir mediated neutropenia can lead to increased mortality from bacterial and fungal infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> .</s><s>Consequently, the reduction in latent HCMV load in HSCTs could have far-reaching clinical benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>US28 is one of four G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homologues encoded by HCMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> .</s><s>All four receptors are expressed during lytic infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> , but only US28 mRNA has been detected in models of latent infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> as well as naturally latently infected monocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> .</s><s>Similarly, recent work from Humby and O'Connor <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> has shown that US28 is important to establish latency in CD34 þ cells.</s><s>US28 is also the best characterized of these virus-encoded receptors; it binds both CC and CX3C chemokines <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> and this ligand binding affects US28 constitutive signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> .</s><s>This appears to promote proliferative signals during lytic HCMV infection that, therefore, have been linked to vascular diseases and potential oncomodulatory effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref> .</s><s>US28 has also been shown to heteromerize with the other HCMV-encoded GPCRs UL33 and UL78 that inhibits constitutive US28 activation of nuclear factor-kB <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Fusion toxin proteins (FTPs) exploit high-affinity receptorligand interactions to direct cytotoxic molecules to target cells, and have shown success as novel cancer therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">44</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, the technique has a great potential as a treatment for other indications, such as infectious diseases, where pathogen-encoded targets provide superior specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> .</s><s>Recently, a novel fusion toxin protein (F49A-FTP) has been described that targets and kills cells lytically infected with HCMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> .</s><s>F49A-FTP is based on the soluble extracellular domain of the US28 ligand CX3CL1 (also known as fractalkine) and binds US28 with high affinity compared with the cellular CX3CL1 receptor, CX3CR1.</s><s>After binding US28, F49A-FTP is internalized and mediates cell killing via a recombinant Pseudomonas exotoxin-A motif.</s></p><p><s>Here, we demonstrate that F49A-FTP is able to kill monocytes and CD34 þ progenitor cells that are experimentally latently infected with HCMV and that this killing is dependent on US28 expression.</s><s>Furthermore, we show that this killing is effective at reducing viral load in naturally latently infected CD14 þ monocytes.</s><s>Consistent with this reduction in latent load, this FTP robustly reduces the frequency of virus reactivation from experimentally and naturally latently infected cells.</s><s>These results are, therefore, proof of principle that F49A-FTP can purge the latent load of HCMV in haematopoietic stem cell grafts that could form the basis for a novel approach to greatly reduce the clinical threat of HCMV-positive grafts in the stem cell transplant setting.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>F49A-FTP kills myeloid cells that express US28 in isolation.</s><s>It was previously shown that F49A-FTP is able to kill fibroblast cells that were lytically infected with HCMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> .</s><s>To start, we wanted to demonstrate that this cytotoxity was due solely to US28 expression and not because of other factors associated with viral infection.</s><s>Consequently, we infected human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) with two isolates of HCMV; the wild type, clinal isolate, Titan strain of HCMV or Titan with a deletion in the US28 gene (Titan-DUS28), both of which have a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged UL32 gene.</s><s>Cell cultures were then treated with F49A-FTP for 72 h before infected cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy.</s><s>F49A-FTP was able to kill HFFs infected with wild-type Titan HCMV but not the corresponding US28-deletion virus (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In addition to lytic infection, we also wanted to assess the ability of F49A-FTP to kill cells in which HCMV would normally establish latent infection.</s><s>To do this, we used THP-1 cells, a monocyte-like cell line and can be used as a model of HCMV latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48</ref> .</s><s>THP-1 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors to express haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged US28 (HA-US28) in isolation.</s><s>After this, puromycin selection was used to generate a cell population expressing HA-US28, and HA-US28 expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>Incubation of these THP-1 cells with F49A-FTP for 48 h showed that F49A-FTP efficiently killed US28-expressing THP-1 cells but not mocktransduced cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Latently infected monocytes express cell surface US28.</s><s>On the basis that F49A-FTP is able to kill myeloid cells expressing US28 in isolation, we reasoned that this could enable us to target latently infected myeloid cells that are known to express US28 mRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49</ref> .</s><s>However, in order for this approach to work, it was important to confirm that US28 protein is expressed and trafficked to the cell surface during latent infection of CD14 þ monocytes.</s><s>Because of the lack of available anti-US28 antibodies capable of detecting US28 in latent cells, we were unable to stain latently infected cells directly.</s><s>Consequently, we turned to radiolabelling assays.</s><s>We latently infected CD14 þ monocytes with an HCMV TB40E isolate with an SV40-GFP tag (SV40-GFP-TB40E) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> that allows the short-term detection of GFP-tagged latently infected cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> and sorted GFP-positive monocytes to enrich for a population of latently infected monocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.</s><s>We confirmed by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of HCMV gene expression that these cells were latent (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>RT-qPCR of these cells before and after sorting showed high levels of expression of UL138 mRNA, a known latency-associated gene, concomitant with low levels of lytic transcripts (IE and UL99) compared with reactivated mature dendritic cells that resulted in a characteristic lytic transcription profile, with a switch to high levels of lytic IE and late RNAs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>), consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> .</s><s>We also analysed viral IE and late protein expression in these cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) and observed no IE or UL99 protein expression.</s><s>Similarly, no infectious virus could be isolated from these latently infected cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>), as expected.</s><s>In contrast, reactivation of these latently infected monocytes resulted in detectable IE and UL99 expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>) as well as production of infectious virions (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We then measured the affinity of sorted, latently infected cells for 125 iodine-radiolabelled CX3CL1, which is a high-affinity ligand of both US28 (ref.</s><s>36) and the endogenous receptor CX3CR1, that is expressed on monocytes.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a,b</ref> show that latently infected monocytes showed a higher binding affinity for CX3CL1 compared with uninfected monocytes, similar to the increase observed in US28 expressing Cos 7 cells compared with COS-7 cells expressing CX3CR1.</s><s>We considered that although this result could result from latency-associated expression of US28, formally it could also have been because of increased expression of CX3CR1, perhaps induced by latent infection.</s><s>To differentiate between these two possibilities, we performed RT-qPCR analysis over several time points post infection, measuring relative US28 and CX3CR1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c,d</ref>).</s><s>This showed that US28 is expressed from 1 day post infection in our model of latency.</s><s>It also showed that, although latent viral infection does cause a minor increase in CX3CR1 expression, at 5 days post infection, when the binding assays were carried out in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>, CX3CR1 showed no significant increase in expression.</s><s>Taken together, these data are consistent with the view that US28 is expressed on the cell surface of latently infected monocytes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F49A-FTP kills experimentally latently infected monocytes.</head><p><s>Knowing that latently infected cells do, indeed, bind CX3CL1 with higher affinity than control monocytes, as a result of US28 expression, we next analysed whether F49A-FTP could kill latently infected cells.</s><s>To do this, we experimentally infected CD14 þ monocytes with SV40-GFP tagged HCMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> , confirmed latency by RT-qPCR (see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) and tested the effect of treatment with F49A-FTP.</s><s>We based the concentration of F49A-FTP used (5 Â 10 À 8 M) and the incubation time of 72 h on pilot titration experiments on latently infected monocytes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>After 72 h of treatment with F49A-FTP, we observed a significant loss of GFP-positive, latently infected monocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>).</s><s>In order to ensure that these observations were because of the killing of latently infected cells, and not just a result of silencing of the SV40-GFP expression cassette, we next removed F49A-FTP from these cultures and replaced it with fresh media containing cytokines followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in order to stimulate differentiation and maturation to mature dendritic cells (mDCs), thereby resulting in reactivation of any remaining latent viral genomes.</s><s>As the SV40-GFP cassette in the viral genome is also expressed during lytic infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> , we again quantified the number of GFP-expressing mDCs resulting from reactivation of GFP-tagged virus.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref> shows that the percentage of GFP-positive CD14 þ monocyte-derived mDCs was also reduced in F49A-FTP-treated cultures.</s><s>Finally, we cocultured these CD14 þ monocyte-derived mDCs with HFFs and quantified foci of viral IE expression by immunofluorescent staining in the fibroblasts as a measure of the reactivation of infectious virions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>) and again observed that F49A-FTP treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of reactivated infectious virus.</s><s>Taken together, these data show that F49A-FTP can target and reduce the number of experimentally latently infected CD14 þ monocytes thus reducing subsequent reactivation of latent virus after differentiation and maturation.</s></p><p><s>If this targeting of latently infected cells was specifically because of US28 expression, F49A-FTP should be less effective against monocytes infected with a US28 deletion virus.</s><s>To address this, we employed the Titan-DUS28 (ref.</s><s>56) that contains a UL32-GFP tag that is expressed to high levels upon lytic infection/reactivation.</s><s>We established latency in monocytes with wild-type Titan or Titan-DUS28, treated the latently infected cells with F49A-FTP and then reactivated cells by differentiation and maturation and quantified lytic reactivation directly by detection of UL32-GFP expression in these mDCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>).</s><s>We also quantified the production of infectious virus from these mDCs by co-culturing them with indicator fibroblasts and staining for viral IE reactivation foci (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4e</ref>).</s><s>Although treatment of monocytes latently infected with Titan wild-type virus with F49A-FTP showed a reduction in the frequency of UL32-GFP reactivating cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>) and reactivation of infectious virus from these cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4e</ref>), monocytes infected with Titan-DUS28 show no such decreases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d,e</ref>).</s><s>This confirmed that F49A-FTP selectively kills latently infected cells based on US28 expression.</s><s>It should be pointed out that this control experiment is, necessarily, an imperfect one as US28 expression is known to be necessary for the maintenance of latency; US28-deleted viruses undergo lytic infection in undifferentiated CD34 þ cells and monocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> .</s><s>Nevertheless, lytically infected cells are also killed by F49A-FTP when expressing US28 (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), and the fact that monocytes infected with Titan-DUS28 are not killed by F49A-FTP still supports the notion that F49A-FTP kills latently infected monocytes in a US28-dependent manner.</s></p><p><s>In addition, we considered that killing by F49A-FTP could also be because of US28 being carried into the cell by infectious virions.</s><s>In order to control for this, we delayed F49A-FTP treatment of experimentally infected monocytes by 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post infection that should allow time for virion-delivered US28 to be degraded.</s><s>We found that treatment was as effective at clearing latently infected cells at day 7 compared with day 1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we tested F49A-FTP efficacy against cultures that were experimentally infected at low multiplicity of infection (MOI); F49A-FTP only marginally lost its efficacy when treating cultures with few latently infected monocytes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>F49A-FTP also kills experimentally infected CD34 þ cells.</s><s>As CD34 þ progenitor cells, a major component of HSCTs, are also sites of latent carriage of HCMV in vivo, we repeated these analyses with experimentally latently infected CD34 þ progenitor cells.</s><s>Firstly, we confirmed these cells were, indeed, latently infected.</s><s>Consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54</ref> , infected CD34 þ cells showed a profile of viral transcription with latency; a low level of lytic IE RNA compared with much higher levels of latency-associated UL138 RNA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>) and, importantly, an inability to culture infectious virus from the latently infected cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, differentiation and maturation of these cells to mature CD34 þ derived DCs resulted in a characteristic lytic transcription profile with a switch to high levels of lytic IE compared with UL138 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>), as well as efficient virus production (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Once again, as with latently infected CD14 þ monocytes, we observed that F49A-FTP reduced the number of GFP-expressing latently infected CD34 þ cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>), reduced the number of GFP-expressing CD34 þ derived mDCs resulting from reactivation of GFP-tagged virus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>) and significantly reduced the amount of reactivated infectious virus capable of reinfecting HFFs in co-culture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>F49A-FTP can kill naturally latently infected monocytes.</s><s>Our data, so far, argue that F49A-FTP is able to target and kill experimentally latently infected CD14 þ monocytes and CD34 þ progenitor cells, resulting in a profound reduction in virus reactivation events after differentiation and maturation of latently infected cells.</s><s>However, a key question is whether such a treatment can also target naturally latent cells and prevent reactivation of infectious virus.</s><s>Consequently, we isolated latently infected monocytes from healthy seropositive donors and treated them with F49A-FTP.</s><s>In order to assess any reduction in naturally latent load in these cells, we differentiated and matured any surviving latently infected monocytes, after F49A-FTP treatment, to mDCs to induce virus reactivation and subsequently measured reactivation of infectious virus by co-culture with HFF indicator cells, followed by immunofluorescent staining for IE-positive foci in these fibroblast co-cultures.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref> shows that treatment of naturally latently infected monocytes with F49A-FTP also causes a strong reduction in viral reactivation from these fusion toxintreated naturally latent cells.</s></p></div>
