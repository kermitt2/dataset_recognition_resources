<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>The "Type D" (distressed) personality construct was introduced by Denollet in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>It is characterized by the combination of two enduring basic traits, "negative affectivity" (i.e.</s><s>dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) and "social inhibition" (i.e.</s><s>inhibited behavior during social interaction).</s><s>These two basic traits are recorded psychometrically on two scales of the self-rated DS-14 questionnaire.</s><s>Although Type D is considered a risk factor for mental distress and physical illness, it is not equivalent to a specific mental disorder, such as depression.</s><s>Instead, the construct emphasizes "the role of normal traits rather than psychopathology" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Type D personality is assumed when both scales of the DS-14 lie above the median of Denollet's validation sample.</s><s>Type D therefore just reflects the upper half of an empirical distribution in the population rather than a clinical condition.</s><s>The prevalence of Type D personality in the general population was reported as 21% in Belgium <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and 31% in Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Among German patients, the prevalence of Type D was 25% in cardiology and 62% in psychosomatic medicine T <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Numerous studies and two meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> have shown that the Type D personality is an independent predictor of poor outcome for various heart diseases.</s><s>Although more recent studies could no longer demonstrate a connection between the Type D pattern and poorer cardiac prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the review by Grande et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> concludes that Type D seems to have a significant overall prognostic effect, although the size of this effect may have been overestimated in the early studies.</s></p><p><s>Most previous studies linking Type D personality to psychopathology measured both, Type D and related constructs such as depression or exhaustion, with self-rating scales.</s><s>Only two studies have used validated observer ratings to investigate the connection between Type D personality and depression or panic disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and none has looked at a broader range of mental disorders according to ICD or DSM in patients with vs. without the Type D personality.</s></p><p><s>One study looking at depressive episodes (as per CIDI) and Type D personality (as per DS-14) in 1205 post-myocardial infarction patients from the MIND-IT trial showed that depression and Type D represent two widely different forms of distress: While 17% of the patients were diagnosed with depression and 19% were considered Type D, the majority of depressed patients (56%) did not show the Type D pattern and the majority of Type D patients (63%) were not clinically depressed.</s><s>Combined depression and Type D was found in no &gt; 7.5% of the whole sample.</s><s>Depression and Type D also showed different associations with cardiac health: Patients who were suffering from depression without having the Type D personality pattern (34%) had the most severe heart disease (in terms of ejection fraction and clinical heart failure), whereas patients with depression and the Type D pattern did not differ in their cardiac status from those who had none of these two risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Unfortunately that study did not consider other mental disorders beyond depression.</s><s>The second study <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, investigating 410 patients with non-cardiac chest pain presenting to an emergency ward, used MINI interviews to diagnose depression or panic disorder.</s><s>In this highly selected group, a total of 27% had isolated panic disorder, 4% had depression, and 36% had comorbid panic disorder and depression.</s><s>While isolated panic disorder or depression were unrelated to Type D, Type D patients had a substantially increased percentage of comorbid panic disorder and depression as compared to non-Type D patients (58% vs. 23%), underlining a possible role of Type D as a risk factor for more complex psychopathology rather than an indicator of a specific disorder.</s><s>Accordingly, also 54% of non-Type D patients in that study also had panic disorder and/or depression.</s><s>Other mental disorders were not specifically assessed.</s></p><p><s>While the association of Type D with a broader spectrum of interview-diagnosed mental disorders has not been investigated so far, shedding light on this association might be important to guide treatment.</s><s>Based on the definition of Type D personality as a "trait", it is assumed that there could be an association especially with more complex or enduring mental disorders, especially personality disorders (according to DSM-IV) which, unlike (episodic) depression cannot be expected to improve with usual medical care and may interfere with treatments for heart disease.</s><s>It would therefore be useful to identify these patients early in the disease process and offer them specific treatment.</s></p><p><s>For example, the SPIRR-CAD trial in 570 depressed coronary patients found a significant moderating effect of Type D on change in depression scores: While Type D patients tended to fare better with psychotherapy, non-Type D patients improved similarly with psychotherapy or usual care only <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this research was therefore to investigate the connection of Type D personality with defined mental disorders (as per DSM-IV) and their comorbidity among depressed CHD patients.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p><s>The SPIRR-CAD trial is the first study in which the type and frequency of all comorbid mental disorders have been investigated by means of structured interviews and related to the presence or absence of (self-rated) Type D personality.</s><s>Overall, in this at least mildly depressed group of CHD patients, mental disorders are not generally more frequent among patients with Type D personality than in those without.</s><s>Type D patients, however, are more likely to suffer from complex mental disorders in terms of multiple diagnoses.</s><s>The prevalence of social phobia, dysthymia and personality disorders, especially those with avoidant or obsessive-compulsive symptoms, is significantly elevated in Type D patients.</s><s>This association has been postulated on theoretical grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> but has never been shown before.</s><s>Due to the trial's selection criteria requiring at least mild depressive symptoms for inclusion and leading to substantial oversampling of both depressed and Type D patients, it is little surprising that depressive episodes are no more frequent among Type D patients than non-Type Ds in our sample.</s><s>Since patient selection was based on elevated depression scores but not on Type D per se, the at least twofold increased prevalence of Type D in the SPIRR-CAD sample when compared to unselected CHD samples from the literature [e.g., 9,10] once more demonstrates a close link between Type D and depressive symptoms.</s><s>Accordingly, among the 6436 patients who completed the SPIRR-CAD screening questionnaires, those screening positive for depression had an odds ratio of 4.9 (95% CI 4.4-5.6)</s><s>for coexisting Type D personality as compared to non-depressed patients.</s><s>Such associations of Type D with self-rated symptoms of depression have been observed in multiple previous studies of cardiac patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s>In analogy to our results, Type D personality has also been associated with an increased risk of social anxiety in cardiac patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>In the general population, Type D personality has also been associated with an increased risk of self-rated symptoms of depression, panic, somatization, and feelings of social isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, so far little was known about Type D and diagnosable mental disorders, with only two studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> comparing interviewbased diagnoses of mental disorders in cardiac patients with vs. without Type D. Although those studies found some association of Type D with depressionin one of the studies only when it was comorbid with panic disorder -associations were not particularly strong and other mental disorders were not studied.</s><s>In our sample which only included patients with at least mild self-reported depressive symptoms, Type D is only mildly related to their severity and shows no clear association with diagnosable depressive episodes.</s><s>This might suggest that screening for Type D is not necessary, once depressive symptoms are present.</s></p><p><s>However, the most important finding in our study is that, despite the fact that all participants in the SPIRR-CAD study had elevated levels of depressive symptoms, we were able to show that Type D was still associated with more mental comorbidity as well as more severe and enduring psychopathology, i.e. social phobia, dysthymia and personality disorders.</s><s>This clearly shows that Type D personality is more than depression.</s><s>It supports findings from other studies not only in the field of psychopathology but also in bio-psychological research.</s><s>Even after adjustment for depressive symptoms, Type D personality has been shown to be independently associated with biological mechanisms that may contribute to cardiovascular disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, including increased macrophage activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and endothelial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, there are findings of developmental precursors of mental health problems in Type D individuals, such as a higher prevalence of fearful and preoccupied attachment in individuals with Type D personality <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The association with enduring psychopathology could also be an explanation of why Type D personality among patients with heart disease was a stronger predictor of the persistence of depressive symptoms than the baseline HADS score <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>On the other hand, it has been criticized that there is no significant difference in the temporal stability between the DS 14 and HADS scores, which tend to detect episodically occurring mood symptoms, whereby the DS 14's significance as a marker of chronic risks is weakened in turn <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>One important argument for the relevance of assessing Type D as a separate construct comes from the main SPIRR-CAD findings, where Type D was a significant moderator of treatment effects on depressive symptoms: While depressed non-Type D patients improved regardless of the specific psychotherapy intervention, the intervention tended to be superior to usual care in the Type D group <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>This indicates that Type D patients with heart disease may require specific attention in addition to usual care.</s><s>Given that we could now for the first time empirically document the theoretically expected association of Type D with certain diagnosable personality disorders, this suggestion appears more than plausible.</s><s>In clinical practice, where thorough interview diagnostics are not generally available, the DS-14 might serve as a risk indicator for more complex and enduring mental disorders requiring special attention, although the associations we found were not strong enough to recommend the DS-14 as a screening tool for specific mental disorders.</s></p><p><s>The main strength of our study consists in the size of the sample and a complete record of all mental disorders in accordance with DSM-IV by the gold standard SCID interview, performed by trained and blinded raters.</s><s>A limitation with regard to the general applicability of the results is that all study participants had CHD and at least mild symptoms of depression (as per HADS), so that no conclusion is possible with regard to the significance of the Type D personality for the prevalence of mental disorders among physically healthy persons or CHD patients without symptoms of depression.</s><s>Although SPIRR-CAD was conducted at 10 sites across Germany, it will need to be tested whether the associations found here also hold in other cultural contexts.</s><s>The prevalence of Type D personality among our main study participants at 60% was considerably higher than among unselected German cardiology patients at 25% <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> or the total SPIRR-CAD screening population (29%) but similar to a previous sample of psychotherapy patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, reflecting the inclusion criteria for SPIRR-CAD as a psychotherapy trial.</s></p><p><s>Another limitation consists in the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</s><s>The 75% of patients without relevant depressive symptoms during screening were excluded because it was expected that they couldn't benefit from the psychotherapy intervention.</s><s>On the other hand, some patients with severe physical or mental disorders requiring immediate medical or psychiatric treatment could not be randomized into the trial for ethical reasons.</s><s>This may have introduced some selection bias towards patients with mild to moderate severity of physical and mental illness.</s></p><p><s>As expected, screening for depressive symptoms also led to increased prevalences of mental disorders other than depression in our sample when compared with unselected CHD patients.</s><s>In a study of 523 CHD patients assessed when entering a rehabilitation program, there were 5% with generalized anxiety disorders, 2% with social phobia, 1% with agoraphobia and 1% with panic disorder as per Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, corresponding rates in SPIRR-CAD were similar for generalized anxiety disorder but substantially higher for social phobia and panic disorder/agoraphobia.</s><s>The prevalence of depressive episodes at 34% in our total sample was due to the selection for depression (HADS-D &gt; 7).</s><s>This is, of course, considerably higher than in the general population, in which the 12-month prevalence of diagnosed depressive disorders among 50 to 59-year olds is 8.4% <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and also far higher than in unselected CHD patients (22% current major depression) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, among depressed CHD patients the association of Type D personality with complex and enduring mental disorders such as social phobia, dysthymia and personality disorders of cluster C as per DSM IV may imply significantly higher demands for secondary prevention as well as medical and psychosocial treatment as compared to non-Type D patients.</s><s>Patients at increased risk can be identified with the DS-14.</s><s>However, future research will need to study the prognostic relevance and mechanisms of some understudied mental disorders in cardiac patients, especially personality disorders and social phobia.</s><s>It also needs to be shown whether Type D just predicts outcomes by means of its association with such enduring mental conditions or whether it also increases risk in the absence of diagnosable mental disorders.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="6,63.04,56.81,469.18,257.90"
