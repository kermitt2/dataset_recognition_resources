exchange and thus organ function.</s><s>In order to shed light on the NLRP3-mediated barrier protective effects, we examined the resistance, as a marker of "tightness" of monolayers of epithelial and

AECs showed enhanced barrier dysfunction in response to PLY treatment, whereas lack of NLRP3 did not influence the MLEC barrier function.</s><s>The purity of isolated AECs was greater than 95%,

diminished cellular adhesion in Nlrp3− /− cells, we performed live TIRF microscopy (TIRFM) using a lipophilic membrane dye.</s><s>Fluorescence intensity correlates with areas of cellular adhesion within 200 nm distance from the glass bottom and can be quantified using a particle analysis tool.</s><s>We observed loss of cellular adhesion upon addition of PLY in AECs, which seemed to further decrease by lack of NLRP3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c,d</ref>).</s><s>However, although we observed a moderate increase in apoptotic and/or necrotic epithelial cell death upon PLY

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We demonstrate here that NLRP3 protects the alveolar barrier upon pneumococcal infection or PLY challenge.</s><s>Previous studies showed that epithelial NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes protect the intestinal barrier integrity by stimulating an IL-18-dependent cell proliferation in the reconstitution phase after DSS-induced injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>We initially hypothesised that it might protect the alveolar epithelium via a similar inflammasomeand IL-18-dependent mechanism.</s><s>However, the compromised lung barrier function in S. pneumoniae-infected Nlrp3− /− compared to WT animals was not associated with decreased levels of IL-1β and IL-18 at the tested time point.</s><s>Moreover, lack of ASC, IL-18 or IL-1β did not affect the barrier function in isolated perfused and ventilated lungs.</s><s>Finally, AEC monolayers of Casp1− /− , Il1b− /− or Il18− /− mice did not demonstrate enhanced barrier dysfunction upon PLY treatment.</s><s>Although we cannot exclude the possibility of additional inflammasome-and/ or IL-18-dependent barrier preserving mechanisms in the lung at the healing stage, our results clearly indicate that NLRP3 is able to protect the alveolar epithelium in an inflammasome-, IL-18-and IL-1β -independent fashion during the acute stage of injury.</s></p><p><s>There have been previous reports indicating the involvement of inflammasome components in cytokine-independent functions in the epithelium.</s><s>NLRP3, for example, has been shown to contribute to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury independently of ASC, IL-1β and IL-18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Moreover, inflammasome-independent NLRP3 was shown to facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of kidney epithelial cells by enhancing TGF-β signaling and R-Smad activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In our study, measurement of the current flow under AEC monolayers as well as TIRF microscopy demonstrated increased detachment of Nlrp3− /− AECs compared to WT cells upon PLY treatment, which was not associated with enhanced cell death.</s><s>These results suggest that NLRP3 increases AEC attachment to fibronectin-containing matrices, such as the basal membrane.</s><s>The mechanism of how NLRP3 affects the adherence of AECs and whether this is mediated by type I or II AECs is unclear at this stage and should be elucidated in future studies.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, NLR molecules might be able to regulate epithelial attachment and detachment in different ways.</s><s>Hardt et al. recently showed that NAIP5 controls expulsion of infected intestinal epithelial cells from monolayers independently of IL-1β and IL-18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Future studies should further explore how specific NLRs influence cell adhesion as well as junctional molecules on epithelial cells in different organs.</s><s>In conclusion, our study reveals a novel function of NLRP3 in lung barrier protection independently of inflammasomes, IL-1β and IL-18.</s><s>In the future, therapeutic stimulation of NLRP3 might be useful to stabilize the lung barrier function during pneumonia.</s></p></div>
