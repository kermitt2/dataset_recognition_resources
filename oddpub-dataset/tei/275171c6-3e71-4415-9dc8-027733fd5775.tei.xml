<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Characterization of AIP on Aβ42 self-aggregation.</s><s>To investigate the dynamics of Aβ 42 aggregation, the effect of AIP on fibril formation was first examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</s><s>After 24 hours incubation at room temperature, Aβ 42 wild-type (wt) peptides revealed well-structured, mature fibrils that were 18 nm wide and 300 nm long (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A,B</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, co-incubating Aβ 42 wt peptides with AIP yielded protofibrillar-only structures and inhibited mature fibril formation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>To further assess the targeting of Aβ 42 aggregates by AIP, we incubated Aβ 42 wt peptides for 4 or 12 hours prior to adding AIP, and then analyzed the aggregates for both time points after a total incubation period of 24 hours each.</s><s>For the 4 hours/20 hours treatment, TEM analysis revealed oligomeric and protofibrillar structures without any Aβ 42 wt mature fibrils.</s><s>Interestingly, the formation of mature fibrils was not abolished in the 12 hours/12 hours treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>) suggesting that AIP prevents Aβ 42 wt from undergoing structural transitions to a more compact form (i.e.</s><s>characteristic of pre-fibrillar structures).</s></p><p><s>As an additional TEM control, we used the Aβ 42 G33A substitution peptide that is known to form oligomeric beta-pleated sheet complexes more readily than Aβ 42 wt peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> and stops aggregation at premature fibril stages due to its more hydrophobic surface.</s><s>The Aβ 42 G33A peptides did not yield mature fibrils after 24 hours, (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), as expected, but we did observe protofibrillar structures that were smaller compared to Aβ 42 wt (average length of 100 nm versus 300 nm, respectively).</s><s>In contrast, we did not observe any significant differences in protofibril width between Aβ 42 G33A and Aβ 42 wt (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Since TEM is limited in its deconvolution and magnification <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , we also performed high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) to further examine the influence of AIP on pre-fibrillar assemblies (i.e.</s><s>protofibrils and oligomers).</s><s>In the presence of AIP, the AFM analyses revealed globular particles and higher oligomeric structures with an average length of 100 nm for both Aβ 42 and Aβ 42 G33A peptides (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).</s><s>Validating our TEM data, this result implies that AIP might also affect oligomer formation at early stages of Aβ aggregation.</s></p><p><s>In order to acquire more detailed information at time points before fibrils are first observed, we performed size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using experimental conditions to match our corresponding microscopic analyses.</s><s>When freshly dissolved Aβ 42 wt peptides were incubated for 0, 4, or 8 hours, slow oligomerization dynamics consistently yielded superimposable tetra-/hexamer oligomer peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>).</s><s>The Aβ 42 G33A substitution peptide exhibited faster kinetics (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>), immediately forming high-n oligomers, which steadily increased over time, while the amount of tetra-/hexamers decreased.</s><s>Thus, Aβ 42 G33A exhibited a faster aggregation process over 8 hours compared to the wt peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F and E</ref>, respectively).</s><s>When the identical Aβ 42 wt experiments were repeated in the presence of AIP, consistent kinetics yielded superimposable tetra-/hexamer oligomer peaks with only a modest increase in high-n oligomers (compare Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref> with 1G).</s><s>Co-incubating Aβ 42 G33A with AIP significantly reduced the formation of high-n oligomers over time while reducing the loss in low-n oligomers (compare Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref> with 1H).</s><s>Importantly, our findings establish that (i) the oligomer-stabilizing effect of AIP is stronger for the more aggregation-prone Aβ 42 G33A peptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> compared to Aβ 42 wt, and (ii) AIP has a quantitative impact on oligomers in that it can attenuate the conversion of low-n tetra-/hexamers into high-n oligomers.</s><s>Moreover, AIP appears to interact with tetra-/hexameric Aβ complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometry AIP was capable to block fibril formation of Aβ 42 wt only when low-n oligomers had formed after 4 hours pre-incubation.</s><s>AIP did not abolish fibril formation when higher aggregates or protofibrils were present (12 hours pre-incubation).</s><s>(C,D) Scale bar = 100 nm.</s><s>SEC analyses of aggregated Aβ 42 peptides within 8 hours after freshly dissolving.</s><s>(E) Aβ 42 wt peptides mainly existed as tetra-/hexamers whose amount slightly decreased over time whereas the quantity of high-n oligomers (16-20mers) slightly increased.</s><s>(F) Aβ 42 G33A is presented by a higher amount of high-n oligomers, tremendously increasing over time.</s><s>(G) Freshly dissolved Aβ 42 wt peptide (0 h), after 4 and 8 hours of co-incubation with the AIP showed a constant amount of tetra-/hexamers and only a slight increase of high-n oligomers.</s><s>(H) Co-incubation of Aβ 42 G33A with the AIP abolished the shift from low aggregates to high-n oligomers over time.</s><s>(I) AIP itself eluted from the column at 20 ml (for comparison see Fig. <ref type="figure">1E,F</ref>).</s><s>since we did not observe any other novel peaks eluting at different times.</s><s>As an additional control, we confirmed that AIP elutes from the column in the salt fraction (Fig. <ref type="figure">1I</ref>).</s></p></div>
