loss in individuals with MetS.</s><s>Remarkably, weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction of serum BA concentrations and GLP-1 levels.</s><s>Lifestyle-induced changes of BAs and GLP-1 were correlated with changed levels of insulin, cholesterol, and triglycerides.</s><s>FGF-19 levels did not change following lifestyle-induced weight loss, indicating that intestinal FGF-19 and GLP-1 secretion might not be coupled.</s><s>Detailed analysis of BA species showed that no individual BA increased.</s><s>Multiple regression analysis revealed that clinical and metabolic parameters, i.e. body weight, plasma insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol, are not suitable to predict serum BA composition by a common model.</s></p><p><s>Our data are in contrast to observations made in patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery, which is characterised by an increase of BAs, FGF-19 and GLP-1 concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> .</s><s>BA increase following gastric bypass surgery has been shown to be biphasic, with an early increase (one month post-surgery) of UDCA and its conjugates and a gradual increase within 24 months post-surgery of CDCA, CA, DCA and GDCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Hence, it is discussed that the increase of BA species may promote early improvement of insulin sensitivity following gastric bypass surgery independently from weight loss.</s><s>However, other bariatric surgery procedures that preserve integrity of the intestine, like laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or gastric banding, are not associated with elevated BA levels, despite improved insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr"

decrease following lifestyle-induced weight loss, support the argument that reduced caloric intake and weight loss, and not increased serum BA levels, improve insulin sensitivity.</s></p><p><s>Since lifestyle-induced weight loss is accompanied by reduced serum BA concentrations, it might be possible that attenuated activation of FXR promotes the development of hepatic steatosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Hepatic steatosis is strongly associated with insulin resistance and various features of the MetS.</s><s>Insulin stimulates SREBP1c mRNA transcription and posttranslational proteolytic activation, leading to an activation of hepatic lipogenic gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>However, our results demonstrate that lifestyle-induced weight loss, which leads to improved insulin sensitivity, is associated with reduced serum TG, ALAT and ASAT levels.</s><s>Thus, our results indicate that reduced serum BA levels

on this, it is suggested that serum BA concentrations reflect spillover of BAs into systemic circulation.</s><s>In healthy individuals, hepatic BA synthesis is inhibited by BAs itself via activation of FXR, with CDCA being the most efficacious endogenous FXR ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s><s>Activation of FXR inhibits transcription of the critical regulatory gene in BA synthesis, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1).</s><s>Several observations indicate that this feedback mechanism is impaired in diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Our results demonstrate that the decrease of serum BA levels correlated with reduced fasting insulin levels.</s><s>Hence, we assume that improved insulin sensitivity following lifestyle-induced weight loss restored physiologic control of FXR by BAs, resulting in reduced serum BA levels.</s><s>Our data suggest that reduced BA levels are a consequence

composition may interfere with metabolic functions.</s><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study describing alterations of BA composition following life style induced weight loss in human

BA).</s><s>Weight loss resulted in an increased ratio of 12α -hydroxylated/ non-12α -hydroxylated BAs.</s><s>The ratio of CA (12α -hydroxylated) over CDCA (non-12α -hydroxylated) is controlled by hepatic CYP8B1, which is responsible for the synthesis of CA and its derivatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>The 12α -hydroxylated BAs CA and DCA are reported to be elevated in insulin resistant individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref>  leads to improved glucose tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Based on those observations our results may appear unexpected.</s><s>However, an increased ratio of 12α -hydroxylated/ non-12α -hydroxylated BAs was also observed 2 years after bariatric surgery <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> , suggesting a common mechanism that might be mediated by improved hepatic insulin sensitivity.</s><s>Another potential factor, which may contribute to the decreased serum BA concentrations, is an altered first pass extraction by the liver.</s><s>Furthermore, BA pool composition depends on the gut microbiome, which might be changed following lifestyle-induced weight loss.</s><s>Bacteria convey intestinal deconjugation and dihydroxylation of primary BAs, which gives rise to the secondary BAs DCA, LCA and UDCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>The possible relevance of the gut microbiome for the observed alterations of serum BA composition was not addressed in the current study and awaits further investigations.</s></p><p><s>Enhanced faecal elimination of BAs by a fibre rich diet, as recommended to the study participants, is another potential cause for the decreased serum BA concentrations.</s><s>The dietary intake was not monitored in the current study and therefore BA reduction cannot be correlated to the actually fibre intake.</s><s>However, faecal BA loss is typically compensated by an enhanced hepatic LDL uptake and by an enhanced synthesis of BAs.</s><s>FGF-19 acts as a negative feedback regulator of hepatic BA synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and increased intestinal BA elimination by sequestrants or a fibre rich diet results in decreased intestinal FGF-19 secretion and lower FGF-19 plasma levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>Yet we observed no change of FGF-19 levels following weight loss, arguing against faecal BA elimination as a major factor contributing to the observed BA reduction.</s></p><p><s>Glucose homeostasis is thought to be improved by BAs through induction of intestinal GLP-1 secretion via activation of TGR5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</s><s>In concordance with that, gastric bypass surgery is associated with increased plasma levels of GLP-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , even in the fasting state <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>GLP-1 is an incretin and a potent stimulator of insulin secretion from pancreatic β -cells, thus promoting postprandial glucose clearance.</s><s>Furthermore, GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying and promotes satiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Unlike gastric bypass surgery lifestyle-induced weight loss was not associated with elevated GLP-1 levels in our study.</s><s>Instead, we observed decreased levels of fasting GLP-1.</s><s>The decreased levels of fasting GLP-1 were correlated with changes of insulin and total BA levels.</s><s>Furthermore, multiple regression analysis revealed an association between cholesterol and GLP-1.</s><s>It has been shown that elevated fasting levels of GLP-1 are associated with MetS components <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> and that decreased fasting GLP-1 levels correlate with fasting insulin levels in obese individuals who reduced body weight by dietary changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> .</s><s>Based on these studies, we assume that the observed reduction of GLP-1 may reflect recovered metabolic homeostasis following lifestyle-induced weight loss.</s></p><p><s>Strengths of the current study include the prospective study design, a well characterised study population with no differences between groups at baseline, a low dropout rate and high compliance of participants as a result of daily telemonitoring and weekly letters commenting individual weight progress.</s><s>Laboratory technicians were blinded regarding to the status of the samples and all laboratory measurements were performed according to standard operating protocols.</s><s>As a result, obtained data are of high quality.</s><s>On the other hand, the current study is limited to middle aged male caucasian participants with MetS.</s><s>Thus the results cannot be generalised to other racial/ethnic groups and to individuals without MetS.</s><s>Weight loss in the present study was less pronounced compared to bariatric surgery and the observational period was limited to 6 months.</s><s>Hence, our study does not address longitudinal changes in serum BA levels following endogenous weight loss.</s><s>Another limitation is that only fasting levels were measured.</s><s>Therefore, we cannot comment on postprandial changes of serum BAs.</s><s>The impact of an endogenous weight loss on postprandial serum BA levels remains to be evaluated in future studies.</s><s>Furthermore, total GLP-1 was estimated instead of active GLP-1.</s><s>Active GLP-1 has a very short half-life and is found in low concentrations, before it is degraded by DPP-IV, while total GLP-1 gives an indication of the secretion from intestinal L-cells.</s><s>However, total GLP-1 has been shown to positively correlate with active GLP-1 concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Taken together, using a telemonitored program we achieved a pronounced weight loss and metabolic improvement in obese, pre-diabetic individuals.</s><s>Importantly, in contrast to bariatric surgery lifestyle-induced weight loss results in a decrease of serum BA and GLP-1 concentrations without affecting FGF-19.</s><s>These changes are associated with specific alterations of serum BA composition resulting in an increased 12α -hydroxylated/non-12α -hydroxylated ratio.</s><s>Therefore, lifestyle-induced metabolic changes cannot be explained by increased serum levels of BAs, GLP-1, or FGF-19.</s><s>Current results suggest instead that lower levels of BAs and GLP-1 are the consequence of improved insulin sensitivity and the associated recovered metabolic homeostasis.</s><s>These results provide important novel insights regarding the role of BAs in glucose homeostasis and their therapeutic potential for insulin resistance.</s></p></div>
