<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Periodontitis is characterized by gingival inflammation accompanied by loss of supportive connective tissues for the tooth, resulting in impaired attachment of the periodontal ligament to the cementum.</s><s>Periodontitis is one of the most common diseases in humans that affects over half of the adult population.</s><s>Tooth loss caused by periodontitis is associated with masticatory dysfunction and poor nutritional status, and the medical cost for periodontitis and related diseases is an escalating burden to the healthcare economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s>The goal of conventional treatments for periodontitis has been to control the infection of gingival tissues; however, many cases of periodontitis are resistant or refractory to antimicrobial therapies including antibiotics, antimicrobial mouth rinse, and removal of dental plaque <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Beyond the conventional view of periodontitis as an infectious disease, an increasing number of studies focus on the aberration of cellular responses in the periodontitis-affected gingival tissues.</s><s>Several studies have performed comprehensive transcriptome analyses of the gingival tissues of periodontitis patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> , which improved our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of periodontitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>However, these analyses provided little information on the cellular level, and it remained unknown which definite cell type is critical for the altered gene expression profiles in periodontitis.</s></p><p><s>A hallmark of periodontitis is degradation of extracellular matrices (ECM), such as collagen, between the tooth root and the alveolar bone.</s><s>In various organs, the fibroblast is a central player to form the structural framework and control tissue repair by regulating ECM turnover and remodeling.</s><s>Gingival fibroblasts play important roles not only in the homeostasis of gingival tissue architecture but also in the pathogenesis of periodontitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s>Recently, we isolated and characterized a subset of gingival fibroblasts derived from periodontitis-affected patients that were designated as periodontitis-associated fibroblasts (PAFs), and demonstrated that they were highly capable of collagen degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Preventing ECM degradation in supportive connective tissues for the tooth seems a straightforward therapeutic approach for periodontitis.</s><s>As a proof of concept, we have previously demonstrated that targeting PAFs by inhibition of key signaling pathways, i.e., transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β ) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), successfully protected PAF-mediated degradation of collagen in experimental models of periodontitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>Obviously, it is important to elucidate the PAF phenotype from diagnostic and therapeutic viewpoints; however, the molecular mechanisms how PAFs appear and contribute to ECM degradation in the periodontitis tissues are largely unknown.</s></p><p><s>To further characterize and dissect the molecular repertoire of PAFs we took advantage of the ongoing project of the Functional annotation of the mammalian genome (FANTOM) 5. FANTOM 5 is an international research consortium that has released transcriptome data for about one thousand human samples including cell lines, primary cells, and tissues, using the cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) technology, which captures the 5′ end of capped transcripts and sequences around 27 base pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>CAGE analysis allowed us to map transcription start sites and promoter regions both for coding and non-coding transcripts across the whole genome, simultaneously providing a quantitative measure of transcriptional activity among the numerous FANTOM5 samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s></p><p><s>As part of the FANTOM5 project, we performed CAGE analyses on primary cultured human gingival fibroblasts, periodontal ligament fibroblasts, gingival epithelial cells, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Furthermore, CAGE profiles of PAFs were also examined together with patient-matched gingival fibroblasts derived from healthy gingival tissues, helping us to identify specific molecular features and novel markers that are potentially of functional relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s></p><p><s>First we investigated if gingival fibroblasts have molecular characteristics distinct from fibroblasts derived from other organs as suggested by a previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>Next we compared CAGE profiles of PAFs and normal counterparts to examine gene expression patterns related to the PAF phenotype.</s><s>Through these analyses we discovered that the expression of Distal-Less Homeobox 5 (DLX5) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in its long transcript form is specific for gingival fibroblasts, and is virtually lost in PAFs.</s><s>Further transcriptome analyses revealed that these identified genes are involved in the regulation of ECM.</s><s>Our findings supported the hypothesis that altered molecular signals mediated by DLX5 and RUNX2 long form are associated with the aggressive phenotype of PAFs and degradation of ECM.</s></p><p><s>This work is part of the FANTOM5 project.</s><s>Data downloads, genomic tools, and co-published manuscripts are summarized online at http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/.</s></p></div>

broaden our understanding of periodontitis.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, CAGE profiling characterized distinctive transcriptional features of GFs and PAFs.</s><s>Loss of GF identity appeared to be linked to the PAF phenotype, and DLX5-mediated alternative promoter activation of RUNX2 is crucial for ECM organization and homeostasis of the gingiva.</s><s>Disruption of this signaling in PAFs may be involved in ECM degradation and impaired architecture of the gingiva of periodontitis.</s><s>These findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms how PAFs develop and contribute to progression of periodontitis.</s></p></div>
