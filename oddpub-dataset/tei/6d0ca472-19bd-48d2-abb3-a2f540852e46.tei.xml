Females which were treated or scored for somite numbers on days 9 1/2 or 10 1/2 were mated between 07:00 p.m. and 09:00 p.m..</s><s>At the time of mating, body weights of DBA/2J and NMRI mice ranged from 20 to 25 g, and from 30 to 35 g, respectively.</s></p><p><s>TREATMENT N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU, CAS Nr 684-93-5) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.</s><s>Since MNU decomposes substantially faster with increasing pH values, it was dissolved in saline phosphate buffer at pH 5 immediately before being administered to mice.</s><s>To exclude any possibility of a circadian variation in the teratogenic response, all treated mice were injected with MNU at 9:00 a.m.</s><s>Based on previous data on the dose response relationships of embryotoxic effects of MNU in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Platzek et al. 1988)</ref>, we chose a dose as high as 5 mg/ kg body weight, given by the intraperitoneal route, for this study.</s><s>The injection volume was 10 μL per g of body weight.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DETERMINATION OF THE NUMBER OF SOMITES</head><p><s>For counting somite pairs, pregnant females were killed by cervical dislocation at 9:00 a.m., the NMRI dams on gestation days (GD) 8, 9, 9 1/2 , 10, 10 1/2 , 11 and 12, and the DBA/2J dams on GD9, 10, 10 1/2 , 11 and 12.
