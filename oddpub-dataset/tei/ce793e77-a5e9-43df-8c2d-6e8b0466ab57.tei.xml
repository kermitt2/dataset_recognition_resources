<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>RetSat regulates glycolytic and lipogenic pathways in hepatocytes.</s><s>We found RetSat protein robustly expressed in several metabolically relevant organs and highest in liver, followed by kidney, epididymal white adipose tissue and muscle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, whole blot shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>), correlating well with its known mRNA expression pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>To gain functional insights, we performed gene expression profiling of primary mouse hepatocytes that were depleted of RetSat by siRNA for 48 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, whole blot shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>Unexpectedly, RetSat depletion in hepatocytes resulted in a rather high number of 1602 regulated genes (P &lt; 0.05 (two tailed Students's t-test) and fold-change ≥ 1.25 cutoff), suggesting that RetSat's enzymatic function may couple to the control of gene expression.</s><s>Regulated genes enriched primarily to gene ontology (GO) pathways of intermediary cell metabolism of oxoacids, hexoses/monosaccharides, and amino acids (top five terms shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Among genes related to hexose/monosaccharide metabolism, we noticed that several glycolytic genes, including aldolase (Aldoa), phosphofructokinase, liver (Pfkl) and pyruvate kinase, liver (Pklr) were downregulated upon RetSat depletion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>We validated the regulation of some of these genes by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and extended our analysis to pathways downstream of glycolysis, namely de novo lipogenesis and the elongation, esterification and desaturation of fatty acids.</s><s>Strikingly, many of these genes were also downregulated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>We then tested whether altered gene expression bears functional relevance and found a reduction in glycolytic flux, de novo lipogenesis, and a lower palmitoleate/ palmitate ratio that indicates reduced palmitate desaturation in RetSat-depleted hepatocytes (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e-g</ref>).</s><s>Thus, RetSat depletion impairs glycolytic flux and lipid metabolism in primary hepatocytes.</s></p><p><s>RetSat is elevated in obese mouse liver and controls lipid metabolism.</s><s>Given this functional relevance, we compared RetSat mRNA levels in livers of lean and diet-induced, obese mice (body weights of 29.7 ± 1.61 g vs. 47.9 ± 2.83 g, respectively) and found it increased in obese animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>We next addressed whether RetSat regulates lipid metabolism in vivo.</s><s>To acutely deplete RetSat in livers of adult mice, we generated adenoviruses that target βGal (Control) or RetSat by expressing shRNA.</s><s>Tail-vein injection of adenoviruses yields transient and highly liver-specific expression, as validated by a FLAG-tagged protein that was delivered similarly and detected only in liver (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>Depleting hepatic RetSat expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>, whole blot shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>) in adult, NC-fed mice did not change any of the metabolic parameters measured, when analyzed 6 days after virus injection (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, acute RetSat depletion in mice that were challenged by HS/HFDfeeding before injecting viruses strongly reduced the liver TG content (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c, d</ref>).</s><s>Consistently, hepatic expression of genes involved in de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid elongation and desaturation, including the enzyme that produces monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , was lower (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>), resembling the consequences of RetSat depletion in primary hepatocytes.</s><s>Consistent with reduced expression of genes like ATP citrate lyase (Acly), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1) and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) in shRetSattreated mice, liver de novo palmitate synthesis tended to be lower (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f</ref>).</s><s>Food intake of HS/HFD-fed mice with hepatic RetSat depletion was lower without reaching significance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>).</s><s>Serum levels of TG, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and blood glucose were strongly reduced in both ad libitum-fed and fasted mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2h-j</ref>).</s><s>Lower blood glucose was not due to increased insulin, since serum insulin was reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2k</ref>).</s><s>Glucose tolerance was enhanced in mice with liver-specific depletion of RetSat, whereas the glucose-lowering effects of insulin were comparable (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a, b</ref>, respectively).</s><s>Basal Akt phosphorylation (S473) was slightly higher in shRetSat-treated mice and similar to control mice after the injection of insulin (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Taken together, we found that RetSat expression is elevated in livers of obese mice, and that its acute depleting has profound metabolic effects in HS/HFD-fed, but not in NC-fed mice.</s></p><p><s>Hepatic RETSAT correlates with obesity and steatosis in humans.</s><s>We then addressed whether RETSAT could be linked to hepatic lipid metabolism in humans.</s><s>In a set of liver samples derived from abdominal surgery, RETSAT mRNA expression correlated positively with patient body mass index (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, RETSAT expression showed a strong correlation with the degree of steatosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), an established clinical parameter determined by histology <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and the homeostatic model assessment -insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s><s>We also identified correlations between RETSAT expression and serum TG (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>), and the percentage of MUFAs from total FA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s><s>Thus, the pattern of RETSAT expression in liver samples could imply a function in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in humans.</s></p><p><s>RetSat regulates ChREBP and its target gene expression.</s><s>We next analyzed livers of HS/HFD-fed mice with or without RetSat depletion in more detail to identify the underlying mechanisms of reduced liver and serum TGs.</s><s>Increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis contributes to both liver steatosis and elevated serum TG upon HS/HFD-feeding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>We therefore tested whether major transcriptional regulators of de novo lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (Srebp1c) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , liver x receptor alpha (Nr1h3 = Lxrα) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , or ChREBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> were affected by RetSat depletion.</s><s>Only ChREBP mRNA expression was decreased, with a more pronounced reduction for the weakly expressed, but more active β-isoform <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We discovered a novel function of RetSat in liver metabolism.</s><s>RetSat depletion in primary hepatocytes reduced glycolytic flux, de novo lipogenesis and palmitate desaturation.</s><s>In HS/HFD-fed mice, acute depletion of RetSat reduced liver TG content, improved glucose tolerance, and lowered blood glucose and serum lipids.</s><s>Moreover, we found that RetSat expression in liver correlates positively with body weights in both mice and humans, consistent with increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis in obese, insulin-resistant subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>To identify the mechanism by which RetSat has such a profound impact on metabolic pathways, we profiled gene expression in primary hepatocytes.</s><s>At first we were surprised to find such a high number of genes regulated by the sole depletion of this enzyme.</s><s>However, this pattern hinted towards a transcriptional regulator that would function downstream of RetSat.</s><s>We identified this transcriptional regulator as ChREBP.</s><s>We found that RetSat is required for (1) ChREBP activity, target gene expression, and its nuclear accumulation upon high glucose exposure in primary hepatocytes, (2) ChREBP target gene expression in livers of mice re-fed with NC and (3) ChREBP protein levels and target gene expression in livers of HS/HFD-fed mice.</s><s>Moreover, RetSat expression correlates strongly with that of canonical ChREBP target genes in human liver samples.</s><s>Most importantly, acute depletion of RetSat in livers of HS/HFD-fed mice induced a phenotype that, in many respects, carries strong resemblance with that of acute depletion of ChREBP in genetically obese mice, including a reduction in serum NEFAs and lower blood glucose levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>On the basis of these findings, our current working model places RetSat upstream of ChREBP by catalyzing the generation of a metabolite that enhances ChREBP's nuclear translocation, or by degrading a molecule that mediates cytosolic retention.</s></p><p><s>RetSat's regulation of ChREBP activity may be relevant in other cell types since there is a strong overlap in their tissue expression pattern.</s><s>Indeed, we show that RetSat depletion interferes with glucose sensing and the expression of ChREBP target genes also in adipocytes.</s><s>Since we recently reported that activating ChREBP by high glucose concentrations or expressing a constitutive-active ChREBP in precursor cells enhances adipocyte differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref>  Reduced RetSat expression in adipose tissue of obese mice and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> is also consistent with its function in de novo lipogenesis, since obesity and insulin resistance, in stark contrast to liver, associate with reduced adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Although Srebp1c and Lxrα are interconnected with ChREBP and partially overlap in controlling glycolytic and lipogenic

indication that RetSat directly affects either of them.</s><s>However, we would expect that Srebp1c's proteolytic activation, functionally more relevant than its mRNA levels, could be affected in HS/HFD-fed mice depleted of hepatic RetSat due to low serum insulin levels which are known to affect its processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</s></p><p><s>By identifying RetSat's function in liver several questions arise that should be addressed in future experiments.</s><s>The most important is in regard to RetSat's enzymatic function.</s><s>Similar to adipocyte differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , defects due to RetSat depletion were not overcome by providing the putative enzymatic product 13,14dhretinol.</s><s>If not retinol conversion, by which reaction does RetSat control ChREBP activity?</s><s>Molecular cues, including posttranslational modifications, that enhance or prevent nuclear translocation of ChREBP are complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and a careful dissection may identify RetSat's involvement.</s><s>For instance, it has been hypothesized that RetSat reduces Δ 13 of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>Since ChREBP activity is suppressed by PUFAs, but not by MUFAS or saturated fatty acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , RetSat may induce ChREBP activity by metabolizing PUFAs.</s><s>Notably, not all effects of RetSat depletion can be explained by working upstream of ChREBP, indicating that additional mechanisms may play a role.</s><s>Another puzzling aspect is that RetSat whole-body knockout mice, even when fed a HFD, lacked changes in hepatic or serum TG levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Whether or not this is due to compensatory mechanisms that can be invoked in germline knockout models has to be determined.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, we found that RetSat coordinates liver metabolism by upstream regulation of ChREBP.</s><s>When balanced with metabolically favorable aspects of activated ChREBP, e.g. de novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , and fatty acid desaturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> and suppression of SREBP2-mediated detrimental cholesterol overload <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> in liver, pharmacological inhibition of RetSat and lower ChREBP activity in liver may have
