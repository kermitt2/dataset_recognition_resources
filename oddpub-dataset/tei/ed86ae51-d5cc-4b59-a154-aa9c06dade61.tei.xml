(2013)</ref>, the current systems are mainly able to detect severe lameness, which can also easily be identified visually.</s></p><p><s>Besides changes in gait, lameness leads to other changes in cow behavior.</s><s>In lame dairy cows, recent studies found, for example, reduced locomotor activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Thorup et al., 2015)</ref>, longer lying duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Solano et al., 2016)</ref>, and reduced usage of an automated grooming brush <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Mandel et al., 2018)</ref> as compared with nonlame cows.</s><s>However, most studies grouped cows of different lameness scores, whereas less is known about lamenessinduced behavioral changes in moderately lame cows specifically.</s></p><p><s>The aim of this study was to identify behavioral variables that have the potential to be used as indicators for automatic early lameness detection.</s><s>Therefore, the behavior of nonlame and moderately lame cows was compared on 17 Swiss dairy farms during 2 data collection periods of 48-h each, separated by an interval of 6 to 10 wk.</s><s>Lying behavior, locomotor and neck activity, feeding and rumination behaviors, brush and concentrate feeder visits, and the milking order were examined in the same cows in both periods.</s><s>It was hypothesized that the behavior of moderately lame cows would be affected in a similar direction as has been described for severely lame cows but to a smaller extent.</s><s>In addition, we analyzed the lateral asymmetry in lying behavior and locomotor activity of cows during 1 h after feed delivery or push-ups, behavioral patterns that, to the best of our knowledge, have rarely been investigated as indicators of lameness.</s></p></div>

(1997)</ref>.</s><s>At the beginning of the study, the inter-observer agreement between these 2 observers was further reviewed with 193 cows on 4 of the study farms and reached an agreement of 92.8 ± 2.9% (mean ± SD).</s><s>In case of a disagreement between the observers concerning a cow's locomotion score during the on-farm scoring, the observers reassessed the cow's score based on the video recordings.</s><s>If no agreement was achieved, the cow was excluded from the statistical analysis for the respective period.</s></p><p><s>Cows were only included in the data collection of period B if their locomotion score in period B still matched 1 of the 2 scores examined in this study (either locomotion score 1 or 3).</s><s>However, as the number of cows that changed their locomotion score from period A to period B was very small (14 cows), these individuals were excluded from the statistical analysis.</s><s>Further, a change in locomotion score within a period led to the exclusion of the cow in the respective period.</s><s>Overall, 219 cows were included in the study of which 66 cows were moderately lame and 142 nonlame in period A, and 53 cows were moderately lame and 128 nonlame in period B.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Recording and Processing</head><p><s>Accelerometers.</s><s>Lying behavior, locomotor activity, and neck activity were measured automatically by means of 3-dimensional accelerometers (MSR145 data logger, MSR Electronics GmbH, Seuzach, Switzerland).</s><s>These accelerometers were already validated and used in previous studies for the recording of locomotor activity and lying behavior in cows <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gygax et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Johns et al., 2015)</ref> and horses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Burla et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Burla et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s>The MSR data loggers recorded acceleration in horizontal, vertical, and lateral direction of the leg with a sampling rate of 1 Hz and a sensitivity of ±16 g.</s><s>Via MSR software (version 5.28.14, MSR Electronics GmbH, Seuzach, Switzerland), raw data were transmitted to a computer as CSV files, and R (version 3.3.2;</s><s>R Core Team, 2016) was used for the calculation of outcome variables.</s></p><p><s>Lying Behavior.</s><s>To measure lying behavior, an accelerometer was attached laterally at the metatarsus of the cow's left hind leg with a Velcro strap, and a foam pad was used underneath to prevent pressure sores.</s><s>Furthermore, elastic bandages and duct tape were used to prevent damage and keep the data logger clean and dry.</s><s>Lying bouts were detected based on a threshold decision for every single data point.</s><s>Each acceleration value of the vertical direction of the leg was categorized as lying if it was greater than −0.5 g and categorized as an upright position if it was smaller than −0.5 g.</s><s>In addition, a running median smoothed this decision across 120 s (60 s situated before and 60 s after the data point in question) to account for short-term fluctuations.</s><s>Only lying bouts lasting at least 60 s were considered for statistical analysis.</s><s>For each cow, the lying duration, number of lying bouts, and average lying bout duration were calculated per 24 h.</s><s>Furthermore, the lateral asymmetry in lying behavior was quantified.</s><s>Acceleration values of the lateral direction of the leg were attributed to be lying on the right side if greater than −0.5 g or lying on the left side if smaller than −0.5 g, and each lying bout was assigned to be on the right or left side according to the majority of attributions.</s><s>Based on these assignments, the lateral asymmetry in the number of lying bouts was calculated by dividing the number of lying bouts on the left side by the total number of lying bouts.</s><s>Similarly, the lateral asymmetry in lying duration was determined by dividing the lying duration on the left side by the total lying duration.</s><s>To represent the degree of asymmetry for both variables but without specifying to which side, asymmetry ratios smaller than 0.5 were subtracted from 1, and these values (ranging from 0.5 to 1) were subsequently translated to a scale from 0 to 1.</s><s>This translation resulted in asymmetry ratios between 0 (no asymmetry) and 1 (complete asymmetry) for the lateral asymmetry in the lying behavior.</s></p><p><s>Locomotor Activity.</s><s>Locomotor activity was determined using data of the accelerometer attached to the hind leg.</s><s>To calculate the average locomotor activity per hour, absolute differences of acceleration values of all 3 directions were summed and divided by 24.</s><s>In addition, the average locomotor activity in upright position was calculated after excluding all data points during lying.</s><s>Furthermore, the locomotor activity during 1 h after feed delivery or push-ups was examined.</s><s>However, intervals that overlapped with the period 1 h after milking were excluded because most cows were fixed in the head lock during this time.</s></p><p><s>Neck Activity.</s><s>The activity of the cows was additionally measured by means of an accelerometer, which was attached to the lowest point of the cow's neck collar (usually next to the transponder).</s><s>Due to the attachment of the measuring device on the neck collar and not the animal itself, it is less likely to cause injuries or pressure sores, where neck activity could be an advantageous alternative to locomotor activity measured by pedometers.</s><s>To calculate the average neck activity per hour, absolute differences of acceleration values of all 3 directions were summed up and divided by 24.</s></p><p><s>Noseband Sensors.</s><s>For the measurement of feeding and rumination behaviors, cows were wearing a pressure sensor for chewing movement detection (RumiWatch halter, ITIN + HOCH GmbH, Liestal, Switzerland;
