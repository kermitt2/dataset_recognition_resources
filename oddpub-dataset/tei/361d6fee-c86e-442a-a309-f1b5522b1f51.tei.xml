built (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>Thirteen spots had a protein ratio below 1.0, meaning less protein abundance when exposed to H-PDF, whereas their RNA ratio was above 1.0.</s><s>Seven of these spots (54%) contained HSP (protein symbols: HSPA9, HSPA1A, HSPA8, HSPA1A, HSPA8, HSPA1A, G6PD, GSTP1, CCT2, TXNRD1, G6PD, HSPB1, and NME1).</s><s>Six protein spots

were also contained in the previously mentioned group.</s><s>Eight protein spots showed higher abundance on the protein level although their RNA expression ratio was below 1.0.</s><s>Two of these spots contained HSP (CCT5, PSMB2, HSPA5, P4HB, PDIA6, COPS4, HSPD1, and RPSA).</s><s>Eleven protein spots had a H-PDF/F-PDF ratio of less than 1.0 with concomitantly downregulated RNA expression.</s><s>Three of these spots contained HSP (CCT7, PSMA2, FKBP1A, PPIA, PCNA, HADHA, PPIA, PSMD4, HSPD1, HSP90B1, and HSPA4).</s><s>In addition to the graphical presentation in Figure <ref

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Comparing the effects of two PDF that only differ in their modality of sterilization, either by heat or by filtration, can be regarded as surrogate method to evaluate the effects of GDPs formed through heat-sterilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Specific effects of heat-sterilized PDF on the cellular stress response might thus be largely attributed to these toxic compounds.</s><s>GDPs are known to mediate their cytotoxicity via oxidative stress, and recent research suggests that oxidative stress might dampen the cellular stress responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The advent of omics technologies, such as gel-or mass spectrometry-based proteomics of the protein level and microarray techniques on the transcriptional level, allowed unbiased global analyses, searching for yet unknown differentially regulated proteins or transcripts under given experimental conditions.</s></p><p><s>Whereas the use of a single analytical level allows candidate search and functional interpretation based on common features, for example, characterized in gene ontology databases, the cross-omics approach allows generating hypotheses by comparing gene expression profiling to (functional active) protein abundances.</s><s>In this study we used a topic defined mRNA microarray for toxicology relevant genes, provided by Miltenyi as the PIQOR platform.</s><s>In contrast to quantification of mRNA levels by rt-PCR, which relies on the consistency of single housekeeping genes, the array technique allows more elaborate approaches of normalization.</s></p><p><s>Together with our proteomics platform based on 2D-DIGE we compared effects of heat-versus filter-sterilized PDF in mesothelial cells in the extended exposure model, for proteins identified by mass spectrometry in earlier in vitro PD studies.</s></p><p><s>The high relevance of the chosen candidate proteins and transcripts becomes evident by the considerable overlap of MS identified proteins and genes represented on the PIQOR array in experimental PD.</s><s>We could therefore use this set, mainly consisting of chaperones and stress-relevant proteins involved in detoxification and protein homeostasis, to search for global systematic effects of heat-versus filter-sterilized PDF on the cellular stress response.</s><s>In recent work, we have shown at the protein level that expression levels of such a stress proteome can be related to mesothelial cell susceptibility to PDF induced injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>This stress proteome was found to be downregulated following exposure to heatsterilized PDF and could be restored by addition of cytoprotective additives, such as alanyl-glutamine dipeptide <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>The cross-omics approach used in the current study gives additional information beyond the observed inadequate induction of the heat shock response at the protein level <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In our dataset a rather large group of candidates showed a protein abundance ratio below 1.0 (downregulated by H-PDF compared to F-PDF) and at the same time an mRNA expression ratio above 1.0 (upregulated by H-PDF compared to F-PDF), when the two fluid types were compared.</s><s>This phenomenon is of growing interest in the omics-field, as the observed perturbations might allow deducing regulatory mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Future studies are needed to investigate whether the reverse relationship of protein and mRNA indicates a higher degree of protein turnover (i.e., shortened halflife of the protein by increased degradation) or translational inhibition or posttranslational modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>This group contains many HSP but the effect only reached the level of significance for the proteins Hsp72 (HSPA1A) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which might be due to inherent limited power of these hypothesesgenerating omics studies.</s><s>HSP are molecular chaperones and known to incorporate transport and folding of other proteins by binding to hydrophobic normal hidden domains of immature or denatured proteins.</s><s>Thereby, these proteins have been shown to promote cytoskeletal repair and preserve the mesothelial monolayer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Whereas G6PD was already found upregulated in the acute exposure model in an earlier study <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> this key-enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, which is substantial for the production of NADPH and the cell's resistance to oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, is significantly downregulated by heat-sterilized PDF compared to filtersterilized PDF after extended exposure.</s><s>The initial observation that the cells are not able to adequately respond to stress mediated by toxic factors of PDF, such as glucose and GDPs, is further reflected by the fact that all candidates in the dataset belonging to the glutathione system (GSTP1, TXNRD1, and GSR), which is dedicated to detoxification and neutralization of reactive oxygen species, are found to be upregulated on the transcriptional level.</s><s>However, none of these candidates show significant upregulation of protein abundance.</s><s>The deleterious effect of the cooccurrence of hyperglycemia, toxic aldehydes, such as GDPs, and a lack of reductive power (e.g., by NADPH and glutathione) has been demonstrated extensively in the diabetes model and beyond <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Two further subgroups of our dataset were characterized by either simultaneously increased or decreased abundance of both protein and mRNA.</s><s>Concurrent regulation of protein and mRNA likely indicates undisturbed translation of transcriptional regulation of gene expression into proteins.</s></p><p><s>One clearly upregulated player identified in our study is PDIA3, a protein disulfide-isomerase predominantly found in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, which is involved in the unfolded protein response <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, knockdown of PDIA3, also known as endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57 or 58 kDa glucose-regulated protein, protected against tunicamycin-induced apoptosis, with associated induction of the 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP-78, BiP, and HSPA5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, which was identified as downregulated on the transcriptional level but upregulated on the protein level in our study.</s><s>GRP-78 is an ER stress protein (glucose-regulated protein) and, as suggested by its name, expected to be upregulated by the physicochemical properties of PDF.</s></p><p><s>Another protein found with significantly higher abundance, when H-PDF was compared to F-PDF, was Hsp27 (HSPB1) which is well known to be involved in the stress response to PDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Hsp27 is a highly abundant effector of the heat shock response directly interacting with the actin cytoskeleton and thereby protecting mesothelial cell integrity by increased abundance <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>However, it is well known that Hsp27 is extensively modified by phosphorylation leading to reciprocal abundance changes of multiple spots on 2D gels <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed we also identified Hsp27 in a spot with lowered abundance, as can be better made evident by direct comparison between 2D proteomic gels and 2D western analysis.</s><s>As the phosphorylation status is functionally highly relevant for its chaperoning effect, Hsp27 is a particularly informative candidate to demonstrate the role of posttranslational modification on the level of functionally active protein isoforms versus total protein abundance and gene expression.</s></p><p><s>One clearly downregulated player, on the protein level as well as on the transcriptional level, identified in our study is PPIA which is a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase and is thereby active in protein folding <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>PPIA is also a member of the immunophilin family (cyclophilin A) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and the receptor for the immunosuppressive drugs tacrolimus and cyclosporine <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s>Other examples for proteins with significantly downregulated transcripts were the important ER chaperone Hsp60 (HSPD1), which was as Hsp27 also found in a significantly upregulated spot, and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is also known as cyclin, reflecting an increase in MC proliferation as previously described in the in vivo setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A small group of candidates showed a protein abundance ratio above 1.0 (upregulated by H-PDF compared to F-PDF) and at the same time an mRNA expression ratio below 1.0 (downregulated by H-PDF compared to F-PDF), when the two fluid types were compared.</s><s>In this case the increased levels of protein expression with concomitantly depressed transcription of the same genes allow generating interesting hypotheses, such as prolonged half-life of the proteins by decreased degradation, possibly mediated by lack of protein degrading mechanisms such as the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly all identified members associated with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (PSMB2, COPS4, PSMA2, and PSMD4) showed downregulated levels of mRNA and one of them was also significantly lower abundant on the protein level.</s><s>This effect is concordant with the literature, where hyperglycemia and methylglyoxal led to an impaired ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in bovine and murine endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Indeed methylglyoxal is one of the GDPs detected in considerable concentrations in conventional PDF <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s>In this study nonuremic patients were used to obtain primary mesothelial cells from omentum.</s><s>It has been demonstrated before that the uremic milieu per se can change the behavior of the mesothelial cells.</s><s>Thus, future studies are needed to investigate whether specific GDPs in PDF might impair or deplete this essential part of the cellular stress response and what the role of the uremic milieu with even more toxic small molecules might be <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our data show that under stressful conditions the correlation between mRNA and protein cannot be regarded as linear for a wide range of tightly involved players of the stress response.</s><s>The transcription of mRNA is the initial level of gene regulation, where transcription factors lead to situation-dependent usage of genetic sequence.</s><s>However a plethora of intermitting mechanisms, such as RNA interference, regulatory proteins, or translational efficiency, can promote or hinder cellular protein production.</s><s>Finally the amounts of functional proteins are influenced by protein folding, posttranslational modification, and turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s>Albeit the observed changes on the protein level are quite low, they are in a reasonable biological range, given that the proteins that can be detected by 2D gel electrophoresis represent the most abundant portion of soluble proteins.</s><s>These findings highlight the limitations of gene expression profiling concerning the prediction of abundance of functionally active proteins and/or their isoforms.</s><s>Future studies need to carefully assess these regulatory mechanisms to monitor the abundance of effector proteins that ultimately reflect biological reality.</s></p><p><s>Bioinformatics analysis yields similar information on activated stress responses using data derived from this transcriptomics dataset as we have previously reported in a proteomics approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Direct comparison between these "omics" technologies at the level of individual gene products, however, as we performed in our cross-omics approach, might allow additional interesting insights into specific pathogenic processes caused by PDF exposure.</s><s>Moreover, the results of the current study underline that information of potential diagnostic (such as biomarker candidates) and/or therapeutic (such as novel drug targets) implications derived from proteomics and/or transcriptomics findings cannot be utilized interchangeably but rather request specific separate analysis and interpretation.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, the comparison of proteomics and transcriptomics data allowed the discrimination of differentially regulated protein expression according to correlating or noncorrelating transcripts.</s><s>The results of this study are particularly interesting in terms of limitations of gene expression profiling with regard to prediction of abundance of functionally active proteins, indicating the need for future studies to investigate potential interference in translational activity and regulation.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 8 )</head><label>8</label><figDesc><div><p><s>The column contains
