<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p><s>The relative contribution of the effector molecules produced by T cells to tumour rejection is unclear, but interferon-γ (IFNγ) is critical in most of the analysed models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> .</s><s>Although IFNγ can impede tumour growth by acting directly on cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> , it must also act on the tumour stroma for effective rejection of large, established tumours <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref> .</s><s>However, which stroma cells respond to IFNγ and by which mechanism IFNγ contributes to tumour rejection through stromal targeting have remained unknown.</s><s>Here we use a model of IFNγ induction and an IFNγ-GFP fusion protein in large, vascularized tumours growing in mice that express the IFNγ receptor exclusively in defined cell types.</s><s>Responsiveness to IFNγ by myeloid cells and other haematopoietic cells, including T cells or fibroblasts, was not sufficient for IFNγ-induced tumour regression, whereas responsiveness of endothelial cells to IFNγ was necessary and sufficient.</s><s>Intravital microscopy revealed IFNγ-induced regression of the tumour vasculature, resulting in arrest of blood flow and subsequent collapse of tumours, similar to non-haemorrhagic necrosis in ischaemia and unlike haemorrhagic necrosis induced by tumour necrosis factor.</s><s>The early events of IFNγ-induced tumour ischaemia resemble non-apoptotic blood vessel regression during development, wound healing or IFNγ-mediated, pregnancy-induced remodelling of uterine arteries <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref> .</s><s>A better mechanistic understanding of how solid tumours are rejected may aid the design of more effective protocols for adoptive T-cell therapy.</s></p><p><s>The contribution of T-cell effector molecules to tumour rejection has mainly been studied in models of low tumour burden with little tumour stroma <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> .</s><s>For IFNγ -mediated effects, various cell types have been suggested as targets, such as the cancer cells themselves, macrophages, fibroblasts, monocytes or endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> .</s><s>Most cells of the body express the IFNγ receptor (IFNγR).</s><s>IFNγ inhibits neoangiogenesis and prevents the development of tumours from inoculated cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> , but the effects of IFNγ on blood vessels of large established tumours are poorly understood.</s><s>As human cancers are usually at least 1 cm in diameter when they are first detected, studying the effects of IFNγ on the vasculature of such tumours is clinically relevant.</s><s>We transduced the fibrosarcoma cell line MCA313, derived from a methylcholanthrene-treated IFNγR-deficient C57BL/6 (IFNγR − ) mouse, with a retrovirus allowing doxycycline (dox)-mediated regulation of IFNγ expression (MCA313 IFNγ-IND ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1a</ref>).</s><s>MCA313 IFNγ-IND cells produced IFNγ upon treatment with dox (around 87 ng ml −1 ), but not in its absence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1b</ref>).</s><s>When IFNγ was induced in large MCA313 <ref type="bibr">IFNγ-IND</ref> tumours in immunocompromised Rag-deficient (Rag − ) mice, serum levels reached a peak of around 10 ng ml −1 48 h after dox administration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1c</ref>).</s><s>Induction of IFNγ in two-to three-week-old large MCA313 IFNγ-IND tumours in C57BL/6 wild-type mice led to tumour regression, macroscopic and microscopic necrosis, and loss of tumour endothelial (CD31 + ) cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1a-c</ref>).</s><s>Tumour regression was observed in wild-type but not in IFNγR − mice (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1a</ref>).</s><s>MCA313 IFNγ-IND tumours grew with similar kinetics and regressed similarly upon IFNγ induction in wild-type and Rag − mice, indicating their low immunogenicity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1a</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether dox-induced IFNγ levels were comparable to those achieved by antigen-specific T cells that rejected established tumours of a similar size, we treated Rag − mice bearing 16.113 adenocarcinomas with CD8 + T cells, which are specific for SV40 large T antigen expressed by 16.113 cells (TCR-I T cells), and determined IFNγ serum levels 3-7 days after T-cell transfer.</s><s>On day 4, around 13 ng ml <ref type="bibr">−1</ref> IFNγ was detected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1c</ref>) and tumours were subsequently rejected (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1d</ref>).</s><s>Thus, IFNγ expression in large MCA313 <ref type="bibr">IFNγ-IND</ref> tumours was comparable to that of effector T cells during tumour rejection and was sufficient to induce tumour regression, when only tumour stroma, and no cancer cells, could respond to IFNγ.</s><s>Similarly, IFNγ induction in large IFNγ-insensitive 16.113-999 <ref type="bibr">IFNγ-IND</ref> adenocarcinomas resulted in tumour regression and a reduction in tumour endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1e-g</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To identify the target stromal cells of IFNγ, we generated mice with exclusive IFNγR expression in defined cell types.</s><s>In these mice, the Ifngr1 transgene is linked to a GFP reporter gene by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and separated from a ubiquitous promoter by a Cre-recombinase-excisable stop cassette (pCAG loxP Stop loxP -IFNγ R-IRES-GFP, denoted hereafter as PIG mice; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">1a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure"
