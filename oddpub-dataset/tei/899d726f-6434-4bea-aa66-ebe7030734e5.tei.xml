<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Removal of the tumor mass and subsequent ablation of the remaining thyroid cancer tissue by radioiodine therapy is a prerequisite for cure of thyroid cancer.</s><s>Therefore, anaplastic thyroid carcinomas that lack radioiodine uptake have a very poor prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, life expectancy of patients with progressive local and metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer that secondarily became refractory to radioiodine treatment is also very limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As an evolving new strategy to improve prognosis of these thyroid carcinomas, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been investigated in clinical studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s><s>Recently, the FDA has approved sorafenib as the first drug of this group (http://  www.fda.gov).</s><s>Sorafenib, an orally ingested drug, exerts its anti-angiogenic and anti-mitogenic effect by targeting BRAF, VEGFR1 and 2, RET and thereby important growth-regulating signaling pathways of thyroid cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>In differentiated thyroid cancer the role of genetic aberrations in the RET-RAS-RAF-MAPK signaling pathway in tumor pathogenesis and progression is well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Rearrangements in the RET proto-oncogene which is involved in the initiation of tumor formation are detectable in up to 25% of PTCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>Twenty nine to 69% of PTCs harbor a BRAF V600E mutation, which is associated with recurrent and persistent disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s>RAS mutations and downstream signaling PIK3CA mutations occur in almost 50% of FTCs &gt;10% of Hurthle cell carcinomas <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In a xenograft model it was demonstrated that sorafenib obstructs RAF kinases and thereby inhibits growth of ATC cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, sorafenib inhibited the growth and angiogenesis of orthotopic ATC xenografts in nude mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>These carcinoma cells lacked any known molecular aberrations which argues against the hypothesis that the effect of sorafenib is limited to tumors with these mutations.</s><s>Subsequent findings demonstrated that PTC cells carrying the RET/PTC1 rearrangement were more sensitive to sorafenib than those carrying a BRAF mutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of sorafenib for patients with radioiodine refractory-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).</s><s>A recent meta-analysis which included seven studies on radioiodine-refractory DTC, showed a partial response in 22% and stable disease in 52% of the patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Median progression-free survival was 12.4 month (95% CI: 10.4-14.7).</s><s>Sorafenib has also been utilized for patients with advanced ATC <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>Two out of 20 patients had a partial remission and 5 had stable disease with a duration of 4 months (range, 3-11 months).</s><s>At least in patients with radioiodine-refractory thyroid carcinomas with a poor prognosis multi-kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib are considered promising.</s></p><p><s>However, toxic side effects such as hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, fatigue, rash and weight loss that occur in up to 80% of sorafenib-treated patients are a concern <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Due to the side effects dose reduction was necessary in &gt;60% of the patients and in 6-25% of patients treatment was even discontinued <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, adjuvant therapy that allows dose reduction of sorafenib without decreasing its efficacy may be an option to overcome this problem.</s></p><p><s>Metformin, a widely used, well-tolerated antidiabetic drug, has recently been demonstrated to potentiate the anti-mitogenic effects of doxorubicin and cisplatin in ATC cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>The combined therapy with metformin enabled a significant reduction of these chemotherapeutic drugs without reducing their anti-proliferative capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we have demonstrated that the anti-mitogenic effect of sorafenib was potentiated by the addition of metformin.</s><s>The addition of metformin allowed a dose reduction of sorafenib by up to 25% without a decrease of the growth-inhibitory effect.</s></p><p><s>Sorafenib reduced viability of ATC cells by blocking cell cycle progression via G0/1 phase arrest and S phase inhibition and by inducing cell apoptosis.</s><s>The effects were more pronounced when metformin was added to the culture.</s></p><p><s>Tumor sphere formation and clonal growth which reflect self-renewal and characteristic proliferation pattern, are a hallmark of cancer stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>.</s><s>In the present results, sorafenib significantly reduced clonal growth of HTh74Rdox cells.</s><s>In addition, the drug inhibited tumor sphere formation by decreasing tumor sphere number and size.</s><s>Again, metformin amplified the effect of sorafenib in the two experiments.</s><s>These data suggest that sorafenib and metformin target cancer cells and their derived stem cells.</s><s>A potentiating effect of metformin as adjuvant to sorafenib has recently been reported in cholangiocarcinoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Sorafenib and metformin inhibited MAP kinase signaling as demonstrated by reduced ERK phosphorylation.</s><s>A synergistic effect was, however, not detected.</s><s>Therefore, the synergistic inhibition of cell growth may be explained by the different targets of the two drugs.</s><s>Metformin additionally decreases thyroid carcinoma cell growth by inhibition of the AMPK-mTOR pathway and, as mentioned earlier, sorafenib by targeting other receptor-dependent kinases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and metformin synergistically decreased the growth rate of ATC cells.</s><s>These drugs share a common target in cancer therapy, the MAP kinase pathway.</s><s>Additionally, each drug inhibits other growth-regulatory signaling pathways and exert their anti-mitogenic effect on the derived cancer stem cells.</s><s>The synergistic effect of metformin suggests this drug as an adjuvant to sorafenib treatment to reduce dose-dependent sideeffects.</s><s>Clinical studies are necessary to evaluate whether a combined therapy of sorafenib and metformin are useful for the treatment of radioiodine-refractory DTC and anaplastic thyroid cancer in diabetics and other patients with
