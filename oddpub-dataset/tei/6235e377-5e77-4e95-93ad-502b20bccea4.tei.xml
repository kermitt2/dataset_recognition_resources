<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>For differentiation-defective malignancies, compounds that modulate transcription, such as retinoic acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, are of particular interest.</s><s>HDAC inhibitors are currently under investigation for the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancer diseases.</s><s>However, one clinical drawback is class-specific toxicity of unselective inhibitors, limiting their full anticancer potential.</s><s>Selective targeting of individual HDAC isozymes in defined tumor entities may therefore be an attractive alternative treatment approach.</s><s>We have previously identified HDAC family member 8 (HDAC8) as a novel target in childhood neuroblastoma.</s><s>Using small-molecule inhibitors, we now demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDAC8 exhibits antineuroblastoma activity without toxicity in two xenograft mouse models of MYCN oncogene-amplified neuroblastoma.</s><s>In contrast, the unselective HDAC inhibitor vorinostat was more toxic in the same models.</s><s>HDAC8-selective inhibition induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation in vitro and in vivo.</s><s>Upon combination with retinoic acid, differentiation was significantly enhanced, as demonstrated by elongated neurofilament-positive neurites and upregulation of NTRK1.</s><s>Additionally, MYCN oncogene expression was downregulated in vitro and tumor cell growth was markedly reduced in vivo.</s><s>Mechanistic studies suggest that cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) links HDAC8-and retinoic acid-mediated gene transcription.</s><s>In conclusion, HDAC-selective targeting can be effective in tumors exhibiting HDAC isozyme-dependent tumor growth in vivo and can be combined with differentiation-inducing agents.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PCI-48000</head><p><s>Because similar toxicity profiles have been independently observed in many clinical trials involving HDAC inhibitors, it is believed that these are drug class-specific side effects, which limit their full anticancer potential.</s><s>Thus, there is an ongoing debate in the field of HDAC inhibitor development as to whether selective inhibitors targeting only a single HDAC family member that drives tumor growth and survival would result in a larger therapeutic window and greater efficacy compared with broadspectrum inhibitors currently in clinical use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref></s><s>So far, in vivo proof of concept demonstrating that superior antitumoral activity using an HDAC-isozyme-selective inhibitor can be achieved is lacking.</s><s>In this regard, HDAC family member 8 appears to be an attractive target, as crystal structure analysis revealed a unique second metal binding site in close proximity to the main catalytic domain, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> which distinguishes this HDAC isozyme from the other classical deacetylases.</s><s>This finding led to the design of linkerless hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> that fit in this secondary pocket and display a much higher selectivity for HDAC8 over the other classical HDACs.</s><s>We have previously shown that the expression of HDAC8 correlates with advanced tumor stage and poor outcome in neuroblastoma. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>Here, we verify small-molecule inhibition of HDAC8 as a novel therapeutic strategy alone and as a potent enhancer of retinoic acidmediated differentiation and propose the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) as a link between HDAC8 and retinoic acid-mediated gene transcription.</s></p></div>

neuroblastoma cell cultures induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>The aim of the current study was to evaluate HDAC8 as a potential drug target in vivo.</s><s>Before this, we investigated HDAC8 expression in human tumor samples.</s><s>We reanalyzed publically available expression data from the AMC (Academic Medical Center) cohort (GEO accession no.</s><s>GSE16476) of neuroblastoma patients using the web-based R2 microarray database (http://r2.amc.nl). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s>he expression of HDAC8 significantly differed between the tumor stages.</s><s>HDAC8 expression levels significantly correlated with INSS (International Neuroblastoma Staging System) stage 4 and poor overall survival (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A and B</ref>).</s><s>These results confirm our previously published observation with human tumor samples from the German neuroblastoma trial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>We additionally tested the HDAC8 protein expression in a diversity of neuroblastoma cell lines.</s><s>All neuroblastoma cell lines used were HDAC8 positive, independent of MYCN oncogene amplification status.</s><s>In contrast, infant fibroblasts displayed much lower HDAC8 protein levels (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1C</ref>).</s><s>To confirm HDAC8 as a potential therapeutic target in vivo, we examined the influence of HDAC8 knockdown on tumor growth in a neuroblastoma xenograft mouse model.</s><s>For this purpose, we used BE(2)-C, a well-established cell line representing a relatively chemotherapy-resistant, highly aggressive, MYCN-amplified and p53 mutant neuroblastoma cell model.</s><s>Cells transiently transfected with either negative control or HDAC8 targeting siRNA were xenografted subcutaneously into athymic mice.</s><s>The specificity of the used siRNA was previously defined. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>HDAC8 depletion delayed tumor growth with a significant difference in tumor weight at day 9 after tumor transplantation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>).</s><s>HDAC8 was clearly depleted at the beginning.</s><s>However, owing to the transient nature of the transfection, the expression of HDAC8 increased again over time (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1D</ref>).</s><s>This result supported our hypothesis to use HDAC8 as a neuroblastoma drug target in vivo.</s></p><p><s>HDAC8-selective inhibitors display antineuroblastoma activity in vitro.</s><s>To inhibit specifically HDAC8 activity in neuroblastoma, we decided to use and compare two structurally divergent HDAC8 inhibitors, which are both reported to be selective for HDAC8: Compound 2 (Cpd2; 1naphthohydroxamic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> ) and PCI-34051. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref></s><s>For PCI--34051, two more stable variants exist: PCI-48000 and PCI-48012.</s><s>A comparison of the compounds and concentrations applied is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>.</s><s>We confirmed HDAC8 selectivity of Cpd2 and PCI-34051 using in vitro cell-free biochemical assays of all classical HDACs 1-11 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This determined HDAC6 and HDAC1 as potential off-target HDACs at concentrations above 75 ŒºM for Cpd2 and above 30 ŒºM for PCI-34051.</s><s>Thus, acetylation levels of HDAC6 or HDAC1 substrates can be used as an indicator for unselective HDAC family inhibition for the two HDAC8-selective compounds.</s><s>We therefore established working concentrations for the selective use of the inhibitors on neuroblastoma cells at 40 ŒºM for Cpd2 and 4 ŒºM for PCI-34051 and PCI-48000.</s><s>We confirmed the HDAC8-selective inhibition under these conditions: (i) increase in whole lysine acetylation levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>), (ii) increase in acetylation level of HDAC8 impairs cell death and differentiation I Rettig et al the HDAC8 substrate core cohesion complex protein SMC3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>), (iii) absence of HDAC6 substrate acetylation (tubulin; <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>) and (iv) absence of HDAC1-3 substrate acetylation (histone 4; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>).</s><s>Treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitor TSA (trichostatin A), which was used as a control for unselective HDAC inhibition, resulted in a much stronger induction of global lysine acetylation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>This is in line with the higher amount of acetylated substrates as a consequence of inhibition of multiple HDACs.</s><s>As predicted, increasing concentrations of Cpd2 and PCI-34051, far above their IC 50 values, displayed HDAC6 off-target activity and induced tubulin acetylation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1d</ref>).</s><s>The treatment of a panel of MYCN-amplified as well as MYCN-single-copy neuroblastoma cell lines with HDAC8 inhibitors for 6 days significantly decreased cell numbers.</s><s>Of note, medulloblastoma cell lines were less susceptible compared with neuroblastoma cells.</s><s>Untransformed cells (infant fibroblasts and astrocytes) hardly responded to the treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1e</ref>).</s><s>So far, these results point towards HDAC8 as a promising and selective target for neuroblastoma treatment.</s></p><p><s>HDAC8-selective inhibitors display antineuroblastoma activity in vivo.</s><s>To determine the in vivo efficacy of HDAC8-selective inhibitors in neuroblastoma, we started to characterize the inhibitors for in vivo use.</s><s>We first determined toxicity profiles, maximum tolerable doses (MTDs) and plasma levels of the two HDAC8-selective inhibitors Cpd2 and PCI-48012 for application in mice in vivo.</s><s>We chose the latter compound as a more in vivo stable variant of PCI-48000 with improved pharmacokinetic properties (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>).</s><s>Both inhibitors were intraperitoneally injected into NMRI Foxn1 nude mice in increasing doses from 40 up to 400 mg/kg per day for 2 √ó 5 days.</s><s>Each dose was tested in a cohort of three animals.</s><s>Resulting MTDs were validated within cohorts of eight animals for each inhibitor.</s><s>Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were determined by monitoring body weight, where a reduction of ‚â• 20% from starting body weight indicated toxicity.</s><s>Additional experiments performed to check for toxicity included clinical chemistry and hematological blood parameters, as well as histological examination of a panel of organs for toxicity using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain after killing the animals.</s><s>As a reference, the blood of 12 untreated NMRI Foxn1 nude mice was analyzed.</s><s>In these studies, we determined the MTD for HDAC8 inhibitors Cpd2 at 50 mg/kg per day and for PCI-48012 at 40 mg/kg per day.</s><s>At these concentrations, neither body weight (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>) nor blood parameters were critically changed according to clinical toxicity criteria (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>DLTs of Cpd2 included weight loss and signs of liver toxicity, as evidenced by elevated plasma liver enzymes and detection of necrotic areas on histological liver examination.</s><s>DLTs of PCI-48012 included severe inflammation of the intestine at organ examination, but no noticeable changes in blood parameters.</s><s>Pharmacokinetic studies after intraperitoneal administration of the inhibitors identified the half-life of Cpd2 to be ~15 min, with a plasma peak concentration of ~30 ŒºM, matching the in vitro HDAC8 IC 50 of 34 ŒºM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>).</s><s>PCI-48012 has a half-life of ~1 h, with a plasma peak concentration of 8.24 ŒºM after administration of a single dose of 100 mg/kg, suggesting that the MTD of 40 mg/kg results in therapeutic plasma levels above the HDAC8 in vitro IC 50 , but still in the range of selectivity.</s><s>As a pharmacodynamic marker for HDAC8 inhibitory action in vivo, we analyzed lysine acetylation levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after intraperitoneal administration of Cpd2 and PCI-48012 at MTD concentrations (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>HDAC8 selectivity was further controlled by the absence of tubulin acetylation and absence of histone 4 acetylation in PBMC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>).</s><s>Vorinostat was used as a control for unselective HDAC inhibition.</s><s>The MTD of vorinostat in mice (150 mg/kg per day) is well established and was taken from the published literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s>ext, we determined the in vivo efficacy of HDAC8-selective inhibition in neuroblastoma xenograft mouse models.</s><s>Because the pharmacokinetic studies revealed a relatively short half-life for Cpd2, we subsequently used PCI-48012 for treatment efficacy studies.</s><s>One week after tumor cell injection, mice established a palpable tumor mass and the animals were then randomly assigned to treatment and control cohorts.</s><s>Treatment with PCI-48012 significantly delayed tumor growth compared with solvent-treated control group.</s><s>Moreover, HDAC8-selective inhibition delayed neuroblastoma tumor growth more efficiently (BE(2)-C model; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>) or equally efficiently (IMR-32 model; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2e</ref>) compared with vorinostat treatment.</s><s>Whereas vorinostat treatment induced clear signs of toxicity, such as diarrhea and weight loss at the applied dose, HDAC8-selective inhibitor treatment was well tolerated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2f</ref>).</s><s>HDAC8-selective inhibition promotes differentiation, delays cell proliferation and induces cell death in vitro and in vivo.</s><s>We have previously demonstrated that HDAC8 depletion of neuroblastoma cells via siRNA transfections resulted in an upregulation of markers for differentiation (NEF and NTRK1) as well as G0/G1 cell cycle arrest with p21 WAF1/ CIP1 upregulation.</s><s>In line with our previous data, all three HDAC8 inhibitors induced morphological changes pointing towards neuronal differentiation, which was associated with an increase in neurofilament (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>) and TrkA protein expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>).</s><s>In addition, all HDAC8 inhibitors used delayed neuroblastoma population growth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>) and induced the cell-cycle inhibitor p21 WAF1/CIP1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, differentiation and proliferation disruption was followed by cell death (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Corresponding to these in vitro data, quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the dissected tumor material from the HDAC8-inhibitor-treated mice revealed an increase in neurofilament-positive tumors (7/12 = 58.3%)</s><s>compared with control groups (1/12 = 8.3%), and a significantly lower amount of cells positive for phosphorylated
