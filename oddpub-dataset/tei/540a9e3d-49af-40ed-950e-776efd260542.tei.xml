<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p><s>A challenge for coil-mounted cameras is the need to calibrate the position and orientation of the camera system relative to the MRI coordinate system, as defined by the imaging gradients.</s><s>This need arises because the camera's reference frame (where motion is measured) is not automatically aligned with the MRI scanner's reference frame (where motion correction is applied).</s><s>The process of determining the transformation between these two reference frames is typically termed 'crosscalibration', as described by <ref type="bibr">Zaitsev et al. in 2006 (12)</ref>.</s><s>In most systems described previously, performing an accurate cross-calibration has typically required at least 30 minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>If the camera system is moved relative to the gradient system of the MRI scanner, then either the camera needs to be returned to an identical position (not normally done in practice) or cross-calibration needs to be repeated.</s><s>This requirement has made head-coil-mounted systems difficult to deploy in a clinical setting.</s></p><p><s>Previous theoretical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> indicates that cross-calibration needs to be extremely accurate ('substantially below 1 mm and 1°') for optical prospective motion correction.</s><s>However, we have observed that even with suboptimal crosscalibration, due to errors of several millimeters in camera repositioning, excellent results can be obtained.</s><s>At first sight, this seems to contradict the earlier theoretical work, indicating the need for further investigation.</s></p><p><s>The primary goal of this work was to produce a rapid, accurate, cross-calibration system for optical tracking systems mounted on the head coil, allowing optical motion correction to be used clinically, without a drain on technologist time.</s><s>Two new methods -a rapid calibration method and a calibration adjustment methodare introduced here to achieve this goal.</s><s>A secondary goal was to establish practical guidelines concerning how precisely a camera that is moved must be repositioned and to reconcile this with previous theoretical work.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Camera hardware</head><p><s>The optical tracking system used in this work was a custom-built monochrome camera, with a resolution of 640 × 480 and a frame rate of 60 Hz.</s><s>It is used within the MRI bore to measure head motion by tracking a 'checkerboard' optical marker placed on the forehead of the subject.</s><s>In this work, the camera was mounted on a standard 8-channel head coil (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, right panel), which has an advantage over a bore-mounted configuration (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, left panel), since the patient table and coil can be moved without obscuring the camera's view of the head-mounted marker.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the challenge with this approach is that the original transformation, ‫܂‬ , between camera and scanner isocenter will change as the table moves (indicated by ‫′܂‬ in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>The development of a practical method to determine ‫܂‬ and ‫′܂‬ was the major goal of this work.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rapid Calibration Method: Calibration tool and software</head><p><s>To perform the cross-calibration procedure described in the following, we designed and constructed a 'calibration tool' (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>), comprising three wireless active markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> and an optical tracking marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>By rigidly coupling scannertrackable and camera-trackable markers, the calibration tool allows simultaneous tracking of the same applied motion in both the scanner and camera reference frames.</s><s>This features is exploited to rapidly calculate the cross-calibration transformation, ‫܂‬ .</s></p><p><s>The calibration tool is based on a plastic sphere mounted on a curved base.</s><s>This allows rotations to be performed approximately about the scanner isocenter.</s><s>Following the description in Ooi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> for in vivo imaging, the active markers are placed on the phantom such that their approximate geometric configuration is known.</s><s>However, the exact geometric relationship between the active markers and the optical marker is not known in advance and is never explicitly calculated.</s><s>The only requirement for the methods that follow is that the relationship is constant, i.e., that the calibration tool is rigid throughout the calibration process.</s></p><p><s>Simultaneous tracking of the calibration tool in both camera and scanner reference frames is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b and 2c</ref>, respectively.</s><s>A video frame of the calibration tool (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) shows the optical marker, which allows the calibration tool's position to be measured in the camera reference frame.</s><s>A tracking pulse sequence was created that measures the active marker positions, by applying projections in the x, y and z directions.</s><s>The reconstructed projection data contains peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), which are localized to determine the position of the markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> in the scanner reference frame.</s><s>A key difference to the sequence in Ooi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> is the omission of the volume spoiler gradients.</s><s>These are not necessary for the calibration phantom, since it contains no source of MR signal other than the samples within the markers.</s><s>In Ooi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, the spoiler gradients act to suppress signal from any 'large' object in the field of view, by generating multiple phase rolls across the object.</s><s>However, to a lesser extent, they also create non-negligible phase variation across the samples in</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p><s>Optionally, the above procedure can be repeated, while applying prospective motion correction to the tracking pulse sequence using the transformation matrix calculated after the first iteration.</s><s>This allows larger rotations to be applied to the calibration tool, without risk of peak overlap in the projections.</s><s>This could potentially lead to better conditioning of the final calculated transform by using a larger range of calibration tool motions.</s><s>It is also a useful quality assurance tool, since it tests that the real time scanner updates are working correctly.</s></p><p><s>The result of the cross-calibration procedure is a 4-by-4 homogeneous transformation matrix, ‫܂‬ .</s><s>This homogenous transformation matrix includes a 3by-3 rotation matrix, R, and a 3-by-1 translation vector v, i.e.,</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">‫܂‬ = R v (0 0 0) 1 ൨ ,</formula><p><s>where the translation vector, v, contains three components</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_1">‫ܞ‬ = ቈ x y z ,</formula><p><s>and where x, y, and z describe the shift from the origin of the MRI scanner coordinate system to the origin of the optical tracking coordinate system, and are defined according to the scanner's physical gradient axes.</s><s>For a patient lying headfirst supine, x corresponds to the patient left-right (LR) direction, y to the patient anterior-posterior (AP) direction, and z to the patient head-feet (HF) direction.</s></p><p><s>It is assumed that ‫܂‬ remains constant in all future experiments, except for the zcomponent in v, which is adjusted as described in the following.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Calibration Adjustment Method</head><p><s>For the coil-mounted setup shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, any movement of the patient table (and head coil) between patients or between scans invalidates ‫܂‬ as obtained using the rapid calibration method described above.</s><s>A calibration adjustment method is therefore employed to compensate ‫܂‬ for table motion, which is based on two assumptions: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>  where z' = z + (tz1 -tz0).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Repeatability experiment</head><p><s>To test the repeatability of the calibration method, the entire calibration process was performed 6 times on a single scanner (1.5 T, MR450w, GE Healthcare).</s></p><p><s>Between each calibration, the table was undocked and re-docked and the head coil and camera were removed and replaced.</s><s>This simulates the workflow in the hospital at our institution, where the table is typically removed between patient scans.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulations</head><p><s>Software was written in Matlab to simulate the effect of calibration errors in prospective motion correction.</s><s>The input data to the simulation includes four components: (i) A 3D model derived from the patient's (or any patient's) T1-weighted MRI data by straightforward surface rendering.</s><s>(ii) Recorded or simulated motion.</s><s>(iii) The camera position and orientation in the scanner.</s><s>(iv) Cross-calibration error terms for both translations and rotations.</s></p><p><s>The use of a 3D head model (i) makes the simulation more realistic than if the head was modeled as a sphere or ellipsoid.</s><s>The inclusion of arbitrary motion (ii) allows a patient scan to be 'repeated' in the simulator using real-world tracking data from the scan.</s><s>The camera position and orientation (iii) in the scanner bore is needed, since this influences tracking errors resulting from cross-calibration errors (iv).</s><s>Given fixed input data for (i)-(iii), it is then possible to allow cross-calibration errors (iv) to vary to produce plots showing the effect of these errors on motion correction performance.</s></p><p><s>To aid interpretation of the results, we define a new metric: the mean voxel displacement (MVD).</s><s>This allows motion occurring during an MRI scan to be quantified using a single parameter.</s><s>Similarly, the MVD metric can be used to indicate how much residual motion occurs due to cross-calibration errors when prospective motion correction is enabled.</s><s>The MVD is calculated by summing the absolute vector displacement for all points (representing voxels) in the 3D head model between each pair of consecutive poses and then dividing by the number of points.</s><s>Specifically,</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p><s>where q and p represent all points in the head model for two poses q and p, respectively, and n is the total number of points in the model.</s><s>The physical interpretation of Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>) is the mean distance travelled by a voxel in the head model during the change in pose from p to q.</s><s>The voxel size in the model is arbitrary and has little effect on the final value; here we used an isotropic resolution of 15 mm, to keep the number of points low and computation time short.</s><s>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref> illustrates the calculation of the MVD for a single time point.</s><s>The MVD can be trivially extended to the entire scan duration by summing the mean voxel displacement over all pairs of consecutive poses (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>).</s><s>In this way, a measure of the total amount of motion occurring during the scan is obtained (nearly 400 mm in the example shown).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mechanical tolerance determination</head><p><s>The simulator and MVD metric were used to determine the acceptable mechanical tolerance for repositioning of the head coil and camera.</s><s>Since any calibration error results in motion correction errors, to answer this question it was necessary to define a threshold for 'acceptable' motion correction.</s><s>A reduction in MVD of 90% was chosen as the threshold and used in the simulations.</s><s>The choice of 90% is arbitrary, but in our experience, it represents a significant (and potentially clinically important) reduction in motion artifacts in the final MR images.</s><s>The fixed input data for the mechanical tolerance simulation comprised:</s></p><p><s>(i) A 3D head model derived from a structural scan (sagittal 3D IR-SPGR, 27 cm FOV, 256 x 256 matrix size, 1.2mm slice thickness) of a volunteer.</s><s>(ii) Simulated 'worst-case' motion consisting of consecutive sinusoidal rotations about each axis.</s><s>For each axis, the amplitude was set at the maximum show by Ooi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref> to be physically reasonable within an 8channel head coil.</s><s>(iii) The camera position and orientation in the scanner, as obtained by calibrating the system in its normal position on an 8-channel head coil.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vivo experiments</head><p><s>At the time of writing, the methods described here have been used to calibrate the optical tracking system on nine different 1.5 T / 3 T MR scanners and two 3T PET/MR scanners for IRB-approved studies of patients and volunteers.</s><s>These results will be reported elsewhere.</s><s>For testing and demonstrating the calibration algorithm, here we report a small subset of these results, namely an experiment performed on two subjects, who were instructed to make large voluntary motions, which inherently tests the quality of cross-calibration.</s></p><p><s>This experiment was performed on a 3 T MR750 scanner (GE Healthcare).</s><s>Two outpatient volunteers with known pathology were imaged: a male with a vessel abnormality (Subject 1), and a female with a pituitary microadenoma (Subject 2).</s><s>Subject 1 was imaged using a 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA sequence.</s><s>Subject 2 was imaged using a 2D sagittal T2-weighted FSE sequence (echo train length: 16, TE: 101 ms, TR: 4942 ms, slice thickness: 2 mm).</s><s>Both subjects were instructed to move continuously during two scans: one with prospective correction off and one with prospective correction on.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p><s>Finally, we performed an experiment on a volunteer to provide an in vivo illustration of the meaning of the mechanical tolerance results derived in this manuscript.</s><s>In this experiment, we replicated the effect of potential cross calibration errors in the z-direction by deliberately introducing errors (denoted ez) into the cross-calibration transform.</s><s>The z-direction was chosen, because that is the degree of freedom that is the least tightly constrained, due to motion of the patient table in that direction.</s></p><p><s>Prior to the experiment, the volunteer practiced a motion trajectory involving tracing out a 'figure of eight' with their nose, a motion pattern proposed by Herbst et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> for an illustration).</s><s>This motion was repeated continuously during all the following imaging experiments, with a period of approximately 15 s.</s><s>The volunteer was imaged six times using an axial IR-FSPGR BRAVO acquisition (TE: 3.2 ms, TR: 9.7 ms, TI: 450 ms, matrix size: 256 x 256, slice thickness: 1.2 mm), while performing the motion continuously.</s><s>The six acquisitions were identical, other than the type of motion correction used: 1) no correction, 2) correction with no extra errors, 3-6) correction with ez values of 3 mm, 6 mm, 12 mm and 24 mm, respectively.</s><s>Setting ez equal to 3 mm, for example, is equivalent to a 3 mm error in knowledge of the camera's position along the z-axis of the MRI scanner.</s><s>In practice, such an error could be caused by errors in the table position encoder or by errors in the cross-calibration algorithm itself.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>There are many practical requirements for effective optical prospective motion correction in MRI.</s><s>These include sufficient tracking precision and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25)</ref>, robust marker fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref>, high frame rate and low latency <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>, good line of sight to the subject, a sufficiently accurate cross-calibration, and the ability to move the patient table as normal.</s><s>The primary goal of this work was to address these final three requirements.</s></p><p><s>The combination of good line of site, accurate cross-calibration, and the ability to move the patient table has previously posed a major challenge.</s><s>Tracking systems mounted externally to the MRI scanner <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> or on the bore ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>) have achieved good cross-calibration accuracy; however, line-of-sight issues are then problematic.</s><s>Systems mounted on the head coil ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>) have achieved better line of sight, but the time required for patient-specific cross-calibration has been a concern for clinical deployment.</s><s>Table motion has been a major problem for all these systems, since it either risks blocking line of sight (for bore-mounted systems) or invalidating the cross-calibration (for coil-mounted systems).</s></p><p><s>In this work, we have addressed the line of sight issue by mounting the camera on the head coil.</s><s>We believe that this is the most practical approach for clinical deployment, particularly given the advent of head coils with a high channel count and therefore an enclosed design that further inhibits line of sight.</s><s>Additional advantages of mounting the camera on the head coil include use for eye tracking or physiological monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27)</ref>.</s><s>We have addressed the cross-calibration challenge by developing a new calibration method, based on wireless active markers.</s><s>This allows both accurate and fast calibration to be performed, with a one-time scan of less than 30 seconds.</s><s>Finally, table motion effects have been addressed using the built-in table position encoder to update the cross-calibration transformation.</s></p><p><s>The methods presented here allow optical motion correction to be applied during routine scanning.</s><s>The calibration step is done only once, after installation of the camera on the chosen head coil at each MRI scanner.</s><s>A possible step-by-step workflow for using this system on patents is then as follows:</s></p><p><s>1 The only steps requiring extra technologist input are thus (3) and ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>): attaching and removing the marker.</s><s>This is a relatively short procedure (&lt; 30 s), so we do not consider this to be a barrier to clinical practicability.</s><s>The relatively large tolerances</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Accepted Article</head><p><s>in camera repositioning mean that the calibration need never be repeated at the same MR scanner, because the head coil can be removed and replaced without introducing errors above these tolerances.</s><s>However, in our experience, it is necessary to repeat the calibration if the system is moved to a new MR scanner, because there are typically significant differences in the mechanical mounting configurations of head coils between different MR systems.</s></p><p><s>The secondary goal of this work was to gain a better understanding of the mechanical tolerance acceptable for repositioning the camera.</s><s>The simulation results shown indicate that good motion correction performance can be obtained despite cross-calibration errors of several millimeters in all degrees of freedom.</s><s>The discrepancy between this and the tighter tolerances given in Zahneisen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> occurs because here the threshold for 'acceptable' motion correction is a 90% reduction in voxel motion, whereas previous work attempts to keep residual artifacts below the noise floor, using motion of a worst-case voxel.</s><s>Thus, our results complement, rather than contradict previous work.</s><s>It is important to note that the MVD metric is highly specific to the analysis of calibration accuracy discussed in this work.</s><s>The MVD metric should not be used to attempt to predict motion artifact levels between different sequences or even between different scans using the same sequence.</s><s>In these cases, looking at the total voxel motion would be an oversimplification: the timing of motion relative to the k-space trajectory is also a critical factor, which would be ignored by the metric.</s><s>However, using the MVD metric for the analysis here has two advantages: it specifically quantifies the reduction in 'apparent motion' in a prospectively corrected sequence, and a practical motion reduction threshold can be set to make a substantial difference to any given exam, which is the end goal of prospective motion correction.</s></p><p><s>A limitation of this work is the assumption of linearity of both the MR scanner coordinate frame and the camera coordinate frame.</s><s>Both frames of reference have non-linear components: the camera coordinate system is affected by lens distortions and the MR coordinate system is distorted by gradient non-linearities.</s><s>These distortions could lead to minor calibration errors.</s><s>The effect of camera distortions is mitigated by the intrinsic camera calibration and calculation of radial and tangential distortion parameters, which seek to remove these distortions; however, the effect of MR coordinate system distortions is mitigated only by attempting to use the calibration tool as near as possible to the isocenter, where the gradients are relatively linear.</s><s>To further improve this method, it might be advisable to apply gradient non-linearity correction to the active marker tracking sequence.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the calibration method presented here is substantially easier to use and more time efficient than existing methods.</s><s>For practical applications, errors in camera repositioning of several millimeters do not prevent good optical motion correction results, which means that the table position encoder is accurate enough to perform recalibration.</s><s>These advances may facilitate the more widespread adoption of optical prospective motion correction in the clinic.</s></p></div>
