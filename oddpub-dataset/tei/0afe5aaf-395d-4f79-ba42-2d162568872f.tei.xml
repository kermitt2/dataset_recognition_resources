<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Actin Dynamics during Developmental Myelination</head><p><s>In Vivo Despite the importance of myelination for the normal function of the CNS, the cellular mechanisms that allow OL membranes to spirally wrap and compact around axons remain poorly understood.</s><s>Since eukaryotic cells change their shape and move by means of a dynamic actin cytoskeleton, we investigated how the OL cytoskeleton is organized and regulated during myelination.</s><s>We first examined the actin cytoskeleton in mature myelin in vivo, using phalloidin staining of actin filaments in P45 spinal cord sections.</s><s>We validated the specificity of phalloidin for actin filaments in tissue sections with the actin filament binding drug, jasplakinolide (Jasp), which blocks phalloidin staining in a dosedependent manner (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>Whereas actin filaments were highly enriched in gray matter, white matter tracts containing myelinated axons had comparatively low levels of actin filaments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Higher magnification confocal micrographs showed that the bulk of actin filaments in white matter was excluded from compact myelin (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B and 1C</ref>), similar to the PNS <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Trapp et al., 1989)</ref>.</s><s>In agreement with this observation, purified myelin fractions appeared devoid of actin protein by immunoblotting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We next quantified actin filaments and compact myelin in the developing dorsal white matter of the spinal cord during active myelination.</s><s>White matter actin filament levels peaked at the start of myelination (P10), but actin filament levels rapidly declined as myelin wrapping and compaction began (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s><s>To look more closely at actin in nascent myelin sheaths, we costained spinal cord sections for actin filaments and MBP at the onset of myelination (P5).</s><s>MBP protein level is proportional to the degree of CNS myelin wrapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shine et al., 1992)</ref>, so immunostaining with a validated MBP antibody (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>) indicates the maturity of individual myelin sheaths in tissue sections.</s><s>Immature myelin sheaths with low levels of MBP had high levels of actin filaments, whereas actin filament levels were dramatically reduced in more mature sheaths <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1F and 1G)</ref>, suggesting that actin filaments are disassembled in OLs during the latter stages of myelination.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Two Phases of Actin Cytoskeletal Dynamics during OL Differentiation</head><p><s>We next asked whether purified OLs in culture could be used to study the changes in the actin cytoskeleton during myelination that we observed in vivo.</s><s>We prospectively isolated OPCs from neonatal rats and induced their differentiation into OLs, fixed them at different stages of differentiation over 6 days of culture, and stained their actin cytoskeletons with phalloidin.</s><s>OLs undergo stereotyped morphological changes as they differentiate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>), extending numerous cellular processes to form an arborized morphology, then flattening out into myelin membrane sheets that are similar to ''unrolled <ref type="bibr">'' myelin (Movie S1 and Figure S2;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aggarwal et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Consistent with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wilson and Brophy, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Song et al., 2001)</ref>, we found that these early OL processes were highly enriched in actin filaments prior to MBP expression (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B-2D</ref>).</s><s>Using structured illumination superresolution microscopy we observed that these OL processes were composed of ordered arrays of actin filaments and were morphologically akin to neuronal growth cones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fox et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, inhibiting actin filament dynamics with latrunculin A (LatA) or Jasp during these early stages arrested OL process extension and arborization <ref type="bibr">(Movies S2 and S3)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As OLs matured further and began to express MBP, however, their actin cytoskeleton was almost completely disassembled, first in MBP+ compact myelin membrane regions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>) and then throughout the entire OL (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F and 2H</ref>).</s><s>Immunoblotting revealed that total cellular actin persisted throughout differentiation, so loss of actin filaments corresponded to their disassembly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>).</s><s>Thus, OLs in culture recapitulated the disassembly of actin filaments that we observed in developing myelin in vivo, even in the absence of neurons or a native CNS microenvironment.</s></p><p><s>Arp2/3-Mediated Actin Assembly Is Required for Myelin Initiation in the CNS Our characterization of the OL actin cytoskeleton in vivo and in culture suggests that myelination proceeds in two phases: first, dynamic actin assembly powers early steps of myelination and, second, the OL cytoskeleton is completely disassembled during the formation of mature, compact myelin.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we first explored the role of actin in the initial stage of axon ensheathment using OPC-neuron coculture assays.</s><s>When plated on dorsal root ganglion neuron (DRG) axons, differentiating OLs initially extended processes enriched in actin filaments, <ref type="bibr">(F and G)</ref> Confocal microscopy of developing P5 mouse spinal cord transverse sections, stained for MBP (red) and phalloidin (green).</s><s>(F) Arrows, early sheaths with low MBP intensity and high phalloidin intensity.</s><s>Arrowheads, more mature sheaths with high MBP intensity and low phalloidin.</s><s>(G) Quantification of individual P5 myelin sheaths showed that actin filament levels (phalloidin) decreased with increasing MBP intensity.</s><s>See also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>.</s><s>(legend continued on next page) but as they matured and developed MBP+ myelin internodes, the actin filaments disappeared, consistent with isolated OLs above (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>).</s><s>Inhibiting actin dynamics with LatA and Jasp blocked axon ensheathment in a dose-dependent manner and did so at concentrations that did not affect OL differentiation or viability (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To determine the contribution of actin assembly to myelination in vivo, we next addressed the role of Arp2/3, the major actin nucleation factor that assembles branched arrays of actin filaments in the lamellipodia of motile cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Fletcher and Mullins, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wu et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Our recent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of CNS glia indicates that all seven subunits of Arp2/3 are expressed by myelinating OLs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Zhang et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Both endogenous ArpC1 and GFP-Arp3 localized to actin-filament-rich cell edge as well as the OL cell body (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B and S3</ref>).</s><s>Pharmacological inhibition of Arp2/3 by CK-666 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Nolen et al., 2009)</ref> induced a dose-dependent loss of OL actin filaments, suggesting that Arp2/3 plays a major role in constructing the OL cytoskeleton during the early phase of myelination (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C and S3</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with this finding, CK-666 significantly inhibited OL ensheathment of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in myelinating cocultures, whereas the inactive control compound CK-689 had only a mild effect at the highest concentration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>).</s><s>In isolated OLs CK-666 strongly inhibited the formation of actin-filament-rich growth cones, process outgrowth, and branching (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>CK-666 also mildly inhibited proliferation of OPCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>).</s><s>These results suggested that Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly is required in early stages of OL differentiation and the initiation of myelination.</s></p><p><s>To determine if Arp2/3 is required for myelination in vivo, we conditionally deleted the essential subunit ArpC3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Yae et al., 2006)</ref> using a floxed allele <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kim et al., 2013)</ref> and several orthogonal Cre lines that function in the OL lineage.</s><s>We first used CNP-Cre <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lappe-Siefke et al., 2003)</ref>, which is expressed by early OLs at the start of myelination.</s><s>ArpC3 Flox/Flox ;

cytoskeletons (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1, 2, and 5</ref>).</s><s>Together, our data indicate that actin disassembly is essential for myelin wrapping, which, contrary to expectations, does not require Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly.</s></p><p><s>How is this dramatic disassembly of the OL cytoskeleton regulated?</s><s>Actin disassembly factors like gelsolin and cofilin

Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly like in a lamellipodium.</s><s>As in blebbing motility, OL actin disassembly needs to be spatially regulated, as unrestricted actin disassembly (by Arp2/3 ablation or
