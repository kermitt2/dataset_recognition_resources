NM_014008.4;</s><s>c.219A4G/p.(Thr17Ala) in the CCDC22 gene was previously shown to be a cause of syndromic XLID (OMIM 300859) in a large family with six affected males. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>This study did not specifically describe the phenotype of the affected individuals as RSS/3C syndrome; however, it provided clinical data according to which the phenotype overlaps with RSS/3C syndrome and includes: presence of ID, Dandy-Walker malformation, cerebellar  hypoplasia, cardiac defects (atrial septum defect, patent ductus arteriosus, VSD, hypoplastic right pulmonary artery), specific facial features (hypertelorism, beaked nose and broad nasal tip, ear abnormalities, high arched palate), as well as various limb anomalies (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>In addition, two individuals were reported to show signs of ectodermal dysplasia, namely aplasia cutis and dental abnormalities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>A series of other variants in CCDC22 was recently described in patients with non-syndromic XLID. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>These included the following missense variants: p.(Thr30Ala), p.(Arg128Gln), p.(Glu238Lys), p.(Arg321Trp), all localized in the N-terminal and mid part of the protein.</s><s>Unfortunately no clinical data of the individuals affected with these variants were provided.</s><s>Whereas the previously mentioned variant p.(Thr17Ala) affected the interaction with COMMD1, none of the other variants disturbed this binding when tested in LCLs or after expression in HEK293 cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>evertheless, this study concluded that CCDC22 is required for the ubiquitination and subsequent turnover of IkB proteins, which is dependent on its interactions with COMMD proteins.</s><s>As an additional evidence for altered NF-kB signaling, the signs of ectodermal dysplasia observed in a minority of patients were presented.</s><s>Ectodermal dysplasia is known to result from of IkB-a variants that alter its degradation or variants in the ectodysplasin pathway, a TNF-related signaling cascade that is involved in ectodermal development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s>he two patients described here show a broad phenotypic overlap with RSS/3C syndrome described in the literature.</s><s>In addition to ID, both displayed Dandy-Walker malformation, VSD, hand and foot anomalies (camptodactyly, clinodactyly, reduced distal creases of fingers, hypoplastic finger nails, and overriding toes), and facial dysmorphism.</s><s>These two probands show a hemizygous variant in the CCDC22 gene that is localized to the C-terminally located coiled-coil domain.</s><s>Although this variant can potentially have different effects on the protein function and partner protein interactions than the N-terminally localized p.(Thr17Ala) variant, the observed phenotypic features in both families are strikingly similar and consistent with the diagnosis of RSS/3C syndrome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>However, it should be noted that the short stature and relative large head circumference are not mentioned for the individuals carrying the CCDC22 variant p.(Thr17Ala).</s></p><p><s>In the light of the recent report about strumpellin intronic variants (c.3335 þ 2T4A, c.3335 þ 4C4A and c.3335 þ 8A4G) being causal to a form of RSS/3C syndrome, 2 it is interesting to note that CCDC22 was shown to interact with FAM21, a subunit of the WASH complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s>Apart from ID, phenotypic overlap in both patient groups consists of the same pattern of cerebellar and cardiac as well as hand and foot anomalies (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>However, facial dysmorphisms in both groups are different.</s><s>Whereas individuals with homozygous KIAA0196 sequence variants show macrocephaly, down slanting palpebral fissures, and low set ears, the patients reported here present with different facial features, for example, occipitofrontal circumference in the upper normal range, upslanting palpebral fissures, and normal appearing ears (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a-d</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, the affected individuals of the family reported here display postnatal short stature in contrast to normal growth in the affected families carrying the homozygous sequence variants of the KIAA0196 gene.</s><s>Nevertheless, it seems likely that variants in CCDC22 affect the same molecular machinery as variants in strumpellin.</s><s>Our observation that WASH1 expression level is increased in the CCDC22-mutant LCL cells supports the notion of the possible link between CCDC22 and WASH complex function.</s></p><p><s>One remaining question is how two missense variants (p.(Thr17Ala) and p.(Tyr557Cys)) in two very distant regions of the CCDC22 protein lead to such closely related phenotypes.</s><s>As indicated by our immunoblot analysis, CCDC22-Y557C shows significantly reduced protein stability in LCLs from patients, which is likely caused by a premature or accelerated degradation of mutant protein, provoked by aberrations of its conformation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s>Likewise, the c.219 A4G change leading to the very mild exchange p.(Thr17Ala) entails a splice defect, which is not unlikely to also lead to reduced levels of the wild-type protein.</s><s>Unfortunately, no protein expression was investigated in this previous study.</s><s>Another finding supporting this hypothesis is the comparable vesicular pattern of wild-type and mutated CCDC22 after transient expression, which, however, does not preclude functional changes independent of intracellular sorting events.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we show that CCDC22 variants, leading to at least partial loss of the protein, are associated with ID, cerebellar anomalies, cardiac defects, facial dysmorphism, as well as hand and foot anomalies.</s><s>Our findings widen the phenotypic as well as the genotypic spectra of syndromic XLID caused by variants in CCDC22.</s><s>Together with previous reports this suggests that the clinical spectrum associated with CCDC22 variants can range from syndromic manifestations similar to RSS/3C syndrome to non-syndromic ID.</s><s>Given the marked clinical variability of RSS/3C syndrome and the heterogeneous etiology, we suggest to collectively call this group of conditions WASHopathies.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Facial photographs of patient 1 (a, b) and
