<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>High yield synthesis of vitamin E modified PLGA nanoparticles.</s><s>PLGA nanoparticle was prepared using acid terminated PLGA (molecular weight â 17000 Da) and 50:50 lactide to glycolide ratio.</s><s>This configuration was chosen due to its potential for rapid breaking down into lactic and glycolic acid which are metabolized in the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> .</s><s>PLGA nanoparticles were prepared by an emulsion-solvent evaporation method using antibacterial and antifungal agent d-Î±-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS, an FDA-approved vitamin E modified emulsifier) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, the use of TPGS drastically increased the yield of nanoshells to almost 100% when compared to our earlier attempt using emulsifier poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) giving a &lt;10% yield.</s><s>Hydrodynamic diameter determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) was ~142.2 nm and size determined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) found to be ~100 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Surface functionalization with cationic polymer.</s><s>PLGA nanoparticle (zeta potential â25.03 Â± 1.10 mV) surface was functionalized with amine groups using glycol chitosan (GCHT) for the attachment of negatively charged gold seeds via electrostatic force <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> .</s><s>GCHT coating on the particle was confirmed as the zeta potential changed from â25.03 Â± 1.10 mV to +36.35 Â± 1.55 mV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Further, stretching of the amide bond of GCHT at 1626 cm â1 was present and also the intensity of C = O stretching due to PLGA ester at 1756 cm â1 was found to be less intense than pure PLGA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3a</ref>).</s><s>Both chitosan and glycol chitosan were used for rendering positive charge over PLGA nanoparticles.</s><s>The usage of chitosan resulted in the formation of about 200 nm sized nanoparticles, which we suspect due to the requirement of acidic pH for the formulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1c</ref>).</s><s>While in case of GCHT, the size obtained is about 120 nm (Figs 2a, 3b and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1b</ref>).</s><s>GCHT was also preferred over the other cationic polymers because of its water soluble nature at neutral pH.</s><s>In addition to this, the ability of GCHT to generate small sized PLGA nanoparticles also potentiate enhanced X-ray attenuation for imaging, and enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Highly stable as well disintegrable gold shell formation and tuning in NIR region.</s><s>PLGA nanoparticles combined with GCHT exposed the positively charged amine groups, thus facilitating attachment of negatively charged gold seeds.</s><s>Gold seeds were prepared by the reduction of chloroauric acid with tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) which resulted in the formation of ~3 nm size seeds having zeta potential â12 Â± 1.84 mV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1d</ref>).</s><s>Seeds were then attached to the amine group of GCHT via co-ordinate bonding and enhanced through electrostatic force at pH 6.5.</s><s>Gold seeds acted as nucleation center in the formation of a thin layer of gold nanoparticles over the PLGA core with the help of gold hydroxide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Toco-Photoxil formed using THPC was found to be more stable as compared to the citrate method of gold coating <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> and its zeta potential was determined to be â31.82</s><s>Â± 1.62 mV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>Gold coating was confirmed using transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>), as well as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Further, to determine the presence as well as nature of gold coating, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed.</s><s>In comparative spectral analysis, the peaks of gold (centers around 83-90 eV) were explicitly observed in Toco-Photoxil with respect to the positive (e.g.</s><s>chloroauric acid) and negative (e.g.</s><s>PLGA NPs) control (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2a</ref>).</s><s>The in between steps of gold reduction during the shell formation was also investigated.</s><s>It was observed that peaks of gold shifted to lower energy as the reduction steps preceded.</s><s>In chloroauric acid, the peaks of gold found to be centered around 90, 86 and 83 eV while in Toco-Photoxil peaks shifted to lower energy i.e. 87 and 83 eV.</s><s>The gold seeds attached with PLGA NPs (intermediary sample) show the shift in peaks in between of chloroauric acid and Toco-Photoxil, indicating ex-situ (step-wise) nature of gold coating (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2b</ref>).</s><s>The surface of Toco-Photoxil was further analyzed for the presence and percentage composition of other elements.</s><s>In the survey spectrum, the percentage composition of Au, C, O and N were found to be in the ratio of 70.96, 12.81, 15.60, and 0.63 respectively, which is also concordant with the EDAX analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2c-f</ref>).</s><s>The hydrodynamic diameter of Toco-Photoxil was determined to be ~155 nm and size determined by SEM and TEM was ~130 nm (Figs 2a, 3b, and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1e</ref>).</s><s>The meticulous removal of excess gold seeds was critical, which otherwise grow into gold nanoparticles.</s><s>The gold layer formation over the PLGA

might be due to this same fact.</s><s>Although, we have no conclusive experimental evidence at this point, IR780-FA moiety detachment from the Toco-Photoxil in the acidic environment of tumor bed might be another reason.</s></p><p><s>Computed Tomography (CT) has revolutionized the field of radiological imaging by providing 3D tomographic information.</s><s>However, as accuracy outcome of X-ray and CT imaging in patients with tumor in thorax and abdomen region is often compromised due to breathing, cardiac and gastrointestinal tract movement, a precise delineation is required to spare normal tissues from the tumor tissue.</s><s>Toward this, various techniques, such as 4-D CT or respiration-co-related CT are under development to compensate such artifacts and therefore these techniques are found to be viable and clinically effective tool for assessing the exact tumor mass, position and shape during the patient respiration cycle.</s><s>Toco-Photoxil embedded phantoms shows comparative contrast to the iodine based contrast agent Omnipaque at 5 times less concentration due to high X-ray attenuation power.</s><s>The further image processing helped in visualizing the internal anatomy of the phantom as well as distribution of Toco-Photoxil.</s><s>At this point, we envisage that it will help in imaging directed therapy and thus easily modulating the dosage of therapeutic agent as per the patient's health recovery.</s></p><p><s>In summary, using seed-mediated ex-situ method of gold coating has helped in providing better stability responsible for long circulation life within body and ultimately helped in enhanced EPR mediated accumulation from systemic delivery.</s><s>In comparison to our earlier product, LiposAu, which showed almost no EPR mediated accumulation, Toco-Photoxil shows the clear sign of success overcoming the barrier of intra-tumoral material delivery dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> .</s><s>Further, to prevent accumulation of metallic gold nanoparticles in the body, which may be seen as a legitimate health concern for clinical application, we have ensured disintegration especially in in vivo setting and thus maximum clearance of the metal particles within a short period.</s><s>Based on the evidences gathered during this study, the space between the gold seeds seems to be more pronounced after photothermal therapy, and thus allowing the hydrolytic enzymes to act on the polymer core which further underpins the disintegration ability of Toco-Photoxil.</s><s>With detailed calculations of the photothermal conversion efficiency of the materials developed during this study, striking results clearly demonstrate the relevance of narrow range NIR absorbance for efficient PTT in a 3D setting.</s></p><p><s>Thus, application of such a simple form of nano-sized, hybrid material holds great promise towards the long stride of effective elimination or containment of solid tumor mass without causing any potential side effects.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure
