<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Workflow and graphical user interfaces of JuGex</head><p><s>The workflow of JuGex comprises four main steps.</s><s>First, using the GUI Configuration, the user selects the genes and two volumes of interest (VOIs), which should be compared with respect to expression differences (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</s><s>VOIs can be single JuBrain maps, a merge of JuBrain maps (neighboring or distant), AllenBrain labels (gyrally and sulcally defined), and VOIs from sMRI, respectively, fMRI findings (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2</head><p><s>JuGEx is an integrated framework of the AllenBrain and JuBrain atlases for statistical analysis of differential gene expression in the adult human brain.</s><s>The data of both atlases are based on postmortem brains that have been scanned by MRI and transformed to a common reference brain (MNI 152 ).</s><s>The upper row displays the positions of TSs (colored spheres) in three of six donor brains from AllenBrain.</s><s>The transcriptional expression has been quantified in these TSs using oligoprobes of Agilent microarrays.</s><s>The lower row shows an example of microstructural information quantified in the frontal pole areas Fp1 (blue) and Fp2 (red) in three of ten donor brains from the Jülich-Düsseldorf brain collection.</s><s>To combine the data from the two modalities (transcriptom and cytoarchitecture), probabilistic JuBrain maps are used as masks to filter the TS-specific expression information as starting point for subsequent statistical analysis of differential expression of genes (JuGEx column).</s><s>In the example of use (most right column), we investigated the expression patterns of 25 candidate genes for MDD in the lateral Fp1 (blue) and the medial Fp2 (red).</s><s>The cut outs are located at the frontal pole and display the left hemispheric part of area Fp1 and area Fp2.</s><s>Analyses were performed using a permuted n-way ANOVA.</s><s>Results show that TAC1 (upper panel, p = 0.0216) and MAOA (lower panel, p = 0.0292) are significantly stronger expressed in tissue samples of Fp2 (spheres) than in those of Fp1 (crosses).</s><s>The level of mRNA expression is indicated by a gradient running from orange (lower expression) to green (higher expression)</s></p><p><s>The first version of JuGex only offers individual JuBrain maps and AllenBrain labels in the MNI 152 space.</s><s>To merge and register any other VOI to this reference space, we ask the user to use established imaging tools before uploading it to JuGex.</s><s>Map thresholds that determine VOI sizes can be selected between 10-100%;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>JuGex links the two atlas systems of AllenBrain and JuBrain.</s><s>Here, we have demonstrated that JuGEx is a valuable novel tool for analysis of differential gene expression in conjunction with precise topographical information on a sound microstructural basis.</s></p><p><s>In the example of use, we identified two differentially expressed genes, each showing an upregulation in Fp2 compared to Fp1.</s><s>TAC1 (tachykinin precursor 1) maps to chromosome 7q21.3.</s><s>The gene locus generates neurokinin 1 (alias substance P), neurokinin A, neuropeptide K, and neuropeptide gamma.</s><s>Tachykinins are hormones that mediate a variety of physiological functions in the body by binding to their receptors.</s><s>In the brain, the tachykinin system is involved in the excitation of neurons and induction of behavioral responses.</s><s>MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) is located on chromosome Xp11.3.</s><s>The enzyme plays a key role in the degradation of monoaminergic neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.</s><s>In models of depression-related behavior, mice with a homozygous deletion of tac1 (tac1 −/− ) were more active than wildtype mice, i.e., they behaved like wildtype mice under medication with an antidepressant, as reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bilkei-Gorzo and Zimmer (2005)</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, tac −/− mutants behave similiar to maoa −/− mutants.</s><s>Therefore, the tachykinin system is under consideration as promising drug target, while the pharmacological blockade of the catabolic MAOA enzyme has already been established for the therapy of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bilkei-Gorzo and Zimmer 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There are only a few studies that have investigated expression of TAC1 in human brains <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Guilloux et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Malki et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>One study reported a significantly lower expression of TAC1 in the frontal pole of MDD patients without separating this effect between its medial and lateral areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Malki et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>One can therefore assume that the higher TAC1 expression in controls was mainly driven by transcript molecules in the medial Fp2.</s><s>This hypothesis may help to design molecular genetic assays for validation in independent samples of postmortem tissue in the wet lab, for instance, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction targeting TAC1 transcripts.</s><s>MAOA expression has not been investigated specifically in the frontal pole but its contribution to the MDD pathogenesis has been investigated in numerous publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Meyer et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lung et al. 2011</ref>).</s><s>Especially Fp2, in which MAOA expression was higher compared to Fp1, is discussed as being a genetically modulated regulatory area for emotional stimulation and social behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Buckholtz et al. 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, a length-polymorphism in the MAOA promoter is associated with the degree of functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, a macroanatomical label that includes Fp2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Buckholtz et al. 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>It is important to keep in mind that the gene expression data derive from tissue samples and reflect the region-specific composition of neuronal, glial, and endothelial cell types.</s><s>Therefore, we cannot exclude that the reported expression differences between Fp1 and Fp2 are influenced by normal differences in cell-type proportions.</s><s>This means that the results cannot provide evidence on a cellular level, but they can be taken as a starting point for follow-up investigations using wet lab methods.</s><s>Together with the Fp2-specific gray matter atrophy in the left hemisphere of MDD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bludau et al. 2016)</ref>, the differential expression of TAC1 and MAOA between Fp2 and Fp1 provides a further argument to include Fp2 as a node in the dysfunctional network of MDD.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the methodological robustness and the biological specificity of our findings, we performed two control analyses and took a closer look at the probes of the MDD genes.</s><s>Neither the genes of a random selection nor the genes of body coloration achieved a single significant result.</s><s>Both negative results strongly suggest that knowledge about genes, MDD, and brain regions plays an important role for the outcome of our study.</s><s>Additionally, the 13 probes of TAC1 and the 31 probes of MAOA probes showed comparable expression levels indicating stable measurements which are not driven by outliers (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, MDD genes with a smaller, the same, or a larger number of probes do not yield a significant result per se: SST encoding the peptide hormone somatostatin (4 probes), HTR1D encoding a serotonin receptor (13 probes), or CNR1 encoding a cannabinoid receptor (89 probes).</s><s>Of note, CNR1 belongs to the genes with the largest numbers of probes among the AllenBrain genes.</s><s>Overall, we conclude that our findings for MAOA and TAC1 are not affected by systematic bias.</s></p><p><s>The strength of JuGex is an easy and rapid way of testing region-specific hypothesis and/or to generate new hypotheses for wet lab experiments.</s><s>However, it cannot provide specific evidence on a cellular level since the investigated TSs consist of multiple cell types.</s><s>Our workflow allows designing investigations either from a genetic perspective (candidate genes) or from an anatomical point of view (probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps) in a common reference space.</s><s>The application shows the capability of JuGEx to identify differentially expressed genes in structurally and functionally specialized tissues (areas Fp1/Fp2) as a prerequisite to understand the biological processes involved in brain function and dysfunction.</s><s>Moreover, the cytoarchitectonic maps of JuBrain atlas in the format of the MNI 152 reference brain represent a hub for integrating other
