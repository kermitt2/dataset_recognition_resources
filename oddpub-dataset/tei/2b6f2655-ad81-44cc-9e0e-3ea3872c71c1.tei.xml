<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>We detected a novel role of MALT1 in the biology of MCL.</s><s>A substantial fraction of MCLs exhibit constitutive MALT1 activity, and these MCLs are addicted to MALT1 function.</s><s>In contrast, some MCLs do not show constitutive MALT1 proteolytic activity, and these lymphomas do not depend on MALT1.</s><s>Thus, our results indicate that MCLs can be divided into 2 distinct subgroups based on their MALT1 activation status.</s></p><p><s>MALT1 activity seems to be caused by constitutive BCR signaling.</s><s>Recent work showed that activity of BCR signaling is correlated with increased MCL proliferation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12</ref></s><s>It seems conceivable that this could be caused by MALT1-induced upregulation of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC. MYC is crucial for the regulation of cell proliferation. <ref type="bibr">40</ref></s><s>In line with this, pharmacologic MALT1 inhibition or shRNA-mediated MYC knockdown significantly decreased MCL proliferation.</s><s>Moreover, Ki-67 expression as a marker for cell proliferation was significantly higher in primary MCL samples with MYC expression.</s><s>MYC expression was detectable in more than 55% of primary MCLs, indicating that MYC is frequently expressed in MCL.</s><s>In our series of primary samples, common genetic aberrations such as MYC locus translocations or high-level amplifications that can cause upregulation of MYC were extremely rare, confirming the results of previous studies. <ref type="bibr">41,</ref><ref type="bibr">42</ref></s><s>However, given that MYC expression and MALT1 activation status did not correlate in all cell lines, additional molecular mechanisms regulate MYC expression in MCL besides MALT1 activity.</s></p><p><s>Recent work in chronic lymphocytic leukemia has linked BCR signaling to upregulation of MYC expression, as antiimmunoglobulin M-induced BCR signaling increased translation of MYC mRNA in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. <ref type="bibr">43</ref></s><s>However, the exact molecular mechanisms how BCR signaling and MYC expression are linked were not elucidated.</s><s>Our data using primary splenocytes suggest that MALT1-driven MYC expression is not restricted to MCL, but seems to be a common mechanism of MYC regulation.</s><s>MALT1 seems to regulate MYC expression through different mechanisms.</s><s>We detected a very moderate MYC downregulation on mRNA levels following MALT1 knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of MALT1.</s><s>However, the predominant mechanism of MYC regulation involves control of MYC stability.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, our gene expression data following MALT1 inhibition failed to show downregulation of previously identified NF-kB gene sets, including signatures defined in MCL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">12</ref> This finding is surprising given the role of MALT1 in activating NF-kB signaling.</s><s>The protease activity of MALT1 is dispensable for initial NF-kB activation and instead promotes NF-kB signaling through cleavage of the negative NF-kB regulators RelB and A20. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">44</ref></s><s>The mechanisms why downregulation of NF-kB was not detectable by our transcriptome analyses are unclear and should be addressed in future studies.</s></p><p><s>Finally, our work revealed that the MALT1-MYC network could be exploited therapeutically in MCL patients.</s><s>Despite improvements in therapy, MCL remains an incurable disease. 1 MALT1 inhibition was highly effective in all MALT1-activated models.</s><s>These data warrant future clinical trials with MALT1 inhibitors in MCL patients with constitutive MALT1 activity.</s><s>Moreover, MALT1 inhibition was able to overcome BTK C481S -induced ibrutinib resistance and might represent a novel therapeutic option for patients failing ibrutinib therapy.</s><s>Similarly, MYC inhibition was lethal to MYC expressing models.</s><s>These data suggest that MYC inhibition offers a promising target and a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome therapy resistance in MCL patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure2.</s><s>Activation of MALT1 is caused by constitutive BCR signaling in MCL.</s><s>(A) Western blot analysis of CD79A, CARD11, CYLD, RelB, and BCL10 following shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD79A and CARD11, respectively.</s><s>Cleavage of CYLD, RelB, and BCL10 was significantly downregulated following CD79A or CARD11 knockdown, respectively, in MALT1-activated cell lines (Jeko-1 and Rec-1), whereas none of these cleaved forms was detectable in MALT1-inactive cell lines (Maver-1 and Z-138) and the expression levels of the corresponding full-length forms were not affected.</s><s>(B) shRNA-mediated knockdown of CD79A and CARD11 was toxic to the MALT1activated cell lines Jeko-1 and Rec-1.</s><s>In contrast, the MALT1-inactive cell lines Maver-1 and Z-138 were unaffected by CD79A and CARD11 knockdown.A previously described, nontoxic shRNA against MSMO1 did not induce toxicity in any cell line.</s><s>Data are shown as means 6 standard deviations (SDs) of at least 3 independent experiments.</s><s>(C) Cell viability of MCL cell lines after incubation with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib.</s><s>Representative results from at least 3 independent replicates are shown.</s><s>Error bars indicate SDs.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
