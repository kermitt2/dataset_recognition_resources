<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p><s>Samples were collected in the course of several respiratory disease outbreaks that occurred at two different locations: in the Limbe Wildlife Center (LWC) situated in Cameroon, and in Taï National Park (TNP), Côte d'Ivoire.</s></p><p><s>The LWC is a wildlife rehabilitation project in which rescued great apes are kept in naturalistic enclosures.</s><s>Here, a total of five distinct outbreaks of respiratory disease occurred over a period of two years (2006/2007), in three separate chimpanzee groups (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>): group 1 consisted of 22 individuals (age &gt;5years), group 2 of 14 individuals between two and five years of age and group 3 consisted of four individuals of less than two years of age.</s><s>The chimpanzees showed varying clinical symptoms (coughing, serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, lethargy, inappetence) over the course of the outbreaks.</s><s>Symptoms indicative of lower respiratory tract infection, such as dyspnoea and wheezing sounds, were noted on auscultation of the lungs of 12 individuals.</s><s>Duration of the outbreaks ranged from several days up to nine weeks.</s><s>Morbidity ranged from 23 to 100% (with 100% in three of the five outbreaks; see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>During these outbreaks pharyngeal swabs from six chimpanzees were taken under anesthesia.</s><s>During one outbreak an infant chimpanzee (referred to as LWC infant) died, a necropsy was performed and tissue samples were taken.</s><s>Throughout the outbreaks, animals with severe symptoms were placed on antiobiotic therapy (see Supplementary Information).</s></p><p><s>In TNP, wild chimpanzees are habituated to the presence of human observers and individually known as a result of a project focusing on wild chimpanzee behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</s><s>Here, three chimpanzee communities (so called North, East and South community) are under observation.</s><s>In November 2009 the South community was affected by a respiratory disease outbreak.</s><s>Morbidity and mortality were high: 32/37 chimpanzees developed severe respiratory symptoms (including high frequency of heavy cough, lethargy, nasal discharge).</s><s>Four adults (&gt;15 years; hereinafter referred to as TNP adult 1-4) and two infants (0-5 years, referred to as TNP infant 1 and 2) were found shortly after death and necropsies were performed.</s><s>In addition, for one chimpanzee (adult) only one arm and the head was found due to scavenging.</s><s>Four infants were found dead but necropsies were not performed and three further adults disappeared in the course of the outbreak and are likely victims of the outbreak as well.</s><s>In total likely 8 adults and 6 infant chimpanzees died in this outbreak.</s><s>Twelve out of the 37 individuals who showed severe symptoms of respiratory disease were treated with Extencilline (Benzathine benzylpenicillin, Sanofi-Aventis France), a long acting antibiotic administered by remote injection.</s><s>Of these nine survived.</s></p><p><s>Histopathology.</s><s>Histopathological examination of lung tissue samples from TNP and LWC chimpanzees revealed a severe purulent bronchopneumonia as cause of disease.</s><s>The bronchoalveolar tissue was diffusely infiltrated with neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages.</s><s>Furthermore, all lung tissue samples collected during the TNP outbreak showed multinucleated cell syncytia, pointing towards an HRSV infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, gram-positive cocci could be demonstrated within the altered tissue giving evidence for a secondary bacterial infection.</s><s>In addition, the lung tissue of one animal (TNP adult 3) revealed signs of a lung mite infection (likely Pneumonyssus simicola).</s><s>The lung tissue from the LWC infant showed a multifocal to diffuse purulent bronchopneumonia with marginal alveolar histiocytosis.</s><s>The periodic acid schiff (PAS) reaction was negative for all samples excluding a fungal infection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular analysis.</head><p><s>All samples collected from the TNP and LWC outbreaks were analysed molecularly by screening PCR and tested positive for either HMPV-or HRSV-specific genes as well as for the lytA gene harboured by S. pneumoniae (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Phylogenetic analyses of generated paramyxovirus sequences revealed that both HRSV and HMPV sequences (Genbank accession no.</s><s>JX489496-JX489498) belonged to recent pandemic waves (see Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1-3</ref>).</s><s>Informing a relaxed molecular clock model with tip dates <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> we estimated that the LWC chimpanzee-infecting HMPV diverged from its closest human-infecting relatives in 2004 (95% highest posterior density: 2003-2004).</s><s>The date of divergence between the HRSV-A strain from TNP chimpanzees and humans was 2007 (95% highest posterior density: 2006-2008) and for HRSV-B strains infecting LWC chimpanzees and humans 2007 (95% highest posterior density: 2007) These results mirror findings from previous outbreaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> and emphasize the high incidence of anthropozoonotic transmission of human respiratory paramyxoviruses.</s></p><p><s>In order to gain new insights on the bacterial community present in the lung samples collected during the outbreak in TNP, we performed 16S rRNA PCR.</s><s>Characterization of the sequences using a BLAST search in GenBank indicated the presence of Streptococcus species in all samples analysed.</s><s>In addition, for one individual (TNP adult 3) Pasteurella (P.) multocida was also among the predominant BLAST hits.</s><s>P. multocida is a commensal in the upper respiratory tracts of many domestic and wild animal species worldwide and coinfection with P. multocida and S. pneumoniae among TNP chimpanzees has been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> .</s><s>In addition, for the samples from TNP adult 1, the BLAST search revealed Clostridium sp.</s><s>Since most species of the genus Clostridium are saprophytic, we conclude that this finding was due to the tissue samples being partly decayed.</s></p><p><s>Molecular analysis of the S. pneumoniae is considered separately in the next section.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenotypic and molecular characterisation of S. pneumoniae.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Here we provide the first evidence that S. pneumoniae can be transmitted and that the origin of this pathogen might be human.</s><s>S. pneumoniae has the potential to circulate over long periods of time in a given population (a finding supported by our data on the chimpanzee XENA) and may cause severe disease once an individual is weakened by further primary viral infections or through other circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> .</s><s>Given that adolescent female chimpanzees migrate to other communities and that other inter-troop encounters occur, the reported findings could have serious implications, not only in respect to the clinical outcome of individuals infected, but also for populations of wild chimpanzees <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> .</s><s>In addition, the risk of ex-captive chimps transmitting human S. pneumoniae into wild populations is a serious concern for reintroduction programs.</s></p><p><s>These results underline the importance of hygiene measures, as established in TNP and described in the new IUCN guidelines, in limiting the risk of pathogen transmission between humans and great apes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> .</s><s>Moreover these results underscore the importance of developing non-invasive sample collection methods to assess the risk of the spread of such pathogens to wild chimpanzee and other great ape communities.</s><s>We note that, characterisation of S. pneumoniae present in human communities in contact to or neighbouring wild great ape populations are needed to allow further conclusions regarding naturally occurring, and introduced, infections.</s><s>Given the availability of vaccines that provide protection against the serotypes most frequently associated with pneumococcal disease in humans, characterisation of the distribution of serotypes would be of great interest.</s><s>Such data will inform the design of vaccination campaigns targeting human-habituated great apes but also human populations in contact with wild great apes, providing enormous benefits to both human and wild animal health.</s></p></div>
