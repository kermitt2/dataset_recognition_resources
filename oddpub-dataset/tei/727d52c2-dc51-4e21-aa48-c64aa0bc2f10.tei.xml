<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Savannah River Site (SRS) located in Aiken, SC, functioned as a nuclear materials production facility for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), where metal-clad uranium (U) targets were used in the production of plutonium <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</s><s>From 1954 to 1982, SRS wastewater originating from the metal plating and fabrication processes was released directly into Tims Branch, a second-order stream.</s><s>Because of these activities, large quantities of U (depleted as well as naturally-occurring) was released and deposited into stream sediments and an abandoned farm pond-the Steeds Pond, that served as a natural settling basin along Tims Branch <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2]</ref>.</s><s>Although contaminant distribution is heterogeneous in the Steeds Pond sediments, U concentration is found upwards of 1000 mg/kg <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s>To gauge in-situ remediation (natural attenuation) and recommend appropriate strategies for the remediation of contaminated SRS ecosystems, it is necessary to obtain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms possessed by the native soil microbiota to resist metals and radionuclides.</s><s>In fact, microorganisms exposed to the contaminant stresses not only have the unparalleled ability to survive in radionuclide contaminated environments but also potentially reduce toxicity of U <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>.</s><s>For example, 90% of bacteria belonging to Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria were found to resist high uranium concentration of up to 4 mM from a uranium mining site in Domiastat, India <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Kulkarni et al. isolated two phosphatase producing bacteria-E.</s><s>coli and Deinococcus radiodurans, and showed that both grew in the presence of up to 20 mM uranium <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Evolutionary mechanisms that include bioreduction, biosorption, biomineralization, and bioaccumulation are utilized by environmental microbiota to persist in uraniferous niches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Among these mechanisms, U biomineralization has recently garnered significant interest because this bioremediative process entails formation of U(VI)phosphate minerals as a function of microbial enzymatic activities and consequently, U is sequestered as stable solid mineral phases within the environmental matrices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9]</ref>.</s><s>However, genomic mechanisms underpinning U transformation into the less-mobile and less-toxic forms, such as a U mineral, continue to remain understudied and hence unclear, especially for the SRS uraniferous soils.</s></p><p><s>Soil samples for this study were collected from site 101 located within the Tims Branch system.</s><s>At this site, U concentrations are typically present between 700-800 ppm <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>, which is a high concentration based on a previously reported criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the historical contamination of the SRS site presents with an opportunity to study genome-enabled mechanisms recruited by the SRS-native microorganisms facilitating their survival in co-contaminated environments.</s><s>In fact, the stress posed by environmental contaminants facilitate recruitment of genes by horizontal gene transfer mechanisms that enable the microbial cells to not only resist but also bioremediate the contaminants, mostly by the synthesis of proteins for cellular survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Some examples of such cellular and genomic-mechanisms include membrane-bound efflux pumps, presence of metal resistant genes, detoxification genes, and biosorption/bioaccumulation of the contaminant at or within the bacterial cell membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To further understand environmentally-relevant molecular mechanisms that underpin microbial survival in radionuclide and heavy metal-rich ecosystems, we recently isolated several bacterial strains in the presence of high uranium concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s><s>16S rRNA gene sequence based analysis revealed that the isolated strains mainly belonged to Burkholderia spp.</s><s>and Arthrobacter spp., these genera have been previously demonstrated to serve as bioindicators of environmental contamination as well as agents of bioremediation, especially U <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, Burkholderia spp., have also been shown by others to successfully thrive in habitats that pose extreme environmental stresses, including uranium-rich ecosystems.</s><s>For example, Burkholderia-like microorganisms comprised a significant proportion of the soil microbiota at the Integrated Field-Scale Subsurface Research Challenge Site (IFRC), Oak Ridge, Tennessee <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref> as well as Rifle, Colorado <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>.</s><s>The intrinsic ability of Burkholderiales to dominate uraniferous habitats is not entirely surprising, owing in part to their repertoire of metabolic abilities, attributed to the large, multi-replicon genome, conferring genome plasticity and metabolic versatility <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>, respectively.</s><s>Adding to this knowledge on Burkholderiales, our recent study also showed genome-enabled mechanisms possessed by another soil isolate-Burkholderia sp.</s><s>strain SRS-W-2-2016, that colonized the heavy metal-rich SRS soil habitat <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s><s>From these studies, it was evident that Burkholderia spp.</s><s>recruited a suite of genomic traits to facilitate survival in radionuclide and metal-contaminated habitats.</s><s>Such traits included several gene homologues previously demonstrated to render resistance against heavy metals and radionuclides, including a suite of substrate-binding proteins, permeases, transport regulators, and efflux pumps.</s><s>These likely work in concert to potentially detoxify toxic metals and thus facilitate the natural attenuation of contaminants within the SRS-impacted ecosystem.</s><s>Another interesting genomic trait that our previous study identified in the Burkholderia sp.</s><s>strain SRS-W-2-2016 was the presence of several genomic islands (GEIs).</s><s>Notably, bacterial genomes not only consist of the "core" set of genes that provide for essential metabolic functions but can also harbor genes acquired from the bacterium's native environment via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms.</s><s>These "foreign" genes, typically occurring as orthologous genomic blocks, called genomic islands <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref>, can provide several beneficial traits to the host bacterium, including environmental adaptations and genomic plasticity.</s><s>In fact, GEIs have been functionally classified into the following four broad categories: pathogenicity islands (PAIs), harboring virulence genes; metabolic islands (MIs), genes that code for secondary metabolite biosynthesis; resistance islands (RIs), genes that typically provide resistance against antibiotics; and symbiotic islands (SIs), those genes that facilitate symbiotic associations of the host with other micro-and macroorganisms, respectively.</s><s>Thus, genome-wide mining of environmentally relevant microorganisms (e.g., Burkholderiales), can provide a broader understanding on the basis of metal-Burkholderia interactions, which can form the basis of targeted management of desirable microbial traits, including bioremediation, resulting in better stewardship of nuclear-legacy contaminated environments.</s></p><p><s>Note, however that, to obtain a holistic understanding at the cellular level of bacteria, against uranium, analysis that combines the genomics and proteomics dataset, termed as proteogenomics, can be a very powerful approach.</s><s>Such an approach has the ability to provide a unique peek into the uranium-microbe interaction(s), including other relevant metabolic and functional traits possessed by the bacteria under study.</s><s>Despite this, only a few studies are available on the impacts of U stress at the proteomic level, especially for aerobic microbiota.</s><s>To further advance on this aspect of metal-microbe interactions, Gallois and coworkers recently integrated the genomics and proteomics data of Microbacterium oleivorans A9, a uranium-tolerant actinobacteria isolated from near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, when grown in the presence or absence of uranyl nitrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>.</s><s>This study revealed 1532 proteins and specifically, 591 proteins with significant differences in abundances when gown with or without uranium.</s><s>Under the influence of U(VI) exposure, Yung et al., identified a phytase enzyme and an ABC transporter to be upregulated in Caulobacter crescentus <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>, which can tolerate high concentrations of U <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the objective of this study was to obtain genomics and high-throughput proteomics data on strains SRS-25 and SRS-46, grown with and without uranium, thus forming a strong basis of our understanding on the underpinnings of U-Burkholderia interactions, which to our understanding, has not been previously demonstrated.</s><s>Such studies can lead to the identification of gene-protein targets to not only gauge but predict the trajectory of uranium bioremediation in historically U-contaminated environments.</s></p></div>

target="#b38">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">43]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To address this knowledge gap, specifically in context to Burkholderia species, our proteomics-guided approach led to the identification of 276 and 408 commonly expressed proteins between strains SRS-25 and SRS-46 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6</ref>).</s><s>Arguably, the number of proteins detected in this study were found to be unusually low and this occurs typically from poor sample preparation and LC discrimination.</s><s>However, the raw data obtained, such as the LC control runs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>) and the number of solubilized membrane proteins (Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>) do not support this notion.</s><s>Yet another reason that may likely have an impact on the proteome analysis presented in this study could be the use of a publicly available Burkholderia proteome database via UniProt.</s><s>In the event that strains SRS-25 and SRS-46 contained large genomic deviations from the publicly available database, it may cause a significant impact on the proteome search.</s><s>However, this also does not appear to be the case by taxonomic analysis of the draft genomes of strains 25 and 46 (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), which shows genome-wide affiliations of strain 25 with Burkholderia lata and strain 46 with Burkholderia multivorans, respectively.</s><s>Regardless, this discrepancy can likely be addressed in our future work in which we will use translated genomes of strains SRS-25 and SRS-46 and then run proteomics comparisons.</s><s>We, however, strongly believe that searching the proteomes from translated databases of environmental Burkholderia strains would have limited value because comparisons with the entire Burkholderia database will reveal better proteomic insights mainly due to rigorous annotations and functional evaluations of the known proteins from different experimental studies as opposed to using just one or two strains isolated from uraniferous soils.</s></p><p><s>Despite low protein yeilds, this study led to the identification of a set of upregulated proteins as a function of uranium exposure-34 proteins in SRS-25 and 52 in SRS-46, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, statistical analysis indicated that each of the two strains possess their unique set of proteins to counteract stress and toxicity imposed by uranium, as a shared pool of proteins being expressed in both strains due to uranium exposure was not clearly evident (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>).</s><s>Despite the fact that both strains were isolated from the same soil and season, yet their total proteomics response against uranium toxicity seemed to be counteruntuitive, such that the proteomes of the two strains differed but not as a function of uranium alone.</s><s>It may be that the Burkholderia strains 25 and 46 colonized different microniches in the soils from where they were isolated and thus, were exposed to different levels of bioavailable uranium, and hence, evolved different proteomic responses against uranium toxicity.</s><s>Moreover, future protein validations will provide further evidence to completely understand why proteomes of the two Burkholderia species were statistically different with uranium not exhibiting the expected impact (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>), and more importantly, identification of uranium-specific protein targets in Burkholderiales.</s></p><p><s>Regardless, upon further review, the unique 34 proteins from strain SRS-25 and 52 from SRS-46, were those that were previously shown to function in bacterial stress response, DNA repair, protein biosynthesis, and metabolism.</s><s>By inference, it appeared that uranium upregulated multiple stress response pathways and heavy metal resistance functions to enable ecological and evolutionary survival in uraniferous soils.</s><s>Multiple stress response pathways became functional in the two Burkholderia strains most likely due to their innate ability to resist higher concentrations of uranium, as shown in this study (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to our study, previous proteomics studies have been performed at much lower concentrations of uranium that do not represent environmentally relevant concentrations, especially in context to the SRS soil habitat.</s><s>For example, Caulobacter crescentus was exposed to 200 µM or 500 µM of uranyl nitrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Yung et al. 2014)</ref>; Geobacter sulfurreducens at 100 µM of uranyl acetate <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>; Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans to 0.5 mM of uranium <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref>; the nitrogen fixing strain, Anabaena, was exposed to 75 µM and 200 µM of uranyl carbonate <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[42]</ref> and Microbacterium oleivorans A9 at 10 µM of uranyl nitrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>, respectively.</s><s>Notably, a recent study from our laboratory suggests that bioavailable uranium is approximately 5 to 30 times lower than the total soil uranium concentrations (~4.2 mM) that is typically been documented from the historically contaminated SRS soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref>; thus, we plan to repeat the proteomics studies at environmentally bioavailable concentrations of uranium, results of which will further improve our basic understanding on uranium-bacterial interactions at the cellular and molecular level.</s></p><p><s>Noteworthy also, were the upregulation of previously uncharacterized proteins in SRS-46, such as the UPF0234 protein Bmul_0741/BMUL1_02519, UPF0307 protein Bcep18194_A4194, and UPF0301 protein Bamb_0737, which were higher in the presence of uranium.</s><s>Other studies on Geobacter sp., Microbacterium sp., Acidithiobacillus sp., have also led to the identification of uncaracterized proteins under uranium stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42]</ref>, and thus, points to the lack of knowledge on the underpinnings of uranium-microbial interactions at the molecular level.</s><s>It is very likely that the suite of uncharacterized proteins may also be engaged in conferring resistance or even biomineralization of uranium in Burkholderiales, which warrants further research.</s></p><p><s>In summation, this study further enhances our understanding of the multiple proteogenomic mechanisms of two newly isolated and soil-borne Burkholderia strains against uranium stress and provides for a framework for additional studies, especially at much shorter time-scales (e.g., hourly intervals post uranium exposure), and more importantly, at bioavailable and environmentally relevant concentrations of uranium, such that precise molecular mechanism(s) underpinning Burkholderia-uranium interactions and remediation can be better understood.</s></p></div>
