<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population and Variables</head><p><s>The study was carried out in a sample of Upper Basic Schools (UBS) and Senior Secondary Schools (SSS) throughout The Gambia, using methods described previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Briefly, two-stage cluster sampling was used to generate a nationally representative sample of students in grades 7 to 12 (aged 12-20 years).</s><s>In the first stage, schools were randomly selected from a list of schools with a probability proportional to their enrolment size and, in the second stage, classes within the selected schools were randomly selected from the total number of classes in the schools.</s><s>All students in the selected classes were eligible to participate.</s></p><p><s>Participating students completed a self-administered questionnaire adapted from the WHO Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire.</s><s>Data were collected on a range of variables including demographic details, smoking susceptibility, exposure to tobacco advertisements and promotion, anti-smoking media messages, beliefs about the danger of smoking, and the perceived benefits of smoking.</s><s>The questionnaire also included a series of questions on several indicators of tobacco use, exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS), support for public smoking regulations, and knowledge of the harmful effect of SHS; these data have been reported in a separate publication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>e measured the outcome variable, susceptibility to smoking, using two standard GYTS questions: (1) "If one of your best friends offered you a tobacco product, would you smoke it?"</s><s>4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> Current smoking was defined as any smoking of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes at any time in the past 30 days.</s><s>All students who responded "definitely not" and "probably not" to the question on knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking were defined as having poor knowledge and those who responded "probably yes" and "definitely yes" were defined as having good knowledge.</s><s>Ethical approvals for the survey were obtained from The Gambia Government/Medical Research Council (MRC) Joint Ethics Committee (SCC 1468v2) and from the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of School of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Nottingham, UK (OVS24022016 SoM EPH).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>The data were initially entered in to Microsoft Access and exported to Stata version 15 for analysis and only nonsmokers were included in the analysis of the study.</s><s>Descriptive and chi-square analyses were used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of susceptibility to smoke and to determine the association of smoking susceptibility to students' demographic characteristics, awareness of tobacco advertisements, attitudes, beliefs, and perceived benefits of smoking.</s><s>Univariate logistic regression was carried out first to look for association between smoking susceptibility (outcome variable) and the exposure variables.</s><s>The exposure variables included gender, age, school locality, school funding source, religion, home smoking rules, family and friends' smoking status, whether students were sent to purchase cigarettes for others, knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking, and exposure to tobacco advertisements.</s><s>Gender, purchasing cigarettes for others, knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking, and exposure to tobacco advertisements were entered as binary variables and the rest of the exposure variables were categorical.</s><s>We constructed a multivariate logistic regression model to ascertain the predicting factors of smoking susceptibility.</s><s>Similar to previous analyses, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> we adjusted for a priori confounders comprising age, gender, and rural/urban area of school, which previous studies have suggested are associated with susceptibility to initiate tobacco use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>ariables with p values equal to or less than 0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in the final model.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Determinants of Smoking Susceptibility Among the Study Participants</head><p><s>The association between smoking susceptibility and student characteristics is outlined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>.</s><s>After adjusting for all independent variables, smoking susceptibility was more common among students attending grant-aided schools (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.87), of Christian or other non-Muslim faiths (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.17 to 3.46), who had smoking sometimes allowed in their homes (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.56), had family members or friends who smoked, and were sent to purchase cigarettes for others.</s><s>Additionally, students who had poor knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.48 to 1.83) and those who noticed point-of-sale tobacco advertisements (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.32) were significantly more likely to be susceptible to smoking.</s><s>Students who had been offered a free cigarette, owned and used a tobacco branded item, who believed that it is difficult to quit once smoking is initiated, that it is safe to smoke as long as one quits later on, that smoking can improve general health status, and that smoking can make people relaxed were significantly more likely to be susceptible to smoking.</s><s>Students with perceptions that smokers have more friends, being more attractive, and that smoking can help to lose weight were significantly less likely to be susceptibility to smoking.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This is the first study to provide detailed data on smoking susceptibility and risk factors in a nationally representative sample of adolescent school students in The Gambia.</s><s>We found that one in three students were susceptible to smoking.</s><s>Susceptibility was more common among students attending grant-aided schools and non-Muslims.</s><s>Young people in our sample were more likely to be susceptible to smoking if they had smoking allowed in their homes, had family or friends who smoked, were sent to purchase cigarettes for others, had poor knowledge of the harmful effect of smoking, and noticed tobacco at the point-of-sale.</s><s>Additionally, positive attitudes, beliefs, and perceived benefits of smoking were significantly associated with susceptibility to smoking.</s><s>Our study was cross sectional and has limited ability to attribute causality to smoking susceptibility.</s><s>All estimates in our assessment were based on self-reports which might be affected by reporting bias.</s><s>Also, although smoking susceptibility has been shown consistently to be a risk factor for smoking experimentation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> its predictive value for sustained future smoking is limited.</s><s>Given the number of variables included in the analysis, we acknowledge the possibility of type I error given the fact that included variables may be highly correlated.</s><s>Our survey was conducted in schools and therefore may not be representative of Gambian youth as a whole.</s><s>Data from the Ministry of Education indicate gross enrolment rates of 68.12% and 41.2% for UBS and SSS, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ; this suggests that our data are more representative for among younger age groups.</s><s>However, doing surveys in schools is one of the most efficient ways to collect data among young people and our study has provided very useful data on a topic with very sparse information particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies on smoking initiation among young people in The Gambia and in West Africa are limited.</s><s>However, our finding that one in three students were susceptible to smoking initiation is consistent with work from other developing and developed countries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Moreover, young people in other countries in Africa at a similar stage of economic development to The Gambia are likely to be exposed to similar risk factors and we think it is likely that our findings will be generalizable to such countries.</s><s>Given the validation of smoking susceptibility as a predictor of smoking experimentation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> these findings suggest that smoking prevalence among young people is likely to rise in the near future in The Gambia.</s><s>This is particularly important in many Sub-Saharan African countries with low current-smoking rates but at high risk of the smoking epidemic.</s></p><p><s>Our finding that susceptibility to smoking varies significantly between types of schools and that religious beliefs influence smoking susceptibility is consistent with existing evidence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s>The link between susceptibility to smoking with socio-cultural factors, and particularly religious faith and attending nonpublic schools is consistent with our previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> that non-Muslim students attending grant-aided or private schools were more likely to be current smokers.</s><s>We found that students who live in homes with only some smoking restrictions were more likely to be susceptible to smoking.</s><s>This finding is in line with previous studies reporting that the absence of, or a partial ban on home smoking, are associated with an increased risk of smoking susceptibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and that partial home smoking bans have not been effective in preventing smoking initiation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s>n line with existing findings, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> we found that students who had parents or friends who smoked and had been sent to purchase cigarettes for their parents or other older adults were significantly more likely to be susceptible to smoking initiation.</s><s>These characteristics appear to identify contact with others who smoke, and these findings indicate that efforts to minimize parents and peer smoking are needed.</s><s>Students' knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking as they relate to susceptibility to initiate smoking is welldocumented. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>Our results provide further confirmation that having good knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking serves as a protective factor against susceptibility to initiate smoking and underscores the importance of education on the harmful effects of smoking.</s></p><p><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> Given that all forms of tobacco advertisements have been banned in The Gambia since 2003, our findings demonstrate worryingly high levels of exposure to tobacco advertisements, which may be a reflection of poor implementation of the Tobacco Advertisement Act.</s><s>To reduce exposure to tobacco advertisements and promotion, the ban needs to be comprehensive. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref></s><s>Advertisements were predominantly seen on television, movies, magazines, radio, and on the internet, which are available online and from broadcasters based within The Gambia and outside.</s><s>It is possible that media advertisements within and outside the country are not adequately regulated and subjected to the advertisement ban. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref></s><s>lthough we did not find exposure to anti-tobacco media messages to be a significant predictor of susceptibility to smoking in our study, we found that more than half of all students did not hear or see any anti-tobacco media messages in the past 30 days preceding this study.</s><s>This suggests that messages are insufficient and even available messages are not delivered effectively.</s><s>This highlights the need for more mass media campaigns and it is also important that anti-smoking media messages are appropriately delivered without interference by tobacco companies.</s></p><p><s>Limited research is available to compare and explore young Gambians perspectives, attitudes and beliefs about smoking.</s><s>However similar to previous findings elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , we found that students who had positive attitudes, beliefs, and perceived benefits of smoking were significantly susceptible to smoking.</s><s>Preventive measures and efforts that particularly focus on various social and behavioral aspects are needed.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>This study has shown that susceptibility to smoking is relatively high among students in The Gambia.</s><s>To help minimize future smoking initiation among young people, intervention may need to be targeted particularly at parents and peers who smoke and raising students' awareness of the harmful effects of smoking.</s><s>This may help to reduce future smoking among students and provide the maximum benefit as a protective factor against smoking initiation.</s><s>Our findings also suggest that there is a need to broaden the ban on tobacco advertising to explicitly include all forms of media and point-of-sale advertisements.</s><s>In addition, strict enforcement of the ban on tobacco advertisements should be a high priority for policy makers.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Baseline Characteristics of
