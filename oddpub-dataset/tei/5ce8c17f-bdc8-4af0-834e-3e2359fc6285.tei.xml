<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The pathophysiology underlying adult OAB is complex and multifactorial.</s><s>Indeed, there are likely to be multiple different derangements in bladder neural transmission that can cause the OAB symptom complex.</s><s>This would explain why patients with seemingly similar OAB symptoms may respond to different forms of treatment.</s><s>Further study is needed to further elucidate these mechanisms and the way that IVES as well as other existing OAB treatments can act on them.</s><s>One particular area of interest would be with regards to suprapontine and spinal cord input into the micturition reflex arc and whether this input is affected by IVES.</s></p><p><s>Much of the existing literature regarding IVES involves its use in pediatric patients with neurogenic bladder.</s><s>Although this patient population is clearly very different from the adult OAB population, there may be commonalities in terms of underlying pathophysiology.</s><s>Sensitization of C-fiber sensory afferents resulting in detrusor overactivity has been proposed as a possible etiology in both patient populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study of middle-aged women demonstrated an age-related decrease in the current perception threshold and latency as well as an increase in the amplitude of sensory evoked potentials in the bladder dome, trigone, and proximal urethra.</s><s>The authors interpreted this as evidence of an age-related increase in bladder afferent excitability which may contribute to the age-related increase in OAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>IVES in a rat spinal cord injury model has been shown to decrease both the number of nonvoiding detrusor contractions and maximal detrusor pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s><s>A recent retrospective study of spina bifida children found that IVES can increase urodynamic bladder capacity.</s><s>Detrusor overactivity was improved in 41.7% of patients and bladder OAB-q SF OAB-q SF bother Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p><s>Administration of IVES was associated with a statistically significant improvement in OAB symptoms as measured by validated questionnaires in a short-term observational study.</s><s>Self-reported urinary frequency and pad usage also improved.</s><s>This treatment was well-tolerated.</s><s>This opens up the need for further studies to investigate the potential use of this treatment modality for OAB patients.</s></p></div>
