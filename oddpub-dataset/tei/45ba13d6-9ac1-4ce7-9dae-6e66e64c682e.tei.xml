<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>For clinical applications of cells and tissue engineering products it is of importance to characterize the quality of the used cells in detail.</s><s>Progenitor cells from the periosteum are already routinely applied in the clinics for the regeneration of the maxillary bone.</s><s>Periosteal cells have, in addition to their potential to differentiate into bone, the ability to develop into cartilage and fat.</s><s>However, the question arises whether all cells isolated from periosteal biopsies are able to differentiate into all three tissue types, or whether there are subpopulations.</s><s>For an efficient and approved application in bone or cartilage regeneration the clarification of this question is of interest.</s><s>Therefore, 83 different clonal cultures of freshly isolated human periosteal cells derived from mastoid periosteum biopsies of 4 donors were generated and growth rates calculated.</s><s>Differentiation capacities of 51 clonal cultures towards the osteogenic, the chondrogenic, and the adipogenic lineage were investigated.</s><s>Histological and immunochemical stainings showed that 100% of the clonal cultures differentiated towards the osteogenic lineage, while 94.1% demonstrated chondrogenesis, and 52.9% could be stimulated to adipogenesis.</s><s>For osteogenesis real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of BGLAP and RUNX2 and for adipogenesis of FABP4 and PPARG confirmed the results.</s><s>Overall, 49% of the cells exhibited a tripotent potential, 45.1% showed a bipotent potential (without adipogenic differentiation), 3.9% bipotent (without chondrogenic differentiation), and 2% possessed a unipotent osteogenic potential.</s><s>In FACS analyses, no differences in the marker profile of undifferentiated clonal cultures with bi-and tripotent differentiation capacity were found.</s><s>Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed 52 differentially expressed genes for clonal subpopulations with or without chondrogenic differentiation capacity, among them DCN, NEDD9, TGFBR3, and TSLP.</s><s>For clinical applications of periosteal cells in bone regeneration all cells were inducible.</s><s>For a chondrogenic application a fraction of 6% of the mixed population could not be induced.</s></p></div>

therefore essential to characterize the used cells extensively.</s><s>Among other things, questions such as the potential of the cells as well as the delimitation to other tissues play an important role.</s><s>Progenitor cells from the periosteum are promising candidates for the application in the regeneration of bones and cartilage.</s><s>They are able to differentiate in vitro into bones,

differentiation potential of these cells and to investigate different subclonal populations, clonal cultures of periosteal cells were developed and differentiated into bone, cartilage and fat.</s><s>In addition, clonal cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry and genome-wide microarrays of undifferentiated cells to determine their gene expression profiles.</s><s>Based on microarray results, important similarities and differences in different subtypes of clonal cultures were demonstrated.</s></p><p><s>To determine the common or different potential of periosteal cells, clonal cultures were applied from single cells isolated from the periosteum with a modified procedure already described <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr"

cultures was heterogeneous.</s><s>We found both, clonal cultures that did not grew or did very slowly, and thus had no or only very limited expansion potential, as well as fast-growing clonal cultures, which led to over 1 x 10 6 cells after 3 weeks.</s><s>In a mixed population, the fast-growing cells would rapidly displace the slowers.</s><s>In previous publications of clonal periosteal

the work presented here, showed for the first time that there are also periosteal cells with a more limited potential.</s><s>A similar spectrum of multi-, bi-or monopotent cells was found in Muraglia et al., where 185 clonal MSC cultures were examined <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>There, the proportion of multipotent cells differentiating in all tested lineages was 24.3% and

al. clonal cultures with a single adipogenic and chondrogenic were detected.</s><s>When comparing the ostegenic differentiation capacity of periosteal clonal cultures to those of MSC, it is shown that there are cells in the heterogenous clonal MSC cultures that display no capability to differentiate to the osteogenic lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr"

of FC m (+/-) between the two groups of clonal cultures.</s><s>A distinction between these two groups on the basis of these 7 genes was not possible.</s><s>The differences comparing cells with or

not be differentiated towards the chondrogenic lineage compared to tripotent clonal cultures.</s><s>NEDD9 is described to be a scaffolding protein in the integrin signaling pathway that is involved in cell adhesion dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The gene expression for TSLP displayed the highest FC m in undifferentiated tripotent clonal cultures compared cultures that did not comprise chondrogenic differentiation.</s><s>For keloid firboblasts TSLP is described as a potent inducer of collagen and TGF-β production <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Among the other 52 genes with different gene expression is Transforming Growth Factor beta Type III Receptor (TGFBR3).</s><s>It encodes the receptor with the same name.</s><s>The receptor plays an important role for TGF-β and BMP signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the gene expression of Decorin (DCN) encoding the cartilage protein decorin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> was higher in chondrogenically inducible cultures.</s></p><p><s>Among the genes higher expressed in clonal cultures not able to form cartilage was Gremlin 1 (GREM1).</s><s>The corresponding protein is a BMP antagonist which was found in higher concentrations in early osteoarthritic cartilage <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>The reduced expression of DCN, TGFBR3, TSLP and the increased expression of GREM1 in clonal cultures not able to induce chondrogenesis might be an interesting chondrogenic indicator.</s></p><p><s>A further confirmation of similarity between the two groups of tripotent cells and clonal cultures not able to induce adipogenic differentiation was provided by FACS analysis.</s><s>Although no specific marker is known for periosteal cells, a set of surface marker that is also used to characterize MSC (CD166, CD105, CD90, CD73, CD44 positive and CD45, CD34, CD14 negative) was chosen.</s><s>FACS analysis did not show any
