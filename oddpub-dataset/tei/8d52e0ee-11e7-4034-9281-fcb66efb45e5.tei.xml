<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DIsCussIOn</head><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine cross-sectional and prospective associations between neighbourhood environments and screen time using both perceived and objective measures of specific neighbourhood environmental attributes among middle-aged Japanese adults in an Asian country.</s><s>The results of this study support previous findings that built environmental attributes of neighbourhoods that are related to physical activity may also play an important role in influencing sedentary behaviours independently, <ref type="bibr">12 14 15 26</ref> and further extend the results showing that both perceived (good access to public transport, access to shop and street Open Access connectivity) and objectively measured (good access to public transport) physical activity-supportive environmental attributes are related to higher levels of screen time cross-sectionally.</s><s>These findings would be important to inform policy makers and intervention designers that when designing environmental approach to promote physical activity, it would be crucial to consider the negative impact of screen time, at least in Japan.</s></p><p><s>Contrary to expectations, a neighbourhood environment with GIS-measured good access to public transportation, and perceived good access to destinations, good access to public transportation and good street connectivity, was positively associated with higher levels of screen time in adults, which have been found to be positively related to higher levels of physical activity. <ref type="bibr">18 27</ref></s><s>The present results were also inconsistent with previous studies from Western countries that have reported inverse associations between high walkable environment and screen-based sedentary time. <ref type="bibr">12 14 15</ref></s><s>Only one Belgium study reported similar results with the present study that high walkable environment is positively associated with total sitting time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>The possible speculation for these results could be that physical activity-supportive neighbourhood environment (eg, there are so many shops, train stations and bus stops within 1.6 km radius of their house) could reduce the time spent in commute and daily errand, and thus adults may have more leisure time to engage in screen time.</s><s>Although there is limited evidence in existing literature to draw the conclusion and the possible mechanism regarding the inverse associations between environment and screen time, the present study may have several important implications.</s><s>First of all, the perceptions of environmental attributes should be considered as predictors of screen time in future studies.</s><s>The present results indicate that perceived environmental attributes might be better predictors of screen time than objective ones.</s><s>How middle-to-older-aged adults perceive and understand their neighbourhood environment might be important in their decision to spend time in screen time in their home.</s><s>Moreover, further studies in Asian countries using specific environmental measures are needed due to differences in residential density, culture and built environment between Western and Asian countries.</s><s>Finally, examining the relationships among environmental factors, physical activity and sedentary behaviour concurrently would be a priority to better understand the potential positive or negative health effects of environment on both physical activity and sedentary behaviours to inform policy initiatives.</s></p><p><s>Another novel finding is that there were no prospective associations between screen time and objective and perceived environmental attributes over 2 years.</s><s>The possible explanation for this result could be that the follow-up duration of this study was only 2 years and screen time is a highly domestic behaviour for adults during leisure time, which may be maintained for years unless there is adjustment in home environment or change in employment status.</s><s>Therefore, the present study might provide a preliminary understanding on built environmental determinants of screen time for developing effective population-based interventions. <ref type="bibr">10 11</ref></s><s>Therefore, to further confirm the prospective associations, studies with a longer follow-up time are needed in the future.</s></p><p><s>This study has several limitations.</s><s>First, the outcome variable-self-reported screen time-may be subject to recall bias.</s><s>Thus, future studies should consider measuring screen time using objective measures to provide more confirmative evidence.</s><s>Second, the use of the IPAQ-SV may have overestimated the time spent in MVPA.</s><s>Third, potential confounders such as self-selection of neighbourhoods and home environment were not examined in this study.</s><s>Finally, the participants who responded to the follow-up survey were more likely to have higher educational levels (58.1% vs 47.4%, P=0.002) and have Open Access</s></p></div><figure
