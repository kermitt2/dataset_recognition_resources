the number of teeth and MI or stroke is not dependent or explained by diet.</s><s>This suggests that diet has small relevance, if at all, in association between number of teeth and these end points <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>Our study found no significant association with T2DM.</s><s>This supports established evidence that uncontrolled T2DM is more likely to result into tooth loss than for reduced number of teeth to precede the onset of T2DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s><s>We also found no association between number of teeth and overall cancer.</s><s>However, we cannot rule out that the association might be with specific cancer sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, due to tooth loss being highly associated with SES and access to dental care, some authors have proposed that SES might be a stronger predictor of cancer when compared to the number of teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A possible biological explanation for the relationship between the number of teeth and MI is that locally synthesized inflammatory cytokines that result in periodontal tissue breakdown before and during tooth loss which reduces number of teeth also propagates systemic dissemination of oral pathogenic bacteria and bacterial products in the blood stream.</s><s>This leads to increased expression of inflammatory, chemotactic and prothrombotic mediators which promote MI <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Early oral dysbiosis that eventually results in tooth loss might also initiate systemic autoantibodies that also promote cardiac dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Genetic defects in recognition and response to oral pathogenic bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> and pro-inflammatory genetic factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> could also be some explanation for our findings.</s></p><p><s>The strengths of our study are the large sample size, relatively long follow-up, multiple chronic disease end points and adjustment for several confounders.</s><s>Our study also investigated the role of diet.</s><s>Our study has major limitations as the observational design does not allow inferences concerning causality.</s><s>Self-reported number of teeth information was not validated.</s><s>Misreporting of the number of teeth due to dental implants, fixed prosthetics and radixes is possible, though this should be very low in our study considering we asked for the number of natural teeth.</s><s>Professional verification of this reported number of teeth <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> would have validated our assessment.</s><s>The retrospective extrapolation of the number of teeth may have also biased point estimates due to less exact data.</s><s>The cross-sectional evaluation of teeth status lacks the exact timing of tooth loss with the subsequent uncertainty of the correct duration of exposure.</s><s>The application of more valid measure of dental status such as clinical periodontal assessments in large epidemiological studies like ours is limited due to diagnostic procedures that are not straightforward and sometimes cumbersome <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Lack of information on actual use of dental care and life-course socioeconomic position could have an impact on teeth number and early diagnosis of diseases.</s><s>Other bias in our study is that outcomes could have been underreported among individuals with serious and debilitating events.</s><s>Finally, the use of phone interviews in order to obtain physician confirmation of chronic diseases could also raise some potential of underreporting.</s></p></div>
