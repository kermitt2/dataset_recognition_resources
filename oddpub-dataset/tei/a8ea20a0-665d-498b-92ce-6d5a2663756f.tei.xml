Improvements in HRQoL were also significantly greater in the ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group.</s><s>Although PGA 0/1 and PASI 75 results were generally comparable between the HSD and SD groups through week 12, differences in responses favored the SD for higher level responses such as PGA 0, PASI 90, and CDLQI 0/1.</s><s>Beyond week 12, clinical response in the SD group was generally higher and better sustained than in the HSD group, in which a modest loss of response was more frequently observed toward the Comparisons of clinical response at week 28, when steady state was achieved, from the CADMUS trial and the PHOENIX adult ustekinumab studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> showed that the response observed with the HSD in the CADMUS trial was generally lower than that seen in adults, whereas response with the SD was similar to (or higher than) that in adults.</s><s>Comparable ustekinumab exposures were achieved in patients weighing #60 kg with the milligram to kilogram weight-adjusted dose and in patients weighing greater than 60 to #100 kg who received the fixed dose.</s><s>This suggests that the 0.75-mg/kg dose adjustment implemented in CADMUS is appropriate for adolescents with a body weight #60 kg.</s><s>Moreover, comparing serum ustekinumab concentrations from this trial and the previous adult trials suggests that systemic exposure to ustekinumab in adolescent patients (age $12 years) receiving the body weighteadjusted SD was comparable to that of adults receiving the approved psoriasis dosage (data not shown).</s></p><p><s>Our results also provide information that is more broadly applicable to adolescent psoriasis treatment, particularly for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.</s><s>The observation that weight-adjusted dosing in the pediatric population in CADMUS resulted in ustekinumab exposure comparable to that in adults provides additional evidence that the metabolism of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in adolescent patients aged 12 to 17 years is similar to that in adult patients.</s><s>The AEs in this trial were consistent with those previously observed in adult patients receiving ustekinumab.</s><s>The challenges to effective disease management that pediatric psoriasis patients currently face is highlighted by the substantial proportion of CADMUS patients who had not previously received either systemic treatment or phototherapy, even though they had relatively severe psoriasis, a major HRQoL issue in this young population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>mong the biologic agents approved worldwide for adult patients with psoriasis, only etanercept and adalimumab are currently indicated for use in children and only in Europe.</s><s>Paller et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> reported that 53% of 106 patients (age 4 to 17 years) receiving weekly etanercept (0.8 mg/kg) achieved PGA 0/1, 57% achieved PASI 75, and 27% achieved PASI 90 at week 12.</s></p><p><s>Limitations of our study include the relatively small number of patients, the predominantly white study population, and the 1-year treatment duration.</s><s>That only 3 patients weighed [100 kg at baseline limits the generalizability of these findings to heavier children.</s><s>However, it is clear the weight-based SD provided exposure comparable to that in adults with comparable clinical response and that the lower HSD provided suboptimal long-term response in this CADMUS population.</s><s>The similar ustekinumab exposure observed in adult patients and patients 12 to 17 years is reassuring, given the well-characterized safety profile from the extensive experience in adult patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s>ur findings suggest a positive benefit-to-risk profile for ustekinumab treatment of adolescents with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.</s><s>A weight-based dosing strategy achieving exposure similar to that observed with the current adult dosage resulted in robust improvements in disease activity and HRQoL with no unexpected AEs noted.</s><s>Ustekinumab appears to provide a beneficial and convenient treatment option for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the pediatric population age 12 years and older.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>[n = 18] or HSD [n = 19]) (Fig 2).</s><s>At week 8, 1 patient each in the HSD and SD groups entered early escape.</s><s>Through week 40, 9 (8.2%) patients discontinued study agent because of unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (n = 5), AEs (n = 3), or death (n = 1).</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
