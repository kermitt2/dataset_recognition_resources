<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>In bistable vision, subjective perception wavers between two interpretations of a constant ambiguous stimulus.</s><s>This dissociation between conscious perception and sensory stimulation has motivated various empirical studies on the neural correlates of bistable perception, but the neurocomputational mechanism behind endogenous perceptual transitions has remained elusive.</s><s>Here, we recurred to a generic Bayesian framework of predictive coding and devised a model that casts endogenous perceptual transitions as a consequence of prediction errors emerging from residual evidence for the suppressed percept.</s><s>Data simulations revealed close similarities between the model's predictions and key temporal characteristics of perceptual bistability, indicating that the model was able to reproduce bistable perception.</s><s>Fitting the predictive coding model to behavioural data from an fMRI-experiment on bistable perception, we found a correlation across participants between the model parameter encoding perceptual stabilization and the behaviourally measured frequency of perceptual transitions, corroborating that the model successfully accounted for participants' perception.</s><s>Formal model comparison with established models of bistable perception based on mutual inhibition and adaptation, noise or a combination of adaptation and noise was used for the validation of the predictive coding model against the established models.</s><s>Most importantly, model-based analyses of the fMRI data revealed that prediction error timecourses derived from the predictive coding model correlated with neural signal time-courses in bilateral inferior frontal gyri and anterior insulae.</s><s>Voxel-wise model selection indicated a superiority of the predictive coding model over conventional analysis approaches in explaining neural activity in these frontal areas, suggesting that frontal cortex encodes prediction errors that mediate endogenous perceptual transitions in bistable perception.</s><s>Taken together, our current work provides a theoretical framework that allows for the analysis of behavioural and neural data using a predictive coding perspective on bistable perception.</s><s>In this, our approach posits a crucial role of prediction error signalling for the resolution of perceptual ambiguities.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>During bistable perception, observers experience fluctuations between two mutually exclusive interpretations of a constant ambiguous input.</s><s>Remarkably, percepts evoked by ambiguous stimuli usually closely resemble the experience of unambiguous objects and thus illustrate the constructive nature of perception.</s><s>However, the mechanisms driving transitions in bistable perception remain poorly understood.</s></p><p><s>Previous neuroimaging work <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref

type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> has sought to distill the neural processes underlying bistable perception by recurring to a 'replay' condition, in which physical stimulus changes mimic the perceptual alternations induced by ambiguous stimuli.</s><s>This approach revealed a right-lateralized assembly of fronto-parietal areas whose activity is specifically enhanced during endogenously evoked transitions (ambiguity) as compared to exogenously evoked transitions (replay) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, the functional role of fronto-parietal areas in bistable perception is a matter of ongoing debate.</s><s>According to one view, transitions in bistable vision are primarily a result of adaptation and inhibition within visual cortex, while switch-related activations in fronto-parietal areas reflect a mere 'feedforward' consequence of neural events at sensory processing levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s>Another view proposes that fronto-parietal areas may be involved in stabilizing and destabilizing perception, thus causally contributing to perceptual switching via 'feedback' mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we sought to resolve this debate by using model-based fMRI to empirically test a theoretical model that has the potential to integrate these two seemingly contradictory views of perceptual bistability.</s></p><p><s>From a theoretical perspective, endogenous transitions might be explained by framing perception as an inferential process generating and testing hypotheses about the most likely causes of sensory stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>Such processes can be elegantly implemented by hierarchical predictive coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Here, 'predictions' encoded at higher levels are compared against 'sensory input' represented at lower levels, while a mismatch between the two elicits a prediction error, updating higher-level predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Such belief-updating schemes can be translated onto Bayes' rule, where prior distributions ('predictions') are combined with likelihood distributions ('sensory input') into posterior distributions in a sequential manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we tested whether this framework provides a mechanistic explanation for perceptual transitions and related neural activity during bistable perception.</s><s>We devised a computational model that formalizes perceptual decisions (i.e., decisions that define the content of conscious perception, as indicated by participants' response) to be performed on the basis of posterior probability distributions.</s><s>This model is a modification of an approach introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, who propose that perceptual time-courses during bistable perception result from samples drawn subsequently from a posterior distribution.</s><s>The authors implement a memory decay favoring recent over older samples as well as stationary prior capturing the effect of context on bistable perception.</s><s>Our model, in turn, posits that the shape of the posterior distribution changes dynamically over time in response to prediction errors emerging from the currently suppressed interpretation of the ambiguous input.</s><s>Importantly, this model has the potential to integrate feedforward and feedback mechanisms in bistable perception: The prediction errors arising from sensory processing levels may be propagated up to higher-level brain areas in a feedforward fashion.</s><s>The registration of prediction errors in higher-level brain areas leads to an updating of predictions that may in turn drive perceptual switching through a feedback mechanism.</s></p><p><s>To test this hypothesis, we began with data simulations to establish that our model's predictions match the key characteristics of perceptual bistability.</s><s>We proceeded by fitting our model to behavioural data from a fMRI experiment on bistable perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In this experiment, participants viewed a Lissajous figure <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> rotating either clockwise (as viewed from above, i.e. movement of the front surface to the left) or counter-clockwise (vice versa) and indicated their current perception via button-presses.</s><s>Participants were presented with alternating blocks of ambiguous and disambiguated Lissajous figures: In the ambiguous condition, we presented bistable Lissajous figures which elicited spontaneous (endogenous) alternations in perception.</s><s>In the disambiguated ('replay') condition, we mimicked the endogenous perceptual time-course by introducing exogenous perceptual switches.</s><s>Ambiguous and disambiguated stimuli were constructed by presenting two Lissajous figures separately to the two eyes: In the ambiguous condition, both eyes received identical stimulation.</s><s>In the replay condition, the two Lissajous figures were slightly phase-shifted against each other, biasing perception in the direction of the phase shift.</s></p><p><s>Having inverted our predictive coding approach based on behavioural data from this experiment, we investigated whether our model accurately explains individual perceptual timecourses during ambiguous and replay stimulation.</s></p><p><s>In a supplementary analysis (see S2 Text), we furthermore compared our model to three established models of bistable perception: Firstly, we tested an oscillator model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which is based on mutual inhibition between to competing neural populations coding for the alternative perceptual outcomes during bistable perception.</s><s>Here, the currently dominant population suppresses activity in the alternative population.</s><s>However, due to adaptation in the dominant population, this relation reverses over time, leading to regular oscillations in perception.</s><s>Secondly, we constructed a noise-driven attractor model of bistable perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In this framework, internal and external sources of noise trigger transitions between two stable states in an attractor network, representing the two perceptual interpretations associated with a bistable stimulus.</s><s>Thirdly, we tested an intermediate model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, which contains both adaptive processes and noise.</s><s>We validated our approach against these models by the use of Bayesian Model Comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We then conducted a model-based fMRI-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> based on the predictive coding model to test whether prediction errors account for transition-related neural activity during bistability.</s><s>Additionally, we compared the model-based fMRI analysis with conventional fMRI analyses using a Posterior Probability Map (PPM) approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical background</head><p><s>Our Bayesian modelling approach draws on the view that perception is an inferential process in which perceptual decisions are based on posterior distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>According to Bayes' rule, the posterior combines information in the current sensory data (likelihood) with information from previous visual experience (prior) in a probabilistically optimal manner.</s><s>Crucially, this posterior at a given moment becomes a prior for the current perceptual decision, which entails a prediction error signal that influences on the prior at the next moment.</s><s>Hence, the posterior not only provides the basis for current perception, but also shapes future perception.</s></p><p><s>In line with previous theorizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we reasoned that the ambiguous likelihood provides equally strong sensory evidence for two different percepts.</s><s>We further hypothesized that the current percept establishes an implicit prior belief about similar percepts in the future, thereby contributing to stability of visual perception.</s><s>The application of Bayes' rules combines the likelihood for ambiguous stimuli with the stability prior into a posterior that represents stronger evidence for the dominant percept, but still contains residual evidence for the suppressed percept.</s><s>While the stronger evidence for the dominant percept will again favor this percept for the upcoming perceptual decision, the residual evidence for the suppressed percept is equivalent to a prediction error that leads to an update of the stability prior.</s></p><p><s>Over time, the stability prior is weakened and the posterior shifts towards the suppressed percept, paralleled by an escalating prediction error.</s><s>When the residual evidence for the suppressed percept equals the evidence for the dominant percept, the prediction error reaches a maximum and a perceptual transition is most likely to occur.</s><s>Once such a transition has occurred, the process starts over again, minimizing the current prediction error.</s></p><p><s>Please note that our approach was influenced by the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, who argue that bistable perception is a product of Bayesian decision making in ambiguous sensory environments.</s><s>They study the effects of viewpoint context on perception of the Necker Cube and propose that bistable perception arises from sampling a bimodal posterior distribution.</s><s>Here, the sample with the highest ‚weight' determines the content of conscious perception.</s><s>Key elements of their model are (1), a stationary prior, whose precision reflects interindividual differences in the effects of viewpoint context on perception of the Necker Cube and (2), a memory decay that discounts the weight associated with a sample drawn from the posterior distribution by its age and influences on the length of individual phase durations.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, our model does not assume a specific memory decay process, but controls the length of phase durations by means of the dynamically updated stability prior.</s><s>In analogy to the stationary viewpoint prior in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, our model captures the influence of additional sensory evidence on perceptual decisions using a ‚stereodisparity' distribution, whose precision determines the effectiveness of disambiguation.</s></p><p><s>Please refer to to the mathematical appendix (see S1 Text) for a complete description, to Fig 1 for a step-by-step illustration of our approach and to Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for a summary of model parameters and quantities.</s><s>For computational expediency, we assume Gaussian probability distributions defined by mean and variance (or inverse precision).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model simulation</head><p><s>To test whether our model is able to reproduce the temporal dynamics of bistable perception, we used it to generate perceptual time-courses from some ambiguous visual input such as the Lissajous figure.</s><s>We assumed a sampling rate of 0.33 Hz, which was chosen to be close to the average overlap frequency in the behavioural experiment (see below), and simulated for a total of 6 Ã 10 5 seconds.</s><s>To model the ambiguous visual input, the impact of the stereodisparity weight was suppressed by setting μ stereo = 0.5 and π stereo = 0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental procedures</head><p><s>To examine whether our prediction error model might account for bistable perception and associated neural activity in human observers, we used data from an fMRI experiment applying the Lissajous figure.</s><s>Results from conventional analyses but not from behavioural modelling or model-based fMRI (see below) have been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Participants.</s><s>Twenty right-handed participants (11 female, mean age: 28, range: 21 -34) took part in this study, which was conducted at the Berlin Center for Advanced Neuroimaging (BCAN), Charite ´Universita ¨tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Mitte.</s><s>All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were naive to the purpose of the study, and provided informed written consent.</s><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of Charite ´Universita ¨tsmedizin Berlin, Campus Mitte.</s></p><p><s>Stimulus.</s><s>We presented stimuli generated with Psychophysics Toolbox 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> running under Matlab 2007b (Mathworks inc.) on a 60 Hz Sanyo LCD projector, on which participants viewed alternating blocks of ambiguous and corresponding replay stimulation.</s><s>In ambiguous blocks, we displayed two identical moving Lissajous figures formed by the intersection of two perpendicular sinusoids (x(t) = sin(3t) and y(t) = sin(6t + δ); with δ increasing from 0 to 2π), perceptual decision y(t − 1) (here centered around '1' for counter-clockwise rotation of the Lissajous figure).</s><s>The impact of the prior on the bimodal likelihood is determined by its precision (the inverse of variance) π stability .</s><s>If a new perceptual decision was adopted at the preceding overlapping configuration of the Lissajous figure, this precision is set to π init .</s><s>Otherwise, π stability is repeatedly updated by a prediction error signal.</s><s>This signal results from residual evidence for the alternative explanation of the bistable stimulus and is given by the difference between P(θ &gt; 0.5) and the current perceptual decision y(t) (see 'feedforward' arrow).</s><s>In this example, the prediction error signal stems from remaining evidence for clockwise rotation (centered around '0'), as the current perceptual decision represents counter-clockwise rotation (y(t) = 1) of the stimulus.</s><s>Overtime, the stability prior is weakened, which is accompanied by an increasing probability for a novel transition in perception.</s><s>B. Here, we depict the temporal evolution of the stability prior (left panel) and the corresponding posterior (right panel) at three successive overlapping configurations of the Lissajous figure (dark to light blue).</s><s>As the precision of the stabilizing prior is gradually reduced, the posterior relaxes to equivalent probability for both perceptual interpretations of the stimulus.</s><s>This is accompanied by escalating prediction error signals and increased likelihood for a perceptual transition.</s><s>C. Furthermore, our approach accounts for additional sensory evidence, which is realized by a stereodisparity signal and used to disambiguate the Lissajous figure in the 'replay' condition.</s><s>To this end, we introduce a 'stereodisparity' distribution (characterized by mean μ stereo and precision π stereo ), which serves as a weight on the bimodal likelihood.</s><s>In the ambiguous condition (left panel), μ stereo is centered around 0.5 and is thus uninformative with regard to the two perceptual interpretations of the stimulus.</s><s>In the replay condition (right panel), μ stereo is centered around '0' or '1' (depending on the direction of stereodisparity).</s><s>The strength of the bias in the direction of either percept introduced by the stereodisparity signal scales with the precision π stereo .</s></p><p><s>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005536.g001</s><s>separately to the two eyes.</s><s>In replay blocks, a disambiguated version of the Lissajous figure mimicked the perceptual time-course participants had experienced during the preceding ambiguous block.</s><s>To this end, the two dichoptically presented Lissajous figures were phaseshifted against each other by an offset of 0.04˚.</s><s>This disparity cue was used to disambiguate the stimulus, biasing participants perceived direction of rotation in the direction of the phase shift.</s><s>All stimuli subtended 2.05˚visual angle.</s><s>We achieved dichoptic stimulation by placing a custom build cardboard divider between the mirror attached to the head-coil and the screen at the end of the scanners bore <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Participants wore prism glasses to facilitate fusion between to two eyes.</s><s>All screens contained a fixation mark at the center and fusion frames surrounding the stimuli.</s></p><p><s>Task.</s><s>Participants were instructed to indicate the perceived direction of rotation of the Lissajous figure by pressing a left (index finger; for clockwise rotation of the stimulus, i.e. movemement of the front surface to the left) or right (ring finger) button with their right hand, responding to the first perceived direction after stimulation onset and to all additional perceptual transitions.</s><s>Furthermore, they reported unclear or mixed percepts by pressing a middle button (middle finger) on a standard MRI button box.</s></p><p><s>In order to titrate individual percept durations to approximately 10 s, we adjusted the rotational speed of the stimulus for every participant to one of three levels ('overlap' frequency 0.24, 0.</s></p></div>

precision determines the frequency of perceptual transitions.</s><s>The notion of such a stability prior is supported by experimental work on serial dependence in visual perception: In an orientation-judgement task, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> showed that perceived orientation was biased by recently observed stimuli and reasoned that the visual system might use past experiences as predictors of present perceptual decisions, thereby incorporating representations of the continuity of the visual environment.</s><s>Corroborating these results in a fMRI experiment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> found that orientation signals in early visual cortex were biased towards previous perceptual decisions.</s><s>At this point, however, we can only speculate

perceptual conflicts despite the ambiguity inherent in every sensory signal and offer a generic tool for quantifying the contribution of different contextual factors on perceptual outcomes.</s></p><p><s>The major strength of predictive coding models for bistable perception, however, lies in their ability to parsimoniously link different levels in the description of perceptual dynamics in ambiguous visual environments: On a computational level, prediction errors constitute the driving force behind perceptual transitions and are substantially reduced by additional sensory information (such as stereodisparity) during replay.</s><s>On a neural level, casting frontal activity during rivalry in terms of prediction error signals nicely relates to increased
