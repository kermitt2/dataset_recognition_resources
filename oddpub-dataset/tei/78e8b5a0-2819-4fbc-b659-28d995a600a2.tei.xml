<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and participants</head><p><s>We retrospectively analyzed data that were collected from January 2014 to December 2015 for critically ill patients who were admitted to a general ICU <ref type="bibr">(17 beds)</ref> in a tertiary teaching hospital-the unique three-general hospital.</s><s>The hospital has a referral center (with 10 ambulances) and was responsible for all critical or emergency work within Shuyang County in northern China (38 county townships and a county town).</s><s>Thus, 24 h a day, almost all critically ill patients were sent directly to the ICU.</s><s>Therefore, this hospital was a strong source of critically ill patients, which ensured sufficient data availability.</s><s>The study sample was compiled from the 2014 and 2015 data registries.</s><s>During the study period, 1,211,138 people aged 15 years or older, including 697,615 women and 115,355 people aged 65 years or older, lived in the county <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>The study was approved by the Ethical Committee on Clinical Research of the Shuyang People's Hospital in China.</s><s>Because the study involved care for critical illness, written informed consent was obtained from the nearest relative or a person who had been designated to provide consent by the patient.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p><s>To date, there are no compulsory diagnostic criteria for critical illness.</s><s>Moreover, the codes for critical illnesses per the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), are not well established.</s><s>The relevant code changes according to the condition of the critically ill patient, and these conditions include coma (R40.2),</s><s>cardiac arrest (I46.9),</s><s>heart failure (I50), shock (R57.9),</s><s>respiratory failure (J96), cardiovascular crisis and other critical events.</s><s>We also identified those patients who had acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) by the code I61.9, but in this study, SICH was only limited to those with acutely non-traumatic coma.</s><s>Similarly, traumatic brain injury (TBI) indicated a severe TBI (including traumatic subdural and epidural hematoma, or with intracerebral hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage) with sudden traumatic coma.</s><s>Coma refers to a state of unconsciousness from which the patient cannot be aroused and is typified by the absence of language and motor function with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3 to 8 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating a lower level of consciousness).</s><s>Cardiovascular crisis includes cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, sudden chest pain, and hypertensive crisis.</s><s>Here, our retrospective study of ICU patients used the following inclusion criteria: (1) the patient (age &gt; 15 years) exhibited an emergency-onset condition with unstable life signs or acute organ dysfunction and required transfer by emergency services to the ICU, and (2) the patient was hospitalized due to the onset a life-threatening organ dysfunction and required monitoring in the ICU.</s><s>We used the following exclusion criteria: (1) age &lt; 15 years, (2) an additional visit to the ICU within 2 weeks, and (3) residence in the county for &lt; 6 months.</s><s>We collected the critically ill patient data from the prospective registration of their primary diagnosis in the ICU patient out-of-hospital registry.</s><s>Registration was the responsibility of the physician in charge of the ICU.</s><s>The data registry annual volumes included sex, age, address, the date of admission, the sole primary diagnosis, the ICU stay length, the outcome of the main processing, and a contact telephone number for the ICU patient.</s><s>All patients with craniocerebral disease were verified using their electronic medical records (an emergency cranial CT scan upon admission) and were assigned an initial GCS score and an acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score.</s></p><p><s>The time window of the ICU stay for most patients was between 3 and 7 days.</s><s>Early mortality was assessed during the first 7 days of the critical illness.</s><s>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a person who is over 65 years old as geriatric.</s><s>Therefore, patients were divided into a geriatric group and a non-geriatric group to compare the risks of critical illness between age groups.</s></p><p><s>Death events in the ICU and their causes were identified through medical record notes and from follow-up information.</s><s>Follow-up information was from our physician who was conducted inquiries by phone to the patient's closest living relative on day 7 of discharge from the ICU.</s><s>Intensive care and neurology experts conducted a retrospective statistical analysis of the data of the study population during the 2-year period.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In previous epidemiological surveys of prehospital emergency care, altered mental status <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and trauma <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> have been reported to have the highest incidence rates.</s><s>However, this study found that the incidences of these ailments among critically ill patients in the ICU were different from those observed in previous prehospital emergency care studies.</s><s>We found that stroke (35.1%, 23.8/100,000 PY) had the highest incidence rate, followed by trauma and TBI (24.1%,16.4/100,000</s><s>PY).</s><s>The latter incidence may be due to the number of mild condition patients with prehospital trauma and TBI that may have been managed outside the ICU.</s><s>This has been confirmed by a recent study that reported that only 20% of TBI cases account for admission to the ICU <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Conversely, epidemiological studies have confirmed that the incidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and mortality rate for stroke are very high in China <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it is likely that the care of patients with stroke has become a primary objective of ICU management.</s><s>The incidence of SICH varies in countries around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, but recent studies have confirmed that the SICH incidence rate is highest in Asians (40.8-51.8/</s><s>100,000 PY) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s>According to our study, SICH is a main cause of critical illness among patients admitted to the ICU, which suggests that more than 1/3 of patients with SICH need ICU care.</s><s>Moreover, the fatality rate for patients with SICH within the first 7 days of admission was very high (42.2%)</s><s>and similar to the fatality rate after 1 month (43-52%) that has been reported by other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>TBI is the primary cause of injury-related death and disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, although its exact incidence is unclear.</s><s>Our current study showed that TBI (16.8%, 11.4/100,000 PY) was the second most common cause of ICU admission.</s><s>TBI has a mortality rate of approximately 40.0% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and a disability rate of 57.4% <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, our data showed that the fatality rate within the first 7 days of admission was also high in cases of TBI (36.6%).</s><s>However, the risks of death from TBI, heart failure/myocardial infarction, severe cerebral infarction, and respiratory failure were significantly higher in the geriatric group than in the non-geriatric group.</s><s>This finding indicates that older age is an important risk factor for death from most critical illnesses in the general ICU, which is consistent with a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and may be related to that the older patients is more likely to develop an acutely fatal multiple organ failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>On the contrary, the risk of death from SICH in the two groups was similar, and the SICH incidence results suggested a trend toward an increase in the younger population.</s><s>This has been confirmed by one recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Prior studies have shown that sepsis and septic shock account for 10% of ICU cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, whereas this study identified only 48 such cases (2.9%).</s><s>Because most sepsis or septic shock diagnoses are secondary to another disease, our result may be related to our study criteria, which examined only the first diagnosis (primary disease).</s><s>These patients had been transferred to specialist  wards or information on sepsis/septic shock had not been included in the diagnosis.</s><s>Surprisingly, the combined incidence of SICH and TBI was almost equal to the sum of the general ICU admissions for other critical patients.</s><s>This strongly suggests that addressing these two critical diseases should be a public health priority and is deserving of further attention.</s></p><p><s>Although this study was conducted in one ICU, this ICU was the county's only ICU with a referral center.</s><s>Therefore, we believe that our data are informative because the results of this study are more likely to represent the true epidemic spectrum of critical illness.</s><s>However, certain limitations should be acknowledged.</s><s>First, although this was a prospective registration, a small number of critically ill patients may be underrepresented due to a lack of standardized criteria for defining critical illness in this population.</s><s>Second, because our registration only selected a sole primary diagnosis in the ICU, some patients with sequential liver or renal failure were not documented.</s><s>This may have been the cause of the low frequencies of liver and renal failures that we observed.</s><s>Additionally, the causes of coma were difficult to identify because numerous comatose patients had been intubated and could not consent to brain magnetic resonance examination.</s><s>However, patients with unexplained comas were rare, so this was unlikely to produce a bias in the population of critically ill patients with neurological conditions.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the rate of critical illness was high in Shuyang County in northern China.</s><s>The most common illnesses that required care in the ICU were SICH and TBI, and both of these critical illnesses carried a higher risk of death than other illnesses.</s><s>This strongly suggests that addressing these two conditions should be a public health priority and is deserving of further attention.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.
