<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods Setting</head><p><s>Froedtert and Medical College of Wisconsin Hospital is a 536 bed tertiary care academic medical center that primarily serves a large metropolitan area in southeastern Wisconsin and functions as a referral center for Wisconsin and northern Illinois.</s><s>From a pool of approximately 350 referral centers, more than 200 critically ill patients are transferred to the Froedtert medical ICU each year.</s><s>Transferring locations include emergency departments (EDs) and ICUs.</s><s>The medical ICU at Froedtert Hospital is a 26-bed closed unit staffed by board certified academic medical intensivists and is separate from the institution's surgical, cardiac, neurological, and transplant ICUs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>We performed an institutional review board (PRO00022374) approved single-center retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database.</s><s>We included patients equal to or greater than 18 years old who were transferred to the Froedtert medical ICU from an outside hospital between 1 January 2010 and 15 April 2014.</s><s>We excluded patients who were initially accepted for transfer but were not physically transferred to the Froedtert medical ICU.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p><s>Our study sheds light on biologically plausible and potentially modifiable variables associated with 24-h mortality after inter-hospital medical ICU transfer.</s><s>Identifying variables associated with 24-h mortality is important for several reasons.</s><s>First, examining mortality at 24-h identifies risk factors in a potentially vulnerable population that may not benefit from inter-hospital transfer, and instead, may be harmed by the potential complications and expense of transfer.</s><s>Knowledge of the risk factors within the framework of our proposed nomogram risk stratifies patients for referring hospitals and accepting providers before considering inter-hospital transfer.</s><s>Second, patients and families can be informed of their risk for mortality after inter-hospital transfer to guide shared-decision making on appropriateness and readiness of transfer.</s><s>Third, the organ dysfunctions which summate into a SOFA score are potentially modifiable.</s><s>It is unclear if optimizing therapies prior to transfer reduces the risk of mortality after inter-hospital transfer.</s><s>Finally, the Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act (EMTALA) of 1986 regulates which patients should be accepted, refused, and/or re-assessed for transfer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>Pending validation, our proposed nomogram can serve as a dynamic research tool to inform changes to EMTALA regulations and inter-hospital transfer guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Further studies evaluating the validity of our findings are needed.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure1.</s><s>The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows the true positive rate (y-axis) and false positive rate (x-axis) for each threshold of the predicted probability of mortality within 24 h after inter-hospital transfer from the multiple logistic regression model.</s><s>The area under the curve (AUC) is provided as a measure of model performance.</s><s>For reference, an AUC of 1 is perfect prediction and an AUC of 0.5 means our model is no better than random guessing.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="4,314.59,338.68,207.88,182.21" type="bitmap" /></figure>
