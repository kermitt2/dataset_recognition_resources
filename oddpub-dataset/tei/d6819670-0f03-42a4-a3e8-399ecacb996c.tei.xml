<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rumen fermentation characteristics and blood metabolites</head><p><s>Rumen fermentation parameters such as pH, NH 3 -N, VFAs, CH 4 , rumen microbe population and BUN were measured to determine the relationship between the dietary treatments and rumen ecology.</s><s>As the results, rumen pH and NH 3 -N were within normal range of 6.3 to 7.2 and 15 to 30 mg %, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>However, NH 3 -N tended to increase with the increasing of SG intake.</s><s>It was found that the utilization of high protein forage needs carbohydrate (starch and sugar) to be synchronized for efficient microbial protein production with a decrease in NH 3 -N concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>In this experiment, it was found that reducing carbohydrate supply from concentrates resulted in increased NH 3 -N.</s><s>The feeding of SG/0.5C showed similar response in these parameters with RS/1.0C.</s><s>Using higher quality roughage provided more nutrients to rumen microbes for growth and resulted in increased microbial population and rumen fermentation end-products expressed in total VFAs and propionic acid concentration.</s><s>Total VFA, propionic acid, bacterial and protozoal populations were highest in the heifers which received SG/1.0C as related with feed intake and digestibility as compared with RS/1.0C.</s><s>Moreover, it could decrease CH4 emission that might be due to the nutrient composition of roughage influencing on methane yield, particularly hexose fermented and VFAs during the fermentation process in the rumen.</s><s>Increasing of propionate with decreasing of acetate and butyrate by increasing of NFC in the diet resulted in decreased methane production.</s><s>Forages that have a high content of NFC, generally support fermentation that increase production of propionate, which competes for hydrogen with methane production.</s><s>Moreover, forages that have less NDF content could increase digestibility resulting in producing less methane <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, it was found that decreasing concentrate intake would decrease the protozoal population.</s><s>The number of protozoa was related to level of concentrate feeding with reduction of concentrate leading to decreased protozoal population.</s><s>Jouany <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> reported that dietary factors, such as roughage to concentrate ratio, forage quality and level of feeding influenced protozoal populations.</s><s>Another experiment using cassava hay as high quality roughage to reduce concentrate supplementation resulted in improved rumen ecology, particularly increased rumen bacterial and decreased protozoal population, which was associated with enhanced feeds digestibility, milk yield and milk components in dairy cows <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s>This agrees with Martinez et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref> who found that in sheep a high ratio of concentrate feeding (30:70, R:C ratio) increased total number of protozoa as compared to a low ratio of concentrate (70:30, R:C ratio).</s><s>In this case, reducing concentrate supplementation and therefore reducing starch and sugar that are the main feed resources for protozoa resulted in decreased protozoal growth.</s><s>In addition, the populations of fungi were increased by reducing of concentrate supplementation due to increasing the roughage intake improved growing conditions of fungi.</s><s>Kamra et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> reported that the fungal growth was stimulated by the high fiber diets of buffalo when compared to high concentrate diets which rich in non-structural carbohydrates.</s><s>These numbers of fungi propose to get adhered to the feed particle and related to the digestion efficiency in ruminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, it could explain why the highest numbers of fungi were associated with the total SG feeding, with better NDF digestibility than an RS/1.0C.</s><s>The current study revealed that rumen microorganism populations were highly related to nutrient digestibility, which has a significant role in feed degradation in the rumen, particularly bacterial and fungal populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, this study suggests that feeding of concentrate supplementation at 0.5% BW with good quality roughage would support efficient rumen fermentation as resulted in the fermentation end-products.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p><s>In conclusion, 1.0% BW of concentrate supplementation with SG improves feed utilization and rumen fermentation.</s><s>Higher quality roughage could reduce concentrate supplementation when compared to lower quality roughage.</s><s>High level of roughage feeding, in which 0.5% BW of concentrate supplementation with SG is recommended.</s><s>Nevertheless, future studies should be conducted provide more data on its feeding value to produce milk and meat.</s></p></div>
