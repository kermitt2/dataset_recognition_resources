95% CI, 6.2-12.3)</s><s>and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.0-3.5)</s><s>times higher in patients with IS (IR, 4.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 2.4-7.6)</s><s>than in controls (IR, 2.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4).</s><s>This elevated mortality persisted over time (Figure) and was mainly supported by a high rate of deaths from acute vascular events: vascular mortality rate, 3.5 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 1.9-5.9) in patients with MI, 2.1 per 1000 person-years (95%, 0.8-4.5) in patients with IS, and 0.3 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.1-0.7) in controls.</s></p><p><s>When counting both fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, the IR was highest in patients with IS at 14.1 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 9.9-19.4),</s><s>corresponding to an HR of 12.9 (95% CI, 6.7-25.0)</s><s>compared with controls (Table <ref type="table">)</ref>.</s><s>The rate was 12.1 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 8.7-16.2) in patients with MI, with an HR of 9.8 (95% CI, 5.0-19.4) in contrast with controls.</s></p><p><s>In patients with MI, the rate of cardiac events was 10.1 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 7.5-13.8)</s><s>whereas the rate of cerebral events was 1.9 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.8-3.8).</s><s>In patients with IS, the reverse picture was observed, with a rate of cerebral events of 11.1 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 7.5-15.9),</s><s>whereas the risk of cardiac events was 2.7 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 1.2-5.4).</s><s>Discussion | Young women who survived a cardiovascular event have a high long-term mortality and morbidity when compared with the general population.</s><s>The recurrence pattern is true to type (ie, the recurrence rate for cerebrovascular disease is highest in patients with IS whereas the risk of cardiac events is highest in patients with MI).</s><s>This finding is supported by studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> that investigated IS and MI separately.</s></p><p><s>A limitation of this study is the possibility of survival bias owing to the case-control nature of the study cohort, and therefore absolute risks for the period shortly after the first event may have been underestimated.</s><s>Moreover, procedures and risk factors change over time, which reduces the generalizability of our results, a problem of all long-term follow-up studies.</s><s>Our findings provide direct insight into the consequences of cardiovascular diseases in young women, which persist for decades after the initial event, stressing the importance of lifelong prevention strategies.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">.5 (0.2-1.0) 1 [Reference] 1 [Reference] 1 [Reference] 1 [Reference]</formula><p><s>a The hazard ratios are obtained by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models and are all adjusted for age.</s><s>b The hazard ratios are also adjusted for smoking (ie, smoking at least 1 cigarette a day in the year before the event), alcohol consumption (ie, ingestion of at least 1 glass of alcohol per week), and body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).</s><s>c The hazard ratios are adjusted for for smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index and additionally for history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. <ref type="bibr">d</ref> The hazard ratios are adjusted for smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia and additionally for family history of a cardiovascular event (ie, any acute cardiovascular event before 60 years of age in a first relative).</s></p></div>
