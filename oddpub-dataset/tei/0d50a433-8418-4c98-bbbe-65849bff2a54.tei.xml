<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Patients and Methods</head><p><s>We retrospectively analyzed 33 consecutive patients who underwent a bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde (BioGlue) sealed fish-mouth closure of the pancreatic remnant during distal pancreatectomy for primary malignant or cystic tumors of the pancreas as well as for chronic pancreatitis at the Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow, between January 1, 2012, and January 1, 2015.</s><s>All operations were performed by five experienced visceral surgeons who were all educated about the technical steps of this novel procedure as part of the inclusion criteria of this study.</s><s>This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments and approved by the institutional ethic committee.</s></p><p><s>2.1.</s><s>Surgical Technique.</s><s>DP was performed as open surgery in each patient.</s><s>The extent of the pancreatic resection, as well as the need for additional lymphadenectomy and splenectomy, was determined based on the underlying disease and/or cancer stages.</s><s>The pancreatic resection was performed in all cases using electrocautery in an incision line, which creates a fish-mouth shaped cutting surface of the pancreatic remnant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>After achievement of local hemostasis, subsequent closure of the main pancreatic duct (MDP) was performed by a stitch ligation using 4-0 polypropylene sutures (Prolene, Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany).</s><s>As a next step single U-shaped 4-0 polypropylene sutures were placed along the cutting surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde (BioGlue, Cryolife Inc., Kennesaw, GA, USA) was then administered into the fish-mouth cavity of the pancreatic remnant in a step-by-step approach  before the tying of each suture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>No additional covering of the pancreatic remnant was performed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>An intra-abdominal drain was placed at the pancreatic stump and if additional splenectomy was performed another intraabdominal drain was positioned against the left subdiaphragmatic region.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Peri-and Postoperative Course.</head><p><s>A splenectomy was performed in 27 of the 32 patients (84%).</s><s>Seven patients (22%) underwent an additional multivisceral resection with partial or total gastrectomy in 4 patients (13%), colon resection in 5 patients (16%), and/or partial adrenalectomy in 3 patients (9%).</s><s>The mean operation time was 199 minutes (116-282 minutes).</s><s>No patient required intraoperative administration of packed red blood cells.</s><s>The pancreas tissue texture was found to be soft in 13 patients (41%) and hard in 19 patients (59%) according to the intraoperative assessment of the operating surgeon.</s><s>Major postoperative morbidity &gt; Clavien II occurred in 5 of the 32 patients (16%).</s><s>Three patients (9%) developed a clinically relevant POPF Grade B.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>Postoperative pancreatic fistula formation remains the most relevant complication after distal pancreatectomy with a major impact on postoperative quality of life as well as on health care costs.</s><s>In patients with an underlying malignant disease POPF may in addition lead to a delayed onset of further essential adjuvant treatment which has been identified as an independent risk factor for early peritoneal recurrence and decreased overall survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Numerous surgical techniques have therefore been described in an attempt to possibly decrease the incidence and impact of POPF.</s><s>However, even two recent prospective randomized trials failed to identify an ideal technique for the procedure with the pancreatic remnant.</s><s>The DISPACT trial compared a stapler versus hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant and the incidence of clinically relevant POPF Grades B and C was reported with 20% and 21% in each group <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Analogously Carter et al. analyzed the effect of the use of an autologous falciform ligament patch with fibrin glue for both stapler and hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant and reported a rate of clinically relevant POPF Grades B and C in 18% of their patients which did not differ significantly from the control group <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>The question of an optimal surgical technique for distal pancreatectomy therefore remains to be debated controversially.</s><s>At our institution we have recently developed a novel technique of a bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde (BioGlue) sealed fish-mouth closure of the pancreatic remnant during distal pancreatectomy, which was analyzed in this study.</s><s>We could demonstrate that our technique was feasible with a distinct positive impact on clinically relevant POPF.</s><s>Only three of our 32 patients (9%) developed a POPF Grade B, which could be treated conservatively, and no POPF Grade C was observed.</s></p><p><s>With a clinically relevant POPF rate below 10% our results are thus to be seen promising especially in comparison to the results of the present prospective as well as retrospective studies <ref type="bibr">[5, 13-15, 17-20, 30]</ref>.</s><s>The concept of bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde application in pancreatic surgery is not new.</s><s>Fisher et al. have previously investigated the use of BioGlue in an attempt to possibly reduce POPF and demonstrated general safety but no relevant clinical benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Most patients in this study however underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) instead of DP and the bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde was only applied on the completed anastomosis.</s><s>We modified this technique by creating a fish-mouth shaped pancreatic remnant with a ligated main pancreatic duct (MPD).</s><s>The bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde (BioGlue) was then applied into the fish-mouth cavity before the tying of previously placed single U-shaped sutures.</s><s>Analogously to Ohwada et al. we believe that our technique enables the bovine serum albuminglutaraldehyde adhesive to stay within the anastomosis region as opposed to the external application described by Fisher et al. in which the BioGlue may rather likely dissolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The creation of a fish-mouth shaped cutting margin of the pancreatic remnant may of course be challenging especially in a rather thin gland and may also be associated with an increased bleeding tendency <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Also the identification and routinely performed ligation of the main pancreatic duct which is considered an individual factor for POPF reduction may not always be possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s><s>We did however not experience any intraoperative problems of this kind.</s></p><p><s>The use of bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde (BioGlue) as a sealant is of course rather expensive especially in comparison to widely used fibrin glue.</s><s>However, several studies showed that the use of fibrin for sealing the cutting surface after PD or DP as well as for occlusion of the main pancreatic duct was not associated with a reduction of POPF <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the limited clinical evidence fibrin may be considered a poor adhesive for pancreatic surgery because it takes a long time to set up and may therefore be swiped or washed away easily.</s><s>Bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde in contrast reaches maximal strength within 2 minutes after application with an additional benefit of local hemostatic properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>We believe that a quick transformation of the liquid glue to a flexible hydrogel is especially important in this setting to prevent a loss of attachment to the applied surface.</s></p><p><s>Complications of bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde (BioGlue) application reported in cardiovascular and pulmonary surgery include nerve damage, local or embolic vascular obstruction, and foreign body reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37]</ref>.</s><s>Lämsä et al. have previously analyzed the histological effects of tissue adhesives on the pancreas and reported acinar cell vacuolization and necrosis together with moderate edema and leukocyte infiltration in each adhesive tested with however no relevant differences between fibrin and bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde (BioGlue) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s>In our study we did not observe any of such complications reaching a clinical manifestation especially no clinical or laboratory signs of a postoperative pancreatitis.</s></p><p><s>It should of course be noted that any kind of additional physical barrier may lead to a delayed onset or at least clinical presentation of POPF <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s><s>As part of our internal treatment standard patients were however only discharged if all parameters indicating infection were low and the patient was feeling well which is reflected by a prolonged median hospital stay of 12 days in our study.</s><s>In addition patients were observed in our outpatient department for a postoperative period of at least 30 days.</s><s>A potentially undetected delayed onset of POPF may thus be excluded in our patient population.</s></p><p><s>A reduction in the incidence of POPF may of course not just be achieved by restricting on surgical technical factors alone.</s><s>Several studies have reported an improved postoperative outcome if EPT or pancreatic stent placement were performed prior to DP <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>This potential benefit is however outweighed by an increased risk for directly intervention related morbidity which is reported to occur in up to 57% of all patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</s><s>In our study ERCP with EPT and/or stent placement was thus only performed in 2 of our 32 patients (6%) and only considered in patients with suspected benign diseases in an attempt to avoid any additional risk for a potential delayed onset of treatment in patients with an underlying malignant disease.</s><s>The statistical power of our study is of course limited by the small sample size of patients.</s><s>Also the retrospective study design may have led to an unintended selection bias.</s><s>However, as a conclusion of our study we could demonstrate that our technique of a bovine serum albumin-glutaraldehyde sealed fish-mouth closure of the pancreatic remnant was technically feasible and safe with a high potential to decrease the incidence as well as the impact of clinically relevant POPF after DP.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
