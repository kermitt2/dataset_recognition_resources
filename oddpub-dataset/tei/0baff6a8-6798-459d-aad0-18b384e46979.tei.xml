<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and population</head><p><s>Between June 2009 and September 2010, the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) study recruited pregnant women of Chinese, Malay and Indian ethnicities who visited two public maternity units (KK Hospital and National University Hospital) in Singapore for their first ultrasound scan before the 15th week of pregnancy.</s><s>The main exclusion criteria were non-homogeneous ethnic background (up to the four grandparents of the offspring), intention not to deliver in the study centers or not to remain in Singapore for the following 5 years.</s><s>From the 1247 pregnant women recruited, 1171 singleton newborns were included and followed regularly.</s><s>The recruitment and follow-up protocol has been detailed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>All participants signed written informed consent at enrolment.</s><s>The study received ethical approval from the National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board and the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data collection</head><p><s>Sociodemographic and health information was obtained at enrolment as part of an interviewer-administered questionnaire: ethnicity (Chinese/Malay/Indian), maternal and paternal age, maternal highest education level (secondary or less/post-secondary/university), marital status (single/married), maternal place of birth (Singapore/other), accommodation type (public/private housing), monthly household income (&lt;2000/2000-3999/ 4000-5999/≥6000 Singapore dollars), and maternal prepregnancy weight (kg).</s><s>During the clinic visit at 26-28 weeks' gestation, maternal height (cm) was measured, and pre-pregnancy and pregnancy behavioral information was obtained through an interviewer-administered questionnaire: tobacco (yes/no) and alcohol consumption (yes/no), television viewing time (6 categories from &lt;1 h to &gt;5 h daily) and physical activity (frequency and duration of light-moderate, moderate and vigorous intensity activities).</s><s>Information on the offspring's date of birth, sex and birth order was extracted from medical records.</s><s>Paternal data were obtained from the fathers when they attended (80% of them did) postnatal visits with their child at 24 or 36 months: highest education level and television viewing time (same categories as for mothers) via interviewer-administered questionnaires, while weight (kg) and height (cm) were both measured.</s><s>Time point and measurement method of the collected data are summarized in Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Maternal and paternal age were categorized into 4 groups: &lt;25, 25-29, 30-34 and ≥35 years for mothers and &lt;30, 30-34, 35-39, and ≥40 years for fathers.</s><s>Maternal prepregnancy and paternal BMI was derived from weight divided by height squared (m 2 ), then categorized according to WHO criteria (&lt;18.5, 18.5-24.9,</s><s>25.0-29.9,</s><s>and ≥30.0 kg/m 2 ).</s><s>Maternal and paternal television viewing times were categorized as &lt;1 h, 1-2 h, 2-3 h or ≥3 h/day.</s><s>Maternal physical activity before pregnancy was categorized as insufficiently, sufficiently or highly active, as detailed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screen viewing time (SVT)</head><p><s>Screen use data were assessed at the 2-and 3-year clinic visits as part of a questionnaire on quantitating children's time spent in indoor and outdoor activities.</s></p><p><s>Trained interviewers asked the parents how much time, in 5-min increments, their child spent on average using screens on weekdays and weekend days.</s><s>Three types of devices (with examples enunciated to the participants) were considered: 1) television and television games (e.g., PlayStation®, Wii™, Xbox™), further referred to as 'television, ' 2) computers, and 3) hand-held video games and hand phones (e.g., Game Boy®, hand-phone games), including tablets, hereinafter referred to as hand-held devices.</s><s>Although the item 'computer' was enunciated without example, the interviewers were trained to clarify, if necessary, that it includes both desktop and laptop computers.</s><s>For each type, weekday and weekend day times were averaged to obtain device-specific SVT in hours/day ([weekday × 5 + weekend day × 2]/7).</s><s>Total SVT was calculated as the sum of the times for the three types of device.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>Total and device-specific SVT at 2 and 3 years, and the changes between those ages, are described as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and median and interquartile range (IQR), while categorical variables are summarized using frequencies and percentages.</s><s>Spearman's correlation was used to assess the degree of SVT tracking between 2 and 3 years.</s></p><p><s>Potential predictors of SVT at 2 and 3 years were examined in several steps.</s><s>First, parental and child predictors were screened by linear regression to identify those associated with SVT in unadjusted models.</s><s>Second, multivariable linear regression models were built using a forward selection approach and p ≤ 0.25 as an entering criterion.</s><s>To maximize statistical power, multivariable analyses were restricted to the sample with complete data for both the offspring and the mother (n = 910), but not necessarily with complete paternal data (since they were missing for n = 270).</s><s>Multivariable models with the paternal variables were built afterwards on the sample with complete data for the three family members (n = 640).</s><s>We also carried out a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation for missing paternal data.</s><s>Third, repeated measures linear regression model with an unstructured variancecovariance matrix was used to account for nonindependence among the repeated outcomes for each individual assessed at both time points.</s><s>This also permitted us to use a single model for children whose SVT was estimated at one time point only (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Interactions between the predictors and time points were tested to evaluate whether predictors were associated differentially with SVT at 2 and 3 years.</s><s>Significant interaction denotes an association between the predictor and the change in SVT from 2 to 3 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, but has the additional advantage of including all children assessed at either age; p-interaction was considered significant when &lt;0.10, since tests of interaction tend to be statistically under-powered.</s><s>Interactions between child sex and ethnicity, and child sex and parental television time were also examined.</s><s>Finally, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine whether the predictors of total SVT also predicted the odds of ≥2 and ≥4 h/day.</s><s>All statistical analyses were carried out with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) during the second half of 2016.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Overall, 910 parents reported their child's SVT, including 812 reporting SVT at both ages (n = 812) and those who reported at 2 years only (n = 49) or 3 years only (n = 49) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>At age 2 years, the children spent an average of 2.4 ± 2.2 h of total SVT, mainly contributed by 1.6 ± 1.7 h of television and 0.7 ± 1.0 of hand-held devices (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Fewer children engaged in any computer use: 21 and 18% at 2 and 3 years, respectively.</s><s>Thus, computer use was not examined further separately.</s><s>At age 3 years, total SVT increased on average by 0.33 ± 2.42 h/day, mainly owing to an increase in hand-held device viewing time.</s><s>SVTs at 2 and 3 years were moderately correlated (r = 0.45 for television, r = 0.42 hand-held devices, r = 0.49 for total SVT, all p &lt; 0.0001, not shown).</s></p><p><s>The study sample at 2 and 3 years of age is described in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>. Predictors of child SVT that passed the multivariable model selection criteria were ethnicity, household income, parental age and education, and higher maternal television viewing time (all p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>Marital status, maternal place of birth, accommodation type, maternal tobacco and alcohol consumption, and parental BMI did not reach the model selection criteria (p &gt; 0.25, not shown) and were therefore excluded from the subsequent multivariable models.</s><s>Although not associated with SVT, child sex and exact age were forced into the models.</s><s>No interaction was found between child sex and ethnicity, nor between child sex and parental television viewing time.</s><s>In logistic regression models, the predictors of total SVT ≥2 and ≥4 h/day were similar to those observed in the linear mixed-effect regressions (not shown).</s><s>Finally, sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation for missing paternal viewing time showed comparable results (not shown).</s></p></div>
