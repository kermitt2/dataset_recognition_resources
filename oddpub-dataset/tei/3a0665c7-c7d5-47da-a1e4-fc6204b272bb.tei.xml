instead of literature-based annotations.</s></p><p><s>In detail, RA transcriptomes of BM and blood monocytes overlapped with signatures of precursors in myelopoietic differentiation, indicating a so-called 'left-shift'.</s><s>Accelerated monocytopoiesis in RA-BM can be deduced from patterns increased in early (HSC, multipotent progenitors (MPP), megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP), common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP), early and late promyelocytes (PM) and MY) but reduced in late-stage myelopoiesis (MMs, band cells (BCs) and PMN cells and from increased G-CSF response patterns.</s><s>'Left-shift' in RA-PB monocytes is indicated by a largely extended G-CSF response pattern, which includes late stage myelopoiesis (MM, BC and PMN) as well as typical monocyte genes of the classical CD16 − subset.</s><s>Interestingly, development up to PMs still includes proliferation and subsequent stages more phagocytosis-related capabilities, suggesting that 'left-shift' in the BM is dominated by proliferation and in the blood by maturation processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref></s><s>is accelerated monocytopoiesis is supported by earlier observations that RA haematopoietic precursors differentiate in vitro more rapidly into CD14 + HLA-DR expressing monocytes than non-inflammatory controls. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34</ref></s><s>6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> In line with this concept, we showed that RA-BM monocytes expressed higher levels of integrins ITGA4 and ITGB1 like their early precursors and also elevated sheddase ADAM10, which is involved in their release from BM and also induced by G-CSF. <ref type="bibr">35 36 38</ref></s><s>Egress of monocytes from BM was also associated with CCR2 activation and desensitisation of CXCR4 anchoring to BM stromal cells. <ref type="bibr">10 11 39</ref></s><s>Both chemokine receptor transcripts were highly expressed on BM monocytes in both RA and OA.</s><s>In line with a 'left-shift' in RA-PB monocytes, CCR2 expression was increased in RA and decreased during differentiation from CD14 + CD16 − to CD14 + CD16 + subsets. <ref type="bibr">8 13 40</ref></s><s>In contrast to RA, monocyte genes increased in OA overlapped with more differentiated progenitors in the BM and with a more differentiated subset of CD16 + monocytes in the blood.</s></p><p><s>On this background, cytometry also reflected the 'leftshifted' monocytopoiesis by reduced CD16 expression on classical and intermediate monocytes in RA-BM when compared with OA.</s><s>Additionally, the decreased frequency of non-classical CD14 + CD16 + RA monocytes in blood indicated reduced terminal differentiation in RA.</s><s>Altogether, a 'left-shift' pattern and reduced differentiation in RA-PB raise the hypothesis of increased production, a shorter circulation time and faster migration into inflamed tissues.</s><s>These conclusions are in line with cell tracking experiments in macaques, performed by in vivo BrdU staining, which is not possible in humans.</s><s>These experiments demonstrated that lower CD14 expression on classical monocytes was related to younger cells and that the frequency of the terminally differentiated non-classical subset increased with circulation time. <ref type="bibr">9 41</ref></s><s>hen investigating the joint compartment, the most obvious change was the absence of classical monocytes.</s><s>The dominant population was similar to the intermediate phenotype of blood and revealed even further increase of HLA-DR, CD14 and CD163 expression compared with blood.</s><s>As these markers were not different between RA and OA monocyte subsets in the blood, this indicates that activation occurred in the joint and that it was related to the intermediate subset.</s><s>This is also emphasised by the high concentrations of shedded sCD14 and sCD163 and of released S100P in RA SF.</s><s>The second population of CD14 + CD16 + SF monocytes was small and may, according to the described phenotype, reflect differentiation towards typical tissue macrophages, which may not propagate activation and inflammation.</s></p><p><s>Recently, we demonstrated that response to MTX in RA is related to a predominance of innate immune activation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42</ref></s><s>orrespondingly, Ponchel et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">43</ref> associated higher naïve T cell frequency with response to MTX.</s><s>Thus, immunopathology of RA appears not independent of innate triggers and becomes more aggressive and difficult to treat when adaptive immune response gains dominance.</s><s>Translating innate to adaptive immunity depends on monocytes, their activation by innate triggers, their antigen processing and presentation and their interaction with T cells.</s><s>This might explain why combination of MTX with biologicals advances treatment of RA patients with reduced naïve T cells and more lymphocyte involvement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">43</ref></s><s>5]<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref> Our results suggest that disease-specific triggering occurs in the joint, where search for biomarkers relevant for drug selection seems to be more promising.</s><s>How and to what extent monocytes are triggered and, consequently, what is the magnitude of the innate and adaptive immune system activation seem to be essential to improve insight into RA aetiopathogenesis.</s></p></div><figure
