<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: Phenotypes of childhood-onset asthma are characterized by distinct trajectories and functional features.</s><s>For atopy, definition of phenotypes during childhood is less clear.</s><s>Objective: We sought to define phenotypes of atopic sensitization over the first 6 years of life using a latent class analysis (LCA) integrating 3 dimensions of atopy: allergen specificity, time course, and levels of specific IgE (sIgE).</s><s>Methods: Phenotypes were defined by means of LCA in 680 children of the Multizentrische Allergiestudie (MAS) and 766 children of the Protection against allergy: Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE) birth cohorts and compared with classical nondisjunctive definitions of seasonal, perennial, and food sensitization with respect to atopic diseases and lung function.</s><s>Cytokine levels were measured in the PASTURE cohort.</s><s>Results: The LCA classified predominantly by type and multiplicity of sensitization (food vs inhalant), allergen combinations, and sIgE levels.</s><s>Latent classes were related to atopic disease manifestations with higher sensitivity and specificity than the classical definitions.</s><s>LCA detected consistently in both cohorts a distinct group of children with severe atopy characterized by high seasonal sIgE levels and a strong propensity for asthma; hay fever; eczema; and impaired lung function, also in children without an established asthma diagnosis.</s><s>Severe atopy was associated with an increased IL-5/IFN-g ratio.</s><s>A path analysis among sensitized children revealed that among all features of severe atopy, only excessive sIgE production early in life affected asthma risk.</s><s>Conclusions: LCA revealed a set of benign, symptomatic, and severe atopy phenotypes.</s><s>The severe phenotype emerged as a latent condition with signs of a dysbalanced immune response.</s><s>It determined high asthma risk through excessive sIgE production and directly affected impaired lung function.</s><s>(J Allergy Clin Immunol 2017;139:1935-45.)</s><s>Key words: Atopy, IgE, sensitization, asthma, lung function, cytokines, severe atopy, atopic diseases, latent class analysis, unsupervised clustering, path analysis, epidemiology Asthma and atopy often manifest concomitantly before school age, but the interrelation of both phenomena remains obscure, possibly because both conditions can result from a multitude of individual pathologies with complex interferences that blur the entire picture.</s><s>2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> However, these approaches are currently only emerging for atopy classification.</s></p><p><s>Because of cosensitizations, categorization by allergen specificity or type of sensitization is ambiguous and leads to overlapping groups, such as food, inhalant perennial, or inhalant seasonal sensitization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> However, it has been pointed out that all the above approaches are susceptible to investigator bias. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>This issue can be overcome by data-driven, unsupervised statistical methods, such as latent class analysis (LCA).</s><s>Until now, these approaches focused on allergen specificities at one 20 or several <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> time points but did not consider the strength of sensitization as assessed by IgE levels.</s></p><p><s>We appraised this omission a shortcoming given the wellknown disease relevance of IgE levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and therefore included this dimension in our analysis.</s><s>We applied LCA to 2 rather different birth cohorts: the urban Multizentrische Allergiestudie (MAS) cohort and the rural Protection against allergy: Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE) study.</s><s>The aim of this analysis was to compare LCA-derived classification with classical definitions of atopy based on carrier polymer system (CAP) classes and to relate both systems to manifestation of asthma, allergic diseases, cytokine expression, and lung function.</s><s>Finally, we sought to integrate the various aspects of atopy in a path model for asthma and lung function.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and population</head><p><s>Both birth cohorts were set up to study the development of childhood asthma and allergies.</s><s>MAS recruited 1314 healthy mature infants born in 1990 in 5 German cities (Berlin, D€ usseldorf, Freiburg, Mainz, and Munich). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s>Of those, 499 had risk factors for atopy (ie, increased cord blood IgE levels [&gt; _0.9 kU/L] or at least 2 atopic family members).</s><s>PASTURE recruited 1133 children in 2002 to 2005 from rural areas in 5 European countries: Austria, Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref></s><s>Children of mothers living on family-run livestock farms were assigned to the farm study group.</s><s>The reference study group comprised children of mothers from the same rural areas but not living on a farm.</s><s>Both studies were approved by the ethics committees of the participating institutions, and written informed consent was obtained from the children's parents or guardians.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>The analysis population consisted of 680 MAS cohort children (52% of 1314 at recruitment; Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref> As shown in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, the largest classes containing 71% (MAS) and 54% (PASTURE) of all children were characterized by the absence of sensitization and consequently labeled as unsensitized.</s><s>One MAS class and 2 PASTURE classes included mainly children with sensitization to food allergens.</s><s>The MAS cohort children in the food class were predominantly monosensitized to cow's milk or hen's egg; in the PASTURE cohort the larger class was sensitized only to cow's milk, and the other class was sensitized to food allergens beyond cow's milk.</s><s>The remaining classes represented mainly inhalant sensitization.</s><s>In the PASTURE cohort one class included children with sensitization predominantly to either seasonal or perennial inhalant allergens.</s><s>The corresponding MAS cohort children were grouped into 2 classes with either sensitization to seasonal or mite allergens.</s><s>The smallest class within each study was termed severe atopy for its specific features, as explained below.</s></p><p><s>A hallmark of the severe atopy class was sensitization predominantly to seasonal allergens up to CAP class 3, with a steep increase in the prevalence of sensitization before year 4 or 5. Food cosensitization occurred in the majority of this LC (MAS, 88%; PASTURE, 67%) and mite cosensitization occurred in a relevant proportion (MAS, 31%; PASTURE, 26%) at year 6 and CAP class 2. In the severe atopy class of the MAS cohort, food cosensitization was very common already at year 1 (81%, CAP class 2).</s><s>In the PASTURE cohort food sensitization at year 1 occurred in 22% when considering a cutoff level of 0.2 kU/L.</s><s>Taken together, LCA grouped mainly for allergen specificity (food vs inhalant classes), for strength of sensitization, and partially for temporal patterns.</s></p><p><s>LCs are mutually exclusive and integrate information across CAP classes and over various time points, whereas classical definitions of sensitization, such as sIgE to any inhalant or any food allergens, can overlap and depend on the underlying CAP class and time point of measurement.</s><s>Although both systems were comparable at the most suitable time points and CAP cutoff levels as determined by receiver operating characteristic curves   LCs related to inhalant sensitization corresponded to a symptomatic phenotype with risk of asthma yet normal lung function.</s><s>In contrast, the LC severe atopy was characterized by impaired lung function and a much higher propensity for atopic disease.</s></p><p><s>To better understand the singular phenomenon of severe atopy and to contrast it with benign and symptomatic sensitized children, we assessed the biologically relevant features of atopy.</s><s>Although the LCA discriminated well between oligovalent and polyvalent sensitization, polyvalence was not specific for severe atopy but also characterized food sensitization in the PASTURE cohort (  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, severe atopy differed from the other LCs with respect to the ratio of IL-5 over IFN-g expression, thereby reflecting the activation of T H 2 rather than T H 1 subsets (P &lt; .01;</s><s>Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5, B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To elucidate the mutual relation between severe atopy and the various features differentiating it from the benign and symptomatic phenotypes, we performed a path analysis (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</s><s>In both studies asthma was determined by severe atopy through an excessive increment in sIgE to seasonal allergens during the first 6 years and high sIgE levels at 6 years.</s><s>Although including only 5% of all children, severe atopy explained 20% of all sensitized asthma cases.</s><s>Early sensitization to food allergens, T H 2/T H 1 ratio, and  polysensitization were similarly determined directly or indirectly by severe atopy but not related to asthma.</s></p><p><s>Similarly, as in atopic subjects also in the entire population of both cohorts, the inverse association of sIgE levels and FEV 1 was completely explained by severe atopy (change in estimate, 104%), as held partially true for the association of asthma and FEV 1 (change in estimate, 38%).</s><s>This was not unexpected because the severe atopy class contained also a substantial proportion of children without current wheeze or an established asthma diagnosis but with FEV 1 values within the lowest decile (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Using LCA, we classified preschool children for sensitization patterns considering the 3 dimensions of allergen specificity, time course, and strength of sensitization.</s><s>The resulting LCs were related to manifested atopic disease with higher sensitivity and specificity compared with classical definitions of sensitization.</s><s>The food LCs of both cohorts emerged as a benign atopy phenotype without individual risk and family history of asthma.</s><s>A symptomatic phenotype was found in the inhalant LCs with substantial risk of atopic diseases but without impaired lung function.</s><s>The severe atopy phenotype represented by the LC of severe atopy comprised children with high sIgE levels to seasonal allergens, much stronger associations with atopic disease, and low FEV 1 values, even in those without an established asthma diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>A major advantage of this analysis was the comprehensive approach covering the first 6 years of life, with detailed information on various major allergen specificities at different levels.</s><s>Missing values were successfully imputed, thereby providing a complete data set for 1446 children without observable selection  from the originally recruited populations.</s><s>A further strength was the replication of the main findings in 2 rather different birth cohorts.</s></p><p><s>Admittedly, not all LCs were fully congruent between the studies: the LC with monosensitization to cow's milk at low sIgE levels was specific for the PASTURE cohort and might be explained by the rather common consumption of cow's milk in this rural population.</s><s>Correspondingly, in the MAS cohort a specific mite class emerged, reflecting the relevance of this allergen in an urban cohort.</s><s>An additional characteristic of the MAS cohort was the higher proportion of early sensitization to food allergens in the LC of severe atopy, possibly resulting from the recruitment focus on children with increased sIgE levels in cord blood.</s><s>Nevertheless, these peculiarities do not interfere with the core results of this analysis.</s></p><p><s>The role of sIgE in the manifestation of atopic diseases has long been discussed controversially.</s><s>In 1989, Burrows et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> suggested a linear relation between total IgE levels and asthma risk.</s><s>Ten years later, the question arose whether increases in total IgE levels were to some extent determined by specific wheeze phenotypes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s>Soon thereafter, Illi et al 11 hypothesized that ''an underlying condition drives both a certain pattern of sensitization and the development of childhood asthma.''</s><s>5]<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> Against this background of conflicting hypotheses, we sought a unifying concept.</s><s>Without providing any information on atopic disease, an LCA based on time course and levels of sIgE against food and inhalant allergens yielded a clear trichotomy with respect to manifestation, severity, and family history of atopic disease in both cohorts.</s><s>Using classical definitions of atopy, such as sIgE levels to any food or any seasonal allergens, the respective associations were overestimated or underestimated, and the signals were diluted.</s></p><p><s>The detection of an innocent or benign atopy phenotype predominantly related to food sIgE is clinically relevant and suggests that children with asthma allocated to one of the benign food LCs should not be considered atopic asthma in epidemiologic studies.</s><s>Rather, these children might experience nonatopic asthma and concomitantly happen to produce irrelevant food sIgE, as do many children without asthma.</s></p><p><s>Also, the distinction between symptomatic and severe atopy has vast implications: children with symptomatic atopy have a lower risk of asthma, hay fever, and eczema, and a less severe phenotype, as suggested by rather normal lung function parameters.</s></p><p><s>Severe atopy was characterized by specific and also unspecific features.</s><s>With the LC of food in the PASTURE cohort, severe atopy shared polyvalent sensitization with 5 or more allergens (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">E7</ref>).</s><s>Children with early food sensitization were allocated to both the severe atopy and food LCs with similar absolute counts, although at different proportions.</s><s>Although early food sensitization can be seen as the first raised flag of severe atopy, it cannot serve as a specific predictor of this condition among sensitized children.</s><s>However, a unique hallmark of severe atopy was the increased T H 2/T H 1 cytokine ratio at age 6 years (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5,  B</ref>).</s><s>This emerging dysbalance might result from an initial T H 2 cell activation without subsequent resolution into ''protective immunologic tolerance,'' as suggested by Rowe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref> In addition to the specifically strong association with impaired lung function, severe atopy harbored a relevant proportion of children with FEV 1 values in the lowest decile but without an established asthma diagnosis.</s><s>In practical terms this group of children might benefit from further clinical work-up and careful monitoring of sIgE increments within the first 3 to 4 years.</s></p><p><s>A further exclusive feature of severe atopy consisted in high sIgE levels, which followed a steep increase in seasonal sensitization particularly before age 3 to 4 years.</s><s>This sharp increase was the only relevant longitudinal variation among the LCs and distinguished the current LCA for atopy from an earlier LCA for wheeze. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>This earlier LCA was entirely determined by the time course of symptoms and produced a late-onset wheeze phenotype emerging only beyond age 3 to 4 years with strong associations with atopic sensitization, particularly severe atopy (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">E3</ref>).</s><s>In this context it is noteworthy that the steep increase in sIgE levels within the severe atopy class preceded the first symptoms of the atopic late-onset wheeze phenotype.</s><s>This temporal relationship in combination with the strength and specificity of the association of severe atopy with asthma and impaired lung function and the consistency of the findings between both studies argues in favor of a causal relationship.</s></p><p><s>To corroborate this assumption, we performed a path analysis contrasting severe atopy with benign and symptomatic atopy in regard to the above features.</s><s>According to this analysis, the effect of severe atopy on asthma was completely mediated through the steep increase in sIgE levels and the resulting high sIgE levels.</s><s>Because this steep increase was seen for all sIgE specificities in severe atopy (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">I</ref>), one might hypothesize that excessive sIgE production is a generic phenomenon beyond any specific allergen.</s></p><p><s>This crucial role of uncontrolled sIgE production is indirectly supported by evidence from clinical studies showing an alleviating effect on childhood asthma symptoms by neutralizing sIgE with an anti-IgE antibody. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s>Vice versa, the pathway model might provide a suitable explanation for the efficacy of anti-IgE treatment.</s><s>Additionally, severe atopy, or in practical terms a steep increase in sIgE levels until age 3 to 4 years, might serve as a selection criterion for children susceptible to anti-IgE therapy.</s><s>Because severe atopy explains at least every fifth case of atopic asthma, a relevant share of children might profit from this therapeutic approach.</s></p><p><s>Moreover, severe atopy directly determined low FEV 1 values and explained the inverse association of FEV 1 and asthma, ultimately implying that poor lung function at age 6 years is not a feature of asthma unless it is related to severe atopy.</s><s>In other words, poor lung function and excessive production of sIgE might result from the same latent phenomenon.</s><s>This shared pathogenesis might point toward a local process of uncontrolled production of sIgE in the bronchial mucosa, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> which again might be the target of future interventions.</s></p><p><s>The other features of severe atopy (ie, early food sensitization, an increased T H 2/T H 1 ratio, and polysensitization) emerged from the path analysis as epiphenomena without any proper effects on asthma risk.</s><s>Rather, they might hint at an authentic latent phenomenon, which manifests with many faces.</s></p><p><s>Integrating temporal patterns, allergen specificity, and strength of sensitization in a data-driven approach, we found 3 phenotypes of atopy with respect to disease relevance.</s><s>In contrast to benign and symptomatic atopy, severe atopy identified a circumscribed group of children with high sIgE values, pronounced disease risk, and poor lung function.</s><s>Thus severe atopy as a latent phenomenon might correspond to the condition underlying both childhood asthma and sensitization patterns, as previously postulated by Illi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> The path analysis performed in atopic subjects now suggests a link between severe atopy and asthma through excessive sIgE production, particularly to seasonal allergens early in life, and might direct further research into the biologic fundamentals of atopy.</s></p></div>
