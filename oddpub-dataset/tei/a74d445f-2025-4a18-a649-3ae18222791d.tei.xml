affected by this policy have not reached the peak age of disease occurrence (45-55 years) until the end of this study.</s><s>We speculate that the incidence of female breast cancer will keep increasing.</s><s>The government has provided free breast cancer screening to rural residents and lowincome women since late 2000s, but the coverage rate was only 27.4% in 2010 <ref type="bibr"
