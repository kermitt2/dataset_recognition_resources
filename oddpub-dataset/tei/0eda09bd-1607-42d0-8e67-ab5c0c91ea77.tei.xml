<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assays</head><p><s>Assays were performed on samples from every other hour (q2 h samples) for each participant, as this was frequent enough to provide adequate determination of a rhythm, if present.</s><s>If a sample from the preferred hour was missing, a sample from the adjacent hour was used, which was necessary in approximately 15% of samples.</s><s>Assays were performed at the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) laboratory at Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) in 2015.</s><s>Each individual's samples were run in the same assay to minimize inter-assay variability.</s><s>Serum sclerostin levels were measured in duplicate on previously unthawed samples stored below −80°C until assay by ELISA (ALPCO/Biomedica, Salem, NH).</s><s>Interassay coefficient of variation (CV) was 7.5% at 60.9 pmol/L.</s><s>Intra-assay CV was 7% at 33.6 pmol/L and 5% at 118.8 pmol/L.</s><s>FGF-23 was measured immunometrically (Kainos Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) in serum that had undergone one freeze/thaw cycle.</s><s>Interassay CV was 4.9% at 48.4 pg/mL.</s><s>Intra-assay CV was 3% at 14.2 pg/mL and 2.8% at 28.7 pg/mL.</s><s>The intact trimer of P1NP was measured by immunoassay (Orion Diagnostica, Finland) in duplicate on serum that had undergone one freeze/thaw cycle.</s><s>Interassay CV was 2.1% at 38.3 μg/L and 3.0% at 118 μg/L.</s><s>Intra-assay CV was 5.4% at 23.6 μg/L, 3.2% at 33.1 μg/L, 5.4% at 53.1 μg/L, and 9.6% at 149.2 μg/L.</s><s>CTX was measured by ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, United Kingdom) on serum that had undergone one freeze/thaw cycle.</s><s>Interassay CV was 15.7% at 0.18 ng/mL and 12.7% at 0.87 ng/mL.</s><s>Intra-assay CV was 3% at 0.121 ng/mL, 1.7% at 0.444 ng/mL, and 1.8% at 1.96 ng/mL.</s><s>All intra-assay CVs are as reported per manufacturers' specifications.</s><s>Values were averaged to obtain a final result for the biomarkers measured in duplicate (sclerostin, P1NP).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>The primary objective of this study was to determine the presence/absence of diurnal rhythmicity in sclerostin.</s><s>To this end, we fit a cosinor model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> controlling for age.</s><s>Secondary outcomes were to evaluate metabolite associations and to confirm the presence/ absence of rhythmicity for the other bone biomarkers, as internal validation of study conditions.</s><s>No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons because these analyses were intended to be hypothesis generating.</s></p><p><s>Maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters in a repeated measures analysis were used to determine if a metabolite displayed a diurnal, sinusoidal rhythm with one or two harmonics, conditioned on age (Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>).</s><s>Equation <ref type="formula">1</ref>where c 1 =cos((h*2*π)/24) and s 1 =sin((h*2* π)/24) estimate the first harmonic, c 2 =cos((h*2*π)/12) and s 2 =sin((h*2* π)/12) estimate the second harmonic, h is the hour, AGE is an indicator variable for older vs. younger men, M is the mesor (midline statistic of rhythm), and β and γ are the parameters that estimate the amplitude ((β 2 + γ 2 ) 1/2 ) and acrophase (arctan(γ/β)) for each harmonic in the cosinor model.</s><s>"Harmonic" refers to the number of oscillations in the 24-h interval, the fundamental period for circadian rhythm.</s><s>The first harmonic has period = 24, frequency = 1/24; the second harmonic has period = 12, frequency = 1/12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>After visually inspecting the raw data at the individual and group levels, parameters were estimated at the group level to determine rhythmicity; that is, to estimate the joint significance of the parameters β 1 and γ 1 and β 2 and γ 2 in equation 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Establishing the 24-h profile of serum sclerostin in relation to other bone biomarkers fills a knowledge gap in our understanding of the drivers of normal bone remodeling rhythms and how circadian disturbances could alter bone health.</s><s>In this group of healthy men we found no significant 24-h rhythm in sclerostin.</s><s>We verified the previously reported, robust sinusoidal rhythm of CTX, but found no evidence that sclerostin orchestrates the 24-h CTX rhythm.</s><s>The timing of FGF-23 rhythmicity was variable across individuals and no statistically significant rhythm was identified in P1NP using cosinor analysis.</s><s>This first published report of the 24-hour profile of serum sclerostin has implications for understanding the rhythmicity of bone turnover markers and the optimal collection time for sclerostin.</s><s>Our results suggest that serum sclerostin, in contrast to CTX, can be measured at any time of day.</s><s>Furthermore, these results do not support the hypothesis that osteocytes direct the rhythmicity of other bone turnover markers (CTX), at least not via a sclerostin mediated mechanism.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown that the osteocyte plays a role in regulating osteoclast formation and activation and that increases in sclerostin (as occurs with mechanical unloading) stimulate osteoclast activity through increased expression of RANKL <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, one might expect sclerostin to display a 24-h profile similar to that of CTX and for these rhythms to be biologically linked.</s><s>However, we found no clear peak or nadir in 24h sclerostin profiles using visual inspection or statistical analysis despite confirming the robust rhythmicity of CTX.</s><s>This suggests the rhythmicity of CTX and bone resorption may be mediated by non-sclerostin mechanisms.</s><s>These sclerostin data are in contrast to results reported in abstract form which identified a peak in sclerostin levels at 01:00 and a nadir at 10:00 in young men (mean 26 years), using the same Biomedica sclerostin assay used in our study <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In that report, the activity and eating patterns of the 6 men were not described and could have resulted in a more pronounced day-night pattern related to environmental/ behavioral influence, unrelated to the endogenous rhythmicity of CTX.</s><s>Our analysis involved controlled lab conditions free of environmental and time cues.</s><s>In this study food and activity were also carefully controlled -meals were scheduled and exercise prohibited (ambulation allowed).</s><s>All 24-h profiles were in similar circadian phase.</s><s>Samples obtained in these controlled lab conditions are more likely to detect the presence or absence of a universal, endogenous rhythmicity across individuals.</s><s>The significant differences in the 24-h profiles of sclerostin and CTX identified in our study suggest that the rhythmicity in bone resorption reflected by CTX may be mediated by a non-sclerostin mechanism.</s></p><p><s>In contrast to sclerostin, we did find evidence of a rhythm in the osteocyte derived protein FGF-23.</s><s>Although a sinusoidal rhythm was identified in FGF-23, there was more interindividual variation in phase (aka timing of peaks) than for CTX (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>, polar plot).</s><s>If FGF-23 rhythmicity were related to the regulation of dietary phosphate intake, one might expect more consistent timing in this study in which meal timing was aligned across individuals.</s><s>This variable rhythm may present a challenge with clinical measurements and the establishment of normative values.</s><s>These data confirm the presence and timing of CTX 24-h rhythmicity but add to the conflicting reports of P1NP rhythmicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>.</s><s>The fitted curves for serum P1NP appeared to have a diurnal profile when assessed visually on a magnified scale (Online Resource Fig 1 <ref type="figure">)</ref>, albeit with a very small amplitude, and when rhythmicity was assessed by the Rao spacing test (Fig 2c polar plot), which tests whether the individuals' peak times are clustered.</s><s>However, no significant

target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>.</s><s>The relatively limited sample size (n = 4 older; n = 6 younger) limited the ability to detect differences in rhythmicity by age.</s><s>This analysis has several strengths.</s><s>It is the first description of the 24-h profile of sclerostin and its relationship to the 24-h profiles of other bone biomarkers.</s><s>The study involved a relatively large sample size (n = 10) for a complex sleep protocol.</s><s>Since rhythmicity was confirmed in CTX and FGF-23, it is likely that we had adequate resolution (in sampling frequency and sample stability) to identify a meaningful rhythm in serum sclerostin.</s><s>The study also has potential limitations.</s><s>It is possible that sclerostin or P1NP day-night patterns are present but not detected by our methods.</s><s>For instance, day/night patterns in sclerostin may be heavily influenced by environmental factors (such as light, food, or posture/ mechanical loading) that varied minimally in this study protocol.</s><s>Furthermore, although a rhythm may have been apparent over a longer sampling interval (i.e.</s><s>48 h to obtain at least 2 full periods), the rigorous design employed (with individuals aligned for differences in phase that account for meals and sleep opportunities) should have been capable of detecting a sinusoidal rhythm in the 24-h study interval.</s><s>In addition, given the variability in commercially available sclerostin assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>, use of a different assay (i.e. one that does not detect fragments as this Biomedica sclerostin assay does) and/or sample type (e.g.</s><s>EDTA plasma) could yield different results.</s><s>A cosinor model was chosen for this data analysis because the most robust bone biomarker rhythm (CTX) has a visually clear sinusoidal rhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, as do other bone biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>Although a more complex rhythm may be present in sclerostin, the approach we used is the most appropriate for investigating the osteocyte-osteoclast rhythm relationship because it is presumed that endogenous rhythms of the bone biomarkers would be similar (i.e. both sine/cosine), if related.</s><s>The samples reported here were taken from a baseline 24 h interval from a study intended to examine the metabolic effects of sleep disturbance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and not designed a priori to address bone-related questions.</s><s>Nonetheless, the protocol appeared adequate to answer the bone questions posed herein.</s><s>Due to limited resources, only healthy adult men were included in this analysis and therefore, sclerostin rhythmicity and its relationship to other bone biomarkers may be different in women or other groups.</s><s>The duration of sample storage (4-8 years at −80°C) may have compromised our ability to detect rhythmicity in sclerostin.</s><s>However, most proteins are stable at these temperatures.</s><s>The half-life of circulating sclerostin is not known and if prolonged could limit the ability to detect a rhythm.</s><s>Lastly, the serum values obtained in this study may not accurately reflect levels in the bone microenvironment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In contrast to the robust diurnal rhythm of the bone resorption marker CTX, we found no significant rhythm in serum sclerostin in healthy adult men.</s><s>Our results do not support the hypothesis that osteocytes direct the rhythmicity of other bone turnover markers (CTX), at least not via a sclerostin mediated mechanism.</s><s>These results also imply that time of day is less important when measuring serum sclerostin.</s><s>The 24-h profile of FGF-23 suggests that a component of osteocyte function is rhythmic, but that timing varies between individuals.</s></p></div>
