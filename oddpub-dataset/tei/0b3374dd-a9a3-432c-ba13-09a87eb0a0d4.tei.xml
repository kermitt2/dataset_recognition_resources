<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer globally and its incidence is rapidly increasing in South Korea, and it is one of main causes of cancer-related death. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> In CRC, molecular level alterations occur before morphological alterations begin, and it progresses slowly through adenoma to dysplasia.</s><s>Thus, it is possible to detect precancerous lesions by screening. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s>Early screening and detection of colorectal tumors can reduce CRC mortality.</s><s>Despite the importance of a CRC screening test, the fact that only 40% of population over 50 years of age receive a colonoscopy examination indicates the need for improved practicability and accessibility of a screening test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s>he fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is the most widely-used noninvasive CRC screening test.</s><s>It has been demonstrated to decrease CRC mortality in a randomized prospective study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s>Yet, the test has limited sensitivity in detecting early stage CRC.</s><s>The second-generation FOBT is an immunochemical test.</s><s>It has improved sensitivity.</s><s>Still, for advanced adenoma and early stage CRC, which are less likely to bleed, the diagnostic sensitivity is only around 20%.</s><s>This has meant the continued use of the invasive colonoscopy examination to detect early stage colorectal tumor that can be completely cured by colonoscopic treatment.</s><s>Colonoscopy is the gold standard for CRC diagnosis due to high sensitivity and specificity, whereas it is less preferred due to its invasiveness and difficulty of preparation.</s><s>If it could be accurately predicted whether asymptomatic people harbor a tumor or not by using a tumor specific biomarker aside from the FOBT, fear of CRC as well as unnecessary medical procedure can be reduced.</s><s>Redundant medical procedures and their cost could be reduced if a noninvasive molecular diagnostic technology using characteristics of tumors, such as DNA methylation, could sensitively detect colorectal tumors instead of colonoscopy.</s></p><p><s>Harada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> reported that DNA methylation was detectable in bowel lavage fluid (BLF) collected from the patients with colorectal tumors during colonoscopy.</s><s>BLF samples from invasive CRC revealed significantly higher levels of methylation than noninvasive tumors.</s><s>BLF from CRC patients contained many exfoliated tumor cells and use of BLF could be an effective approach to detect CRC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>ecently, syndecan-2 (SDC2) has been identified as a novel potential epigenetic biomarker for the detection of CRC using a genome-wide Media CpG microarray approach.</s><s>While SDC2 methylation was detected at all CRC stages, even early stage showed very high frequency of SDC2 methylation.</s><s>Thus, it suggested that SDC2 methylation can be potential biomarker for the detection of early stage of CRC. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> To date, SDC2 methylation has not been studied in adenomas that are prodromal lesions of CRC.</s><s>It is also necessary to confirm if SDC2 methylation exfoliated from colon tumor can be detectable in BLF from patients with colon tumors before confirming detection in the stool. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>Therefore, in this study, we performed bisulfite-pyrosequencing on an independent group of patients with precancerous lesions to confirm the high frequency of aberrant SDC2 methylation in precancerous biopsies with various stages compared to normal tissues.</s><s>For feasibility test of SDC2 methylation in BLF samples for early CRC detection, we assessed SDC2 methylation in patients with CRC and various precancerous lesions, and healthy individuals by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.</s><s>The results suggest that SDC2 methylation test in BLF could be a useful biomarker for early CRC detection.</s></p></div>

has prompted studies using epigenetic biomarkers.</s><s>Approximately 60% of human genes have CpG islands, where cytosine and guanine are concentrated at their promoters.</s><s>Epigenetic biomarkers

test (FIT) in detecting CRC.</s><s>For those with advanced precancerous lesions, sensitivities of the DNA test and FOBT were only 42.4% and 23.8%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">33</ref></s><s>Among patients in a subclinical stage who were at average risk for CRC, multitarget stool DNA testing had higher sensitivity compared to FIT, while the false positive rate was still significantly high.</s><s>These prior studies suggested that the epigenetic biomarkers were still unsatisfactory and need for more sensitive and specific epigenetic biomarkers.</s></p><p><s>Syndecan-2 is a cell membrane protein that is involved in cell proliferation, cell migration and in the interaction between cells and intercellular substances.</s><s>SDC2 is not expressed in normal intestinal endothelial cells, but is expressed in mesenchymal cells.</s><s>34 It was previously reported that SDC2 was aberrantly methylated in tumor tissues of most CRC patients and demonstrated a high potential of quantification of SDC2 methylation in blood for early detection of CRC. 7 SDC2 methylation has been described in more than 95% of CRC tissue and no difference with respect to the CRC stage has been found. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>This implies that SDC2 methylation may begin early in tumor development and continue thereafter.</s></p><p><s>Up to date, SDC2 methylation has not been addressed in precancerous lesions, thus this study was conducted to confirm the SDC2 methylation in precancerous biopsies at various stages.</s><s>It is new that SDC2 methylation appears 100% in the stage of advanced adenoma and 88.9% of non-advanced adenomas, while did not occur in normal tissues.</s><s>Thus it provides good evidence for SDC2 methylation as a potential biomarker for the early detection of CRC and prevention to CRC development.</s></p><p><s>The usefulness of SDC2 as a CRC biomarker for the first time was studied from blood samples and showed high sensitivity and specificity in the serum of CRC patients, and almost no methylation in serum DNA of normal healthy population, that resulted in suggesting the possibility as a circulating biomarker. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>f these epigenetic markers can detect tumor specific DNA methylation separated from the tumor at stool before being detected in the serum, the epigenetic marker can be noninvasive and more sensitive biomarkers in CRC screening.</s><s>Thus, we tried to confirm SDC2 methylation in BLF before confirming the detection in the stool.</s></p><p><s>In this study, SCD2 methylation test by qMSP in BLF showed sensitivities of 80.0%, 64.7% and 62.8% for CRC, VA and MTA, respectively at the specificity of 88.9%.</s><s>Meanwhile, Harada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> analyzed the methylation of 15 genes in BLF of patients with CRC and advanced adenoma and identified three highly sensitive genes.</s><s>Sensitivities of miR-124-3, LOC386758, and SFRP1 were 71.8%, 79.5% and 4.4%, respectively, for CRC detection.</s><s>Combination of three genes revealed 82% of sensitivity and 79% of specificity with the AUC of 0.834, which are comparable to our data.</s></p><p><s>The SDC2 methylation in the BLF displayed high sensitivity and specificity as a marker for the detection of CRC patients.</s><s>Also, it is encouraging that sensitivity and specificity increased to the expected levels of clinically important precancerous lesion such as VA and/or high-grade dysplasia.</s><s>Sensitivity of SDC2 methylation significantly increased with more than three adenomas than 1 or 2 adenomas.</s><s>The false positive rate in the normal group was 11.1% and positive rate in STA or HP was less than 30%.</s><s>This is an acceptable limitation for the use of single biomarker in BLF.</s><s>Thus, a large scale of clinical validation will be warranted in voided stool samples to evaluate the clinical utility of stool-based SDC2 methylation test to early detect CRC.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the SDC2 DNA methylation was detected in the tissue of almost colorectal neoplasm.</s><s>The SDC2 DNA methylation in BLF showed a high sensitivity and specificity in patients with CRC and precancerous lesions.</s><s>Also it has potential value in detection of the patients with precancerous lesion.</s></p></div>
