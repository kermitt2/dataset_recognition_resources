<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characteristics of the study population</head><p><s>Overall 87 patients seeking care for acute respiratory symptoms were examined, of which 77 met the inclusion criteria to be assigned to the upper (n = 39) or to the lower (n = 38) airways disease group (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Allergic rhinitis (33/39; 85%) and allergic asthma (31/38; 82%) were the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the group with upper and lower airways disease, respectively.</s><s>An allergic reaction or a viral infection were the most common triggers of the acute exacerbation to be treated.</s><s>The severity of symptoms to be treated was classified as "moderate" by the patients in 79% and 42% of those having upper or lower airways symptoms, respectively.</s><s>Symptoms were more frequently short lived (1-3 days) in the group with lower airways disease than in that with upper airways disease (55% vs 10%, p &lt; 0.001), but the latter suffered more frequently from sleep impairment (46% vs 34%, p = 0.285) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy</head><p><s>The percentage of patients reporting a subjective feeling of clear symptoms improvement was 92% (95% CI, 77-97%) and 87% (95% CI, 73-94%) in the upper and lower airways disease groups, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Doctors judged a clear improvement of symptoms in 90% (95% CI, 76-96%) and 97% (95% CI 87-100%) of the patients with upper and lower airways disease, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The average total nasal inspiratory airflow significantly improved (p = 0.030) among the patients with upper airways symptoms, from 275 ml/s (95% CI, 207-342 ml/s) to 359 ml/s (95% CI, 300-419 ml/s) after Oxymetazoline administration with the A3C nebulizer (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The frequency distributions of V'na values measured before and after nebulization were notably different.</s><s>Particularly, V'na values evaluated after nebulization were distributed towards higher values, with a peak in interval between 51 and 75 V'na (%).</s><s>Moreover, the mean differences resulted statistically significant (44% vs 61%, p = 0.010) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>All the selected lung function parameters (FEV1, Tiffeneau Index and MMEF25-75) significantly improved among the patients with lower airways symptoms after inhalation of Salbutamol (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Similarly, MMEF 25/75 values measured after nebulization revealed a tendency towards higher values, with a peak in the interval between 61 and 80 MMEF 25/75 (%).The mean pre-post nebulization differences were statistically significant (51% vs 77%, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What we found</head><p><s>We tested the efficacy and usability of a novel nebulizer (A3 complete, OMRON, Kyoto, Japan) in two groups of children with either upper or lower airways disease.</s><s>In both groups the nebulizer was considered as "easy to use" by the patients.</s><s>The successful delivery of the anti-symptomatic drug (Oxymetazoline or Salbutamol) was assessed at individual level through the subjective opinion of the patients and their doctor.</s><s>At population level, the success of drug delivery in the target tissue was measured by the improvement of objective upper or lower airways parameters, i.e. total inspiratory nasal airflow and More than one etiology is possible in the same subject lung function parameters.</s><s>(FEV1, Tiffeneau Index, MMEF 25/75) To our knowledge, this is the first example of a nebulizer being able to effectively deliver drugs to both the upper and lower airways; actually, no nebulizer with this property has been mentioned in a recent, comprehensive review on nebulizers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug deposition in upper/lower airways</head><p><s>The efficacy of drug delivery in the lower airways was clearly detected at population level in terms of variation of FEV-1.</s><s>This increase was remarkably evident when the Maximal Midexpiratory Flow (MMEF25-75) was taken into account.</s><s>This suggests a successful penetration and  Quantitative data were summarized as mean and standard deviation (SD) a A paired t-test, when condition were respected (Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality of data), or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to show differences in time within each group deposition of the drug (Salbutamol) in the targeted segment of the airways, i.e. the medium-size and smaller bronchi.</s><s>Accordingly, this improvement was also accompanied by a clear improvement of the Tiffeneau Index.</s><s>Most of the patients subjectively reported improvement of their bronchial symptoms, assessed both through specific questioning (87%) and a visual analogue scale (89%).</s><s>The efficacy of drug delivery in the upper airways was detected at population level by measuring the total nasal inspiratory flow.</s><s>This objective improvement suggests the effective penetration and deposition of the drug (Oxymetazoline) in the upper airways.</s><s>Accordingly, most patients subjectively reported improvement of their nasal symptoms.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Usability of the device for patients with UAD</head><p><s>The improvement of subjective and objective symptoms reflects why patients and doctors consider the use of the nebulizer successful.</s><s>Interestingly, the patients with symptoms in both upper and lower airways expressed appreciation for the possibility of treating both affected sites with a unique nebulizer.</s><s>Additionally, the instrument seemed to be user-friendly for most of the participating patients.</s><s>In certain patients (e.g.</s><s>pre-school children, patients with difficult coordination or low attention) the use of a single and easier device, which is able to treat both the upper and lower airways, may be preferable and facilitate adherence to a complete treatment of the so-called "United Airways Disease" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choosing the appropriate device for each patient</head><p><s>Although the use of the A3C has been shown to be beneficial for patients with rhinitis and asthma, one should consider that nebulizers generally are not the most frequently used drug delivery devices in the treatment of both pathologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>In particular, the European and German national guidelines for the treatment of rhinitis and asthma suggest as first choice the use of nasal drops/sprays and metered dose inhalers with aero-chamber to deliver anti-symptomatic drugs or corticosteroids in the upper and lower airways, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s>One of the reasons for this recommendation is that most nebulizers are relatively big, not easily carried instruments, requiring electric power <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>This impedes an outdoor use, e.g. during sports or at school <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which is an essential limiting factor with regard to the treatment of acute disease exacerbations, especially in asthma.</s><s>Moreover, some nebulizers have a relatively high degree of variability in their efficiency of drug delivery over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study limitations</head><p><s>We have to acknowledge some limitations of our study.</s><s>First, we did not compare the efficacy of A3C with that of other nebulizers.</s><s>Nevertheless, the very high efficacy measured suggests non-inferiority to other nebulizers already available on the European market in delivering drugs to either upper or lower airways.</s><s>Second, we measured the impact of therapy only in not-hospitalized patients affected by milder forms of acute exacerbations of respiratory diseases.</s><s>We stress that our conclusions cannot be automatically extrapolated, without further studies, to more severe conditions, such as severe asthma, cystic fibrosis or to use in unconscious patients.</s><s>Third, the subjective opinion of patients and doctors and the objective measures of lung or nasal function were based on one episodic treatment only, without further follow-up assessments.</s><s>A study evaluating the efficacy of the instrument on patients monitored longterm would have been more informative.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>In conclusion, this study has shown that the A3C nebulizer efficiently delivers anti-symptomatic drugs in both the upper and lower airways in a userfriendly way.</s><s>This device may be useful to facilitate adherence to a complete treatment of respiratory symptoms in patients with symptoms of both upper and lower airways symptoms, i.e. the so-called United Airways Disease.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig. 1 Omron A3C nebulizer Instruction Manual</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,155.68,94.85,283.87,386.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
