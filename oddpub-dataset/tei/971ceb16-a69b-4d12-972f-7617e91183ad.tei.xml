<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head><p><s>Study population-The study population was comprised of 109 mother-newborn dyads recruited from an on-going, prospective cohort study conducted at the University of California, Irvine, Development, Health and Disease Research Program.</s><s>Women with a singleton pregnancy were recruited in the late first or early second trimester.</s><s>Maternal exclusionary criteria were uterine anomalies, pre-existing major medical co-morbidities (hypertension or diabetes), use of antenatal systemic corticosteroids, and illicit drug use.</s><s>Newborn exclusionary criteria were congenital malformations, chromosomal abnormalities, major perinatal complications, and preterm birth &lt;34 completed weeks.</s><s>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained from all mothers.</s></p><p><s>Prenatal ultrasonography-Fetal 2D ultrasound was performed at all three antenatal visits (approximately 12, 20 and 30 weeks) to assess biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length.</s><s>Estimated fetal weight was calculated using the four-parameter model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s>asures of fetal adiposity were obtained at the second and third study visits, but not at the first visit, since fetal fat deposition is histologically evident only after 14-16 weeks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>We selected the mid-upper arm, mid-thigh, and abdomen to measure fat mass because it can be reliably quantified by ultrasound at these anatomical sites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>3D ultrasound was used to acquire total contours of arm and thigh, then analyzed offline using appropriate software (4D View 9.0, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) to determine subcutaneous fat area with standardized cross-sectional images. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s>Briefly, we identified the midpoint of the humerus and femur, and measured the total cross-sectional area and the lean mass area.</s><s>The fat area was calculated as difference between these two measures.</s><s>Percentage fat area was defined as the ratio of fat area to the total area.</s><s>Subcutaneous fat thickness in the abdomen was measured as the high-echoic region anterior to the margins of the ribs, proximal to the cord insertion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>ach of the measurements were obtained in duplicate and averaged.</s><s>All ultrasound scans were performed using a Voluson i (GE Healthcare) with trans-abdominal 4MHz curved array transducer (RAB4-8-RS) by 1 of 3 obstetricians with training in fetal ultrasonography (SI, KS, MO).</s><s>Inter-observer coefficient of variation for arm percent fat area, thigh percent fat area, and anterior abdominal wall thickness were 8.2%, 9.7% and 9.9% respectively, and intra-observer coefficient of variation were 7.2%, 7.4% and 7.5% respectively.</s></p><p><s>Birth outcomes-Birth weight, gestational age at birth, and infant sex were abstracted from the medical record.</s></p><p><s>Infant body composition-Newborn adiposity was quantified by DXA using a Hologic Discovery scanner (QDR 4500A, Hologic Inc, Bedford, MA, USA) in the pediatric scan mode. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s>Potential measurement issues at birth can relate to ensuring similar timing of measurement relative to delivery, rapid changes in body composition that occur soon after delivery, water loss in first few days of life, and potential individual variation in these factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s>Therefore, newborn DXA scans were performed at approximately one month postnatal age.</s><s>Calibration using the anthropomorphic phantom was performed before each scan.</s><s>Infants lay supine while sleeping, wearing only a disposable diaper and swaddled in a light cotton blanket.</s><s>Percent body fat was determined using the Hologic Analysis Version 12.1 software.</s><s>The DXA scan of one newborn was excluded from the analysis due to unsatisfactory image quality.</s></p><p><s>Obstetric risk conditions-Obstetric risk factors were defined as the conditions considered pertinent to affect fetal body composition, including gestational diabetes (GDM), gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, genital tract infection, recurrent vaginal bleeding, or severe anemia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s>Nine mothers had GDM, and 11 mothers had other obstetric risk conditions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain (GWG)-Pre-pregnancy BMI was calculated using pre-pregnancy weight (by maternal self-report) and height measured at 1 st prenatal visit.</s><s>Pre-pregnancy weight was highly correlated with the maternal weight measured at her 1 st prenatal visit (r =0.99, p&lt;0.001), justifying its use in this context.</s><s>Maternal total weight gain during pregnancy was abstracted from the medical record, and GWG per week (GWG/week) was calculated.</s><s>Because pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG both may exert effects on newborn adiposity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> and because the effect of GWG is conditional upon pre-pregnancy BMI (inter-correlation coefficient =−0.50, p&lt;0.001), the interaction term between the two parameters (pre-pregnancy BMI×GWG/week) was used in the analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p><s>Adjustment of fetal measures for gestational age at ultrasonography-Gestational age was confirmed using an algorithm combining last menstrual period and fetal biometry as per standard clinical criteria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s>Gestational ages of study subjects varied due to the timing of ultrasonography (three antenatal visits ranged between 10-16, 18-23, and 28-32 weeks, respectively).</s><s>We therefore corrected for the effects of variation in gestational age at assessment by centering at a mean gestational age for each visit (12.9, 20.5 and 30.4 weeks, respectively) and residualizing the ultrasound measurements for these mean gestational ages.</s><s>Briefly, after confirmation of the linear relationship between fetal ultrasound measure and gestational age at scan, the product of the regression coefficient and centered gestational age was calculated.</s><s>This product was added to or subtracted from the measured value to calculate the adjusted value of fetal parameters.</s><s>This procedure standardizes the fetal measures across all subjects at the centered gestational ages, enabling comparisons across subjects.</s></p><p><s>Estimated fetal adiposity (EFA)-We derived a composite measure of fetal adiposity using arm percent fat area, thigh percent fat area and anterior abdominal wall thickness.</s><s>Because these parameters have different units of measurement, we first converted each of the measurement units to standardized (z) scores based on our study population.</s><s>We then computed the mean (unweighted) of the three z scores as a composite estimate of fetal adiposity (EFA).</s><s>Inter-observer reliability of EFA was evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients, and was estimated to be 0.90.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a prospective association of fetal fat mass (assessed before the period of maximal fetal fat deposition) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> with newborn adiposity.</s><s>The principal findings are as follows: Firstly, our composite measure of fetal fat mass (EFA) at the beginning of the third trimester independently accounted for a significant proportion of the variation in newborn adiposity after controlling for potential confounding factors.</s><s>Secondly, EFA was a better predictor of newborn adiposity than conventional fetal biometry.</s><s>Thirdly, fetal arm fat mass at the beginning of the third trimester appears to be a novel marker that leads to better prediction of newborn adiposity.</s></p><p><s>After accounting for the effects of pre-pregnancy BMI, GWG, GDM, gestational age at birth, and postnatal age at DXA, EFA at 30 weeks explained 24.0% of the variance in newborn percent body fat, whereas estimated fetal weight explained only 8.1% of its variance.</s><s>The observation that this association is evident as early as the beginning of the third trimester suggests that, quantification of fetal fat mass before the fetus accrues the majority of fat tissue could reliably account for a substantial proportion of the variation in newborn adiposity.</s><s>The clinical significance of this finding is that it may be possible to implement interventions for primary prevention of newborn adiposity prior to the acceleration of fetal fat deposition.</s><s>Although our study quantitatively documents evidence of fetal fat deposition at 20 weeks, the absence of an association of these measures with newborn adiposity suggests insufficient variation of fat deposition between fetuses at this gestational age.</s></p><p><s>Our study indicated that fetal arm fat and abdominal fat at 30 weeks independently and additively explained variations in newborn adiposity.</s><s>This effect was driven primarily by arm percent fat area, which alone explained 20.4% of the variation of newborn percent body fat.</s><s>Another recent study also has reported that variations in the fetal arm fat area in the late third trimester differentiated newborns with low compared to high fat mass. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s>It appears that the pivotal time of growth acceleration of arm volume is around 28 weeks, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> which precedes thigh volume by approximately two weeks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref></s><s>These findings suggest measures of fetal arm fat mass may represent an important early marker of newborn adiposity.</s><s>This is also consistent with observations from studies of fat deposition in offspring of GDM mothers, wherein GDM was associated specifically with greater fetal arm fat mass in the early third trimester. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s> addition to the 3 anatomical sites we used to estimate fetal fat mass, there are other areas of fat deposition such as cheek, ribs and buttocks, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> whose quantification was not available in the current study.</s><s>However, these latter measures are yet to be endorsed as reliable measurements.</s><s>Fetal limb volume in the late third trimester has recently been proposed as a useful measure for predicting newborn adiposity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s>It accounts for a significant improvement in explaining the variation in newborn adiposity as compared with estimated fetal weight, which is consistent with the present study.</s><s>Measures of fetal limb fat volume may also improve accuracy of fat estimation, and this warrants future investigation.</s></p><p><s>The association between fetal fat mass and newborn adiposity remained robust after adjustment for the most likely confounding factors.</s><s>Inclusion of site-specific EFA measurements at 30 weeks contributed to 15.6% relative increase in the AUC for the prediction of high newborn percent body fat.</s><s>A question of interest and future direction of this research is the elucidation of the determinants of variation in fetal fat mass, including maternal nutritional (e.g.</s><s>fatty acid status) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> and metabolic state (e.g.</s><s>insulin resistance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> that, in turn, could facilitate the development of potential clinical interventions in the future.</s></p><p><s>The major strength of this study is the prospective, longitudinal design that enabled serial tracking of fat deposition across gestation.</s><s>Furthermore, we measured newborn adiposity using DXA, one of the standard techniques for the direct measurement of fat mass.</s><s>A possible limitation of performing the DXA at one month postnatal age is that it follows a period of rapid early postnatal growth.</s><s>We note, however, that in the analysis we adjusted for postnatal age at DXA as a potential confounding factor.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, our findings provide greater insight into changes in fetal body composition and its relationship to newborn adiposity.</s><s>We have introduced the concept of EFA as a new method to evaluate fetal body composition, and demonstrated its feasibility in a study population of uncomplicated pregnancies.</s><s>If these findings are replicated, it is possible that EFA may lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of fetal growth and body composition and help differentiate fetuses with a higher body weight (estimated fetal weight) from those with a greater fat mass (EFA).</s><s>It is also possible that the ability to detect extreme variations in fetal fat deposition may provide greater insight in understanding the origins of alterations of fetal body composition as in pathophysiological conditions such as fetal growth restriction and fetal macrosomia.</s><s>This then may potentially provide a basis for the development of the interventional strategies during pregnancy that may modify newborn adiposity and subsequent obesity.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
