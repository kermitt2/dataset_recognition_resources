<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>IBD is an etiologically complex inflammatory disorder, involving the interaction of genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, microbial dysbiosis, and perturbation of immune homeostasis1-4.</s><s>Immune dysregulation in IBD depends on the inappropriate production of diverse pro-inflammatory cytokines, which orchestrate intestinal inflammation and constitute attractive targets for therapeutic development5,6.</s><s>Indeed, blockade of TNF using monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNF therapy) is now firmly established as an effective therapeutic approach for IBD.</s><s>Nevertheless, up to 40% of patients with IBD exhibit primary non-responsiveness to anti-TNF therapy, and many patients who are initially responsive develop therapeutic resistance7,8.</s><s>Various other cytokines have been targeted in clinical trials (including interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-6, and IL-17A) but their blockade has generally resulted in negligible efficacy or, in the case of IL-17A, deleterious side effects in subgroups of patients5,9.</s><s>Therefore, we sought to identify novel cytokines that could potentially serve as alternative therapeutic targets to TNF.</s><s>In a large number of IBD patients, we identified OSM (Oncostatin M) as a highly expressed cytokine that is associated with anti-TNF resistant disease.</s><s>Furthermore, OSM was found to promote intestinal pathology in an anti-TNF resistant mouse model of IBD.</s><s>Intriguingly, OSM appears to promote intestinal inflammation by inducing chemokine, cytokine, and adhesion factor expression in gutresident stromal cells, which express high amounts of the OSM receptor-β (OSMR).</s></p><p><s>OSM is part of the IL-6 cytokine family, which shares gp130 as a receptor subunit10.</s><s>Depending on the cell type, human OSM can induce signalling via the JAK-STAT pathway (including JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and possibly STAT6), the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades via heterodimeric receptors comprised of gp130 and either OSMR or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-β (LIFR)11,12.</s><s>By contrast, mouse OSM is thought to mediate similar signal transduction mainly via gp130-OSMR heterodimers11,12.</s><s>OSM supports diverse homeostatic processes, including liver repair, cardiac tissue remodeling, osteoclastogenesis, and hematopoiesis11,12.</s><s>However, overproduction of OSM is thought to promote a variety of pathologies, including skin and lung inflammation, atherosclerosis, and several forms of cancer11,12.</s><s>Interestingly, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human OSM locus is strongly associated with risk of developing IBD13.</s><s>Nevertheless, the role of OSM in IBD has remained unclear11,14,15.</s></p></div>

while they can respond to microbial challenges and influence dendritic cell function under steady state conditions27,29, a critical inflammatory role for stromal cells in IBD has not been demonstrated28.</s><s>Nevertheless, data from other inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis support the hypothesis that stromal cells are active contributors to immune pathology41.</s><s>The high frequency of fibrotic complications in CD is consistent with a pathological role for intestinal stromal cells.</s><s>However, we found that inflamed tissue from both CD and UC patients contains large numbers of PDPN + stromal cells, despite UC not being strongly associated with fibrosis.</s><s>Similarly, mice subjected to Hh+αIL-10R colitis show a substantial expansion of the intestinal stromal cell compartment in the absence of overt intestinal fibrosis.</s><s>These observations highlight the possibility that intestinal stromal cells may contribute to inflammatory pathology in ways that extend beyond the simple deposition of extracellular matrix components.</s><s>A major unanswered question regarding intestinal stromal cells is their ontogeny.</s><s>Although the number of PDPN + stromal cells clearly increases during intestinal inflammation in both mice and humans, it is unknown whether they arise from expansion of tissue-resident precursors, are recruited from elsewhere (e.g. via circulating precursors), or if they differentiate from a distinct tissueresident cell type.</s><s>Similarly, it is not known if OSMR high intestinal stromal cells represent a distinct mesenchymal lineage, or simply a state of increased immunological activity.</s><s>Also noteworthy is the heightened cytokine sensitivity of intestinal stromal cells from IBD patients.</s><s>Although the mechanism underlying this difference is not clear, it may be related to a similar phenomenon observed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from rheumatoid arthritis patients, which display imprinted hyperresponsiveness to inflammatory stimuli, possibly due to mutations and/or epigenetic alterations41</s></p><p><s>To assess the role of OSM in a preclinical model of IBD, we chose to employ the Hh +αIL-10R system.</s><s>Although several murine models of IBD exist, we chose this system for the following reasons: (a) it does not require the use of genetically modified mice, which precludes the possibility of confounding developmental defects; (b) similar to current concepts of human IBD etiology, it requires dual triggers in the form of infection with the commensal pathobiont H. hepaticus and transient immune dysregulation via IL-10R blockade; (c) it is driven by a full spectrum of innate and adaptive immune processes, as occurs in human IBD patients; and (c) it is highly resistant to TNF blockade, making it ideal for investigating novel drivers of colitis.</s><s>We have also observed high expression of OSM in additional mouse models of IBD, including chemically induced colitis and adoptive transfer of naïve CD4 + T cells to Rag −/− hosts, suggesting that OSM may be relevant beyond the Hh +αIL-10R model.</s></p><p><s>In addition to alternative therapeutic targets, IBD patients would benefit substantially from improved systems for predicting disease course and response to therapy.</s><s>In the case of anti-TNF therapy, no biomarkers are currently used for predictive purposes in standard clinical practice, and conventional clinical parameters are insufficient to predict therapeutic response21.</s><s>This forces caregivers to make treatment decisions with little knowledge of whether a patient is likely to benefit, placing many patients at unnecessary risk of developing anti-TNF related complications (e.g.</s><s>infections)42,43, and inflating the economic burden of IBD care.</s><s>However, we have observed that high OSM expression in intestinal mucosa is reproducibly associated with a high risk of resistance to anti-TNF therapy.</s><s>Our data thus highlight the potential for developing a robust assay-based on measuring expression of OSM or similar inflammatory factors-that could assist clinicians in determining whether to prescribe anti-TNF antibodies or explore alternative therapeutic options.</s></p><p><s>While OSM can influence tissue remodeling in organs such as the heart and liver44-48, Osm −/− mice are viable and healthy, suggesting that therapeutic blockade of OSM may cause minimal side effects.</s><s>Indeed, OSM has been targeted for rheumatoid arthritis in phase I and II clinical trials using a humanized anti-OSM monoclonal antibody (GSK315234)49.</s><s>Although little clinical efficacy was observed, the drug was well tolerated, with a doserelated decrease in platelet counts being the most notable adverse effect (although all platelet counts remained within the normal reference range).</s><s>This is consistent with a prior report that OSMR-deficient mice have modestly reduced platelet counts due to a reduction in bone marrow megakaryocyte progenitors50.</s><s>Because Osm −/− mice have reduced nociception51 and OSM has been implicated in other inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis52-55 and arthritis56-59, which are common comorbidities of IBD60, it is tempting to speculate that OSM blockade could also be beneficial in managing extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD.</s><s>OSM and OSMR are over-expressed in the vast majority of active IBD lesions, particularly in patients with anti-TNF resistant disease.</s><s>OSM could therefore be a novel predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for this clinically challenging population, and clinical studies to evaluate this hypothesis are warranted.</s></p></div>
