as follows: Binding of Rpp to phosphate-binding residues (phosphosensors) on β -strand I in the arrestin N-domain breaks the 3-element interaction, which releases the arrestin C-tail and thereby breaks the polar core.</s><s>The displacement of the C-tail has widespread effects on the arrestin structure.</s><s>The two domains of arrestin rotate against each other by ~20° and several loops in

cavity formed upon activation of the receptor.</s><s>Mutation of several residues in the finger loop resulted in low IC 50 values for Meta II-P (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>), and Ops-P (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>) binding.</s><s>Differences in the mutation patterns are likely due to variations in engagement of the receptor (see Discussion), however weak binding of finger loop mutations on both Meta II-P and Ops-P reflects the biological relevance of finger loop interaction with the receptor.</s><s>In (b,c), the receptor-arrestin interaction, coloured

via a hydrogen bond between D162 (D163 in mouse arrestin-1) and K245 on the receptor.</s><s>Residues 161-163 are classified as rim residues by the program EPPIC.</s><s>Rim amino acids directly interact with the receptor albeit their buried surface area is smaller than core residues.</s><s>In agreement with this structural analysis, mutation of E161, D162 and K163 significantly decreases Meta II-P binding.</s><s>The effect of the mutations is less pronounced in case of Ops-P, where D162 even resulted in slightly increased binding.</s></p><p><s>Thirdly, the C-loop within the central

actually does not involve the receptor.</s><s>The arrestin in the complex is bound to the receptor at an angle such that the 344-loop within the C-edge would be expected to interact with the membrane (although loop-344 is not completely resolved in the structure, and no membrane is present).</s><s>Notably, mutation of several sites on the C-edge within the 344-loop and the nearby 200-loop significantly decrease binding to Meta II-P.</s><s>Most of the influential mutations are hydrophobic or uncharged amino acids (e.g.</s><s>L338, L339, L342, S345, F197, M198, S199), suggesting a possible role in interacting with the hydrophobic membrane interior.</s><s>In contrast, mutation of sites within the 344-loop actually increased binding to Ops-P.</s><s>Interestingly, mutations within the 270-loop adversely affected Ops-P binding, and many of these sites are polar or charged amino acids (e.g.</s><s>E263, Q265, K267, N271).</s><s>These differences suggest different roles for the C-edge loops in Meta II-P and Ops-P binding.</s><s>Furthermore, the placement of the 344-loop within the putative membrane plane of the Ops* /arrestin-1 complex is supported by Meta II-P functional

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study was initiated based on the hypothesis that arrestin-1 employs different binding modes for Meta II-P and Ops-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>The functional maps we present here indicate both similarities and differences regarding how arrestin-1 interacts with these two physiologically important forms of the receptor.</s><s>In general the results demonstrate the structural and functional versatility that is common to all arrestin family members.</s></p><p><s>The similarities in the functional maps we observed can be partially explained by the presence of active-state opsin in the pull-down experiments using Ops-P.</s><s>In the native membrane, opsin exists in a pH-dependent conformational equilibrium between inactive opsin (Ops), which resembles dark-state rhodopsin, and active opsin (Ops* ), which structurally resembles Meta II-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref

the Ops/Ops* equilibrium of ~4, meaning that essentially no Ops* exists in native membranes at physiological pH.</s><s>However, we surmise that receptor phosphorylation shifts the equilibrium toward Ops* , given that phosphorylation stabilises the active Meta II-P species over its inactive precursor Meta I <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>The binding of arrestin would additionally influence the amount of receptor stabilised as Ops* -P <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>For the current study, we estimated how much Ops-P could be stabilized in the active form by arrestin.</s><s>In order to do this, we used fluorescently labelled arrestin mutants that report two key aspects of arrestin binding to the active receptor: finger loop engagement (I72NBD) and gate loop movement (I299B/L173W) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,c</ref>).</s><s>We used a six-fold excess of receptor to arrestin, which is a reasonable approximation of the conditions used in the pull-downs employing arrestin-mCherry mutants (see Methods).</s><s>The fluorescence data indicate that about half of the 1 μ M arrestin was bound to the active receptor form Ops* -P at pH 7, since the fluorescence signal obtained with Ops-P at pH 7 was about half as great as that obtained with Meta II-P (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,c</ref>).</s><s>This result means that about 10% of the total opsin was stabilised as Ops* -P in complex with arrestin (0.5 μ M / 6 μ M = 0.083).</s><s>Furthermore, we observed a pH-dependence in the fluorescence signals indicative of arrestin binding to the active receptor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a,c</ref>).</s><s>Arrestin binding to Ops-P at pH 6 was similar to Meta II-P, and pH 8 significantly decreased the amount of Ops-P bound in the active form.</s><s>Given that Ops* -P is favoured at lower pH values <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , these observations suggest arrestin binds Ops* -P similarly as Meta II-P, at least with regard to the finger and gate loop.</s><s>Despite these similarities, Meta II-P and Ops* P binding are biochemically distinct with respect to salt sensitivity.</s><s>The difference can be explained by the coupling between the [Ops-P ↔ Ops* -P] and the [Arr + Ops* -P ↔ Arr• Ops* -P] equilibria.</s><s>This coupling lowers the apparent affinity of arrestin for Ops* -P, because the conformational equilibrium of the receptor is heavily shifted toward inactive Ops-P in the native membrane.</s><s>The fluorescence experiments presented here suggest that arrestin binding shifts the receptor conformational equilibrium by stabilizing Ops* -P (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Based on the fluorescence experiments, we conclude that our functional map of Ops-P binding represents a combination of Ops-P and Ops* -P characteristics.</s><s>The complex of arrestin with Ops* -P is structurally very similar to that with Meta II-P.</s><s>In contrast, arrestin binding to inactive Ops-P is primarily electrostatic, and the finger loop is not engaged nor is the gate loop displaced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>) <ref type="bibr"

the energy barrier for coupling to the active receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>Hence, we hypothesize that pre-activated mutants are able to stabilize Ops* -P to a greater extent, which would explain the striking similarities between the Meta II-P and Ops-P functional maps for the polar core and 3-element interaction.</s></p><p><s>Interestingly, mutations which displaced the C-tail increased affinity for Ops-P to a greater extent than Meta II-P.</s><s>These mutations included alanine substitution of the bulky hydrophobic residues involved in anchoring the C-tail within the 3-element interaction (F375 and F377), and C-tail truncation.</s><s>C-tail displacement exposes a large area of electropositive surface within the arrestin N-domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> .</s><s>Given the fact that arrestin binding to Ops-P is primarily electrostatic and heavily dependent on the level of receptor phosphorylation, it is not surprising that C-tail displacement would dramatically increase affinity for Ops-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>A similar effect is observed for p44, a naturally occurring splice variant of arrestin-1 that lacks the C-tail, which has significantly enhanced affinity for all forms of phosphorylated rhodopsin, even inactive dark-state rhodopsin and Ops-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Meta II-P and Ops-P binding were both negatively affected by mutations in the finger loop and 160-loop,

variety of conformations within the cytoplasmic crevice of the active receptor, which is supported by DEER studies of arrestin-1 binding to rhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> .</s><s>Different finger loop binding modes for Meta II-P (or Ops* -P) and Ops-P could also be implied by the opposite mutagenesis patterns seen in the residues 81-84, adjacent to the finger loop region.</s></p><p><s>Despite the many similarities between the Meta II-P and Ops-P functional maps, we detected significant differences that could indicate distinct binding modes.</s><s>Firstly, the mutation of potential phosphosensors within the arrestin N-domain, in the region where the phosphopeptide derived from the V2 vasopressin receptor interacts with arrestin-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> had dramatically distinct effects on Meta II-P and Ops-P binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .</s><s>A plot of affected residues on the arrestin surface yields distinct "phosphosensing footprints" for Meta II-P and Ops-P (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>Meta II-P binding was most negatively affected by mutation of residues which line the positively-charged cleft within the N-domain, which is exposed upon full displacement of the C-tail <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, Ops-P binding was most affected by mutation of residues within the cup of the N-domain.</s><s>Surprisingly, mutation of these residues had exactly the opposite effect on Meta II-P binding.</s><s>This difference indicates that these residues are playing different roles in Ops-P and Meta II-P binding.</s><s>In the case of Ops-P, we hypothesize that these residues bind Rpp.</s><s>In the case of Meta II-P, these residues are in close proximity to the cytoplasmic face of the receptor, and their mutation would make the N-domain cup more electronegative.</s><s>This change would increase binding affinity to Meta II-P, since the cytoplasmic face of the receptor is strongly electropositive <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Overall these results indicate that Rpp binds arrestin differently for Meta II-P and Ops-P.</s><s>We believe the arrestin-2/V2Rpp structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> is similar to how Rpp binds in the arrestin/Meta II-P complex, although some differences likely exist because of the different phosphorylation patterns between the V2R and rhodopsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>Distinct receptor phosphorylation patterns, which arise from ligand bias and/or GPCR C-tail subtype, are believed to engage specific clusters of phosphosensors and thereby direct the cellular functions of arrestin <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>However, here we observe different phosphosensor engagement, depending on the presence or absence of agonist for the same Rpp phosphorylation pattern.</s><s>In contrast to the arrestin/Meta II-P complex, we speculate that Rpp binds within the cup of the N-domain in the arrestin-1/Ops-P complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>These different modes in Rpp binding are supported by site-directed fluorescence experiments, which indicated that the arrestin gate loop is displaced from its basal position only in complex with Meta II-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Movement of the gate loop is necessary for Rpp to access the positively-charged cleft within the N-domain.</s><s>It is interesting to note the correlation between the mutation patterns in our functional maps and the different phosphorylation requirements of Meta II-P and Ops-P binding.</s><s>Only four residues (K5, K14, R29, H301) strongly affected Meta II-P binding, which corresponds well to two to three phosphates that are required for maximal Meta II-P binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In contrast, nine residues strongly affected Ops-P binding (belong to the group of the lowest 20%), which mirrors the dependence of Ops-P binding on high levels of receptor phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The Meta II-P and Ops-P functional maps are also distinct with respect to the inter-domain interface.</s><s>For example, mutation of residues within region 310-324 of Loop17-18, increased Ops-P binding and weakened Meta II-P binding.</s><s>Most of the critical sites are aliphatic residues (e.g.</s><s>I311, G315, I316, I323, L324) that are solvent-exposed in the basal state structure and more buried in the pre-active p44 structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>We hypothesize that mutation of these residues may interfere with the hydrophobic packing necessary to stabilise the new inter-domain orientation of the arrestin active state.</s><s>Hence, the inter-domain rotation seen in the pre-active arrestin structures might be more critical for Meta II-P binding, and Ops-P binding might be different in this respect.</s></p><p><s>The rearrangement of the inter-domain interface causes a rotation of the two domains of arrestin against one another.</s><s>In the Ops* /arrestin-1 complex structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> the asymmetric binding of arrestin to the receptor, along with the twist of the C-domain, positions the loops of the C-edge within or near the theoretical plane of the membrane adjacent to the receptor.</s><s>Previous site-directed fluorescence studies suggested the C-edge might interact with the membrane, or another receptor in a one-to-two complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>Intriguingly, we observed strong changes in IC 50 values, both positive and negative, when side chains in the C-edge were removed by alanine substitution.</s><s>Strong and weak binders are clustered in a directly reversed manner between Meta II-P and Ops-P.</s><s>Although the function of the C-edge is currently not well understood, the different patterns seen between Meta II-P and Ops-P binding could reflect distinct modes in membrane binding or different receptor binding stoichiometries.</s><s>Considering the orientation of the C-edge is controlled by the extent of inter-domain rotation, it is likely that the positive and negative correlations seen in the inter-domain interface and in the C-edge are related and reflect distinct binding modes employed by arrestin for Ops-P and Meta II-P.</s></p></div>
