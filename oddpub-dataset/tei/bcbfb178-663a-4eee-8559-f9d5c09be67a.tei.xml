<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>L-selectin is a transmembrane receptor expressed on the surface of white blood cells and responsible for the tethering of leukocytes to vascular endothelial cells.</s><s>This initial intercellular contact is the first step of the complex leukocyte adhesion cascade that ultimately permits extravasation of leukocytes into the surrounding tissue in case of inflammation.</s><s>Here we show the binding of a soluble histidine tagged L-selectin to a recently described shortened variant of an L-selectin specific DNA aptamer with surface plasmon resonance.</s><s>The high specificity of this aptamer in combination with its high binding affinity of ~12 nM, allows for a single-step protein purification from cell culture supernatants.</s><s>In comparison to the well-established Ni-NTA based technology, aptamer affinity chromatography (AAC) was easier to establish, resulted in a 3.6-fold higher protein yield, and increased protein purity.</s><s>Moreover, due to target specificity, the DNA aptamer facilitated binding studies directly from cell culture supernatant, a helpful characteristic to quickly monitor successful expression of biological active L-selectin.</s></p></div>
