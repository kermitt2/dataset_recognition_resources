<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>It is well-known that TOF can be associated with a clinically relevant dilatation of the aorta and echocardiography is the first line imaging tool for measuring aortic dimensions.</s><s>In addition to echocardiography also CMR is an inherent part of the follow-up work flow in congenital heart   <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> disease and recently a number of CMR normative date have been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our study adds CMR data of the aortic size in children and adolescents after correction of TOF that could serve as reference values.</s></p><p><s>Besides the unique capabilities of CMR in imaging morphologic and functional changes of the right heart after correction of TOF also imaging of the great vessels is feasible without restrictions from patient constitution and the presence of an adequate acoustic window.</s><s>In most centers the CMR protocol includes the administration of a gadolinium based contrast-medium for CE-CMRA and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging.</s><s>The CE-CMRA sequence is primarily used for visualization of the right ventricular outflow tract and the pulmonary arteries.</s><s>Yet the short acquisition time also allows imaging of the entire thoracic aorta with optimal timing using the same contrast bolus.</s></p><p><s>The acquisition of a 3-dimensional CE-CMRA dataset offers some advantages over other CMR techniques like 2-dimensional spin-echo, phase contrast or steady statefree precession imaging.</s><s>In a 3-dimensional CE-CMRA dataset it is possible to create multiplanar reconstructions and to perform multiple measurements.</s><s>Once the source data is acquired all measurements can be performed offline in any position and there is no need for a correct crosssectional angulation pre imaging.</s><s>In our study we provide normal values in four positions of the aortic root and the ascending aorta.</s><s>As known from echocardiography studies, enlargement in postoperative TOF is not limited to a single section of the aorta but can effect multiple segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>Thus a gapless acquisition might be better than the acquisition of single slices.</s><s>Moreover CE-CMRA sequences are based on differences in T1 relaxation times and not on inflow effects what gives them a high signal to noise ratio and makes them insensitive to flow artifacts.</s></p><p><s>The robustness of this method is underlined by a low intra-and interobserver variability of our data.</s><s>The reliability of measurements is particularly important in CHD as therapeutic decisions are often based on the time course of morphological and functional changes.</s><s>Therefore the capability to detect minor changes and tendencies is crucial.</s><s>Interobserver variability was highest at the level of the AV and the AS and lowest at the level of the AA.</s><s>This is a common finding in CE-CMRA measurements of the aorta as the 3-dimensional dataset is acquired over multiple cardiac cycles without electrocardiographic triggering and irrespective of vessel wall motion.</s><s>Therefore the contours of the highly pulsatile proximal vessel sections show more blurring than the more distal sections <ref type="bibr"

practice not only in adult but also in pediatric cardiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>According to previous studies our data show that growth of the aorta is best described by a linear relationship between aortic diameters and the square root of the BSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>In addition we provide sex-specific values.</s><s>Previous studies found bigger valve diameters in boys at all ages, even before adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover onset and time course of growth is sex-specific.</s><s>Pooled values would have underestimated male and overestimated female aortic diameters.</s></p><p><s>Aortic diameters of our TOF cohort are significantly larger than the normal aortic values published by Kaiser et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Numerous previous echocardiography studies have reported enlarged aortas in TOF, yet the prevalence of aortic dilatation varies widely depending on definition and cut-off values <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s>In a large multicenter study an aortic root diameter of C40 mm was found in 29 % of adult TOF patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>However, there is only little data on aortic size measured with CMR.</s><s>Recently Kutty et al. published CMR data of AA size in a large group of TOF patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Compared with our data AA diameters were slightly higher in the cited study, which might be explained by methodological differences in AA assessment.</s><s>Kutty et al. used phase contrast imaging for measuring the AA, meaning that the aortic wall was included into the diameters.</s><s>In CE-CMRA the lumen of the aorta appears hyperintense caused by the gadolinium based shortening of T1 relaxation times.</s><s>The surrounding tissue including the vessel walls is hypointense.</s><s>Measurements in CE-CMRA therefore exclude vessel walls and can rather be compared to luminography in conventional angiography.</s><s>Moreover age at repair was higher in the cited study.</s><s>The majority of our patients underwent corrective surgery within the first year of life and might therefore be considered a more 'contemporary' TOF cohort of children and adolescents as an early repair is standard in most centers nowadays.</s></p><p><s>Yet it is unclear whether an early repair can reduce, delay or even prevent aortic dilatation in TOF.</s><s>Though it is assumed that increased aortic flow attributable to right-toleft shunting might lead to high wall shear stress also intrinsic alterations of the aortic wall seem to play a role in the pathophysiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s>Actually our data did not show a significant association between the age at repair and aortic size.</s><s>The only parameters associated with an increased diameter at all measured levels were the postoperative interval and the age at CMR examination.</s><s>As our group was quite homogeneous with regard to an early repair, these two parameters were highly interdependent and should be interpreted as a continuous growth of aortic dimensions over time.</s><s>Our results support the thesis of an intrinsic aortopathy rather than the thesis of preoperative hemodynamic alterations.</s></p><p><s>Male sex was associated with non-significant larger aortas.</s><s>In contradiction to previous studies neither right aortic arches nor increased LV volumes were associated with aortic dilatation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Large prospective longitudinal multicenter studies necessary to clearly identify independent factors of aortic dilatation in TOF.</s></p><p><s>The natural course of the left-sided affection of TOF is discussed controversially <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>The mild degree of aortic dilation in repaired TOF patients as shown by our results reflects our clinical experience.</s><s>Severe complications due to this dilation are rare and there only exist sporadic reports of aortic dissection or even rupture.</s><s>Yet in future decades the number of adult and elderly patients with corrected TOF will increase and atherosclerosis may put these dilated aortas at risk for dissection.</s><s>In addition a dilated aorta could result in a compression of the right pulmonary artery with unequal pulmonary perfusion and in the worst case leading to left-sided pulmonary hypertension with the need of a proximal aortic replacement <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, aortic dilatation at the level of the AV and the AS can lead to AI.</s><s>In the present study AI was obtained by echocardiography and there were only a small number of young patients showing mild to moderate AI.</s><s>This might be the reason for the absence of a correlation between aortic size and aortic regurgitation.</s><s>Further studies should use CMR phase contrast flow measurement for an absolute quantification of AI and a more detailed analysis.</s></p><p><s>Our results show the distribution of aortic dimensions in patients with corrected TOF.</s><s>This data may be useful for an estimation of the 'normal' aortic size in this patient cohort.</s><s>Special guidelines regarding the optimal time of replacement of the ascending aorta in patients with connective tissue diseases (e.g.</s><s>Marfan syndrome) as well as normal variants (e.g.</s><s>bicuspid aortic valve) have been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>No such cut-off values exist for patients with corrected TOF.</s><s>Although we cannot provide such data with our current approach this study might be a basis for future longitudinal studies using CE-CMRA.</s></p></div>
