<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic pain condition characterized by widespread pain and mechanical hyperalgesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>, affects approximately 4 million Americans and is associated with US$50 billion in health care costs in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Insomnia Disorder-defined as at least 3 months of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining restorative sleep (DSM-5)-is comorbid with chronic pain, affecting 50% of those with FM <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, research investigating the interplay and treatment of these conditions is needed.</s></p><p><s>Although the association between pain and insomnia is bidirectional, research over the past decade suggests that sleep impairment may have a stronger impact on chronic pain than vice versa <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Insomnia not only exacerbates chronic pain, but also leads to the development of painful conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Given evidence regarding sleep and pain interactions, research has examined the impact of cognitive behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBT-I), an established and highly efficacious treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, on chronic pain.</s><s>In a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials of patients with chronic pain, Tang and colleagues found that treatments incorporating at least one CBT-I component improved sleep (standardized mean difference = .68),</s><s>pain (.18), depression (.24), and fatigue (.38) in chronic pain populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>A limited number of studies have examined the efficacy of CBT-I among patients with FM <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, CBT-I demonstrated efficacy over sleep hygiene in improving pain-related rumination/ helplessness ("catastrophizing"), and use of CBT-I techniques was associated with greater posttreatment reductions in pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>These findings are underscored by the fact that one of the recommended treatments for pain-cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-P)-also has small effects on pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The promise of CBT-I in improving insomnia and pain symptoms raises the question of whether CBT-P also reduces pain in patients with FM.</s><s>To date, only one study has examined the efficacy of CBT-P among this population, but outcomes were not compared with CBT-I.</s><s>Instead, Lami and colleagues compared CBT-P with a combination treatment for pain and insomnia (CBT-PI) and found that the combination treatment improved pain intensity at 3 month follow-up <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>This effect was not observed following CBT-P, indicating that CBT-I may be necessary to effect long-term reductions in pain intensity.</s><s>This is consistent with the findings of Pigeon and colleagues' pilot trial comparing CBT approaches for insomnia and pain in a chronic pain sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The authors found that neither intervention significantly improved pain severity over the waitlist control (WLC), and CBT-P had only modest advantage over CBT-I in improving pain-related disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Vitiello and colleagues also failed to find significant differences between CBT-PI, CBT-P, and an educational attention control in reducing pain severity in a sample of patients with osteoarthritis and insomnia at 9 month follow-up, although CBT-PI had the largest within-group effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Collectively, studies suggest that CBT-I may lead to comparable effects on pain.</s><s>However, this has not been tested in larger samples or patients with FM.</s></p><p><s>The Sleep and Pain Interventions (SPIN) trial addresses this gap in the literature.</s><s>Specifically, SPIN compares the efficacy (i.e.</s><s>magnitude of improvement relative to baseline) of CBT-I, CBT-P, and a WLC condition on sleep-and pain-related outcomes among patients with FM.</s><s>We aimed to improve on the limitations of previous CBT-I trials in patients with FM, which were conducted by only two research groups and provided CBT-I primarily in group settings, by implementing an 8-session CBT protocol that was delivered individually.</s><s>Consistent with previous trials in FM and chronic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, participants in both interventions were expected to report greater improvements in sleep outcomes (self-reported sleep onset latency <ref type="bibr">[SOL]</ref>, wake after sleep onset [WASO], sleep efficiency [SE], sleep quality <ref type="bibr">[SQ]</ref>) and clinical pain (pain intensity ratings) than the WLC.</s><s>Furthermore, based on previous research, we hypothesized that CBT-I and CBT-P would show similar improvement in clinical pain, and the WLC would not show improvement in clinical pain.</s><s>Furthermore, we hypothesized that CBT-I would have greater effects than CBT-P on sleep outcomes than CBT-P, and both interventions would show greater improvement than the WLC group.</s><s>We also examined the effects of CBT-I and CBT-P on objectively measured (i.e. through actigraphy and polysomnography <ref type="bibr">[PSG]</ref>) secondary sleep outcomes of SOL, WASO, SE, and total sleep time (TST).</s><s>Because CBT-I is theorized to affect insomnia symptoms in part as a function of change in dysfunctional sleep-related beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, we examined change in sleep-related attitudes and beliefs as a secondary outcome.</s><s>Finally, because individuals with chronic pain are susceptible to symptoms of anxiety and depression, and CBT-I has been associated with improvements in these symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, we also examined secondary intervention effects on anxiety and depression.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p><s>The SPIN randomized controlled trial compared changes in sleep and pain in patients with comorbid chronic insomnia and FM immediately and 6 months following 8 weeks of CBT-I, CBT-P, or usual care WLC.</s><s>The University of Florida Health Science Center Institutional Review Board (IRB-01) approved the trial protocol (#627-2007).</s><s>All participants provided written informed consent.</s><s>This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov</s><s>(NCT02001077).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Participants (N = 113) were recruited from rheumatology and sleep clinics at the University of Florida and from the surrounding area through community advertisements.</s><s>General inclusion criteria were aged 18 or older, willing to undergo randomization, and able to read and understand English.</s><s>FM criteria were pain for at least 6 months and confirmation of FM by tender point testing, using guidelines established by the American College of Rheumatology (with application of 4 kg force, participants reported pain in at least 11 of 18 points, including points in all four body quadrants) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Chronic insomnia criteria were insomnia complaints (sleep onset or awake time during night &gt;30 min) at least three nights per week for more than 6 months; sleep diary confirmation of insomnia (sleep onset or awake time during night &gt;30 min) at least six nights during the 2 week baseline period; daytime dysfunction due to insomnia (mood, cognitive, social, or occupational impairment); and no prescribed or over-the-counter sleep medications for at least 1 month or stabilized on sleep medication for at least 6 months.</s></p><p><s>Exclusion criteria were sleep disorders other than insomnia, specifically sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index greater than 15 per hr or between 10 and 15 per hr with oxygen saturation below 88%) or periodic limb movements (PLMS index greater than 15 per hr); bipolar or seizure disorders (due to contraindication for the sleep restriction component of CBT-I); significant medical (e.g.</s><s>cancer) or neurological disorder (e.g.</s><s>dementia); severe untreated psychiatric comorbidity (e.g.</s><s>schizophrenia and substance abuse); cognitive impairment based on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score below 26 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>; and concurrent participation in CBT or other nonpharmacological treatment outside of the study.</s><s>Participants taking pain medications as well as those with common psychological comorbidities (e.g.</s><s>depression and anxiety) were included to increase generalizability.</s></p><p><s>See Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) flow diagram.</s><s>Participants reported withdrawing from the trial for the following reasons: CBT-I (3-not benefitting from treatment, 2-relocation, 2-familial obligations, 4-unwilling to undergo posttreatment or follow-up evaluation, 4-no reason given), CBT-P (3-not benefitting from treatment, 1-relocation, 2-familial obligations, 2-unwilling to undergo posttreatment or follow-up evaluation, 2-no reason given), and WLC (1-relocation, 4-familial obligations, 3unwilling to undergo posttreatment or follow-up evaluation, 5-no reason given).</s><s>Three participants in each active treatment condition withdrew due to reported lack of treatment benefit.</s><s>Otherwise, there were no significant harms or unintended effects.</s><s>Participants were compensated US$100 following each assessment period.</s><s>They received the treatment and parking on the UF campus at no charge.</s><s>WLC participants were offered treatment (a hybrid combining CBT-P and CBT-I) at no charge upon completion of their follow-up assessments.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures</head><p><s>Screening First, the project coordinator conducted a brief, structured telephone interview to address inclusion/exclusion criteria and establish probable FM and insomnia diagnoses.</s><s>At the lab, study personnel conducted a semistructured clinical interview, performed tender point testing, and administered questionnaires to confirm FM diagnosis and assess mood.</s><s>Then, participants underwent a single night of ambulatory PSG in their own homes to rule out sleep disorders other than insomnia.</s><s>Finally, 2 weeks of sleep diaries were collected to confirm the insomnia diagnosis.</s><s>Screening, with the exception of the telephone and clinical interviews and tender point testing, also served as the baseline assessment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomization and masking</head><p><s>Participants were randomly assigned to condition by computergenerated block randomization (block size = 6).</s><s>They provided informed consent and completed the baseline assessment period prior to being informed of their assignment by the project coordinator.</s><s>Team members involved in recruitment data collection, and statisticians who conducted the analyses, were masked to assignment.</s><s>Due to the nature of the treatment, interventionist and participant masking was not possible.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interventions</head><p><s>Eight-session CBT-I and CBT-P protocols (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) were manualized and individually delivered during 50 min sessions by predoctoral students in clinical psychology.</s><s>There were three interventionists, and each delivered both interventions.</s><s>Both treatments were developed by psychologists who had expertise in CBT-I (C.S.M.) and CBT-P (L.B.W.) and provided training, weekly supervision, and on-going monitoring of treatment delivery via audiotape.</s><s>Lichstein, Riedel, and Grieve's model was used to guide training and treatment implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Training involved mock therapy with corrective feedback and audiotaped practice sessions with volunteers.</s><s>All treatment sessions were audiotaped.</s><s>Half were randomly selected for scoring by another interventionist, and 25% of the scored tapes were double-scored for reliability by the lead supervising clinical psychologist (C.S.M.).</s><s>Interventionist scoring of each other's tapes (not their own) was used because they were highly qualified to evaluate session content.</s><s>Also, viewing others' tapes provided valuable booster training and enhanced consistency across interventionists.</s><s>Session parts were weighted by importance and scored 0, 0.5, or 1 for no, part, or full delivery, respectively.</s><s>Scores were summed to provide an index of the degree of treatment delivery.</s><s>A separate index of treatment purity was calculated using a similar weighted scoring procedure.</s><s>To ensure comprehension of treatment, participants were given a workbook detailing treatment instructions and rationale.</s><s>They were also questioned during sessions about their home practice of techniques and procedural modifications were adopted as needed (e.g.</s><s>pacing activities differently and adjusting bed/wake times).</s><s>Interventionists encouraged adherence and emphasized the importance of regular home practice, which was monitored by daily practice logs.</s><s>Participants also completed a 10-item quiz on treatment rationale and procedures at the beginning of session 3 and a treatment credibility questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> at the end of session 3. Interventionists left the room prior to the completion of the credibility questionnaire, which was then completed by the participants, placed in a sealed envelope, and given to the project coordinator.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p><s>Sleep Self-reported sleep.</s><s>Participants were instructed to complete a daily diary assessing self-reported sleep and pain (see below) for 14 days at each assessment point.</s><s>Diaries were completed via paper and pencil and were collected weekly.</s><s>Participants provided subjective estimates of the following sleep variables: (1) SOL-time from initial lights out until sleep onset; (2) wake time after sleep onset (WASO)-time spent awake after initial sleep onset until last awakening; (3) TST-computed by subtracting total wake time (time spent awake from initial lights out until time out of bed in the morning) from the total time spent in bed; (4) sleep efficiency (SE)-ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed × 100%; and (5) sleep quality rating-rated from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent).</s><s>Means were computed for these variables for each of the three 14 day assessment periods (baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up).</s><s>Primary self-reported sleep outcomes are SOL, WASO, SE, and sleep quality.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep.</head><p><s>The dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep (DBAS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> consists of 30 questions intended to measure five dimensions: misconceptions about the causes of insomnia, misattributions or amplification of its consequences, unrealistic expectations, control and predictability of sleep, and faulty beliefs about sleep-promoting practices.</s><s>Although the original scale used a 100 mm VAS, subsequent research with the DBAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> has used an 11-point Likert scale (0 = strongly disagree, 10 = strongly disagree).</s><s>The latter response method was utilized in the present study.</s><s>This measure had high internal consistency in our sample (α = .83).</s></p></div>

dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, may also partially account for the differential effects of the two treatments on insomnia symptoms.</s><s>Dysfunctional sleep beliefs, another hypothesized mechanism of CBT-I, were the only sleep outcome that improved at both posttreatment and follow-up in CBT-I but not control or CBT-P groups.</s><s>These findings also highlight the importance of understanding that CBT represents a class of interventions, and within that class, CBT-I and CBT-P are distinct interventions with distinct mechanistic impacts.</s><s>For example, although CBT-P included cognitive therapy, it did not improve dysfunctional sleep beliefs.</s><s>This is likely due to the focus in CBT-P on dysfunctional thinking related to pain.</s><s>Such thinking is often referred to as pain catastrophizing or pain-related coping, and prior CBT-P trials have demonstrated improvements in these pain-related outcomes.</s><s>Inclusion of pain catastrophizing and pain-related coping outcomes in future work in this area will help us to further clarify the differential effects of cognitive components of CBT-I and CBT-P on sleep and pain-related thought processes.</s></p><p><s>There were no significant group by time interactions for our objective sleep (actigraphy and polysomnograpy) outcomes.</s><s>However, polysomnographically assessed WASO improved following treatment, regardless of condition.</s><s>Furthermore, when collapsed across time points, CBT-I participants generally had less polysomnographically assessed WASO than CBT-P and control participants.</s><s>Our lack of treatment-specific objective sleep improvements is consistent with other CBT-I trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>, and is not surprising, as insomnia (like chronic pain) is a condition diagnosed based upon patient complaints.</s><s>For this reason, PSG is not recommended for the routine diagnosis of insomnia, but is indicated only if other sleep disorders are suspected (e.g.</s><s>apnea and periodic limb movements disorder) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Similarly, treatment response for both chronic pain and chronic insomnia is assessed based on patient self-report.</s><s>Inclusion of PSG has increasingly become the standard in RCTs examining the impact of behavioral interventions on sleep.</s><s>However, our lack of findings combined with those of prior trials raises the question of whether PSG should continue to be used as an outcome measure.</s><s>Alternatively, given that PSG data were obtained through one night of assessment, this may not have captured the patterns of insomnia observed in daily self-report diaries.</s><s>Potential night to night variation in polysomnographic values following CBT-I or CBT-P would be interesting to explore.</s><s>However, other factors hinder this type of daily data collection of polysomnographic data, as well as its use in general as an outcome measure is sleep research studies.</s><s>For instance, considerable resources are needed to conduct PSG (e.g.</s><s>equipment and personnel), and patient burden is also quite high (e.g.</s><s>hookup time, wearing the equipment overnight, and multiple assessments within in a relatively short period of time).</s></p><p><s>Our observed lack of improvement in actigraphy measures is, for the most part, consistent with prior insomnia intervention studies in FM.</s><s>For instance, one study found that only one actigraphic sleep estimate (i.e.</s><s>SOL) was associated with CBT-I <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>That is, the authors reported overall better actigraphic SOL at  posttreatment and 6 month follow-up for those who underwent CBT-I compared with usual insomnia care.</s><s>Additionally, another non-CBT-I intervention pilot study (i.e. an 8 week functional respiratory intervention) found improvements in actigraphic SOL at posttreatment; however, the majority of improvement was observed for self-reported sleep (i.e.</s><s>sleep quality, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50]</ref>.</s><s>Taken together, research suggests that the improvement in actigraphy measures following insomnia treatments in FM miminal.</s><s>Futhermore, given that there have been several reports of discrepancies between sleep diary and actigraphic measurements in FM <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>, it is possible that actigraphy and diary measurements of sleep in FM are measuring different constructs.</s><s>Overall, given the lack of objectively improved sleep in the present study, it may be important for future FM trials to consider other objective sleep measures (i.e.</s><s>sleep microstructure/architecture obtained through PSG).</s></p><p><s>Although actigraphy outcomes did not improve, the collection of daily actigraphy has allowed us to address important questions about the daily relationship between sleep and pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>.</s><s>Recent research suggests that actigraphy's usefulness may further extend to predicting treatment response.</s><s>In a recent study, patients with primary sleep maintenance insomnia and objective short TST (&lt;6 hr/night) based on 2 weeks of actigraphy prior to treatment did not respond as well to CBT-I as did patients with normal TST (≥6 hr) <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</s><s>Specifically, patients with short TST on actigraphic evaluation reported significantly less improvement in terms of insomnia remission, SE, WASO, and total wake time compared with patients with normal sleep duration at 6 months after treatment.</s><s>Given that study's focus on primary sleep maintenance insomnia, it is unclear whether those findings translate to the other populations, such as patients with comorbid insomnia and a broader range of insomnia symptoms (i.e.</s><s>sleep onset difficulties alone or combined with sleep maintenance difficulties).</s><s>Future research in this area appears warranted.</s></p><p><s>Contrary to expectations, improvements in pain were not treatment specific, as morning and evening clinical pain decreased significantly over time for all three groups.</s><s>Additionally, there were no significant improvements in secondary pain outcomes of global pain experience or pain-related disability.</s><s>Our examination of clinical significance revealed modest support for the clinical utility of both treatments for reducing clinical pain immediately following treatment, whereas long-term reductions were found for CBT-I only.</s><s>Specifically, although very few participants achieved large reductions (&gt;50%) in pain intensity, the number who achieved more modest pain reductions (at least 30%) was higher for both treatments for morning pain and for CBT-P for evening pain relative to the control at posttreatment.</s><s>However, at 6 months, CBT-I (but not CBT-P) produced a greater proportion of participants who achieved reductions of at least 30% relative to the control.</s><s>These findings provide limited support for our hypothesis that both treatments would affect pain.</s><s>Consistent with Lami and colleagues' findings of long-term improvements in pain intensity following CBT-PI, but not CBT-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, these findings also suggest that CBT-I may be important for long-term pain reduction.</s></p><p><s>Findings regarding pain are not entirely surprising, given inconsistencies in the existing literature.</s><s>Although prior research suggests that both CBT-I [8-10] and CBT-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> hold promise for reducing clinical pain, findings have often shown greater improvement in pain-related symptoms (e.g.</s><s>catastrophizing) rather than in clinical pain itself.</s><s>Additionally, when pain improvements have been found, they have typically been small.</s><s>Thus, one plausible explanation for our findings is that our trial was underpowered to detect small changes in pain.</s><s>Tang and colleagues offered this same explanation for the contrast between their meta-analytic finding of significant improvement in pain following nonpharmacological treatments involving at least one component of CBT-I and the inconsistency in findings across individual trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Those researchers suggested the examination of individual response trajectories as one approach for increasing power to detect significant pain effects.</s><s>Thus, future examination of patterns of within-person changes in pain over the course of treatment appears to be warranted.</s></p><p><s>The limited pain improvement in our trial may also be at least partially attributable to the presence of floor effects for pain.</s><s>Pain severity was not considered when determining eligibility for the present trial and as a result, half of our participants reported average pain severity of less than 50 out of 100 possible at baseline.</s><s>Use of insomnia severity criteria is an established methodological approach in the CBT-I literature, but has not been consistently used for clinical pain <ref type="bibr">[8-10, 13, 14]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, previous research found group differences in pain only when limiting the sample to those with the most severe pain at baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>; thus, we may have observed limited treatment-related pain improvement due to the lower average level of pain intensity reported by individuals in our study.</s><s>Future examination of the potential impact of pain severity on pain outcomes is needed, and the adoption of pain severity criteria may be warranted.</s></p><p><s>Contrary to our prediction and previous research, there were no effects of treatment on self-reported mood, anxiety, and pain disability outcomes following either CBT-I or CBT-P.</s><s>Given that we observed improvement in depressive symptoms (i.e.</s><s>lower scores on the BDI-II) at posttreatment, regardless of treatment condition, it is also possible that mood changes are not specific to treatment.</s><s>Instead, common elements of trial participation, such as the daily self-monitoring of behavior performed by all participants regardless of condition, may be associated with endorsing fewer depressive symptoms.</s><s>This speculation is supported by the fact that participants did not continue reporting improvements at 6 months.</s><s>Additionally, given that participants' average baseline scores on the BDI-II and STAI-Y1 would generally be considered representative of mild depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35]</ref>, it is possible that our results do not generalize to patients endorsing more severe symptoms.</s><s>Therefore, future work should examine whether CBT-I and CBT-P improve anxiety and depression in patients with FM who have more severe symptoms at baseline.</s><s>Furthermore, given that the pain disability index was assessed at one time point at baseline, posttreatment, and follow-up, it may not have captured the day to day changes regarding the impact of pain on daily functioning.</s><s>Therefore, it may be important for future work to consider implementing daily assessments of this index in order to examine the impact of CBT-I and CBT-P on its daily variation.</s></p><p><s>Strengths of this trial include its RCT design, use of PSG to rule out sleep disorders other than insomnia, and assessment of both self-reported and objective sleep.</s><s>Participants considered both treatments to be highly credible.</s><s>Additionally, treatment integrity was strictly monitored using an established system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and was generally high.</s><s>Treatment delivery was over 90% for both treatments.</s><s>Participants understood their treatment based on scores over 90% on quizzes testing their knowledge of their respective treatment.</s><s>Likewise, logs indicated that participants were practicing the skills taught in treatment at home to a high degree (≥90%) immediately following treatment.</s><s>Home practice was generally well-maintained at posttreatment for both treatments and at follow-up for CBT-I with a large drop (almost 30%) for CBT-P.</s><s>Booster sessions may be useful in future research to help ensure high levels of continued skill enactment for CBT-P.</s></p><p><s>Potential limitations include lack of power (due to small sample size) to detect smaller effects and potential floor effects for pain and mood.</s><s>Larger sample size and use of pain and/or mood severity criteria would increase the likelihood of detecting pain and mood effects in future trials.</s><s>Our sample consisted primarily of middle-aged women, all of whom had comorbid FM and insomnia.</s><s>Although this sex bias is representative of patients with FM, it is unclear whether our findings are more broadly generalizable to men with FM, patients with FM with subclinical insomnia or without insomnia, and individuals of both sexes with other chronic pain conditions.</s><s>Use of paper and pencil daily diaries is a limitation, because there was no documentation of date of completion which could have implications for accuracy.</s><s>Use of electronic daily diaries which provide a timestamp would increase the rigor of assessment of self-reported sleep and clinical pain outcomes in future trials.</s><s>A global measure of insomnia severity was not included due to concerns about participant burden, given the trial's large number of outcomes, and represents a limitation.</s><s>The use of a WLC is another potential limitation.</s><s>Although our control participants were actively engaged in pharmacological treatment for insomnia and pain to a similar extent as our active treatment groups, an active control would provide a more rigorous test by controlling for nonspecific therapeutic factors.</s></p><p><s>Both CBT-I and CBT-P treatments led to improvements in self-reported sleep, with CBT-I prompting greater improvements that were maintained over time.</s><s>Neither treatment prompted improvements in pain or mood relative to the control group.</s><s>However, relative to the WLC, both CBT-I and CBT-P prompted clinically meaningful, immediate reductions in pain in about a third of patients that persisted at 6 months for CBT-I only.</s><s>Future research that examines potential temporal effects of treatment on pain, identifies patients most likely to benefit from treatment (e.g.</s><s>those with more severe levels of pain and mood), studies treatment effects on pain-related worry and coping, and investigates the mechanisms underlying treatment effects is encouraged.</s></p></div><figure
