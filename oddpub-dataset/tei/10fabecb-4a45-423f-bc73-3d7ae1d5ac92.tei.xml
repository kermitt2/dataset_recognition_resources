<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>In all, 42 EUSTAR centres participated in this multicentre, post hoc nested case control, observational study.</s><s>Data about RTX-treated SSc patients were collected from centres during a 6-month period.</s><s>Patients were prospectively included in the EUSTAR database and received RTX in routine clinical practice upon the decision of their physicians.</s><s>Patients for the matchedcontrol group were chosen from the EUSTAR database according to the matching criteria outlined below and consisted of SSc patients not treated with RTX.</s><s>Clinical characteristics of patients and outcome parameters were defined as in the EUSTAR online Minimal Essential Data Set and have been reported in detail. <ref type="bibr">29 30</ref></s><s>Additional data with a special focus on timing of RTX exposure and immunosuppressive co-treatment, immune profile and safety issues were provided retrospectively by the participating centres.</s><s>Immunosuppressive co-treatment was defined as ongoing or newly started treatment at RTX treatment including a 3-month period before the first RTX infusion.</s></p><p><s>The following clinical data were included into the analysis: Patients' demographics (age, gender), disease duration from the first non-Raynaud's symptom, disease subtype (limited or diffuse SSc) and autoantibodies status ( presence of anticentromere, anti-RNA polymerase III, antitopoisomerase 1 (anti-Scl-70), anti-U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein).</s><s>Skin fibrosis was assessed by the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">31</ref></s><s>EUSTAR centres are advised that the same investigator is performing the mRSS on follow-up visits in individual patients, and EUSTAR investigators are trained on a regular basis on how to perform the mRSS. <ref type="bibr">32 33</ref></s><s>ILD was assessed by lung function tests including forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and by high-resolution CT (HRCT). <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">22</ref></s><s>ll patients agreed to participate in the EUSTAR database by signing informed consent forms approved by the local ethical committees.</s><s>The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and local laws and guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</head><p><s>Patients were included in the RTX group if they met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for SSc, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">34</ref> were treated with RTX and had at least one follow-up.</s><s>Patients in the matched-control group had to fulfil the ACR criteria for SSc, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">34</ref> did not receive RTX treatment and had at least one follow-up with report of the mRSS.</s><s>Patients were excluded if they had autologous stem cell transplantation between baseline and follow-up.</s><s>For the analysis of RTX on SSc-ILD, we included SSc patients with evidence for ILD, as defined by FVC of less than 70% predicted and evidence for lung fibrosis on HRCT at baseline.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary and secondary objectives</head><p><s>The primary objective for this study was to measure the change of mRSS from baseline to follow-up between the RTX and control groups.</s><s>Secondary objectives were to measure the change of the FVC from baseline to follow-up between the RTX and control groups in patients with evidence for ILD and safety measures.</s><s>Effects of RTX on primary and secondary objectives were analysed at the first follow-up after a single RTX course.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RTX application scheme</head><p><s>We analysed the effects after one course of RTX.</s><s>The most frequent application was two infusions of 1000 mg in 2 weeks (in 75% of patients), but there were also other application schemes (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Overall, 31 patients (31/63 or 49%) received co-treatment with methylprednisolone during RTX application, all of them in a dose of 100 mg per infusion according to the general recommendations for RTX pretreatment.</s><s>A total of 41 patients (65%) received co-treatment with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety of RTX</head><p><s>Data on all 63 patients were available for safety analysis.</s><s>We observed the following adverse events in RTX-treated patients: cardiac/renal involvement and arrhythmia was reported in one</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>This is the first multicentre nested case-controlled study with RTX in SSc.</s><s>Although there is a potential selection bias in this study, treatment with RTX improved skin fibrosis and stabilised lung function parameters in patients with SSc-associated lung fibrosis.</s><s>It is noteworthy that effects of RTX could be shown in both skin and lung fibrosis.</s><s>These effects on two different organ manifestations of fibrosis underline the potential of RTX as an antifibrotic agent in SSc.</s><s>The most important advantage over previous studies on RTX in SSc was the inclusion of a large control group using a nested case-control design.</s><s>Inclusion of a matched-control group is of particular importance in studies on skin fibrosis in SSc, as spontaneous improvements of the mRSS over time occur frequently.</s><s>Thus, previous reported effects of RTX in uncontrolled studies might have been due to the natural course of the disease rather than due to effects of RTX effects.</s><s>Moreover, it is the largest study reported so far on the use of RTX in SSc.</s><s>It also reflects clinical practice rather than potentially artificial clinical study situations, as patients and controls were derived from the observational EUSTAR registry and were treated by decisions of the local physician.</s><s>We could also observe an acceptable safety profile of RTX.</s><s>Infections and respiratory tract infections in particular are one of the frequent side effects of RTX treatment.</s><s>In studies with rheumatoid arthritis, respiratory tract infection occurred in 4%-9% of RTX patients.</s><s>7]<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[38]</ref> In the present study, the side effect profile was in general consistent with recent reports in other rheumatic autoimmune diseases.</s><s>The exception was rigour that occurred in three patients in our study and is neither a common manifestation of SSc nor a common side effect of RTX in autoimmune disease.</s><s>Rigour has been reported in patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphomas under RTX treatment and might be related to the release of cytokines. <ref type="bibr">39 40</ref></s><s>This needs further analysis in forthcoming trials.</s><s>In general, the use of RTX in the other systemic rheumatic diseases has shown good safety profile.</s><s>A major concern associated with a long-term RTX use is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</s><s>This was not observed in our short-term study, but longer follow-up in a larger number of patients and comparison with a placebo group is needed to establish a side effect profile specific for SSc. <ref type="bibr">36 41</ref></s><s>ur study has certain limitations: First, observational trials can be confounded by indication.</s><s>This accounts for the fact that in observational trials patients with higher need for treatment are more likely to get the medication of interest.</s><s>However, we accounted for this potential confounder by matching patients for major factors that influence the treatment decision for skin and lung, including severity of mRSS, disease duration and scleroderma subtype.</s><s>While immunosuppressive co-treatment was matched between RTX patients and controls, we cannot exclude that the application of methylprednisolone during RTX applications had effects on skin and lung fibrosis, although this is unlikely with only one or two applications.</s><s>When we compared patients with coapplication of methylprednisolone with those  without, the mRSS at follow-up did not differ significantly between the two groups (data not shown).</s><s>In addition, history of previous immunosuppressive treatment longer than 3 months before RTX was not available in this study for both groups.</s><s>Next, the mRSS, which was the measure of skin fibrosis in this study, shows a considerable inter-rater variability and also varies between experienced and less experienced examiners.</s><s>However, in the EUSTAR network, centres are requested that the same examiner performs baseline and follow-up examinations.</s><s>Furthermore, EUSTAR experts are trained regularly at EUSTAR courses, which have been shown to improve standardisation, intraobserver variability and within-patient SD values of the mRSS. <ref type="bibr">33 42</ref></s><s>Another potential limitation was that some of the data for this study had to be collected retrospectively, because they were not captured in the otherwise prospectively collected EUSTAR database.</s><s>Finally, it has to be strongly emphasised that this is not a randomised controlled trial which allows definite conclusions on the efficacy of RTX on skin and lung fibrosis in SSc and the relative safety compared with placebo treatment.</s><s>Randomisation and blinded treatment are an important part of clinical study design in SSc, and these issues need to be addressed in prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase III trials.</s><s>Nevertheless, our study as the largest and controlled study available so far adds important aspects to RTX and B cell targeting in general as a potential antifibrotic treatment strategy in SSc.</s><s>It provides the motivation for initiation of a phase III prospective, randomised, double-blinded, placebocontrolled trial in SSc, which is now the next necessary step to prove efficacy of B cell targeting on fibrotic manifestations in SSc.</s></p><p><s>Taken together, in this large, multicentre, observational trial using the EUSTAR database, we could show beneficial effects of RTX on skin and lung fibrosis in patients with SSc compared with matched-control SSc patients without RTX treatment.</s><s>These promising results need to be confirmed in phase III randomised-controlled trials.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Change of modified
