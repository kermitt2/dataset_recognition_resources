<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Participants.</head><p><s>Two hundred study participants (106 men and 94 women) were recruited from the clinics of the Department of Cardiology and the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Medical University of Graz, Austria, from June 2011 to August 2014.</s><s>Eligible study participants were adults aged 18 years or older with a serum 25OHD concentration below 75 nmol/L and arterial hypertension.</s><s>Pregnant or lactating women were excluded as well as patients with hypercalcemia (serum calcium &gt;2.65 mmol/L), regular vitamin D intake &gt;880 IU per day during the last four weeks before the study, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 , drug intake as part of another clinical study, acute coronary syndrome or cerebrovascular event in the previous two weeks, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref>-hour systolic BP &gt;160 mm Hg or &lt;120 mm Hg, 24-hour diastolic BP &gt;100 mm Hg, change in hypertensive treatment (drugs or lifestyle) in the previous four weeks or planned changes in antihypertensive treatment during the study, any disease with an estimated life expectancy of &lt;1 year, any clinically significant acute disease requiring drug treatment, and chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</s></p></div>
