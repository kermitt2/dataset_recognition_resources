<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Results and Analysis of Land-Use Types</head><p><s>According to the overall accuracy (0.876) and the Kappa coefficient (0.851) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref>), the land-use types were well extracted from the ZY-3 high-resolution remote sensing images.</s><s>As far as the producer's and user's accuracy were concerned, the UVs possessed slightly lower accuracies (77.6% and 84.6%) than those of vegetation (94.7% and 98.2%), water (98.6% and 97.2%), and roads (89.0% and 87.2%), although the omission and commission of UVs have been appropriately controlled by the texture selection procedure.</s><s>In a word, the present extraction accuracy can meet the demands of subsequent analysis.</s><s>Then, the roads, CBs, and RFs were combined into the normal construction land (NCL) type, resulting in the five major land-use types including NCL, UVs, unused land, vegetation, and water.</s><s>In terms of urban space, the GF core areas were highly urbanized.</s><s>According to the area ratio of five land-use types as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, more than 60% of the core areas were covered by impervious surfaces including NCL (50.1%) and UVs (10.4%).</s><s>In comparison, about 31% of this region was covered by permeable surfaces (vegetation, 28.0%; water area, 8.4%).</s><s>Similar to the spatial patterns of UHI zones, UVs also appeared in each administrative district.</s><s>There were several zones with spatially clustered UVs as labeled by black dotted ovals in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, including the zones near the Pearl River fork between Yuexiu and Haizhu Districts, the Wangjiegang forest park in Chancheng District, the Pingzhou Branch of Provincial People's Hospital in Nanhai District.</s><s>These results indicated that the GF core areas were featured by widely distributed UVs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Contributions of Different Land-Use Types to Urban Heat Island</head><p><s>The average surface temperature and UHI contribution index (H i ) varied with the land-use types across the GF core areas.</s><s>The five land-use types were ranked from the highest to the lowest surface temperature values as follows (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>): NCL &gt; unused land &gt; UVs &gt; vegetation &gt; water, which persisted during 2011-2017.</s><s>The average surface temperature of NCL was 1.89-2.97</s><s>• C higher than that of UVs.</s><s>In comparison, the sequence of H i for these land-use types was slightly different: NCL &gt; UVs &gt; vegetation &gt; unused land &gt; water, and this order also remained unchanged in this period.</s><s>These results showed that different land-use types made different contributions to the spatial patterns of UHI across the GF core areas, and NCL contributed the most to the UHI effect across the GF core urban areas, followed by UVs.</s><s>In addition, the average regional LST was correlated with the proportions of area of various land-use types.</s><s>According to the Pearson's correlation coefficients in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>, the average LST values decreased significantly when the proportion of area covered by the permeable surfaces (vegetation and water) increased in the UV-centered buffer zones.</s><s>Meanwhile, surface temperature increased remarkably when those of area covered by the impervious surfaces (NCL and UVs) were higher in these buffer zones.</s><s>In contrast to the significantly positive influence of NCL on the surface temperature, the contribution of UVs was not remarkable, which means that UVs and NCL possessed weak and strong warming effects in the core areas, respectively.</s></p><p><s>Lastly, the influences of land-use types on the spatial patterns of UHI could be further understood according to the analysis of the profile lines across the GF core areas.</s><s>On the LST profile line 1 (see the other profile lines in the Supplementary Files in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), the surface temperature values for all 5 land-use types formed a waving curve from 2011 to 2017 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>).</s><s>The average temperature of all profile lines in 2011-2017 were ranked from the highest to the lowest as follows: NCL &gt; UVs &gt; Vegetation &gt; Water.</s><s>As the largest contributor to the UHI effect, NCL was mainly indicated by outstanding peaks on the profile lines.</s><s>Water and vegetation appeared as obvious valley-shapes due to their relatively low surface temperature.</s><s>UVs tended to be featured by clear valley shapes when they were adjacent to NCL (labeled by blue dotted rectangles) on the profile lines.</s><s>However, when adjacent to the vegetation and water bodies (labeled by purple dotted rectangles), UVs showed a small peak shape on the profile lines, indicating an UHI phenomenon.</s><s>In the GF core areas, the areas with small peak shapes were, for example, near the Zhujiang fork between Yuexiu and Haizhu Districts, nearby the Guangjun Business Center in Haizhu District, and near Huolushan Park in Tianhe Park.</s><s>The results indicated that UVs were widespread and mainly surrounded by NCL, so that the slight but clear surface temperature valleys could be presented in this highly urbanized region.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p><s>To our knowledge, our study concentrated on the effects of widely scattered UVs on increasingly serious UHIs in some metropolitan regions for the first time.</s><s>In this study, we analyzed the influences of UVs, as well as other land-use types, on the spatiotemporal patterns of UHI in the GF core areas by means of multi-source remote sensing data.</s><s>This study will help to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of UHI in the urban area with numerous UVs, which can provide local environmental and hygienic

efficiency of ZY-3 high-resolution remotely sensed imagery segmentation.</s><s>Moreover, the extraction of texture using the GLCM method was used to enrich the features of ground objects to overcome the disadvantages of shape and spectral features in identifying UVs from CBs and RFs.</s><s>As a result, UVs and other land-use types were effectively extracted in the GF core areas with an overall accuracy of 0.876 and the Kappa coefficient of 0.851.</s><s>The results indicated that the nearest object-oriented method had strong adaptability and high efficiency and could be considered as an alternative approach to detect UVs in China.</s></p><p><s>The UHI is an outstanding environment problem due to its profound influence on the lives of urban residents, and some research have focused on how to mitigate it <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, the UHI effect in the GF core areas was mitigated to some degree in the past 7 years.</s><s>It is due to the fact that the joint GF development that has taken place in recent years has been accompanied by continuous implementation of policies protecting and restoring green spaces and water areas for the improvement of the ecological structure of the GF core areas.</s><s>In addition, previous studies have pointed out that the construction land is a predominant contributor and an important influencing factor of UHIs, while vegetation and water can mitigate heat islands in the urban area <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s>These findings are similar to our study that NCL presented the highest ground temperature, as well as the largest contribution to UHIs in the GF core areas.</s><s>In comparison, UVs, as a specific land-use type separated from the construction land, possessed 1.89-2.97</s><s>• C lower surface temperature and a relatively weaker warming effect, which may be related to the buildings' tile roofs of UVs with higher reflectance than cement roofs or their unique roofs with many potted plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref>.</s><s>In addition, the slight but clear surface temperature valleys could be presented from surface temperature profile analysis results.</s><s>These results implied that the specific urban settlement (i.e., UVs) should be considered as a separate land-use type when the influences of LULC on UHIs were to be investigated.</s><s>It would supply useful reference for monitoring and managing urban environment.</s></p><p><s>In fact, UVs are widely distributed in not only the GF core areas but also the other cities (e.g., Shenzhen City) in the highly urbanized PRD region.</s><s>In addition to the relatively lower temperature, UVs are commonly featured by poor sanitation, overcrowding population, low coverage public health services <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, resulting in a high environmental suitability for some biological vectors (e.g., Aedes Albopictus), as well as the vector-borne diseases in these urban regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56]</ref>.</s><s>Accordingly, UVs should be heavily emphasized due to their serious environmental health risk.</s><s>Together with the quick detection of UVs by using remote sensing, the unique influences of UVs on UHIs investigated in this study would provide meaningful clues for monitoring biological vectors, as well as preventing and controlling UVs-related infection in these urban areas with numerous UVs.</s></p><p><s>A few limitations of this study warrant mention.</s><s>First, much earlier UVs information before 2012 should be obtained for the future analysis of the spatiotemporal variations of UVs, although the urban reconstruction focusing on the demolishing UVs was slowed down after the 2010 Asian Games.</s><s>Additionally, the extraction accuracy of all the land-use types could be further improved through adding many more auxiliary data (i.e., openly accessible point of interest (POI) data).</s><s>Finally, ground temperature at night may be spatially different from that of daytime across the urban area and the analysis of their difference could be conducted in future research to provide more meaningful support for monitoring and regulating urban environment.</s></p></div>
