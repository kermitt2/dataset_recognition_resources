<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dear Editor,</head><p><s>Here, we report that the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter exhibits intrinsic hypoxia sensitivity.</s><s>Complex and refined genetic cellular or animal models of disease enabling targeted expression of transgenes in cellular subtypes such as select groups of neurons in the brain are now routinely developed and allow investigation of distinct mechanisms in cell death and other fundamental cellular pathways.</s><s>Thus, nearphysiological expression of transgenes is imperative and deserves close attention in the generation or application of these models.</s><s>However, systematic information of how stress conditions affect promoter function and thus protein expression is scarce.</s></p><p><s>Here, we use different fluorescent proteins with different turnover kinetics to illustrate that the sensitivity of a promoter to the conditions of the cellular environment, such as oxygen levels, can mask or mimic dynamics or function of transgene expression.</s><s>We found that over the course of cultivation there was a marked decrease in fluorescence intensity of the green fluorescent protein eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein)-or destabilized (d2)eGFPtransfected primary rat brain cortical neurons after 4-7 days in culture.</s><s>After 10 days most transfected neurons showed nearly undetectable green fluorescence when d2eGFP (Figure <ref type="figure">1a-i</ref>) or eGFP (data not shown) were expressed under the control of the CMV promoter.</s><s>This time course corresponds well with the stability of eGFP in cells of about 1 week. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> Furthermore, 24 h after hypoxia (see Mergenthaler et al., 2 for details), there was a marked increase in green fluorescence in transfected neurons (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>-i and data not shown).</s><s>Likewise, protein levels for d2eGFP were nearly undetectable by western blotting before hypoxia, but increased to readily detectable levels thereafter (Figure <ref type="figure">1b-i</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, d2eGFP was expressed at constant high levels when driven by the human ubiquitin promoter (UBI), without apparent increase of green fluorescence after hypoxia (Figure <ref type="figure">1a and b</ref>).</s><s>As a sign of cellular damage after hypoxia, protein levels under these conditions rather slightly decreased (Figure <ref type="figure">1a and b</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, other ubiquitous and neuron-specific promoters (CAG, composite chicken β-actin promoter with CMV enhancer; FER, human ferritin promoter; C1.3, long version of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II promoter) allowed constant expression of the monomeric red-fluorescent protein tagRFP targeted to mitochondria over the entire culture period, whereas CMV-driven expression resulted in nearly undetectable protein levels by western blotting and increased expression after hypoxia (Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, the tetrameric red-fluorescent protein DsRed2 under the control of the CMV promoter showed stable fluorescence intensity over the normal neuronal culture period of 10 days (data not shown), which corresponds to the greater stability of this red-fluorescent protein in cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> These data indicate that hypoxia sensitivity is not dependent on the species from which the fluorescent protein was derived.</s><s>Of note, we also found reactivation of CMV-driven expression of d2eGFP after 90 min oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) or oxygen deprivation at 0.3% O2, but not after glucose deprivation (GD, 90 and 180 min, data not shown).</s><s>In summary, these data indicate that hypoxia is a central stimulus for reactivation of CMV-driven transgene expression.</s></p><p><s>Silencing of the CMV promoter in the central nervous system, in neurons, and in other cells has been well characterized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4</ref></s><s>In addition, efforts have been made to introduce hypoxia sensitivity to the CMV promoter by coupling it to hypoxia response elements (HREs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5</ref></s><s>However, in this report we demonstrate that the CMV promoter is intrinsically hypoxia sensitive and can be reactivated after a brief period of hypoxia without the need for additional HREs.</s><s>Likewise, reactivation of silenced CMV promoter has been shown for cellular stress induced by lipopolysaccharide or physical stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> and pharmacological agents such as histone deacetylase inhibitors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref></s><s>ransgene expression under the control of the CMV promoter continues to play a big role in cell death research and other fields of cell biology for the investigation of fundamental cellular functions.</s><s>Our data emphasize that care should be taken when interpreting results using the CMV promoter in different models of cellular stress and in particular when proteins are expressed without a tag to distinguish exogenous and endogenous protein turnover.</s></p><p><s>Finally, the CMV promoter might not be suited to function as a constitutive promoter constant expression of transgenes.</s></p></div>		</body>
