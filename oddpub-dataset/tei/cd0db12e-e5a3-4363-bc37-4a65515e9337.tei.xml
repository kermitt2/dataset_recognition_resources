<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maintenance of T expression requires the conserved Y88 residue</head><p><s>The exchange of the conserved tyrosine residue 88 to an alanine (Y88A) in T was previously shown in vitro to disrupt the interaction of T with multiple components of the histone-modifying machinery, including RBBP5 and H3K27 demethylase activity, mediated by KDM6A and KDM6B <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>A similarly mutated T-BET (Y182A) was able to activate reporter expression in transiently transfected cells (a non-chromatin environment), arguing for the intact DNA binding and transactivation properties of T-BET Y182A .</s><s>However, activation of endogenous target genes in a chromatin context was impaired due to the loss of a permissive chromatin environment at T-BET target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>In order to identify whether there is a histone-specific function of T in early mesoderm development in vivo, we mutated the endogenous T allele in mouse ESCs (mESCs) containing a single wild-type allele (T 2J/+ ) to generate the T Y88A mutant (T 2J/Y88A ) (Fig 1A <ref type="figure">-C</ref>).</s><s>We directly generated embryos via tetraploid morula aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> of either T 2J/+ (T WT ), T 2J/2J (T null ), or T 2J/Y88A (T Y88A ) mESCs.</s><s>During early mesodermal specification (E7.0-E7.5), the expression of T mRNA in T WT and T Y88A mutant embryos by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was comparable.</s><s>However, at E8.0, the expression of T was markedly decreased in T Y88A compared to T WT embryos (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref>).</s><s>RT-qPCR analysis of T expression in whole embryos verified the reduction of T in T Y88A mutants compared to T WT (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref>).</s><s>Hence, while the initiation of T expression is unaffected in T Y88A mutants, expression cannot be maintained, leading to a concordant decrease in T protein levels <ref type="bibr">(Fig 1E)</ref>.</s><s>This disruption of T maintenance in T Y88A mutant embryos resulted in a phenotype similar to T null embryos (Fig 1F <ref type="figure">)</ref>, with embryos exhibiting a failure in allantoic development, a complete truncation of posterior mesodermal tissue, and lethality between E9.5 and E10.0 (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1F and EV1A</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Considering that the tyrosine residue is conserved among multiple T-box family members, we hypothesized that the analogous Y to A mutation in another T-box factor would lead to corresponding phenotypes to those observed in the T Y88A mutant.</s><s>We chose to focus on the T-box factor family member TBX6, which is also involved in mesodermal development.</s><s>TBX6 has previously been shown to play a role in the specification of presomitic mesoderm (PSM) in early embryonic development <ref type="bibr"

the maintenance of Tbx6 expression.</s><s>WISH analysis of Tbx6 expression indicated that while Tbx6 expression is initiated in the caudal end of the embryo, its expression is not maintained in the
