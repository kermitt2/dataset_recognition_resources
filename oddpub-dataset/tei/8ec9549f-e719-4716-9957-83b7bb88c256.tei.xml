female HUVECs to be more potent than primary male HUVECs in directing the maternal immune system.</s></p><p><s>For long time it was thought that mother and fetus are completely separated by the placenta and rejection of the fetus is prevented in normal progressing pregnancy because of a missing recognition of the foreign fetal antigens or in other words immune ignorance.</s><s>However, nowadays there is scientific consent that both fetal and maternal cells trespass the placenta, leading to the phenomenon of fetal and maternal microchimerism with beneficial and detrimental consequences for both the mother and the offspring, which seems to depend on the magnitude of the trespassing.</s><s>During pregnancy, tolerance towards the foreign fetal and maternal antigens is achieved by an active immune regulation.</s><s>Most studies concentrate on the modulation of anti-fetal immune responses in the decidua, the maternal part of the fetal-maternal interface.</s><s>However, it can be speculated that some maternal immune cells immigrating into the fetal circulation possess anti-fetal immune reactivity and may initiate processes that can harm the fetal tissue.</s><s>Thus, we hypothesized that regulation of maternal immune cells may not only takes place on the maternal but also on the fetal side of the placenta.</s><s>To test this hypothesis, we studied the potential of female and male HUVECs to contribute to fetal tolerance by altering the proliferation of maternal CD4 + T cells and/or induce Treg cells.</s><s>We found no influence of HUVECs on the proliferation of CD4 + T cells.</s><s>This is in line with observations from Adams and colleagues who demonstrated that "resting" (non-activated) allogeneic HUVECs stimulate IL-2 production, but not proliferation of CD3 + PBMCs.</s><s>Interestingly, in the presence of submitogenic IL-2 concentrations, HUVECs induced strong T cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>In our in vitro culture system, primary HUVECs did not produce IL-2 (data not shown) and exogenous IL-2 was not added to the co-cultures.</s><s>This may explain why HUVECs were not able to induce T cell proliferation in our study.</s></p><p><s>Despite the lack of an effect on proliferation, both female and male HUVECs induced Treg cells from maternal CD4 + T cells.</s><s>As Treg cells are key players in the suppression of allo-reactive immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and are critically involved in fetal tolerance (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ), we suggest that Treg induction by HUVECs may represent one of the pathways through which HUVECs contribute to fetal acceptance.</s><s>Several studies confirmed the presence of Treg cells in cord blood and analyzed their phenotype and functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s><s>While Mold and colleagues proved the existence of maternal CD4 + T cells in neonatal cord blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , none of the other studies provided evidence about the origin of the cord blood derived Treg cells.</s><s>Those Treg cells may be of fetal or maternal origin or represent a pool of both.</s><s>This question should be addressed in a future study, where Treg cells can be sorted from cord blood of male fetuses followed by a XX karyotype analysis for the detection of maternal cells.</s></p><p><s>After confirmation of a HUVEC-mediated Treg induction, we wondered whether this effect relies on a direct cell-to-cell interaction or is mediated by soluble factors secreted by HUVECs.</s><s>Primary HUVECs did not attract maternal CD4 + T cells that would facilitate conversion into Treg cells by direct cell-to-cell contact.</s><s>Additionally, HUVECs induced Treg cells also when spatially separated from CD4 + T cells.</s><s>This strongly suggests that HUVECs can exert their effect on CD4 + T cells by secreting a soluble factor that favors Treg cell conversion.</s><s>We subsequently identified TGF-β , a potent Treg cell inducer from CD4 + CD25 − precursors <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , as a potential candidate for HUVEC-mediated Treg cell generation.</s><s>Previous in vitro studies in the human and murine system demonstrated that TGF-β induces Foxp3 gene expression in CD4 + CD25 − naïve T cells.</s><s>Foxp3 induction was further associated with a transition into T cells with a regulatory phenotype and a potent immunosuppressive potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>In vivo, TGF-β promoted the local expansion of the CD4 + CD25 + Treg cell pool and restricted the progression of autoimmunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In our study, both female and male HUVECs secreted high levels of TGF-β and its blockage in co-cultures of HUVECs and CD4 + T cells impaired Treg cell induction.</s><s>Thus, our results suggest a pathway mediated at least partially by TGF-β for generation of Treg cells by HUVECs.</s><s>In line, Carambia and colleagues showed that Treg cell induction by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells is TGF-β dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>IL-10 was not involved in the HUVEC-induced positive effect on Treg cell generation.</s><s>As TGF-β blockage could not completely abrogate the HUVEC-mediated Treg cell generation, we cannot exclude that other soluble factors or direct cell-to-cell interactions may also be involved.</s><s>Moreover, fetal specific antigens may influence the interaction between HUVECs and T cells and thereby the number of converted Treg cells.</s><s>Our experiments showed that CD4 + T cells from pregnant but not from non-pregnant women are susceptible for a HUVEC effect.</s><s>However, it remains to be elucidated which are the pregnancy-associated factors that influence T cell susceptibility towards HUVECs.</s></p><p><s>We were also interested to understand whether there are sex-specific differences in the capacity of primary female and male HUVECs to promote Treg cell differentiation.</s><s>We observed that female HUVECs had a stronger potential to induce Treg cells than male HUVECs.</s><s>This finding might be attributed to differences in immune-related parameters between male and female cells.</s><s>Indeed, in our previous study we found sex-specific differences in the expression of immune-relevant genes between male and female HUVECs.</s><s>Altogether, more than 70 immune-related genes were higher expressed in female HUVECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>Among these genes were members of the complement system, interleukin receptors, MHC molecules, the toll-like-receptor 10 and the co-stimulatory molecule CD86.</s><s>We are currently investigating secreted proteins in cell culture supernatants from unstimulated female and male HUVECs.</s><s>So far, we could identify a higher secretion of MCP-1 and IL-8 in male HUVECs as compared to female HUVECs.</s><s>Although all of the above differentially expressed molecules are potential candidates for the observed sex-specific effects, a direct influence on Treg cell induction has not been reported in the literature so far.</s><s>Thus, functional consequences of the observed transcriptional differences between male and female on Treg cell induction remain to be elucidated.</s><s>Differential numbers of Treg cells generated in female and male fetuses may provide explanations for sex-specific variations in the susceptibility to autoimmune and infectious diseases that can be observed during childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we propose that maternal T cells trespass the placenta and get in contact with HUVECs.</s><s>During pregnancy, HUVECs may prevent anti-fetal immune responses by converting allo-reactive T cells into pregnancy-protective Treg cells, and this effect is apparently sex-specific (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s></p></div>
