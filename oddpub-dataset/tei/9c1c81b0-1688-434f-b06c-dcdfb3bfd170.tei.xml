adequate microvascular networks.</s><s>The structural diameter of a vessel is here defined as the internal diameter at a physiological transmural pressure in the absence of vascular tone.</s><s>Under normal conditions, vessel diameters are determined by the structural diameter combined with any effects of smooth muscle cell tone.</s><s>Several stimuli for structural diameter changes have been identified, including circumferential stress in the vascular wall, shear stress on the endothelial cell surface, local metabolic conditions and conducted responses propagated along vessel walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pries et al., 1998)</ref>.</s><s>Theoretical studies have shown that diameter adaptation in response to wall shear stress alone causes regression of complex network structures to single arterio-venous pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rodbard, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hacking et al., 1996)</ref>.</s><s>This instability originates from a positive feedback mechanism: Vessels with higher blood flow experience higher wall shear stress, evoking a stimulus for diameter increase, which leads to further increase of blood flow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Thus, a compensatory negative feedback mechanism is needed to maintain blood flow and to preserve parallel flow pathways.</s><s>Such a negative feedback can be derived from local metabolic conditions, if low local blood flow or an imbalance between substrate supply and demand causes the generation of a signal for diameter increase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>Oxygen is a critical metabolite, and the metabolic signal is often assumed to be related to the local oxygen level.</s><s>According to this concept, decreased oxygen partial pressures (PO 2 ) induce increased release of metabolic signaling substance(s) which evokes structural increases of vessel diameters, increasing perfusion and restoring adequate PO 2 values.</s><s>Alternatively, decreased PO 2 may induce decreased release of (vasoconstrictive) substances evoking diameter decrease.</s></p><p><s>Experimental studies of acute blood flow regulation have established the role of metabolic mechanisms in controlling diameters of arterioles and small arteries via changes of smooth muscle tone.</s><s>These studies provide evidence for different sites of oxygen-dependent release of vasoactive substances, specifically the parenchymal tissue, the red blood cells (RBCs), and the vessel wall (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>It has also been suggested that increasing PO 2 may lead to increased release of vasoconstrictive mediators <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jackson, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lombard et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>As mediators of metabolic vasodilator signaling by the parenchymal tissue, substances including adenosine, CO 2 , O − 2 , phosphates, prostanoids and osmolality have been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berne, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Broten et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Golub and

1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ellsworth et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, nitric oxide (NO) as a metabolic signal substance is liberated from S-nitrosohemoglobin in proportion to the decline of hemoglobin saturation along a vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jia et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stamler et al., 1997)</ref> or reduced from nitrite mediated by deoxyhemoglobin <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Cosby et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Nagababu et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Possible metabolic signal substances released by the vessel wall or its immediately adjacent tissues include adenosine, NO, prostaglandins and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Busse et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pohl and Busse, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Messina et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Earley et al., 2003)</ref>.</s><s>Several studies have

target="#b21">Jacobsen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Martinez-Lemus et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the various factors that have been proposed as contributing to acute flow regulation can also be considered as potential mediators of structural adaptation of vessel diameters.</s></p><p><s>While these studies have suggested potential mechanisms of metabolic signaling in structural adaptation, the relevance of these mechanisms and how they are integrated to achieve adequate diameter control remain to be determined.</s><s>Therefore, the goal of the present study is to test several possible modes for metabolic structural control of vessel diameters, with respect to their ability to provide adequate tissue oxygenation and to generate blood flow velocities in agreement with experimental observations.</s><s>A previously developed theoretical model <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reglin et al., 2009)</ref> is used to simulate vessel diameter adaptation in response to hemodynamic and metabolic stimuli for a rat mesentery microvascular network with 576 vessel segments where complete morphological and hemodynamic data sets were previously obtained from in vivo observations.</s><s>By incorporating various assumed modes of metabolic control in the model, the effects of these control modes on network structure, flow and oxygenation were assessed.</s><s>The tested modes include vessel-derived, tissue-derived and RBC-derived metabolic signals acting individually and in combination and oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent generation of these signals.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The goal of the present work is to gain insight into the mechanisms governing structural responses of microvessel diameters to metabolic signals.</s><s>The approach depends on the assumption that fully adapted inner vessel diameters represent the outcome of biological mechanisms that control structural adaptation in response to metabolic and hemodynamic signals, so as to provide a biologically adequate distribution of blood flow in the vascular network.</s><s>Therefore, simulating possible mechanisms and testing their ability to generate results consistent with experimental observations allows testing of hypotheses regarding these mechanisms of adaptation.</s><s>The simulations of diameter adaptation are based on microvascular network data derived from the mesentery, a tissue that does not experience large changes in metabolic demand over time, and from adult animals.</s><s>Therefore, the observed vessel morphology can reasonably be assumed to represent a fully adapted steady state of the system.</s><s>The experimental vasculature studied here did not exhibit tone during the experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Pries et al., 1998)</ref>, and so vessel diameters represent solely the result of structural adaptation.</s><s>In the presence of tone, arteriolar diameters would reflect the combined effect of structural (maximally dilated) diameter and superimposed smooth muscle contraction.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we assessed different assumed mechanisms of structural adaptation in terms of two parameters: predicted hypoxic fraction; and overall deviation between predicted and observed velocities (V err ).</s><s>The hypoxic fraction is considered as a measure of the potential of the assumed mechanism to meet the functional needs of the tissue for oxygen supply, while V err indicates deviation from experimentally observed conditions.</s><s>The errors in the experimental measurements of vessel diameters, flow velocities, etc., and the simplifying assumptions of the model result in a basic component of V err which is relatively large compared to the variations in V err found with different assumed mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pries et al., 1994)</ref>.</s><s>However, the remaining component of V err is sensitive to changes in the assumed adaptive mechanisms, and minimization of V err may indicate which mechanisms are likely present in the physiological system.</s></p><p><s>In previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reglin et al., 2009)</ref>, we considered the same three modes of metabolic control of vascular diameters, namely vessel signaling, tissue signaling and RBC signaling, each acting individually, and showed that vessel signaling led to minimal tissue hypoxia and closest agreement between predicted and observed vessel flow velocities in individual segments (minimal V err ).</s><s>Those results were confirmed in the present study, where the velocity error was lowest with vessel signaling mode, higher with tissue signaling mode, and highest with RBC signaling mode (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>The previous study did not consider the possibility that a combination of signaling modes could lead to lower levels of tissue hypoxia and V err than could be achieved by any one mechanism acting alone.</s><s>The present results show that this is not the case when oxygen-sensitive signaling is considered (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>In the present study, we also considered cases in which all three signaling modes are insensitive to oxygen levels.</s><s>The results for hypoxic fraction are similar to those with oxygensensitive signaling, in that hypoxic fraction was low with vessel or tissue signaling but high with RBC signaling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</s><s>In these case, V err levels were somewhat higher and the minimum was found for a combination of tissue and vessel signaling (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>).</s></p><p><s>In the present study, we explored the dependence of vessel signaling on the assumed signal-producing structure, by considering signals generated in proportion to the number, length, surface area, volume, or flow rate in each vessel.</s><s>While it might be expected that signals are generated in proportion to vessel surface area (i.e., endothelial cell area), the best match between model predictions and experimental data was obtained for vessel signaling in proportion to vessel length (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>Signal generation in proportion to surface area has the consequence that the signal decreases with decreasing vessel diameter, which diminishes the ability of low-flow vessels to restore adequate flow.</s><s>This may account for the advantageous behavior of length-dependent signaling.</s><s>One possible interpretation of this result is that the signal is generated from a tissue sleeve of constant outer radius adjacent to the vessel, such that the volume of signal-generating tissue is proportional to the vessel length.</s><s>Such behavior could result from mechanisms limiting the effective diffusion distance of signaling molecules such as adenosine <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Deussen, 2000)</ref>, VEGF <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Ji et al., 2007)</ref> or HETE <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Lombard et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>This "tissue sleeve" hypothesis might explain experimental observations where PO 2 sensitivity was lost after complete dissection of perivascular tissue from arterioles in situ <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jackson, 1987)</ref> while being preserved if even small amounts of perivascular tissue remained in contact with the vessel <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jackson and Duling, 1983)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The role of oxygen sensitivity in metabolic signaling was investigated by restricting the range of PO 2 values for which metabolic signals are produced in an oxygen-dependent fashion.</s><s>Sensitivity in the high PO 2 range was shown to have the greatest impact in reducing V err (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D,E</ref>) while varying oxygen sensitivity at lower PO 2 levels had little effect (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B,C</ref>).</s><s>Even in the complete absence of oxygen sensitivity, relatively low velocity errors were obtained with vessel signaling.</s><s>Thus, the results of the present study surprisingly suggest that functionally adequate vessel diameter distributions can be achieved with restricted or absent oxygen sensitivity.</s><s>This finding can be understood in terms of feedback mechanisms involved in control of vessel diameters (Figure <ref type="figure">6A</ref>).</s><s>Independent of oxygen sensitivity, negative feedback is provided by the "dilution effect" <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Reglin and Pries, 2014)</ref> for signal substances released into the blood that evoke vessel diameter increase: The concentration in the blood of a substance that diffuses into the vessel at a given rate increases inversely with decreasing volume flow rate.</s><s>In low flow vessels, the higher substance concentration may thus evoke a stronger signal for diameter increase, providing a simple and robust mechanism for adaptation to maintain adequate flow in all vessels, provided that the existing network structure provides adequate vessel density.</s><s>This mechanism may operate in tissues such as the lung that are not dependent on blood for oxygen supply.</s><s>However, mechanisms involving sensitivity to oxygen must play a key role in enabling adaptation of vascular networks to short and long term changes in the oxygen supply-todemand ratio of the tissue, including stimulation of angiogenesis to increase vascular density when oxygen demand increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Secomb et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Reglin and Pries, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Insight into the possible reasons for this finding can be obtained by considering the feedback loops involved in each signaling mode (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</s><s>In vessel signaling, the dilution effect and PO 2 -dependent signaling act together to provide robust negative feedback regulation, with vessel diameter increasing in response to low flow and low PO 2 (Figure <ref type="figure">6A</ref>).</s><s>This provides FIGURE 6 | Feedback loops involved in structural control of structural vessel diameters, under different assumed metabolic signaling modes.</s><s>Arrows and blunt ends indicate stimulatory and inhibitory action.</s><s>Signs "+" and "-" in gray rectangles indicate positive and negative feedback regulation.</s><s>Upper loop: hemodynamic feedback.</s><s>Lower loops: metabolic feedback.</s><s>In all cases, the growth response to wall shear stress produces a positive hemodynamic feedback loop, which must be counteracted by negative feedback from metabolic responses to maintain stability.</s><s>(A) Vessel signaling.</s><s>Increased blood flow causes increased intravascular PO 2 which reduces production of the metabolic signaling substance, resulting in a negative feedback loop (upper metabolic loop).</s><s>In addition, the dilution effect (lower metabolic loop) introduces a negative feedback that operates independently of oxygen sensitivity.</s><s>(B) Tissue signaling.</s><s>Increased blood flow causes increased intravascular PO 2 , and hence increased tissue PO 2 , which reduces production of the metabolic signaling substance, resulting in a negative feedback loop which, however will be compromised for situations where the maximal oxygen diffusion distance is exceeded (dashed arrow).</s><s>The dilution effect is again present.</s><s>(C) RBC signaling.</s><s>Increased blood flow causes increased RBC hemoglobin oxygen saturation, reducing production of the metabolic signaling substance, resulting in a negative feedback loop (upper metabolic loop).</s><s>However, decreasing vessel diameter and blood flow decrease the local concentration of RBCs due to unequal RBC distribution at microvascular bifurcations, and this introduces a destabilizing positive feedback effect (middle metabolic loop).</s><s>The dilution effect is again present (lower metabolic loop).</s><s>(D) Vessel signaling with a vasoconstrictor signaling substance.</s><s>Increased blood flow causes increased intravascular PO 2 , which increases production of the metabolic vasoconstrictor signaling substance, resulting in a negative feedback loop.</s><s>However, increased blood flow also reduces the concentration of the metabolic signaling substance in the blood by the dilution effect, which introduces a destabilizing positive feedback.</s><s>a likely explanation for the effectiveness of vessel signaling in producing low levels of tissue hypoxia and velocity error.</s></p><p><s>In tissue signaling, the situation is similar to that in vessel signaling, with both the dilution effect and PO 2 -based signaling providing negative feedback regulation (Figure <ref type="figure">6B</ref>) but somewhat higher velocity error (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</s><s>This may be due to partial decoupling of the feedback, as oxygenation of tissue cells is determined both by vascular perfusion and diffusion distance.</s><s>If vessel density is too low, increase of vascular diameter caused by metabolic signals released by the tissue cannot lead to adequate tissue oxygenation if the distance from microvessels to cells within the tissue exceeds the maximal oxygen diffusion distance (depending on tissue oxygen consumption).</s><s>In this situation, inadequately supplied tissue cells would continue to produce increased levels of the metabolic signal substance despite the diameter increase of existing vessels, compromising the metabolic negative feedback signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reglin et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In RBC signaling, both the dilution effect and the SO 2 -based signaling provide negative feedback regulation (Figure <ref type="figure">6C</ref>).</s><s>However, in this case the metabolic substances are generated in proportion to local tube hematocrit (H T ).</s><s>As a consequence of the unequal partition of hematocrit in diverging microvascular bifurcations, vessels with lower flow also tend to receive lower hematocrit <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Pries et al., 1989)</ref>.</s><s>This effect reduces the amount of RBC-derived signal substance in a low-flow vessel, creating a destabilizing positive feedback loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Reglin et al., 2009</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">6C</ref>).</s><s>Therefore, RBC signaling provides a less effective mechanism for ensuring tissue oxygenation, relative to vessel and tissue signaling.</s><s>An analogous conclusion was reached in the context of acute flow regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Roy et al., 2012)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Low PO 2 was considered to lead to an increased release of dilator substances in the models discussed so far.</s><s>Alternatively, decreasing PO 2 could lead to a declining release of vasoconstrictive mediators, as has been shown for release of leukotrienes or 20-HETE in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Jackson, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lombard et al., 1999)</ref>.</s><s>In this case, shown schematically in Figure <ref type="figure">6D</ref>, an increase in flow results in a reduced concentration of the vasoconstrictor by the dilution effect, creating a positive feedback mechanism that leads to further flow increase and works against uniform tissue oxygenation.</s><s>Therefore, it is unlikely that vasoconstrictive mediators can play a primary role in structural adaptation of diameters in response to metabolic stimuli.</s></p><p><s>When comparing different signaling modes, the constants β that specify the signal strength must be chosen.</s><s>Here, the values were chosen to give the same total metabolite release rate for all three modes.</s><s>The possibility arises that other assumptions might lead to different conclusions.</s><s>For instance a higher value of β might give improved tissue oxygenation with RBC signaling.</s><s>In all cases considered, however, RBC signaling gave relatively high levels of hypoxia and V err .</s><s>It was not possible to reduce V err to levels comparable to those found with the vessel or tissue mode by varying the metabolic feedback strength for RBC signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Reglin et al., 2009</ref>.</s><s>This is an expected consequence of the positive feedback mechanism shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6C</ref>, which would only be strengthened by increasing β.</s></p><p><s>In summary, theoretical models have been developed for structural control of microvessel diameters by metabolic signals, and the predictions were compared with in vivo experimental observations.</s><s>With this approach, a variety of hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms have been tested.</s><s>The results indicate that growth signals generated in the vessel wall or an adjacent tissue sleeve in response to reduced PO 2 are likely to play a dominant role in the metabolic control of vessel diameters.</s><s>In this context, oxygen sensitivity in the high PO 2 ranges seems to be especially relevant to achieve realistic diameter distributions.</s><s>Growth signals derived from the entire tissue may also play a role but give results that agree less well with experimental observations.</s><s>On the other hand, such signals presumably play an important role in stimulating angiogenesis when vascular density is inadequate.</s><s>In contrast, RBC signaling results in inadequate oxygen distribution, with significant fraction (∼5%) of hypoxic tissue.</s><s>With decreasing flow, vessel hematocrit decreases as a consequence of unequal hematocrit partition in diverging bifurcations.</s><s>The reduction of the concentration of RBCs releasing metabolic signal substances creates a positive feedback loop.</s><s>Also, signaling based on a vasoconstrictor released at high oxygen levels is unlikely to be effective as it likewise creates a positive feedback loop.</s><s>The ability of blood-borne growth signals generated in response to reduced oxygen levels to regulate vessel diameters is enhanced by the dilution effect, which causes a reduction of concentration with increasing flow, providing a negative feedback mechanism.</s><s>This mechanism is effective even if the generation of the metabolic signal substance is independent of oxygen levels.</s></p><p><s>These results may suggest new targets for experimental studies of metabolic control of vessel luminal diameter.</s><s>Candidate molecules for metabolic control of diameters are likely to be produced by or in the close vicinity of the vessel wall.</s><s>While it is likely that the generation of these substances is PO 2 -dependent, growth signals whose generation has no oxygen sensitivity or a limited range of sensitivity may contribute to diameter control, as a consequence of the dilution effect.</s></p></div>
