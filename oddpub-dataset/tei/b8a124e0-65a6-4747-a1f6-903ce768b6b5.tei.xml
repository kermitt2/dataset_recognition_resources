<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">| Patients</head><p><s>Patients (≥18 years old) who had type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control with diet and lifestyle advice alone (ie, pharmacotherapy-naïve, defined as no prior pharmacotherapy for glucose lowering within 90 days prior to enrolment and no more than 14 days of glucose-lowering medication) were eligible for inclusion.</s><s>Key inclusion criteria were: HbA1c, 7.0% to 9.2% at screening; body mass index (BMI) ≤45.0 kg/m 2 ; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) &lt;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); C-peptide ≥1.0 ng/mL at enrolment.</s><s>Key exclusion criteria were: history of ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma; marked polyuria; polydipsia with &gt;10% weight loss during last 3 months prior to screening/enrolment; and elevated serum creatinine levels.</s><s>Patients provided written informed consent before participating in the study, which followed the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">| Study assessments</head><p><s>The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24, which was also examined by baseline HbA1c subgroup (&lt;8%, ≥8 to &lt;9% and ≥9%).</s><s>The secondary efficacy endpoints were mean change in FPG and mean daily glucose (MDG) levels from baseline to week 24 (or last observation carried forward [LOCF] for MDG) and percentage of patients achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA1c &lt;7.0%) at week 24.</s><s>MDG was self-monitored using a 7-point fingerstick blood-glucose test.</s><s>Mean change in body weight and waist circumference, and mean percentage change in fasting serum lipids from baseline to week 24 were also assessed.</s><s>Safety assessments included incidence of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory evaluations (haematology, blood chemistry, liver function tests, urinalysis) and vital signs.</s><s>Hypoglycaemia was also assessed; all episodes consistent with the clinical definition of hypoglycemia as assessed by the investigator were documented.</s><s>Reasons for discontinuation because of hypoglycaemia included, but were not limited to, a documented fingerstick glucose value ≤54 mg/dL (≤3.1 mmol/L).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| Hypoglycaemia</head><p><s>After 24 weeks of treatment, no hypoglycaemia events were reported in patients receiving once-daily metformin XR compared with 3 patients (1.1%) receiving twice-daily metformin IR.</s><s>There were 5 events in total: 2 classified as "probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia" and 3 as "relative hypoglycaemia" (according to American Diabetes Association recommendations).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Few head-to-head trials have been conducted to establish therapeutic equivalency of metformin IR and XR formulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s>We report an international, 24-week, head-to-head trial of metformin XR and IR conducted in pharmacotherapy-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes.</s></p><p><s>The results demonstrate that once-daily metformin XR 2000 mg and twice-daily metformin IR 1000 mg monotherapy have similar efficacy and safety profiles.</s></p><p><s>The primary efficacy endpoint demonstrated the non-inferiority of metformin XR compared with metformin IR, which was confirmed in subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c.</s><s>Results from the 3 secondary efficacy endpoints, change from baseline to week 24 in FPG and MDG and proportion of patients achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response of HbA1c &lt;7.0% at week 24, supported this finding.</s><s>In the previously reported 24-week head-to-head study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> the mean decrease in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 for once-daily metformin XR 2000 mg was −1.06%, similar to the value reported in this study.</s><s>Patients in the metformin IR group received a lower dose than was used here (500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening vs 1000 mg twice daily) and experienced a mean decrease in HbA1c of −0.70%.</s></p><p><s>Once-daily metformin XR and twice-daily metformin IR were well tolerated, as reported in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and product labelling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s>tably, the most common AE was diarrhoea in both treatment groups.</s><s>The frequency of nausea was slightly higher with metformin XR than with metformin IR (4.6% vs 2.8%, respectively), which  contrasts with the previous head-to-head trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> ; however, overall, nausea was reported by few patients in both groups.</s><s>Moreover, AEs and SAEs leading to study discontinuation were reported for fewer than 5% of patients in both treatment groups.</s></p><p><s>In this study, down-titration because of metformin intolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> was necessary in almost 3 times as many patients treated with metformin IR compared with metformin XR.</s><s>The reduced requirement for down-titration from 2000 mg/d with metformin XR, in addition to the once-daily dosing regimen, may help to improve the patient and physician experience.</s><s>Patients in this study were highly selected (a large proportion of patients did not meet the study criteria) and were motivated to comply with medication; however, outside of a controlled study setting, the potential patient compliance benefits of once-daily vs twice-daily dosing are more likely to become apparent.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this international head-to-head trial has demonstrated the therapeutic equivalence of metformin XR and metformin IR over a 24-week period in pharmacotherapy-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes, and confirms metformin XR as an important treatment option for patients in whom dosing frequency could affect medication compliance and compromise treatment outcomes.</s><s>Data are adjusted mean changes from baseline, except for the responder rate (reported as percentage of patients achieving HbA1c &lt;7.0% at week 24; percentage adjusted for baseline HbA1c).</s></p><p><s>a Excluding data after rescue medication.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>FIGURE 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>FIGURE 1 Adjusted a mean change (SE) in HbA1c (%) from baseline to week 24 for patients receiving twice-daily metformin IR or once-daily metformin XR (randomized data set) b .</s><s>a Adjusted for baseline HbA1c, treatment group, time, baseline-by-time interaction and time-by-treatment group interaction and b excluding data after rescue medication.</s><s>Abbreviations: HbA1c, glycated haemoglobin; IR, immediate release; SE, standard error; XR, extended release</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
