<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Research in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is rapidly developing and there are expectations that this research may obviate the need to use human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), the ethics of which has been a subject of controversy for more than 15 years.</s><s>In this study, we investigated approximately 3,400 original research papers that reported an experimental use of these types of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and were published from 2008 to 2013.</s><s>We found that research into both cell types was conducted independently and further expanded, accompanied by a growing intersection of both research fields.</s><s>Moreover, an in-depth analysis of papers that reported the use of both cell types indicates that hESCs are still being used as a ''gold standard,'' but in a declining proportion of publications.</s><s>Instead, the expanding research field is diversifying and hESC and hiPSC lines are increasingly being used in more independent research and application areas.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>With the first reports on generating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from human cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Takahashi et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yu et al., 2007)</ref>, the controversy regarding the ethics of research involving human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Thomson et al., 1998)</ref> has arisen once again <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Holm, 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Opponents of hESC research have been quick to argue that, considering the availability of an alternative source of human PSCs (hPSCs), research in hESCs is no longer needed to realize the promise of hPSCs.</s><s>However, even before the derivation of hiPSCs was first reported, leading scientists in the field of hPSC research emphasized the need to continue research in ESCs in case hiPSCs became available <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hyun et al., 2007)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several arguments have been put forward to support the continuation or even an extension of hESC research.</s><s>For example, it has been reasoned that hESCs have advantages over hiPSCs for regenerative therapies because the latter may contain somatic mutations or reprogramminginduced epigenetic defects.</s><s>Indeed, there are currently 11 clinical trials registered with the FDA in which hESCderived cells are being used, mainly to establish treatments for different forms of macular degeneration, but also for neurological, cardiac, and pancreatic disorders (NIH, clinicaltrials.gov;</s><s>https://clinicaltrials.gov/).</s><s>Although the first results from one of the studies on macular degeneration have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Schwartz et al., 2015)</ref>, the vast majority of these trials started very recently, at a time when hiPSCs have already been available for years.</s><s>Currently, hiPSC-derived cells are being used in one clin-ical trial in Japan (UMIN Clinical Trial Registry, ID UMIN000011929; http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/).</s><s>Another argument in favor of continuing the use of hESCs is their utility for basic research (e.g., to gain a better understanding of human ground-state pluripotency) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gafni et al., 2013)</ref>, for studies of early human development <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Niakan et al., 2012)</ref>, or as cells that are unimpeded by epigenetic or environmental disturbances that are likely present in hiPSCs (e.g., to study gene function in a rather naive cell).</s></p><p><s>One of the most widely used arguments to justify hESC research is that these cells are still needed as the ''gold standard'' for human pluripotency to characterize and qualify hiPSC lines and gain a deeper understanding of the reprogramming process.</s><s>This argument is frequently used in the political debate among stem cell researchers and proponents of hESC research, and has become a central point in the attempt to justify continued support for this research, for example, by the European Union.</s><s>Thinking this argument through implies that research into hESCs would mainly lead to a more complete understanding of induced pluripotency and would become more and more dispensable with increasing progress in hiPSC research.</s><s>Indeed, although novel and less invasive methods for reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotency have been developed in recent years, and some difficulties in the reprogramming procedure have been overcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anokye-Danso et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kim et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Warren et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Yoshioka et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yu et al., 2009)</ref>, many controversial studies have reported differences between the two types of hPSCs on both genetic and epigenetic levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Liang and Zhang, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ma et al., 2014</ref>) that may, for example, result in deviant behaviors in specific differentiation settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bar-Nur et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hu et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mills et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it is currently unequivocally crucial to use hESCs as a reference material to gain a deeper understanding of hiPSC biology and to improve reprogramming strategies.</s></p><p><s>However, at present, the degree to which studies of hESCs and hiPSCs overlap, whether hESCs are being increasingly replaced by hiPSCs, and the purposes for which hESCs are used in iPSC research remain unknown.</s><s>Six years after the onset of research into hiPSCs, scientific projects that were planned and started after hiPSCs became available should now be completed and published, and a meta-analysis of the relevant papers can be performed to indicate trends with respect to the relationship between hESC and hiPSC research.</s><s>For example, if hESC research were just a transient technology and hESCs were mainly used as a ''gold standard'' in hiPSC research, one would expect the extent of independent hESC research to have declined in recent years and the cells to be mainly used in the context of comparative studies with hiPSCs.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we aimed to address these issues and provide a substantiated and validated database to facilitate further discussion.</s><s>We analyzed all original research papers involving the experimental use of hPSCs that were published after the onset of hiPSC research.</s><s>This analysis revealed that although research in hESCs and hiPSCs coexists, both areas are growing into independent and autonomous research fields that increasingly intersect.</s><s>About one-quarter of studies involving hESCs were found to also involve hiPSCs.</s><s>Furthermore, a close inspection of the overlap of hESC and hiPSC studies showed that in the majority of these studies, hESCs were not used as a mere ''gold standard'' to qualify and better understand hiPSCs, and that this role of hESCs is declining while their use is diversifying and increasing in other areas.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Database Searches and Paper Selection</head><p><s>We performed extensive searches of the PubMed database for studies that reported an experimental use of hESCs or hiPSCs and were published from 2008 to 2013.</s><s>Our searches resulted in 11,137 hits for hESC-related studies and 6,291 hits for hiPSC-related studies.</s><s>Of the identified studies, we excluded 3,313 and 2,444 studies, respectively, that were categorized by PubMed as non-original research (e.g., comments, editorials, and reviews).</s><s>In addition, we excluded 473 hESC and 227 iPSC papers because they appeared in journals that do not publish original experimental research.</s><s>To identify studies reporting original research in hPSCs, we manually inspected abstracts and/ or full texts of the remaining 7,351 hESC and 3,620 hiPSC papers for the use of hESCs and/or hiPSCs, and excluded articles of no relevance for our analysis (e.g., studies reporting on research in mouse or non-human primate stem cells, somatic human stem cells, or political or ethical aspects of research).</s></p><p><s>This paper-selection procedure finally resulted in a pool of 2,922 studies reporting on experimental use of hESCs (38.4% of the studies inspected manually) and 1,376 studies reporting on experimental use of hiPSCs (36.2% of studies inspected manually).</s><s>These publications were used for subsequent analyses, and the full texts of these papers were also investigated to identify the specific hESC and/or hiPSC lines used in the studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Involving hESCs</head><p><s>In the course of our analysis of the 2,922 studies involving experimental use of hESCs, we first identified papers in which hESCs were solely used for comparison with hiPSCs (as a ''gold standard,'' e.g., to compare novel hiPSC lines with hESCs with respect to pluripotency marker gene expression; see Experimental Procedures for criteria).</s><s>We identified 401 papers that used hESCs only for comparative reasons and thus provided no inherent contribution to hESC research.</s><s>Therefore, these papers were excluded from the hESC paper pool for the analyses of hESC research trends.</s><s>However, these 401 papers were included again for the subsequent analysis of research involving both hESCs and hiPSCs (see below).</s></p><p><s>The distribution of the remaining 2,521 (not ''gold standard'') hESC research papers on a timeline ranging from 2008 through the end of 2013 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>.</s><s>To illustrate long-term trends during the whole period of hESC research, we also included the respective data for the years before 2008 that were derived in a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lo Â¨ser et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s>Altogether, the number of hESC papers published per year steadily increased throughout the whole era of hESC research, with a minor decline in 2011.</s><s>Although there apparently has been a slower increase from 2010 on, the result clearly indicates a sustained high interest in hESCs despite the worldwide availability of hiPSCs.</s></p><p><s>We next investigated the regional distribution of hESC research.</s><s>By the end of 2013, research groups located in 38 nations reported results of experimental hESC research in international scientific journals.</s><s>To determine the contribution of individual nations to worldwide hESC research, we allocated each paper to a specific country according to the affiliation of the corresponding author.</s><s>This approach is justified since about 73% of the hESC research papers published so far resulted from national research with scientists from only one country mentioned in the authors list in the respective paper.</s><s>The results of our analysis are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> for the complete era of hESC research <ref type="bibr">(2000)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2007)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2008)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2009)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref> and for the years <ref type="bibr">2000-2009 and 2010-2013.</ref></s><s>Our results confirm the unchallenged leadership in hESC research by groups located in the United States, which continuously contributed about 40% of publications to international hESC research for the past one and a half decades.</s><s>The contribution of United States-based researchers remained nearly unaltered during the two periods shown.</s><s>This is interesting because these results reflect the research output under the two fundamentally different stem cell policies of the Bush and Obama administrations <ref type="bibr">(2000-2009 and 2010-2013, respectively)</ref>.</s><s>In contrast to the United States, the relative contribution to worldwide research from some other nations that entered the hESC field very early, such as Israel, Sweden, and Singapore, markedly declined in the second period, whereas the research output from countries that entered the hESC research field after a delay, such as Germany, France, and Spain, increased to some degree.</s><s>Notably, the share of research from China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan) in international hESC research increased from less than 5% in the 2000-2009 period to more than 8% in the second period <ref type="bibr">(2010)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2011)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref>.</s><s>We also related the number of hESC papers published in the 2008-2013 period to the overall number of publications in the life and health science fields.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S2A</ref>, the share of hESC research papers in the overall publication number slightly increased from 2008 to 2013, with some regional differences.</s></p><p><s>To exclude distortion of this comparison, the number of hESC research papers was related to the overall research output of the respective country in the fields of life and health science (Figure <ref type="figure">S2A</ref>).</s><s>For example, it became apparent that Singapore, Israel, and Finland overproportionally published research in the hESC field, whereas there was no major imbalance toward this field in other countries.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Involving hiPSCs</head><p><s>We next determined the extent of research involving hiPSCs through the end of 2013.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, the number of papers reporting on experimental use of hiPSCs substantially increased from 2007 (the year of the first publication regarding hiPSCs, with only two original research papers in the field) to 2013.</s><s>We divided the hiPSC era into two periods: 2008-2010 and 2011-2013.</s><s>While only 267 hiPSC research papers were published in the first 3 years, the number more than quadrupled to 1,109 papers in the following 3-year period.</s><s>This seems to be a usual phenomenon after the establishment of a novel research field: in the case of hESC research, the output of research even increased more than 8-fold in the second 3-year period of hESC research <ref type="bibr">(2003)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2004)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2005)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2006)</ref> compared with the first 3-year period after the first derivation of hESCs <ref type="bibr">(2000)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref><ref type="bibr">(2002)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, in 2013 the output from both fields of hPSC research was at a comparable level (about 500 papers each).</s></p><p><s>By the end of 2013, research groups from 27 nations contributed to research into hiPSCs.</s><s>As in the case of hESCs, the leadership of US-based researchers is unchallenged, with an overall share of 45% in hiPSC research published worldwide, although the contribution declined from more than 50% in the 2008-2010 period to about 43% in the more recent period (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</s><s>As expected, when the number of hiPSC research papers was related to the overall publication numbers in life and health sciences from selected countries, we observed a strong increase in the share of hiPSC papers for all countries from 2008 to 2013 (Figure <ref type="figure">S2B</ref>).</s><s>However, there are some regional</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>To identify global trends in the application of hESCs and hiPSCs in research, we established a curated database of published primary research conducted with these cells between 2008 and 2013, and performed a thorough analysis of studies involving only hESCs or only hiPSCs, as well as intersecting research.</s><s>The results show that both the hESC and hiPSC research fields increased (hiPSC) or remained at a high level (hESC) with respect to impact and quantitative paper output.</s><s>Research in which both hPSC types were applied in similar proportions included the development and optimization of cultivation and differentiation protocols, and research on animal models to develop cell-based therapies.</s><s>Interestingly, we identified early segregation trends for the preferential research use of hESCs and hiPSCs in the recent past.</s><s>For example, trends for the use of mostly hESCs include basic research on cell pluripotency and plasticity, and analysis of (early) devel-opmental mechanisms.</s><s>hiPSCs, on the other hand, clearly dominate the field of disease modeling, frequently in conjunction with the derivation of novel disease-specific hiPSC lines and the correction of genetic defects in vitro.</s></p><p><s>Other topics of hiPSC research included the provision of cell models for drug development and toxicity testing, although rather surprisingly, a slight relative overweight of hESCs was found in this application field.</s><s>This finding may have been influenced by our strict inclusion criteria, which only considered studies that directly used hPSCs, and excluded about 80 studies in which only commercially available hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, or neural cells were used.</s><s>We also excluded other secondary studies that used hPSC-derived nucleic acids, proteins, or data.</s><s>However, a more likely explanation is the relatively short time span of the research used in this analysis <ref type="bibr">(years 2011-2013)</ref>.</s><s>Follow-up studies will be required to establish a trend in this specific area, especially in light of the recent establishment of large-scale hiPSC banking projects to meet the anticipated demand in this field <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(McKernan and Watt, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>It is intriguing that about 20% of the studies involving hiPSCs were focused on the establishment of disease-specific human cell lines, and frequently provided for the first time relevant human cell models for poorly understood, rare, and fatal human diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cherry and Daley, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Peitz et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, a large number of projects that aim to derive novel disease-specific hiPSC lines are currently registered with the NIH (ClinicalTrials.gov).</s><s>While hESCs are a valuable resource for generating isogenic variants for specific diseases on a naive background, and therefore are also playing an increasing role in disease modeling, banking projects involving hESCs are mostly directed toward the distribution of highly characterized lines for comparable basic research and prospective clinical applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Stacey et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, in many cases, hESCs are used to provide a reliable source for differentiated or progenitor human cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes, which are not readily accessible in other ways.</s></p><p><s>The trend for increased differentiation in the field is paralleled by a large and increasing proportion of papers in which both cell types are being used.</s><s>To analyze the validity of the ''gold standard'' argument that is frequently used to justify the continued use of hESCs in research, we analyzed the intersection of research papers in which both cell types were applied for their specific uses.</s><s>Although such intersecting research is increasing in absolute numbers, it includes only a minority (about 26%) of all papers involving hPSCs.</s><s>Moreover, only a portion of these papers used hESCs solely as a gold standard for comparative research.</s><s>In addition, the overall proportion of hiPSC studies that also use hESCs is steadily declining, likely because the ''gold standard'' aspect is less relevant if, for example, the research is focused on disease models or on differentiated progeny derived from hiPSCs.</s><s>In the same period in which the proportion of hiPSC work involving hESCs declined, the number of hESC-only papers did not decline.</s><s>These findings may indicate that the trend of field diversification and specification is at least partially due to the specific and differential applicability of these two cell types.</s><s>These findings also show that hESCs are indeed useful as a gold standard and in general for standardization and benchmarking efforts in the field, but that this is not the major justification for their continued high level of use in research.</s><s>In addition, the use of hESCs for standardization and comparative research is limited to a very small number of cell lines, which are already well characterized and available from established hESC banks.</s><s>Hence, it appears that the ''gold standard'' itself is restricted to a small set: most studies used only a single hESC benchmark line (e.g., H9) rather than a larger, representative panel.</s><s>The lack of generally accepted standard hPSC lines and insufficient knowledge about acceptable phenotypic tolerances may partly explain this restriction to the most commonly used lines and their quasi-standard status <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adewumi et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Boulting et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Loring and Rao,

help to define such benchmark standards.</s></p><p><s>In the controversial field of pluripotent stem cell research, it is vital to argue on the basis of reliable and solid data that best reflect the actual research situation and are carefully validated.</s><s>However, available data on recent research activities in this field are often based on abstract searches and automatized algorithms, and not on manually verified data bank searches.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pera and Trounson (2013)</ref> estimated the number of publications on hESC research to be nearly 2,000 per year for 2010 through 2012, since review articles were included in their data pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pera and Trounson, 2013)</ref>.</s><s>More strikingly, the recent European Union-funded Stem Cell Report, published in collaboration with Elsevier and Kyoto University <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barfoot et al., 2013)</ref>, claimed that more than 500 papers on hESCs were published in 2008, and stated that in 2012, researchers from Germany published substantially more papers in the hESC field than groups from Japan, Korea, or Israel.</s><s>However, a closer inspection of the data set used for this extensive and highly appreciated study revealed that, for example, the German hESC paper pool contained many publications in which hESCs were not used.</s><s>Abstract statements such as ''Despite their potential benefits, ethical and practical considerations limit the application of NSCs derived from hESCs or adult brain tissue.</s><s>Thus, alternative sources are required'' resulted in consideration of the respective paper as a contribution to hESC research.</s><s>Altogether, nearly 50% of the alleged hESC papers from Germany used for this database did not report any research involving hESCs.</s><s>Moreover, while our study was under review, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alberta et al. (2015)</ref> published an analysis assessing the impact of stem cell research funding programs in selected U.S. states.</s><s>These authors searched the Web of Science for articles that contained the phrase ''human embryonic stem cell'' in the title, abstract, or key words, and were (co-)produced by authors with an affiliation in the United States.</s><s>However, our analysis of this data pool (1,544 hESC-related papers from U.S. authors) revealed that more than 15% of the studies identified by Alberta et al. are not relevant because they did not report research involving hESCs.</s><s>On the other hand, more than 550 relevant papers from the United States that involved hESCs and are present in our database were missed (including the one by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Thomson et al. [1998]</ref>).</s><s>The vast reduction of the initially high number of papers obtained through our selection process confirms that it may be essential for the assessment of research activities to initially generate broader publication-based data pools, and to manually validate each included paper.</s><s>An analysis of papers only on the basis of meta-data provided by a search engine may result in a massive over-or underestimation of research output and may lead to misleading conclusions, which could potentially influence and misdirect political decision-making.</s></p><p><s>When compared with our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Guhr et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lo Â¨ser et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lo Â¨ser et al., , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lo Â¨ser et al., , 2012))</ref>, the current analysis revealed some relevant changes in the number and ranking of countries involved in hESC research.</s><s>In addition, we substantiated that a country's quantitative output of papers in hPSC research does not necessarily correlate with the impact of this research.</s><s>For example, our previous surprising finding that Japan is somewhat underperforming in the hiPSC field was confirmed for recent years with respect to impact per study.</s><s>Moreover, although the number of hPSC research papers from China increased markedly over the past years, research from China clearly underperformed with respect to impact per study in both the hESC and hiPSC fields.</s><s>However, it may be expected that this situation will change in the near future as Chinese research groups increasingly publish papers in highly influential, ranking international journals.</s></p><p><s>Our present study was based on a pool of stem cell publications that only included original research papers.</s><s>It is a well-reasoned assumption that aspects concerning stem cell history, the prospect of using pluripotent stem cells in future therapies, and the ethical and legal aspects of research cannot reflect the extent of research activities in this field, and their inclusion in such an analysis is irrelevant.</s><s>Our data on the extent of experimental research involving hPSCs show that both hESCs and hiPSCs supply a vital research field that has not yet reached maturity.</s><s>The emerging trends of differentiation, diversification, and fusion with other research and technological fields indicate that both hESCs and hiPSCs will be essential and independent components of this research area.</s></p></div>
