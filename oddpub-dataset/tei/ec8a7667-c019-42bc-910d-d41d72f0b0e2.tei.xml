<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Although canonical NF-κB signaling is crucial to generate a normal mature B-cell compartment, its role in the persistence of resting mature B cells is controversial.</s><s>To resolve this conflict, we ablated NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and IκB kinase 2 (IKK2), two essential mediators of the canonical pathway, either early on in B-cell development or specifically in mature B cells.</s><s>Early ablation severely inhibited the generation of all mature B-cell subsets, but follicular B-cell numbers could be largely rescued by ectopic expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), despite a persisting block at the transitional stage.</s><s>Marginal zone (MZ) B and B1 cells were not rescued, indicating a possible role of canonical NF-κB signals beyond the control of cell survival in these subsets.</s><s>When canonical NF-κB signaling was ablated specifically in mature B cells, the differentiation and/or persistence of MZ B cells was still abrogated, but follicular B-cell numbers were only mildly affected.</s><s>However, the mutant cells exhibited increased turnover as well as functional deficiencies upon activation, suggesting that canonical NF-κB signals contribute to their long-term persistence and functional fitness.</s></p><p><s>NF-κB | canonical signaling | follicular B cells | persistence M ature B cells comprise three major subsets: follicular and marginal zone (MZ) B and B1 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s>Two receptors, the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and B-cell activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family receptor (BAFFR), have been shown to control the generation and/or persistence of mature B cells critically <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Numerous stimuli activate the NF-κB signaling pathways in mature B cells.</s><s>In mammals, the NF-κB family of transcription factors comprises five members (RelA, RelB, c-Rel, NF-κB1, and NF-κB2) whose activation is initiated by two major signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>The canonical pathway depends on the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of the structural protein NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and the IκB kinases IKK1 and IKK2.</s><s>This complex triggers the degradation of a specific set of inhibitors of NF-κB and the induction of dimers containing RelA and/or c-Rel.</s><s>The canonical pathway regulates NF-κB activation downstream of the BCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>The stimulation of the alternative pathway, mediated by NF-κB-inducing kinase and IKK1, leads to the partial proteolysis of the inhibitory precursor NF-κB2 and the activation of dimers containing RelB and/or the processed form of NF-κB2 through another set of receptors, including BAFFR (4).</s></p><p><s>There is abundant evidence for a critical role of the canonical pathway in the generation and/or maintenance of mature B cells.</s><s>The ablation of NEMO or IKK2 in the B-cell lineage, as well as conditional replacement of the latter by a kinase-dead IKK2, impaired the generation of the three mature B subsets and transitional 2 (T2) cells, a developmental stage preceding the mature stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</s><s>In the case of the kinase-dead IKK2, some mutant cells made it into the mature compartment but were completely outcompeted by WT cells over a period of 4 wk, upon blockade of B-cell generation in the bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Mechanistically, tonic BCR signaling could increase the production of NF-κB2 via canonical NF-κB activation in T2 and follicular B cells, sensitizing B cells to the prosurvival effect of BAFFR <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>However, other work suggested that canonical signals downstream of the BCR may not be critical for the maintenance of mature follicular B cells.</s><s>Ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of IKK2 only slightly rescued the acute loss of B cells upon ablation of the BCR in these cells, whereas a full rescue was obtained through signals along the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) axis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>In addition, a study of the role of B cells in a prostate cancer model suggested that the absence of canonical signaling may not result in the rapid disappearance of mature B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In the present work, using conditional ablation of NEMO and IKK2 either early during B-cell development or specifically in mature B cells, as well as ectopic expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), we show that canonical NF-κB signaling contributes to the functional integrity of follicular B cells and supports their long-term persistence through its prosurvival activity.</s><s>However, absence of canonical NF-κB signaling in these cells only mildly affects their numbers in steady state, in contrast to its severe impact on transitional B-cell numbers.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Mature B cells are long-lived cells responsible for the Ab production in the immune system.</s><s>Canonical NF-κB signaling, one of the two discrete pathways activating transcription factors of the NF-κB family, participates in the generation of a normal mature B-cell compartment.</s><s>However, the role of these signals specifically in mature B cells is still imperfectly defined.</s><s>Notably, their role in the persistence of follicular B cells, the main mature B-cell subset, is controversial.</s><s>Here, we show that canonical NF-κB signaling does not contribute to immediate (short-term) survival of follicular B cells, contrasting with the crucial tonic B-cell antigen receptor survival signals, but is required for their long-term persistence as well as functional fitness.</s></p><p><s>(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> A and B and Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1A and S2A</ref>).</s><s>Within the mature compartment, MZ B and B1 cells were more affected than follicular B cells.</s><s>Because overexpression of Bcl2 in RelA and c-Rel double-deficient hematopoietic cells has been shown to rescue the generation of mature B cells and promote their survival in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, we assessed whether ectopic expression of Bcl2 leads to the accumulation of mature B cells in the absence of NEMO.</s><s>Indeed, the generation of follicular B cells was largely rescued in Nemo fl Mb1-cre + Bcl2Tg mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, mutant MZ B cellularity was lower (2-to 5.5-fold) compared with controls and was similar to the MZ B-cell numbers observed in Nemo fl Mb1cre + mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>).</s><s>However, the difference between Mb1-cre + Bcl2Tg and Nemo fl Mb1-cre + Bcl2Tg mice did not reach statistical significance.</s><s>Surprisingly, MZ B cellularity was also reduced in Mb1-cre + Bcl2Tg compared with Mb1-cre − Bcl2Tg control mice.</s><s>In addition, the ectopic expression of Bcl2 in B cells did not rescue NEMO-deficient B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The absence of canonical NF-κB signaling in B cells has previously been shown to affect splenic B-cell development also at the T1 to T2 transition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>We thus investigated whether the accumulation of mutant follicular B cells could be due to the rescue of T2 cell generation in Nemo fl Mb1-cre + Bcl2Tg mice.</s><s>T2 cell numbers demonstrated a positive correlation with T1 cellularity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), in agreement with T2 cells arising from the T1 subset <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s>Notably, the production of NEMO-deficient T2 cells was clearly reduced compared with controls, independent of the overexpression of Bcl2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>CD23, used to discriminate T1 and T2 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, has been reported to be an NF-κB target gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>We therefore confirmed the identity of the mutant transitional populations using an independent marker, CD93, which is expressed at lower levels on T2 cells (3, 9) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>Comparable distributions of CD93 lo cells were seen in the transitional subsets of Nemo fl Mb1-cre + Bcl2Tg and control mice, supporting that genuine T1 and T2 cells were detected in the mutant mice.</s></p><p><s>Thus, ectopic expression of Bcl2 permitted the accumulation of NEMO-deficient follicular B cells close to normal cellularity despite a persisting developmental block at the transitional stage.</s><s>In contrast, the generation of MZ B and B1 cells was not rescued, possibly due to a role for canonical NF-κB signaling beyond cell survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, consistent with the inability of a Bcl2 transgene regulated by vav gene regulatory elements to promote the development of MZ B cells in NF-κB1-deficient mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Peripheral B cells from Ikk2 fl CD19-cre + mice showed altered in vitro and in vivo responses to stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, but these results could have been partly due to the reduced numbers of mature B cells in these mice.</s><s>The large numbers of follicular B cells in Nemo fl Mb1-cre + Bcl2Tg mice allowed us to examine their responses to various kinds of stimulation.</s><s>The NEMO-deficient B cells overexpressing Bcl2 exhibited an impaired proliferative response to various mitogenic stimuli in vitro compared with control B cells overexpressing Bcl2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with defective B-cell functions, IgM and IgG serum Ab levels were strongly reduced or undetectable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</s><s>In the T-cell-dependent response to immunization with (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl)acetyl (NP)-chicken γ-globulin (CGG), the frequency of germinal center cells was strongly reduced and the production of anti-NP IgG 1 Abs was abolished (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> C and D).</s><s>These data show that canonical NF-κB signals are essential for the functional activity of follicular B cells, and complement a large body of evidence for the multifaceted role of this pathway in the control of humoral immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long-Term Persistence of Follicular B Cells Requires Canonical NF-κB</head><p><s>Signaling.</s><s>To evaluate directly the contribution of canonical signaling to the maintenance of mature B cells, we ablated NEMO using CD21-cre (3).</s><s>We excluded B1 cells from the analysis because, in our hands, CD21-cre proved to be poorly expressed in the prototypical CD5 + B1a subset (Fig. <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).</s><s>A large follicular B-cell population was detected in the spleens of Nemo fl CD21-cre + mice, whereas MZ B cells were essentially lost (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 A and B</ref>).</s><s>Similar results were obtained upon IKK2 ablation through CD21-cre (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 C and D</ref>).</s><s>These data contrast with the small mature B-cell compartment detected in the absence of NEMO or IKK2 using the CD19-cre or Mb1-cre allele (6-9).</s><s>Nemo fl and Ikk2 fl loxP-flanked exons are efficiently eliminated upon Cre-mediated recombination in B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, which we verified in the case of follicular B cells from Ikk2 fl CD21-cre + mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</s><s>The mild reduction of follicular B-cell numbers in Ikk2 fl CD21-cre + mice was not due to the accumulation of cells that had escaped IKK2 deletion.</s><s>Indeed, the majority of these cells expressed a Cre-inducible truncated human CD2 reporter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> A and B), and the reporter-positive cells demonstrated dramatically reduced IKK2 protein levels compared with controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Residual splenic mature B cells expressing a kinase-dead IKK2 have been shown to display an increased turnover compared with controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, we assessed whether follicular B-cell persistence was altered in Ikk2 fl CD21-cre + mice by measuring BrdU incorporation into their DNA after 2 wk of labeling.</s><s>Labeling efficiency was similar among the various mice, as indicated by comparable proportions of BrdU + transitional B cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>In agreement with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>, follicular B cells from CD21-cre − and Ikk2 fl/+ CD21-cre + controls showed low proportions (12-13%) of BrdU + cells.</s><s>In contrast, 40% of IKK2-deficient follicular B cells had incorporated BrdU (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>), suggesting increased turnover.</s></p><p><s>Overall, the present results suggest that the main function of canonical NF-κB signaling in follicular B-cell homeostasis is indeed the control of cell survival, as demonstrated by the ability of a Bcl2 transgene to rescue a substantial compartment of these cells even under conditions where the ablation of canonical signaling in the B-cell lineage leads to a severe developmental block at the transitional B-cell stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</s><s>These data are in line with earlier work showing the accumulation of mature B cells in mice reconstituted with RelA and c-Rel double-deficient fetal liver cells overexpressing Bcl2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Whereas ablation of components of the BCR in mature B cells led to a steady state in which BCR-deficient cells were a minority of

be rescued by constitutive PI3K activation, but not by canonical NF-κB activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>However, the homeostasis of follicular B cells unable to signal through the canonical NF-κB pathway is clearly different from the homeostasis of their WT counterparts.</s><s>Whereas the latter are long-lived cells with average life spans of months ( <ref

our previous demonstration of the failure of such cells to compete with WT cells in vivo <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</s><s>Together with the accumulation of NEMOdeficient follicular B cells upon ectopic expression of Bcl2, these data raise the possibility that canonical NF-κB signals may determine the fitness of mature follicular B cells in their competition for survival niches in

generated mature B cells is expected to lead to the suboptimal filling of the follicular B compartment, in the absence of canonical NF-κB signaling.</s></p><p><s>Compared with follicular B cells, MZ B and B1 cells demonstrate a stronger dependency on canonical NF-κB signals for their development and/or persistence.</s><s>Thus, MZ B-cell numbers were strongly reduced in Nemo fl and Ikk2 fl CD21-cre + mice, and the ectopic expression of Bcl2 failed to rescue the generation and/or maintenance of NEMO-deficient MZ B and B1 cells.</s><s>These results are suggestive of a role beyond the control of survival for canonical NF-κB signaling in MZ B and B1 cells.</s><s>It is noteworthy in this context that cyclin D2, a regulator of the cell cycle and a target of NF-κB, contributes to the development of B1 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</s><s>Although an important signaling pathway activated in B cells upon engagement of BAFFR is the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway (4), there is also evidence for cross-talk between the alternative and canonical pathways, both in the sense of BAFFR signaling resulting in canonical NF-κB activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref> and of canonical signals up-regulating the expression of components of the alternative pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, BAFFR might be involved in the activation of survival signals in mature B cells through both the canonical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways, and/or canonical signals could contribute to an enhanced sensitivity of the corresponding cells to survival signals downstream of BAFFR.</s><s>In this scenario, the occasional engagement of the BCR on resting mature B cells by antigens in the environment, with a resulting activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, might enhance the competitive fitness of the cells in their ability to access survival niches <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>.</s><s>The activation of canonical NF-κB signaling downstream of the BCR and/or BAFFR could be mediated by Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, similar to the behavior of follicular B cells in the absence of canonical NF-κB signals, ectopic expression of Bcl2 rescues the generation of follicular B cells in x-linked immunodeficiency (xid) mice, which bear a mutation in Btk, and CD23 + transitional and follicular xid B cells are outcompeted by WT B cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</s></p></div>
