<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Aims/hypothesis Although the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the progression of diabetic retinopathy, its influence therein has not been systematically evaluated.</s></p><p><s>Here we test the suitability of a new translational model of diabetic retinopathy, the TetO rat, for addressing the role of angiotensin-II receptor 1 (AT1) blockade in experimental diabetic retinopathy.</s><s>Methods Diabetes was induced by tetracycline-inducible small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of the insulin receptor in rats, generating TetO rats.</s><s>Systemic treatment consisted of an AT1 blocker (ARB) at the onset of diabetes, following which, 4-5 weeks later the retina was analysed in vivo and ex vivo.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Retinal function was assessed by Ganzfeld electroretinography (ERG).</head><p><s>Results Retinal vessels in TetO rats showed differences in vessel calibre, together with gliosis.</s><s>The total number and the proportion of activated mononuclear phagocytes was increased.</s><s>TetO rats presented with loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and ERG indicated photoreceptor malfunction.</s><s>Both the inner and outer blood-retina barriers were affected.</s><s>The ARB treated group showed reduced gliosis and an overall amelioration of retinal function, alongside RGC recovery, whilst no statistically significant differences in vascular and inflammatory features were detected.</s><s>Conclusions/interpretation The TetO rat represents a promising translational model for the early neurovascular changes associated with type 2 diabetic retinopathy.</s><s>ARB treatment had an effect on the neuronal component of the retina but not on the vasculature.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The TetO rat, a novel model for type 2 diabetes, reproduces early features of the clinical phenotype of diabetic retinopathy, showing changes in neurons and vessels together with inflammation and functional deficits.</s><s>After blocking the RAS using an AT1 antagonist (losartan), we observed amelioration of functional variables and neuronal structure.</s><s>However, this amelioration was not significant in either vascular features or inflammation.</s><s>In this study, ARB treatment has not only provided insight into the possible pathological mechanisms but it has also demonstrated the suitability of the TetO rat model for translational approaches.</s></p><p><s>TetO rats present both hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia, defining type 2 diabetes and mimicking insulin resistance in humans.</s><s>The model shows an early onset of hyperglycaemia with subsequent early neurovascular effects.</s><s>Given the spectrum of mechanisms underlying human diabetic retinopathy (e.g.</s><s>hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and altered lipid metabolism) the TetO rat is potentially a very valuable translational model for insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.</s></p><p><s>Comparing TetO rats with the most common diabetes model, the STZ-induced rodent model of type 1 diabetes, we also find many of the STZ-induced early changes to be present in our short-term diabetes model.</s><s>Breakdown of the BRB, as shown by albumin extravasation or by loss of ZO-1 expression in the RPE in TetO, has been reported in STZ rats after 2 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, reactive gliosis, as we have shown in the TetO rat, was also observed in STZ mice at a similar time point <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In rats, however, there was a rather contrary effect: a reduction in the number of astrocytes after 2-6 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</s><s>Also, an increase in GFAP expression and delocalisation of K ir 4.1 in Müller cells was detected much later in the STZ model than in the TetO model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</s><s>Stenotic capillaries, found as an early feature in the TetO model, were detected in the STZ model only as a late finding after 6-9 months of diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>RGC loss and visual function changes, which is reported in humans even before detectable vascular impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, were also found in TetO rats within 4-5 weeks, whereas STZ model animals only shows these alterations in very late stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In the context of a pro-inflammatory scenario leading to diabetes-related changes, activation appears early in the course of the disease, before the onset of overt neuronal cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s>A general increase in isolectin-B4 (IB4)-positive microglia cells was detected in STZ rats 4 weeks after the onset of type 1 diabetes.</s><s>However, this marker that does not reliably cover the population of microglia cells in the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>A morphological switch towards the active amoeboid phenotype was also found in STZ rats, but this was observed as late as 20 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, in the present study, in TetO rats (even in the early stages of diabetes) we found diabetic features, previously identified in both rodent models and humans, that are not reproduced efficiently, either chronologically or phenotypically by STZ-treatment of rats.</s><s>Furthermore, interesting additional TetO properties were detected in this study, such as prominent veins in the deep plexus and changes in RPE cell morphology.</s><s>These properties require further examination in the context of diabetes-related changes.</s></p><p><s>The few existing type 2 diabetes animal models reveal diabetic hallmarks only up to a certain extent, even after long periods of the disease.</s><s>Also, they do not present with the combination of high glucose and insulin levels, such as demonstrated in the TetO rat.</s><s>db/db mice develop diabetes due to a mutation of the leptin receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and display RGC loss and thinning of the retina as early features <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>This is comparable with our model.</s><s>However, other diabetic hallmarks, such as vascular leakage and glial activation, which were detected after a few weeks of diabetes in the TetO rat, develop relatively late in db/db mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Considering rat models of type 2 diabetes, such as the popular Wistar Bonn/Kobori rats, Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rats or Goto-Kakizaki rats, the focus of research has been concentrated on vascular hallmarks, present only after more than 6 months of diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>Neurodegeneration and ERG, which were important features of our study in TetO rats, were not assessed in these models.</s></p><p><s>Our data revealed AT1 activation in RGCs, endothelial cells and possibly in Müller cells in the TetO retina, suggesting a role for RAS activation mainly in the inner retina.</s><s>There is emerging evidence that RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes via promotion of endothelial apoptosis and remodelling, inflammation or oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s>In diabetic organ damage, AT1 is the main mediating the pathological effect.</s><s>ARBs have been shown to be beneficial in clinical cases of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s>The Diabetic Retinopathy Candesartan Trials (DIRECT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, using the ARB candesartan in type 1 and 2 diabetes, showed a clear trend towards less severe retinopathy with RAS blockade.</s><s>A smaller trial, the Renin-Angiotensin System Study (RASS), reported that RAS blockade with both the ARB losartan and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, resulted in reduced retinopathy progression in type 1 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Experimental evidence concerning the effect of ARBs is sparse.</s><s>Application of the ACE inhibitor, perindopril, reduced diabetes-induced hyperpermeability of the retinal vasculature after 24 weeks in the STZ model <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and the same drug improved photoreceptor function <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We systematically evaluated the influence of the ARB, losartan, on neurovascular structures in the TetO rat.</s><s>Its impact was only significant on the neuronal components analysed, showing decreased gliosis, RGC recovery and improved ERG variables.</s><s>An influence on vasculature was not detectable, although the decrease in inflammation caused by losartan was close to reaching statistical significance.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the TetO rat exhibits early vascular and neuronal features of experimental diabetic retinopathy to a more complete and clinically relevant extent than currently used rodent models of diabetes.</s><s>The fact that ARB treatment resulted in amelioration of characteristics more related to neurodegeneration than to vascular remodelling and inflammation emphasises the relevance of the RAS as a pathological mechanism in diabetic retinopathy and proves the suitability of the TetO model for interventional studies.</s></p><p><s>The TetO model permits modulation of the degree of hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia, enabling reproduction of clinically relevant situations, such as glucose concentration fluctuations, which can trigger progression of diabetic retinopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>.</s><s>This model could also reproduce characteristics closer to those found in proliferative diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular oedema, as well as other long-term effects, within a considerably shorter time than in other rodent models.</s><s>By not focusing on separate factors, such as high glucose (e.g. as in STZ models) or high insulin levels, but by taking into account their interplay, the TetO model is more valuable in the research of pharmaceutical interventions.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
