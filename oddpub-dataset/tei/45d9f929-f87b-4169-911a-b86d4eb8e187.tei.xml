(2015)</ref>, that is, referring to a wide range of phenomena that implicate predictive processing, such as contextual disambiguation, attentional processes, and learning.</s><s>Predictive signals are thought to be fed back from higher to lower levels of cortical hierarchies.</s><s>Whenever predictions are violated by sensory data, a prediction error signal is fed forward to the next higher hierarchical level to update the predictive model.</s><s>Prediction errors thereby drive learning and enable a flexible adaptation to changes in the environment.</s></p><p><s>Computational approaches have conceptualized hierarchical predictive coding as Bayesian inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lee and Mumford, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Friston, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>The underlying principle of Bayesian inference is that the probability of a prediction, which is commonly referred to as prior belief, is combined with the observed sensory data to compute a posterior probability.</s><s>The difference between the means of the probability density functions of the prior belief and the sensory data corresponds to prediction error.</s><s>Importantly, the size of the prediction error is weighted by the precisions of the prior belief and the sensory data: if the precision (which corresponds to the inverse of the width of the probability density function) of the sensory data is high relative to the precision of the prior belief, the precision-weighted prediction error will be greater and vice versa.</s><s>It has been proposed that the psychosis is linked to decreased precision in the representation of prior beliefs relative to an increased precision in the encoding of the sensory data, which results in an abnormally strong weighting of precision error <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Adams and Friston, in press)</ref>; this can lead to the attribution of salience to otherwise irrelevant stimuli thus giving rise to delusional mood and the subsequent formation of delusions.</s><s>This link between salience misattribution (or aberrant salience) and the formation of delusions was noted earlier by a number of authors, with or without direct reference to prediction error signaling as the underlying mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Conrad, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Heinz, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Kapur, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Corlett et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fletcher and Frith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Mishara and Corlett, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Heinz and Schlagenhauf, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mishara, 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Mishara and Fusar-Poli, 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This predictive-coding account of altered inference has been related to the emergence of delusions of reference or persecution, and to a lesser extent delusions of control and hallucinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fletcher and Frith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Notredame et al., 2014)</ref>, but not specifically to a group of positive symptoms that are commonly classified as self-disturbances (from the German ''Ichstörungen'').</s><s>In the present article, we propose an account within the predictive-coding framework of a particularly striking and frequently reported form of selfdisturbance, the experience of one's thoughts as being caused by somebody else, which is commonly referred to as thought insertion.</s><s>In brief, we take our lead from the early Heidelberg School of phenomenological psychiatry and suggest that thought insertion is a form of aberrant or false inference, in analogy to the perceptual domain.</s><s>Crucially, we will argue that the phenomenon of thought insertion entails a failure of hierarchical Bayesian inference to contextualize or predict the narrative interconnectedness of thoughts.</s><s>In other words, there is an imprecise representation of context and a subsequent failure to provide top-down predictions of the neural representations of thoughts.</s><s>These representations are therefore experienced as being caused by external forces, much in the same way that percepts are experienced as being caused by sensory input.</s><s>It is this experience of thoughts as sensations that characterizes, as we indicate, thought insertion as a self-disturbance, in line with the phenomenological accounts of the early Heidelberg School.</s><s>We will propose that the neurocomputational mechanism underlying this form of false inference is a reduction in the precision of prior beliefs relative to the precision in the encoding of thoughts, thus leading to increased prediction error and thus aberrant salience of thoughts.</s><s>This account of thought insertion fits comfortably with explanations for delusions that are seen as a consequence of the aberrant salience of external stimuli, as outlined above.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THOUGHT INSERTION AND THE COMPARATOR MODEL: CAN WE TREAT THOUGHTS LIKE ACTIONS?</head><p><s>The self-disturbances feature prominently among the first-rank symptoms proposed by Kurt Schneider.</s><s>He described the selfdisturbances as ''certain disturbances in the experience of self that are highly specific for schizophrenia. . .</s><s><ref type="bibr">[They]</ref> consist in the feeling that what one is and does is under the direct influence of others. . .</s><s><ref type="bibr">[and]</ref> are found in the influencing of thought, feeling, impulse (drive) and will'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Schneider, 1946)</ref>; modified English translation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Schneider (1959)</ref>.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cutting (2015)</ref> observes that seven out of Schneider's 11 first-rank symptoms, including thought insertion, are self-disturbances.</s><s>Moreover, the remaining four are arguably related if we take the historical definition of the self-disturbances into account: ''passivity-the nonparticipation in one's own experience'', whereby one's actions, cognitions, emotions, volitions, etc., are experienced as ''occurring independently from self'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Schneider, 1959)</ref>.</s><s>As indicated in the subsequent section, the origin and history of the self-disturbances concept, however, beginning some 30 years prior to Kurt Schneider's proposal of the first-rank symptoms, has remained nearly completely unexplored until only recently.</s><s>As a result, commentators have almost universally propagated the assumptions that the self-disturbances are characterized by a ''loss of a sense of mineness'', or ''ipseity'', and that such self-disturbances are ''core to schizophrenia'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Sass and Parnas, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zahavi, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for reviews see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mishara, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mishara, , 2010a;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mishara et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The actual originators and developers of the concept (namely, the earlier Heidelberg School as reviewed below) did not endorse either assumption.</s><s>The lack of clarity concerning the history, concept and phenomenology of the self-disturbances has impeded the search for neurobiological mechanisms, which we attempt to correct in the current contribution.</s><s>In this article, we focus on thought insertion, which refers to the experience of one's own thoughts as caused by an alien agent.</s></p><p><s>The reasons for our interest in thought insertion are twofold.</s><s>First, thought insertion is not only one of the most striking of the positive symptoms, but also a very frequent one occurring in approximately half of all patients diagnosed with schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Sartorius et al., 1977)</ref> while absent in organic psychoses, e.g., those induced by tonic dopaminergic stimulation in Parkinson's patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Heinz et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s>Second, there has been a longstanding debate regarding the relation of thought insertion to other positive symptoms with respect to current neurocognitive models and it has recently been questioned whether a Bayesian approach is able to provide a plausible account of thought insertion at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frith, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Partially in response to the criticism (summarized below) that thoughts are not a kind of action, Frith abandons his earlier position that ''the 'made experiences' including delusions of alien control and thought insertion, are associated with abnormalities in the mechanism that predicts the outcome of intended actions (the forward model)'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Frith, 2005)</ref>.</s><s>He <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Frith, 2012)</ref> concedes: ''a general, Bayesian approach does not provide a plausible account for the most striking of all first rank symptoms, thought insertion.</s><s>This is ironic given that it was to explain this symptom that the comparator theory was first proposed''.</s><s>Here we would like to argue that the previous problems in providing plausible accounts of thought insertion stem largely from the attempt to draw an analogy with delusions of control, in which not the thoughts but one's own actions are experienced as being caused and controlled by an external agent.</s><s>That is, we contend that it is possible to develop a Bayesian account of thought insertion without resorting to the analogy between thought and action.</s><s>We do so precisely by relying on the earlier phenomenological work.</s></p><p><s>Delusions of control have long been proposed to result from a failure to predict one's own actions due to impairment in generating ''corollary discharge'' signals (also called efference copy) that normally serve to attenuate the sensory consequences of self-initiated actions.</s><s>The classic comparator model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Frith and Done, 1989)</ref> suggested that if the predicted and observed sensory consequences do not match, an action is experienced as generated by somebody else.</s><s>This model can be translated into a Bayesian framework, in which corollary discharge would be equivalent to signaling Bayesian prior beliefs (i.e., a forward model of an action) and the sensory feedback signals correspond to the sensory data.</s><s>Thus, similar to the idea that delusions of control result from a failure to attenuate the sensory consequences of one's own actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Frith and Done, 1989)</ref>, the Bayesian account suggests a reduced precision in predicting these sensory consequences, resulting in increased precisionweighted prediction-error signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fletcher and Frith, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Synofzik et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>It was recently noted, however, that even if the predicted and observed sensory consequences do not match, they will be attenuated during intended movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brown et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Earlier accounts based upon the comparator and forward models failed to distinguish between the attenuation of precision during action and the suppression of prediction error per se by correct predictions or corollary discharge.</s><s>This means that misattributions of agency and illusory phenomena characteristic of psychosis are better explained in terms of a failure to attenuate the precision of ascending sensory prediction errors.</s><s>This failure of sensory attenuation can account for a resistance to illusions, such as the well-known force matching illusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brown et al., 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In analogy with the comparator model, a mechanism on the basis of altered corollary discharge signaling was also proposed for thought insertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Feinberg, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Frith, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Campbell, 1999)</ref>, but this idea has been criticized for a number of reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Stephens and Graham, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gallagher, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vosgerau and Newen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Frith, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Most critically, it has been questioned whether thoughts can be treated like actions.</s><s>One key problem is that, in the case of motor acts, the comparator model implicates intentions for movement.</s><s>The comparator functions to match the corollary discharge signal to the motor intentions, thus anticipating the movement and its sensory consequences.</s><s>However, unlike actions, thoughts are not associated with intentions. 1 In fact, the idea of having an intention to think leads to an infinite regress, whereby each thought would have to be preceded by an intention to think and this intention to think would also have to be preceded by an intention, and so on <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Akins and Dennett, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Stephens and Graham, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Heinz, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>It has also been questioned whether a comparator mechanism is needed at all in the case of thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gallagher, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>It is indeed implausible that the act of thinking should have sensory consequences that need to be ''explained away'' by a corollary discharge signal, as there is normally no need for distinguishing self-initiated thoughts from thoughts that are not self-initiated.</s><s>Finally, the comparator model does not seem to sufficiently explain why inserted thoughts are experienced as being caused by another agent, whereas unbidden or intrusive thoughts that run through our heads unexpectedly or even against our will are not <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Stephens and Graham, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gallagher, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vosgerau and Newen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Brewin et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Heinz, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We concur with the previous critiques in that we do not find the analogy between thoughts and actions particularly helpful.</s><s>Instead, we suggest that the flow, or continuity of thinking relies much more on the automatic processing of context-including previous thoughts-than we are usually prone to admit or observe. 2 In the next section we provide a historical introduction to the concept of self-disturbances, and in particular thought insertion, with an emphasis on the early 20th century phenomenological accounts of these symptoms.</s><s>Interestingly, these phenomenological descriptions highlighted thought insertion as a ''perceptual experience''.</s><s>On the basis of these observations, we then go on to develop an account of thought insertion within the framework of hierarchical predictive coding and Bayesian inference, which suggests that the prediction errors may be more ''lowlevel'' than current theories of thought insertion would suggest.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF THOUGHT INSERTION</head><p><s>In the literature, the origin of the term self-disturbances is frequently attributed to Jaspers (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mishara et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jaspers (1913)</ref> described phenomena related to self-disturbances, such as passivity experiences, being influenced, inserted or withdrawn thoughts, he did not systemize them under the concept of self-disturbances.</s><s>The historical reviews then jump to Schneider's systemization of the self-disturbances in the 1940s, which are then included among 2 By emphasizing agency and intention, the role of automaticity in thinking has often been neglected.</s><s>To take one example, which at least indirectly suggests an automatic component, the philosopher <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Heidegger (1969</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Heidegger ( , 1977) )</ref> claims that ''thinking'' is neither the product of the agency of an ''I,'' nor the relationship of ownership to what is thought.</s><s>Rather, thinking is a ''letting be'' of the matter thought about, which, in turn, discloses itself, opens itself to thought, as if thinking itself were a conversation, a dialog of question and answer which is future oriented.</s><s>The ''opening sets us the task of learning from it, while questioning it, that is, of letting it say something to us'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Heidegger, 1977)</ref>.</s><s>We do not enter here into Heidegger's ontological and philosophical goals, which are not critical to our argument.</s><s>As the Heidelberg psychiatrist, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gruhle (1922</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gruhle ( , 1929</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Gruhle ( , 1932) )</ref> notes, the ''medium,'' who, in a state of ''possession'' imparts the thoughts of the spirit possessing her does not experience thought insertion.</s><s>The medium is conscious of her role as medium, and even if the possession is against her will, it does not lead to thought insertion.</s><s>One may be ''surprised'' by one's own thoughts and even learn from them, but does not experience these thoughts as inserted because they occur within a more or less expected context.</s><s>the first rank symptoms, thus omitting not only who coined the term but nearly 30 years of its development.</s><s>Only recently, <ref type="bibr">Mishara et al. (2015)</ref> documented for the first time (as far as we know) the role of Jaspers' Heidelberg colleagues (the early Heidelberg School, i.e., <ref type="bibr">Gruhle, Mayer-Gross, and Beringer)</ref> in the origin and development of the self-disturbance concept (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Hermle et al., 1988</ref> for exception in their acknowledgment of Beringer's contribution).</s><s>In fact, it was <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gruhle (1915)</ref> who coined the term self-disturbance: ''Tentatively, I call this passivity-the nonparticipation in one's own experience-a self-disturbance'' (our translation).</s><s>In coining the term, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Gruhle (1915</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Gruhle ( , 1922</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Gruhle ( , 1929) )</ref> identified two components of self-disturbances: a perceptual-component, whereby the self looks passively on its own perceptual experiences as a non-participatory bystander, in a doubling/splitting of the I (Doppel-Ich), as if everything plays before the subject on a theater-stage; and a higher-cognitive component, implicating that thoughts, feelings, actions and volition are experienced as coming under foreign power(s).</s><s>Not recognized as double(s), the foreign agents have power over the self.</s></p><p><s>The further development of the concept of self-disturbances was closely linked to a study by Heidelberg psychiatrists Beringer and Mayer-Gross in the 1920's, which used mescaline to examine the phenomenology of psychotic experiences, especially the self-disturbances, in healthy participants.</s><s>The participants included psychiatrists and medical students with the goal of becoming more able to empathize with or understand those experiences of psychotic patients that <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jaspers (1913)</ref> had labeled as non-understandable due to an underlying as yet unknown neurobiological disease process, which interrupts the development of the person.</s><s>On the basis of his experiences as a participant in the mescaline studies, Mayer-Gross noted that thoughts are not ascribed to alien agency, but that they are rather perceived as alien.</s><s>He described a ''becoming sensory'' (Versinnlichung) in the ''sensory representation of thoughts. .</s><s>.Without this change, the manifestations remain inexplicable'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mayer-Gross and Stein, 1928;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mayer-Gross, 1932)</ref>.</s><s>He further notes that we obtain ''insight into the progressive invasiveness of the thoughtdisturbances from the earliest sign of difficulties in concentrating [. .</s><s>.].</s><s>These prodromal manifestations lead to a scattered emptiness of thinking, quite similar to thought withdrawal'' (our translation).</s><s>In his careful phenomenological analysis of subtle self-perceived cognitive and other disturbances in prodromal schizophrenia and mescaline intoxication, Mayer-Gross anticipated Huber's basic-symptom concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Huber, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mishara et al., 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>As far as we know, Mayer-Gross' novel hypothesis that thought insertion involves a ''becoming sensory'' of individual, intermittent thoughts has not been previously discussed in the secondary literature on thought insertion or other selfdisturbances.</s><s>It also seems to have escaped the attention of commentators that Mayer-Gross is the herald of what later came to be known as the ''perceptual anomalies'' approach to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, the view that low-level perceptual anomalies play a critical role in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, including thought insertion

of activation within semantic memory in schizophrenia patients is increased and farther-reaching than in healthy individuals, resulting in co-activations of semantically related concepts, which in

perception of visual illusions and ambiguous stimuli in schizophrenia thus suggest a functional abnormality at low hierarchical levels, thus pointing to a pervasive deficit that involves predictive processing throughout all levels of the predictive coding hierarchy.</s><s>This idea is in line with observations by various phenomenologists (including Mayer-Gross, <ref type="bibr">Binswanger and

to this stimulus later in time <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fletcher and Frith, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>In individuals with schizophrenia, latent inhibition is reduced, that is, they learn to associate stimuli to which they have been previously exposed with a predictive value more easily than healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Vaitl et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>Another example of reduced context effects in learning is the observation that in people with schizophrenia the recall of extinction learning following fear conditioning is impaired, with a reduced effect of the context that

integration will not alter the actual content of conscious perception in everyday vision, but may nevertheless result in the aberrant salience of sensory stimuli.</s><s>Similarly to the processing of external sensory events, a context integration deficit may also play a role in the process of thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Martin and Pacherie, 2013)</ref> and imbue thought with aberrant

both cases may be unable to introspectively explain the occurrence of the thought.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vosgerau and Voss (2014)</ref> therefore distinguish control over thoughts (which is disturbed in both, inserted and intrusive/unbidden thoughts, respectively) from authorship of thoughts (which is disturbed in the case of inserted thoughts only).</s><s>The fact that only inserted thoughts are attributed to an alien agent may be accounted for by the aberrant salience of such thoughts.</s><s>Again, the cause of aberrant salience, low precision of prior beliefs and/or increased sensory precision, may not be accessible to introspection, leaving the strange feeling associated with inserted thoughts unintelligible to the individual.</s><s>While beliefs and desires can have a role in the prior beliefs regarding our own thoughts <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Stephens and Graham, 2000)</ref>, what makes thoughts feel alien is not the result of a higherlevel introspection but rather the prediction-error based aberrant salience caused by imprecise prior beliefs.</s><s>It is therefore not the failure of introspection in a comparator process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Campbell, 1999)</ref> but rather the failure (or imprecision) of prior beliefs in a Bayesian inference process that is at the core of thought insertion.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aberrant Salience of Thoughts and Their Attribution to an Alien Agent</head><p><s>We have now outlined how a thought that is poorly predicted by prior beliefs can evoke aberrant salience in analogy with sensory events that are associated with excessive precisionweighted prediction error.</s><s>The question remains whether this aberrant salience is sufficient to explain why patients experience such thoughts as inserted by an alien agent.</s><s>Here we argue that aberrant salience provides a sufficient explanation for the experience of thought insertion.</s><s>To do so, we first turn to the question what it is that normally makes us experience our thoughts as being generated by ourselves and belonging to ourselves, which is often referred to as sense of authorship or sense of ownership, respectively.</s><s>It has been proposed that thought insertion reflects a disrupted sense of ownership, and as a consequence also a disturbed sense of authorship (for discussion see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Martin and Pacherie, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vosgerau and Voss, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>One non-trivial problem with this idea is the assumption that we have a pre-reflective self-awareness which imbues each experience with a sense of ''mineness''.</s><s>This basic sense of mineness (also called ''ipseity'') supposedly accompanies every experience and becomes the condition of having any experience at all (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Henry, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zahavi, 2005)</ref>; for reviews see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Mishara, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mishara, , 2010a;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mishara et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>However finding reflective (phenomenological) access to the putative pre-reflective mineness poses considerable methodological challenges.</s><s>Moreover, these challenges of accessing pre-reflective consciousness as a pure (irrelational) ''passive self-affection'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Henry, 1973</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Henry, , 1989</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Henry, , 2003;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Zahavi, 2005)</ref> should give us pause from simply identifying this evasive, but putatively all-pervasive quality with either consciousness or interoception.</s><s>The latter involves a perception action cycle, i.e., an experienced content.</s><s>Notably, ispeity cannot be the content of a perception, including interoception, because this would objectify it.</s><s>Rather, ipseity is seen as the condition for, and therefore, must ''precede'' any perception action cycle for the latter to take place at all.</s><s>This position, however, neglects how rapidly and automatically such perception action cycles may occur and any ''access'' to ipseity would be comparatively ''slower'' because it would require a retrospective reflection or verbal report (and thus unable to rule out socalled observer or verbal overshadowing effects) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Mishara, 2010a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mishara et al., 2014)</ref> 4 .</s><s>Moreover, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Vosgerau and Voss (2014)</ref> point out, the content of an experienced thought does not necessarily contain self-reference.</s><s>It thus remains moot whether the idea of pre-reflective self-awareness as a pervasive feeling of mineness (so-called ipseity or pure ''passive self-affection'') is what is disrupted in thought insertion.</s><s>Instead, based on the phenomenological accounts by the early Heidelberg school (see above), we propose that it is not that something is merely missing but rather something added or different about the experience of thinking.</s><s>The description of thoughts as ''becoming sensory'' (Mayer-Gross) in the interruption of context and inner connectedness of experience <ref type="bibr">(Gruhle, Beringer)</ref> does not indicate the absence of a feeling of mineness, but rather an altered modality of thoughts, now given as sensory objects, and thus, a disruption of context.</s></p><p><s>Here, we therefore suggest that sense of authorship and sense of ownership are not generated by some specialized neural circuitry that produces an experience of ''mineness'' or a ''feeling of authorship''.</s><s>Rather, they are a result of thoughts and actions being predictable on the basis of the current contextual information, as described above.</s><s>That is, if a thought is predicted by (conscious or unconscious) contextual information and thus matches prior beliefs, we experience this thought as generated by ourselves and ''belonging'' to us.</s><s>This is also compatible with the phenomenology of automatic processing of contextual meaning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gruhle, 1922</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gruhle, , 1929;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Mishara, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Mishara, , 2011))</ref>.</s><s>This is normally the case, that is, the ''default'' manner of thinking is that thoughts are predictable.</s><s>That is, there is an on-line predicting of the inner continuity of one's thoughts and experiences on different time scales-some conscious, some not conscious-which serves as the context for this default view concerning our thoughts.</s><s>If the precision of prior beliefs is abnormally low, and the posterior belief is biased towards the precision of sensory evidence (as the mode of givenness of the thoughts), however, the thoughts may be associated with aberrant salience.</s><s>As it does not occur normally, such salience is an unusual and surprising event, which requires some explanation.</s><s>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Vosgerau and Newen (2007)</ref>, this misattribution of thoughts to an alien agent is actually ''a healthy and normal rationalization''.</s><s>They suggest that if there is a conflict between beliefs and perceived states, this conflict is removed by some form of rationalization; and that a quite normal way of rationalizing is to misattribute the cause of the perceived state.</s><s>In the case of thought insertion, it is ''some kind of strange feeling about one's own thoughts'' that creates the dissonance to be rationalized <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Vosgerau and Newen, 2007)</ref>.</s><s>In a way, this may be alike to the situation in which one's own thoughts are interrupted by the utterance of another person-it is unexpected and hence to some degree surprising, and thus a totally unexpected thought may appear to come from someone else as the most likely explanation of its surprising character.</s></p><p><s>Here, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Martin and Pacherie (2013)</ref> proposed that the attribution of thoughts to an alien agent is the result of an attempt to make sense of this strange experience of having a thought that appears out of context.</s><s>Thus, they suggest that the interpretation of one's own thoughts as being inserted by someone else is an attempt to ''recontextualize'' thoughts that seem to come out of nowhere.</s><s>The recontextualization or rationalization of thoughts as being inserted by an alien agent of course appears bizarre, but as <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Martin and Pacherie (2013)</ref> put it, ''extraordinary events call for extraordinary explanations''.</s><s>In other words, the strange experience that we suggest reflects prediction-errorbased aberrant salience of thoughts is an unusual event that does not normally occur (as the default experience is that thoughts are predictable and not given as interrupting sensory experiences).</s><s>Even if the interpretation that such thoughts are inserted by an alien agent appears bizarre, it may in fact be the most plausible explanation for thoughts that are associated with aberrant salience.</s><s>In addition, there may be a readiness to attribute the cause of such thoughts to another agent on the basis of delusional mood in prodromal period (prior to fully formed self-disturbances) or, following conversion to fullblown psychosis, and already established delusional beliefs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conrad, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mishara, 2010b)</ref>.</s><s>If a propensity towards bizarre explanations for one's surprising experiences has already developed, then the interpretation of surprising thoughts as caused by another agent (which one would normally reject as bizarre) may be more readily accepted.</s><s>Alternatively, the alien agency may be, as Mayer-Gross suggests, the thoughts are not ascribed to alien agency, but are rather directly perceived as alien <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Mayer-Gross and Stein, 1928;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Mayer-Gross, 1932)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, hierarchical predictive-coding is consistent with both alternatives and provides a way to integrate them into one account of thought insertion.</s></p></div>
