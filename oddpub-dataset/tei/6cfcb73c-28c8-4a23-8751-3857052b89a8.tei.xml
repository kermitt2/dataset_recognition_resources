<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design</head><p><s>The SUCCESS-A study is a prospectively randomized German multicenter open label phase III trial, investigating the potential benefit of gemcitabine in the adjuvant treatment of primary breast cancer patients.</s><s>A total of 3754 node-positive or high-risk node-negative patients were randomized to either 3 cycles of FEC followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel or 3 cycles of FEC followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel plus gemcitabine.</s><s>The study was approved by all involved ethical boards in Germany (reference number 076-05), and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and procedures</head><p><s>Patient and tumor characteristics were collected for all participants of the trial recruited in 251 German study centers.</s><s>The tumor stage at primary diagnosis was classified according to the revised AJCC tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Histopathological grading of the primary tumors was assessed according to the Bloom-Richardson system.</s><s>Tumors for which immunohistochemical nuclear staining for estrogen, progesterone, or both yielded ≥10 % stained cells were classified as hormone receptor-positive.</s><s>HER2 positivity was assigned if strong (3+) immunohistochemical membranous staining was present or, in the case of moderate (2+) membranous staining, if an additional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis yielded a positive test result.</s><s>All patients underwent primary breast surgery (either breast conservation therapy or modified radical mastectomy) leading to R 0 resection.</s><s>Routine axillary dissection in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes included levels I and II.</s><s>Only when macroscopic metastatic involvement of these lymph nodes was also present, level III lymph nodes were excised.</s><s>For the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis, single embedded lymph nodes were screened at up to three levels.</s><s>External beam radiation therapy was administered to all patients treated with breast conserving surgery.</s><s>Chest wall irradiation following mastectomy was performed in patients with &gt;3 involved lymph nodes or T3 and T4 tumors.</s><s>After the end of chemotherapy (either FEC-Doc or FEC-Doc/Gemcitabine), premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive disease received tamoxifen for 5 years.</s><s>Endocrine treatment of postmenopausal patients started with tamoxifen for 2 years and was continued with anastrozole for another 3 years.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blood sample collection, blood preparation and immunocytochemistry</head><p><s>According to the SUCCESS-A study protocol, blood samples had to be taken from each patient before the start of adjuvant chemotherapy.</s><s>Usually, CTC detection was performed using the CellSearch® system; however, in cases where too little blood was available for the CellSearch® analysis, or if there was a surplus of blood, CTC detection was performed using the MICC method.</s></p><p><s>For the study presented here, blood samples (23 ml) from 1221 of the 3754 patients with histologically confirmed invasive primary breast cancer recruited for the SUCCESS-A trial were collected and analyzed using the MICC method; written informed consent was obtained from each patient.</s><s>If the time span between the collection and preparation of blood samples exceeded 96 h patients were excluded from the analysis.</s><s>Peripheral blood was collected in tubes containing ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA) and in some cases, also a cell-stabilizing agent (Veridex, Janssen Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, USA).</s><s>Samples were shipped at room temperature to the central cancer immunological laboratory at the Women's Hospital of the Ludwig Maximilians-University of Munich.</s><s>Blood analyses were performed according to the previously published semi-quantitative assay for bone marrow preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, with the exception of cell enrichment via density gradient centrifugation (OncoQuick® technique), which was performed according to a standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Greiner BioOne, Frickenhausen, Germany).</s><s>Here both a liquid separation medium and the subsequent density gradient centrifugation ensured separation of blood cells and granulocytes and specific enrichment of CTCs.</s></p><p><s>Tumor cell isolation and detection was accomplished based on the Consensus Recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>After two centrifugation steps at 500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature, washing (and if needed lysis of red blood cells) and cytospins were prepared by spinning the remaining mononuclear cells onto microscope slides (1,000,000 cells per slide; Menzel, Braunschweig, Germany).</s><s>The cytospins were air-dried for ≥12 h at room temperature and then used immediately or stored at room temperature.</s></p><p><s>Immunostaining of cytospins from the blood preparations using the pan-anti-cytokeratin monoclonal antibody A45-B/B3 has been described in detail elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>To detect the specific reaction of the primary antibody, the DAKO-alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) detection system with the Z0259 antibody serving as a secondary antibody (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) combined with new fuchsin staining was used.</s><s>After capping with cover slips the cytospins were stored at room temperature.</s></p><p><s>Cytospins containing MCF-7 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> were used as positive controls while cytospins with murine antibody mouse IgG1 kappa (MOPC 21: Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) served as negative controls.</s><s>A total of three cytospins (two cytospins for the detection of CTCs and one negative control) were prepared from all of the blood samples (2 × 10 6 cells per sample).</s><s>All cytospins were manually screened for CTCs using conventional light field microscopy (Axiophot: Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) or using an automatic device (MDS 1: Applied Imaging Corp., Santa Clara, California, USA) by two independent investigators (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>First, cytospins were screened at 20fold magnification to localize cells suspected of being CTCs; the identity of these cells was then validated by observation at 63-fold magnification.</s><s>The determination of the presence of CTCs was based on Consensus Criteria, and only immunocytochemically positive cells lacking hematopoietic characteristics, with a moderate to strong staining intensity, were defined as CTCs.</s><s>Additional criteria for positivity were pathognomonic signs of epithelial tumors, as defined by a clearly enlarged nucleus or clusters of ≥ 2 immunopositive cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s></p></div>

p = 0.75); furthermore, the two patient cohorts were found to be well-balanced with regard to clinicopathological parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, it might be expected that the presence of CTCs should be associated with a worse outcome for all patients in the SUCCESS-A study, regardless of the method for CTC detection.</s><s>Our finding that the presence of CTCs as detected using the MICC method was not significantly associated with reduced survival (in contrast to the presence of CTCs as detected with the CellSearch® system) indicates that the CellSearch® system might be superior to the MICC method in terms of the detection of prognostically relevant CTCs.</s><s>However, even if the patient cohorts were comparable and well balanced, the two groups were not equivalent and comprised different patients; this hindered a direct comparison between the two methods and interpretation of the results obtained.</s><s>Head-to-head comparisons between the two methods regarding the same samples could not be performed because of the very small patient number (n = 22) for which both CTC detection methods (CellSearch® and MICC) were used.</s><s>Thus, there could be other as yet unidentified differences between the two patient cohorts that account for the fact that the presence of CTCs was associated with a significantly poorer prognosis in patients where CTC prevalence was determined using the Cell-Search® system, but not in patients where CTC prevalence was determined using the MICC method.</s><s>Other possible explanations for differing results are pre-analytical factors caused by the fact that for the MICC method patients were chosen from whom too little blood was available to perform the CellSearch® analysis.</s><s>The fact that we found no significant association between the presence of CTCs detected using the MICC method and survival, was not the result of a lack of statistical power; a retrospective power analysis showed that our study had 95 % power (two-sided, alpha 0.05) in the detection of a DFS hazard ratio of 2.0 for patients with CTCs relative to patients without CTCs.</s><s>For comparison, the univariate DFS hazard ratio for the SUCCESS-A patients with CTCs detected using the CellSearch® system, as compared with patients without CTCs as reported by Rack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, was 2.26.</s><s>Thus, we are confident that our study was sufficiently powered to detect a prognostic value of CTCs assuming a hazard ratio similar to the one reported by Rack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>In our view, the most probable explanation for the incongruent findings of the current study as compared with the previous analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is that the two methods differ with regard to the subpopulations of circulating cells that are detected, even if we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the observed differences are caused by an unidentified bias between the two patient cohorts.</s></p><p><s>Both the CellSearch® system and the MICC technique are based on labeling of cytokeratin-containing cells (and therefore epithelial cells) in peripheral blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Using the CellSearch® system CTCs are separated from blood cells on the basis of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCam) expression, while in the MICC method this separation is achieved using a density gradient centrifugation.</s><s>Former investigations in healthy individuals and in patients with benign tumors as compared with patients with malignant tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> have shown the high specificity of the CellSearch® system in reliably detecting malignant epithelial cells.</s><s>The carcinomatous origin of the detected CTCs using the MICC method has also been proven <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>One difference between the two techniques is that the CellSearch® system is a semi-automated method while the MICC technique is performed manually.</s><s>Consequently, the MICC technique is the more elaborate and time-consuming process; as a manual technique it has a higher intertest variability concerning CTC detection in peripheral blood.</s><s>However, the final decision as to whether or not a is considered a CTC using both techniques has to be made by an investigator, and cannot be carried out using an automated method.</s><s>Another important difference is that the MICC method does not have a CD 45 counterstaining step for the separation of leukocytes from CTCs; thus, it possibly yields a higher amount of prognostically less relevant cells (such as leukocytes) that impair the prognostic value of this method.</s><s>In brief, the main differences between MICC and the CellSearch® are as follows: the cell enrichment is achieved via density gradient centrifugation using MICC and with an automated cell enrichment method using the CellSearch® system; the APAAP technique is applied for antibody staining using MICC and immunomagnetic antibody enrichment using CellSearch® (however, both methods use the same antibodies directed against cytokeratins CK8, CK18, and CK19); and the lack of CD 45 counterstaining in the MICC method.</s><s>Thus, it seems possible that some of the observed inconsistent findings with regard to CTCs detected with the CellSearch® system or the MICC method might be related to technical details or procedures.</s></p><p><s>In bone marrow analyses concerning DTCs, the MICC method is considered the gold standard because of its high reliability and reproducibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>However, with respect to the detection of CTCs in the peripheral blood, the CellSearch® system seems to be more reliable and represents the most established method, especially with regard to the evaluation of the prognostic value of CTCs.</s><s>There have been some studies that have compared the CellSearch® system with other methods for CTC detection and enumeration.</s><s>In a direct comparison based on blood samples collected from 61 patients with metastatic and non-metastatic cancer, as well as 15 healthy donors, the CellSearch® system proved to be more sensitive than a manual detection technique using OncoQuick®.</s><s>CTCs were detected in 33 (54 %) out of the 61 cancer patients using the CellSearch® system, but in only 14 (23 %) of these patients using OncoQuick® <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Interestingly, considering only patients with non-metastatic cancer, the detection rate of CTCs was equal using both methods (12 %);
