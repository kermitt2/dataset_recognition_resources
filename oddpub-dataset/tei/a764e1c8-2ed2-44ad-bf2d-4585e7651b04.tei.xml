Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1,2</ref>] defined Bcl11b-regulated "differentially expressed genes" (DEGs) in young adult thymocytes.</s><s>Although the Bcl11b knockout cells resembled normal DN2a thymocytes, their gene expression patterns sharply distinguished the mutant cells from any normal Bcl11b +/+ subsets.</s><s>Highly robust effects were seen in multiple samples, e.g. for Bcl11b itself, Zbtb16 (encoding PLZF) and Id2 (both Bcl11b-repressed), and Cd6 (Bcl11b-dependent) genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, certain differentially expressed genes also showed partial de-repression in YFP + Bcl11b heterozygous cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>At a subset of these loci, the effects of Bcl11b deletion prior to commitment (Vav1-iCre) were more severe than the effects of deletion after commitment (Lck-Cre), and Vav1-iCremediated deletion had more severe effects on total thymus cellularity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>).</s><s>About 40 Bcl11b-dependent genes failed to be turned on in Vav1-iCre;Bcl11b deleted cells, but were expressed somewhat in Lck-Cre;Bcl11b deleted cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>), while ~85 Bcl11b repression targets were more overexpressed in the Vav1-iCre knockout cells than in the Lck-Cre knockout cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>).</s><s>This difference suggests that even transient Bcl11b expression in the Lck-Cre deletion model provides some needed function for T-cell development.</s><s>The most timing-sensitive genes included Cd3g, Cd3d, Cd3e, and Dntt among Bcl11b-dependent genes, and progenitor-associated, γδ-associated, and alternative-lineage associated genes Pou2af1, Tyrobp, Cd7, Itgae, Itgb7, Klf2, Trpm1, Cd163l1 (Scart1), Cited4, and Tnni1 among Bcl11b-repressed ones.</s><s>However, most DEGs required Bcl11b both during and continuously after commitment, for activation or especially for repression in pro-T cells.</s></p><p><s>For mechanistic experiments on Bcl11b function, we also defined the genes affected by acute Cas9-mediated disruption of Bcl11b in pro-T cells differentiating in vitro, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>Bone marrow precursors from B6.ROSA26-Cas9; Bcl2-tg transgenic mice (Cas9-Bcl2 cells), were cultured with OP9-DL1 stroma for 7 days, then transduced with retroviral vectors encoding sgRNA, and 7 d later analyzed and harvested for RNA-seq analysis.</s><s>Most of these genes also overlapped with the significant DEGs from both Lck-Cre and Vav1-iCre deletion in vivo (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</s><s>DEGs significant in all three are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, and include most of the targets previously reported in fetal liver-derived pro-T cells 7 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>; see Methods).</s><s>Importantly, genes encoding transcription factors Id2 and PLZF (Zbtb16) were highly significant Bcl11b repression targets in DN2/DN3 cells in every case.</s><s>Thus, during pro-T cell commitment, Bcl11b activates and represses several hundred genes important for T cell identity.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A challenge of functional specificity</head><p><s>To determine which genes were directly regulated by Bcl11b, we performed Bcl11b ChIPseq.</s><s>However, despite the prevalence of Bcl11b repressive effects, binding of Bcl11b across the genome appeared preponderantly at open chromatin sites with active marks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> , globally associated with active genes, and showed no distinction between non-regulated loci and those with any response to Bcl11b deletion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s>We tested whether distinct motifs were bound at functional sites.</s><s>Most sites bound by Bcl11b in DN3 pro-T cells are enriched for Ets and Runx motifs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> ; we compared these with GC-rich sequences originally reported as a cognate site <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> and with three newly reported motifs for Bcl11b binding to protein-binding microarrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> .</s><s>While matches to the newly defined sites (log odds ≥5) were found at 10-18% of Bcl11b occupancy sites, they were not enriched at DEGs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s>Bcl11b binding sites in CpG islands were actually strongly depleted near DEGs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>).</s><s>Bcl11b occupancy and target site motifs were thus unable to distinguish sites of Bcl11b function.</s></p></div>

We</s><s>show that Bcl11b can repress targets directly by nucleating complexes of corepressors on the DNA at specific sites where they do not otherwise assemble.</s><s>Such sites of Bcl11b-dependent cofactor recruitment and redirection turn out to be a far better statistical discriminator of genes that Bcl11b actually controls than Bcl11b binding alone.</s><s>At the same time, a substantial minority of Bcl11b effects are apparently indirect, mediated through its repression of the regulatory genes Id2 and Zbtb16.</s><s>Acute double-deletion analysis using the Cas9 system has revealed that many effects of Bcl11b deletion are responses to the resultant increases in Id2 and/or PLZF.</s><s>In particular, many T lineage-specific genes that apparently depend on Bcl11b for activation during commitment in fact require Bcl11b largely to suppress Id2.</s><s>Thus, in addition to its direct genomic targets, Bcl11b is an indirectly acting but critical member of the E protein-Id gene regulatory network in pro-T cells during commitment.</s></p><p><s>The best available statistical criteria for enriching loci that Bcl11b regulates, positively or negatively, have turned out to be the presence of sites where assembly of chromatin modifying complexes depended on Bcl11b binding.</s><s>Such complexes often included Chd4, Mta2, Ring1b, LSD1, and Runx1; future work should also test Brg1.</s><s>Bcl11b-dependent nucleation of cofactor complexes was only seen at a small minority of Bcl11b sites and a minority of the sites for most of these cofactors.</s><s>Deletion analysis of individual chromatin modification complex components showed that these components, stably expressed throughout commitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57</ref> , were often important for Bcl11b effects, especially at loci that Bcl11b represses.</s><s>Among factors redeployed by Bcl11b, Runx1 was most potent for both activation and repression of target genes.</s><s>Notably, the components that depended most on Bcl11b for recruitment differed from one genomic site to another.</s><s>Although much remains to be learned about the mechanistic rules for transcriptional repression, this suggests that Bcl11b can interact with a variety of subunit assemblies individually, not only with preformed NuRD or PRC1 complexes as a whole.</s></p><p><s>New cofactor peaks also appeared in Bcl11b-deleted cells at sites never bound by Bcl11b in pro-T cells, with a distinct motif enrichment signature, and these were strongly associated with abnormal activation of Bcl11b-repressed genes.</s><s>Thus, in addition to recruiting repression complexes, Bcl11b may also repress target genes by preventing cofactors from assembling at other neighboring sites that could otherwise serve different, activating transcription factors.</s><s>Gene regulation by redirection of limiting pools of cofactors, with or without direct DNA binding, is consistent with recent findings on PU.1-mediated gene regulation in early pro-T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, gene regulation by partner factor redeployment could be a common mechanism for transcription factors that have crucial roles in cell fate decisions.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we have shown that the advent of Bcl11b expression during commitment recenters T cell regulatory circuits in multiple ways.</s><s>Bcl11b physically redirects the binding of Runx1 and chromatin modulating complexes across the genome in site-specific ways that are highly concentrated around Bcl11b-regulated target genes.</s><s>These biochemical collaborations, especially with Runx1, are likely to be directly functional, especially for repression.</s><s>At the same time, Bcl11b's repression of PLZF and Id2 blocks implementation of at least two alternative programs, distinctly regulated by these factors.</s><s>Finally, its control of Id2 gives it a position of indirect power in a pro-T cell network where the main direct effectors are E proteins and their own interaction partners.</s><s>This network is particularly important for TCR gene expression and the stringent cell biology of β-selection, and may well explain the importance of Bcl11b for these crucial milestones.</s></p></div>
