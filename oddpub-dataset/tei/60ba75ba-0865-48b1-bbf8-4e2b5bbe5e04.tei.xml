supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>To sensitively monitor and visualize B-cell-characteristic gene expression, we generated cHL and B-NHL cell line clones harboring luciferase reporter constructs under control of the B-cell-specific CD19, CD79a (mb-1), or CD79b (B29) promoters (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>).</s><s>Consistent with the loss of B-cell-specific gene products, we found dramatically lower CD19 promoter activities in all cHL cell lines tested when compared with B-NHL cell lines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Because activity signals of CD79a and CD79b promoter-driven constructs were not overtly different (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B-C</ref>), we decided to focus on the subsequent screening on the CD19 reporter system as readout.</s></p><p><s>To explain the lost B-cell phenotype, one might hypothesize silencing of the respective transcriptional networks in cHL.</s><s>However, the DNA-demethylating agent 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) alone, or even more profoundly in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), reportedly reduced CD19 transcript levels in B-NHL cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> suggesting that a CD19-suppressive factor, a panel of negative regulators, or even a singular master repressor of the B-cell program was epigenetically inactivated in B-NHL, while possibly remaining active in cHL.</s><s>We confirmed and extended this finding by flow cytometry, which demonstrated reduced membrane expression of CD19 protein in 5-Aza-or 5-Aza/TSA-exposed B-NHL, and no reexpression in equally treated cHL cell lines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, these treatments resulted in much lower CD19 promoter activities exclusively in B-NHL reporter cell lines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).</s></p><p><s>A high-throughput screening identifies compounds that restore CD19 transcription in cHL cell lines Having this CD19 reporter system established, we next set up a pharmacological screening to identify compounds that reinduce the lost B-cell phenotype in cHL cells.</s><s>First, we stably transduced cHL cell lines with bcl2 to protect them against potential proapoptotic pressure, which may arise from B-cell-specific gene reexpression.</s><s>Second, PAX5, a transcription factor critical for B-cell commitment, is often moderately expressed in HRS cells irrespective of their lost B-cell phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> but virtually undetectable in cHL cell lines KM-H2 and L428 (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>).</s><s>To rule out that subcritical PAX5 expression may hinder reconstitution of CD19 promoter activity, we infected L428 cells prior to the pharmacological screening with a mifepristone-inducible construct encoding PAX5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Using these PAX5/Bcl2-engineered L428 reporter cells, we conducted a luciferase-based pharmacological screening of a 28 160compound library enriched for potentially bioactive compounds.</s><s>After vigorous selection, we finally came up with a list of 55 compounds (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">3C-D</ref>).</s><s>We treated the 3 bcl2-infected cHL reporter cell lines L428, L1236, and KM-H2 (all without exogenous PAX5) with all 55 compounds, and selected 13 chemicals (reflecting 6 structurally distinct groups) that were effective in all 3 cHL lines and possessed good structure soundness and derivation possibility (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>).</s><s>As a last selection step, we tested these 13 compounds regarding their ability to drive endogenous CD19 expression in nonengineered cHL cell lines, leaving us with 3 compounds: compounds encoded as "27" and "49" increased CD19 expression in L428 and KM-H2 cells, whereas compound "40" induced CD19 transcripts in L1236 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>).</s><s>Structurally, compounds 27, 40, and 49 share limited similarity among each other (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>).    to compound 27, compounds 40 and 49 have been previously claimed to interfere with epigenetic regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> (see next section and Discussion for details), a suggestive and attractive mechanism by which they may contribute to the reexpression of a silenced B-cell program.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacological rescue of the B-cell phenotype is associated with histone H3 modifications</head><p><s>Previous studies observed histone H3 hypermethylation in the promoter region of B-cell-specific genes in cHL cell lines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>We performed ChIP assays to analyze a variety of histone modifications, namely histone H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 as transcriptionally repressive and H3K4me3 as rather transcription-promoting chromatin marks, at the CD19 promoter (of note, in cHL cells not being engineered with exogenous promoter/reporter constructs).</s><s>Five pairs of primers (P1-P5) were designed to amplify a region spanning 1000 bp upstream to 200 bp downstream of the transcription start site.</s><s>Compared with the untreated condition, exposure to compound 49, which produced a 48-fold increase of CD19 transcript levels in L428 cells (compare Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>), led to markedly reduced H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 occupation at the CD19 promoter in L428 cells (Figure <ref type="figure">3A-B</ref>).</s><s>Treatment of L1236 cells with compound 40, enhancing CD19 transcript expression by about sixfold (compare Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>), resulted in downregulated H3K9me3 and upregulated H3K4me3 marks at the CD19 promoter (Figure <ref type="figure">3C-D</ref>).</s><s>In line with a presumably nonepigenetic mode of its pharmacological action, we did not observe any changes in CD19 promoter occupation according to the 3 ChIP analyses (carried out in L428 cells) in response to compound 27 that would explain the CD19 transcript-inducing activity of this agent (data not shown).</s><s>In essence, the data regarding the 2 "epigenetic" compounds 40 and 49 are suggestive of a certain pattern: the conversion of heterochromatinized regions (ie, especially P1/2 and P4/5) of the CD19 promoter into a more euchromatin-characteristic state that becomes permissive for the B-cell-specific transcription factor machinery to drive gene expression.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ATRA or ATO treatment initiates B-cell-specific transcription in cHL cell lines</head><p><s>To stress the idea of pharmacological restorability of the lost B-cell phenotype in cHL cells even further, we considered ATRA (not part of the drug library screened here) an attractive candidate.</s><s>ATRA, the agent that overcomes the pathognomonic differentiation block in t(15;17) 1 acute promyelocytic leukemia, was previously reported to promote expansion of CD19 1 B cells in preclinical models, although the underlying mechanism, proliferation, differentiation, or selective induction of CD19 gene expression, was not unveiled. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref></s><s>To explore whether ATRA may reinduce the B-cell program in cHL cells, we measured a variety of B-cell-specific promoter activities in cHL cell lines (without exogenous PAX5 restoration) in response to ATRA.</s><s>L428 and L1236 cells consistently exhibited enhanced CD19, CD79a, and CD79b promoter activities, and expressed, accordingly, increased transcript levels of these B-cell markers after ATRA (Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, the reduction of CD19 expression in B-NHL cells after 5-Aza/TSA double treatment (compare Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D-E</ref>) was completely neutralized if ATRA was added to the combination (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>This observation suggests that the putative repressor of the B-cell program, which is presumably silenced in B-NHL and normal B cells but active in cHL cells, cannot exert its repressive activity in the presence of ATRA.</s><s>ATO (not part of the screened library either), another agent used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, reportedly inhibited the constitutive NF-kB activity in cHL cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> which might be indirectly related to potential effects of this compound regarding the B-cell phenotype we seek to uncover here.</s><s>Therefore, we treated L1236 and L428 cells with ATO, and analyzed its effects on B-cell-specific gene expression.</s><s>Expression of CD19 and CD20 transcripts was markedly upregulated in both cell lines, even exceeding the effects seen in response to ATRA at its given dose schedule (Figure <ref type="figure">4B-C</ref>).</s><s>Of note, endogenous derepressed CD19 expression levels in cHL cells after exposure to a "restoring" agent, despite their profound elevation from virtual nondetectability, were still lower by orders of magnitude when compared with CD19 expression in untreated B-NHL cells (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, we also detected strong CD20-protein expression signals when we probed cHL cell lines L1236 and L428 by immunoblot analysis (Figure <ref type="figure">4D</ref>).</s><s>ATO and ATRA enhanced transcript levels of the B-cell-specific transcription factors PAX5 and Oct2 or BOB.1, respectively, whereas the expression levels of the Hodgkintypical gene product CD30 in response to ATO as well as the cHLreminiscent and lineage-inappropriate TCF7 transcript in response to either agent were strongly reduced in L1236 cells (Figure <ref type="figure">4E-F</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref></s><s>aken together, ATO and ATRA appear to "fix" the aberrant lineage fidelity in cHL cells by reinducing B-cell-specific transcription factors and B-cell-typical differentiation markers, and by repressing gene products indicative of the Hodgkin-reminiscent transdifferentiation phenotype.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compound 40 enhances ATO-licensed anti-CD20-induced cell death in cHL cell lines</head><p><s>Consistent with previous reports on cytotoxic effects exerted by highdose ATRA in cHL cell lines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> reestablishment of the B-cell program in cHL cells by single-agent ATO or ATRA treatment resulted in a robust dose-dependent reduction of cell viability, suggestive of a prosurvival role the lost B-cell phenotype may have in Hodgkin biology (Figure <ref type="figure">5A-B</ref>).</s><s>Because ATO stimulated reexpression of CD20 in cHL cells (compare Figure <ref type="figure">4D</ref>), we speculated whether it may, in addition, create the molecular basis for de novo sensitivity to a therapeutic CD20 antibody approach.</s><s>L1236 cells were exposed to ATO or ATRA for 24 hours to induce CD20 expression, followed by incubation with the CD20 antibodies rituximab or tositumomab for 3 days prior to assessing cell viability.</s><s>Compared with control samples that were treated with antibody but no ATO or ATRA, tositumomab-targeted L1236 cells presented with significantly lower viability when preexposed to a relatively low dose of ATO (10 mM) or ATRA (40 mM), with the latter agent also enhancing rituximab-induced cytotoxicity (Figure <ref type="figure">5C</ref>).</s><s>Rituximab or tositumomab alone, as anticipated, had no effect against the originally CD20 2 cHL cells.</s><s>Of note, the kinetics of antibodyinduced cell death are expectedly rather slow and less pronounced, if the actual contribution of host immunity in vivo, that is, ADCC and complement-mediated cytolysis, is not covered by the experimental setup.</s><s>Moreover, an in vitro cytotoxicity assay may underestimate the activity of rituximab because cellular senescence, a terminal cell-cycle arrest, has just been unveiled as part of its antilymphoma action. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref></s><s>e wondered whether cotreatment of the prodifferentiation agents ATO or ATRA with 1 of the pharmacological screening-derived compounds might cooperatively increase CD20 expression as the basis for rituximab or tositumomab activity.</s><s>Therefore, we exposed L1236 cells, in which ATO strongly enhanced CD20 and compound 40 markedly induced CD19 expression (compare Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B, 4C-D</ref>), to very low doses of either ATRA (20 mM) or ATO (5 mM) alone or in combination with compound 40.</s><s>Strikingly, the already robustly ATRA-or ATO-induced CD20 transcript levels almost doubled, when the cells were coexposed to compound 40 (Figure <ref type="figure">5D</ref>).</s><s>This effect was reproducible on the protein level by immunoblot analysis as well.</s><s>Moreover, CD20 membrane expression became detectable by immunofluorescence image-based flow cytometry upon combined ATO/40 treatment, although the signal was less intense and of a somewhat more aggregated pattern when compared with the B-NHL cell line SU-DHL4 (Figure <ref type="figure">5E</ref>).</s><s>Conventional flow cytometry confirmed the increased signal intensity in ATO/40-preexposed as compared with untreated L1236 cells (Figure <ref type="figure">5F</ref>).</s><s>Hence, we decided to test whether the most effective combination, ATO plus compound 40, enhancing CD20 transcript expression by nearly 20-fold and producing a positive CD20 signal at the cell surface, might further promote in vitro (Figure <ref type="figure">5H</ref>; see supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref> for similar results obtained with tositumomab in these cHL cell lines), and immunemediated clearance of antibody-induced senescent lymphoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> further add to the full realization of the antibody-dependent therapeutic benefits in patients.</s></p><p><s>ATO and compound 40 sensitize cHL cell lines to BCR signaling-targeting kinase inhibitors</s></p><p><s>4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref> Given the marked effects the restoration of B-cell-specific differentiation markers had on CD20mediated cell death in cHL cells, we sought to explore whether ATO, compound 40, or their combination might also sensitize cHL cells to small compounds that interfere with BCR signaling.</s><s>Strikingly, L1236 cells that were preexposed to ATO and compound 40 displayed a dramatic susceptibility to ibrutinib-induced cell death that was about 2 orders of magnitude higher when compared with ibrutinib action in otherwise naive L1236 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>).</s><s>Notably, sensitization to the BTK inhibitor was also seen after single-agent ATO or compound 40 pretreatment, albeit to a lesser extent, and L428 cells (without exogenous PAX5 restoration) recapitulated this pattern (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>).</s><s>Likewise, L1236 cells preincubated with the ATO/40 combination gained extreme sensitivity to idelalisib, exceeding the already enhanced cytotoxic effects the PI3K inhibitor produced in single-agent pretreated L1236 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6B</ref>).</s><s>L428 cells also exhibited the lowest viability in response to the ATO/40-idelalisib sequence.</s><s>Notably, single-agent ibrutinib or idelalisib has no cell-autonomous efficacy in Hodgkin lymphoma because it produced virtually no toxicity in otherwise untreated cHL cells (viability $95%; supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</s><s>To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we probed lysates from L1236 cells that were either untreated or exposed to ATO, compound 40, or both (regarding BTK and PI3K activation, indicated by the phospho-BTK-Tyr223 [p-BTK] and the PI3K downstream target p-AKT-P-Ser473 [p-AKT]) by immunoblot analysis.</s><s>Indeed, ATO, compound 40, or the combination of both agents had a significant impact on BCR signaling: both the p-BTK-to-total BTK ratio as well as the p-AKT-to-total AKT ratio were strongly induced (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref>; see similar immunoblot findings for L428 cells in supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).</s><s>Finally, we sought to test additional cHL cell lines, namely L540, L591, HDML-2, SUP-HD1, and U-HO1, regarding their phenotypic B-cell restorability by the agents used in this study so far: indeed, all compounds induced CD19 and CD20 transcript levels to varying extents in at least some of these cHL cell lines (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>), thereby underscoring the general applicability of the restoration strategy to the majority of Hodgkin lymphomas tested, while also indicating a certain degree of heterogeneity with respect to the responsiveness of cHL cell lines and very little additional inducibility in B-NHL cell lines when judged by CD19 or CD20 reexpression.</s><s>Strikingly, the ATO/40 combination rendered all of these additional cHL cell lines dramatically sensitive to the BCR-related pathway blockers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6D</ref>).</s><s>In essence, our pharmacological hunt for B-cell phenotype-restoring agents not only retrieved working candidates, but further led us to the clinically highly relevant observation that such a pretreatment can be therapeutically exploited with a variety of B-cell-specific antibodies or BCR-signaling inhibitors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Previous studies revealed that epigenetically silenced, transcriptionally repressed, or inadequately induced promoters of B-cell-specific genes may contribute to cHL phenotypic transformation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref></s><s>e present now, based on a high-throughput screening and further characterization, a number of compounds which share the capacity to restore components of the B-cell phenotype that are consistently lost in cHL cells.</s><s>Specifically, our data suggest that 2 of these agents exert their effects via remodeling of repressive chromatin marks in the vicinity of the CD19 promoter.</s><s>The differentiation-enforcing agents ATO and ATRA complement the effects of the drugs at a variety of B-cell-specific gene loci, although the precise mechanism of action needs to be elucidated in future investigations and may vary in individual cases.</s><s>For instance, different expression levels of preferentially antigen expressed in melanoma (PRAME), a repressor of retinoic acid signaling, seem to affect ATRA sensitivity in cHL cell lines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref></s><s>Our own findings obtained after derepressing treatment with the DNA-demethylating agent 5-Aza and the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA support the idea that a master repressor of the B-cell program is selectively active in Hodgkin lymphoma, but epigenetically silenced in B-NHL and normal B cells.</s><s>We may also have uncovered a putative role of the B-cell phenotype as a tumorsuppressive principle and novel vulnerability of cHL cells: different agents that led to the reexpression of B-cell-specific genes despite their pharmacologically distinct modes of action turned out to be toxic for cHL cells.</s><s>The putative targets of the screen-identified compounds point to an important role of epigenetic dysregulation at histone H3 in cHL. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>Both compounds 40 and 49 reportedly inhibit, among other epigenetic regulators, the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EHMT2 (aka, G9a or KMT1C), which confers transcriptional repression through methylation of H3K9 and less pronouncedly of H3K27. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref></s><s>Indeed, knockdown of EHMT2, comparable to its pharmacological inhibition by BIX-01294, also reinduced CD19 transcript expression in cHL cells (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).</s><s>Although other modes of pharmacological action, indirect and via different or even a variety of target molecules, may apply, it is an attractive hypothesis that the epigenetic changes at the CD19 promoter observed in response to compound 40 or 49 are due to direct inhibition of a histone methylation-modifying enzyme operating at this site.</s></p><p><s>Most importantly, our findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential restoration of the B-cell program in Hodgkin lymphoma may have (with respect to the increasing arsenal of B-cellpreferential or -exclusive therapeutic options available, and, so far, nonapplicable) to patients diagnosed with cHL.</s><s>Monoclonal antibodies or antibody-drug conjugates raised against B-cellspecific surface receptors such as CD19, CD20, or CD79 play no role in current (chemo-)immunotherapy regimens used against cHL.</s><s>Especially in light of the success story of CD20 antibodies in the clinical care of B-NHL, it is a very attractive goal to "repurpose" these antibodies for Hodgkin lymphoma, after restoration of the lost B-cell phenotype by ATO/ATRA and/or compounds identified in our screen.</s><s>Notably, our data indicate that the derepressed surface expression levels of the CD20 target we achieved on Hodgkin cells, although lower than endogenous levels detectable on B-NHL cells by orders of magnitude, are sufficient to enable CD20 antibody-mediated cytotoxicity.</s><s>Although feasibility and actual efficacy must be demonstrated in clinical trials, we also like to speculate that the agents discussed here might exert additional benefits in cHL cells beyond restoration of the B-cell program.</s><s>Although it did not escape our attention that preliminary preclinical and clinical evidence has been reported regarding the PI3K and the BTK inhibitor in the context of Hodgkin lymphoma, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50</ref> we present here a hitherto unknown strategy to dramatically booster cHL's susceptibility to BCR-related pathway blockers.</s><s>Future preclinical investigations will aim at a systematic, multidimensional survey of various combinatorial and sequential treatments (including additional B-cell-targeting antibodies and other compounds) at different concentrations (to also address synergism) in an expanded panel of available cHL cell lines, thereby addressing a larger array of B-cell phenotype-related gene products, and approaching the underlying molecular mechanisms of pharmacological action.</s><s>Of note, screening-derived lead compounds need to undergo structural optimization by medicinal chemists to lower required doses and potential toxicities before moving toward early-phase clinical testing in relapsed or refractory cHL patients.</s><s>Taken together, various combinations of B-cell-reprogramming agents, particularly in combination with B-NHL-established antibody-and/or signaling inhibitor-based therapeutics, could open a conceptually novel perspective in clinical care of Hodgkin lymphoma, especially in high-risk or relapsed patients.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
