<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objectives: Creation of functional, durable vasculature remains an important goal within the field of regenerative medicine.</s><s>Engineered biological vasculature has the potential to restore or improve human tissue function.</s><s>We hypothesized that the pleotropic effects of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) would enhance the engineering of capillary-like vasculature.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods:</head><p><s>The impact of IGF1 upon vasculogenesis was examined in in vitro cultures for a period of up to 40 days and as subcutaneous implants within immunodeficient mice.</s><s>Co-cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in collagen-fibronectin hydrogels were supplemented with either recombinant IGF1 protein or genetically engineered cells to provide sustained IGF1.</s><s>Morphometric analysis was performed on the vascular networks that formed in four concentrations of IGF1.</s></p><p><s>Results: IGF1 supplementation significantly enhanced de novo vasculogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.</s><s>Effects were long-term as they lasted the duration of the study period, and included network density, vessel length, and diameter.</s><s>Bifurcation density was not affected.</s><s>However, the highest concentrations of IGF1 tested were either ineffective or even deleterious.</s><s>Sustained IGF1 delivery was required in vivo as the inclusion of recombinant IGF1 protein had minimal impact.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p><s>IGF1 supplementation can be used to produce neovasculature with significantly enhanced network density and durability.</s><s>Its use is a promising methodology for engineering de novo vasculature to support regeneration of functional tissue.</s></p></div>
