<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 1124 patients with active SLE, those receiving 120 Q2W tabalumab met the primary endpoint, SRI-5 (38.4% vs 27.7% ( placebo), p=0.002).</s><s>A dose-response was suggested by fewer patients meeting this endpoint when treated Q4W (34.8%, p=0.051 vs placebo).</s><s>At baseline, tabalumab or placebo was added to a variety of SoC therapies, the impact of which on BAFF signals is unknown.</s><s>Furthermore, major adjustments (including increases) in corticosteroid dose were allowed in the first 24 weeks, which may have affected BAFF levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref></s><s>Similar to other trials allowing significant background medications, a high placebo response rate was expected.</s><s>Whether forced steroid tapering or withdrawal of background treatments would increase tabalumab treatment effect remains unknown. <ref type="bibr">8 9</ref></s><s>nalyses of three secondary endpoints were multiplicity controlled: time-to-first severe SLE flare, corticosteroid sparing and the change from baseline in fatigue.</s><s>Tabalumab did not meet these three endpoints, although active treatment had better outcomes than placebo on some measures.</s><s>For example, the corticosteroid sparing endpoint was achieved by 13.9% in placebo group versus 22.5% in 120 Q2W ( p=0.051) and 17.5% in 120 Q4W ( p=0.342) groups.</s><s>Steroid tapering was not mandated in improved patients.</s><s>Since no other rescue was allowed after 6 months, incentive to reduce steroids was likely decreased, limiting insight into the potential of tabalumab to spare corticosteroids.</s><s>Other secondary endpoints did show statistically significant differences between groups.</s><s>More patients in the tabalumab group had improved SLEDAI-2K, SELENA-SLEDAI and PGA scores compared to placebo (table 2).</s></p><p><s>Tabalumab had significant impact on its intended immunological target with decreases in mean total B cells, immunoglobulins and anti-dsDNA antibodies.</s><s>However, given the heterogeneity of SLE, the optimal dose remains unknown either for the cross-section of international patients who were studied or for individual patients.</s><s>Clinical observations from this trial and from the ILLUMINATE-1 study (Ann Rheum Dis, submitted March 2015) suggest that different dosing strategies might be helpful for different patients, underscoring the importance of further responder analyses and pharmacodynamic assessments of BAFF inhibitors.</s></p><p><s>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> SRI-5 observed response rates over the 52-week treatment period and SRI-5 (NRI) primary endpoint at Week 52.</s><s>The primary endpoint analysis included patients who achieved SRI-5 endpoint without violating concomitant medication rules.</s><s>Patients who did not meet all three clinical criteria of the SRI, who added or increased antimalarial or immunosuppressant treatment, who could not meet the steroid-dosing requirements and/ or who discontinued the study prior to week 52, were considered non-responders.</s><s>For observed response rates, missing data were not imputed as non-response.</s><s>For the pre-specified primary endpoint analysis, NRI was used to impute missing response data as non-response for the primary endpoint of SRI-5 at Week 52.</s><s>p Value based on OR was estimated from logistic regression model.</s><s>(B) SRI-4 through SRI-10 response rates at week 52.</s><s>SRI-6-SRI-10 was performed in subset of patients who entered study with ≥SLEDAI6-SLEDAI10.</s><s>NRI was used to impute missing response data for the endpoints of SRI-4 to SRI-10.</s><s>*p≤0.05 versus placebo;
