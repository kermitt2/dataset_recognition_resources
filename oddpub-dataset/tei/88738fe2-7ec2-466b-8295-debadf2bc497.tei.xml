<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The value of alloHCT in patients with FLT3-ITD þ AML has not been established unequivocally in randomized controlled trials.</s><s>Additional evidence on the role of alloHCT therefore remains desirable, especially when the ratio of mut/wt FLT3 alleles is considered.</s><s>In the randomized AML2003 study, patients were allocated to 2 transplant strategies with different timings of alloHCT stratified by the allelic ratio of mut/wt FLT3 in the experimental arm.</s><s>The study design allowed for a comparison of alloHCT as consolidation in first remission to alloHCT as salvage strategy after treatment failure.</s><s>In the as-treated analysis we found a significant impact of alloHCT on OS and EFS.</s><s>Patients with HR FLT3-ITD had inferior OS (P &lt; .001)</s><s>and EFS (P .001)</s><s>compared with patients with LR FLT3-ITD [2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, we found a different impact of alloHCT in patients with HR FLT3-ITD versus LR FLT3-ITD .</s><s>Although we found a clear benefit for alloHCT in terms of EFS and OS in patients with HR FLT3-ITD AML and in patients with LR FLT3-ITD AML and NPM1-wildtype, in patients with LR FLT3-ITD AML and NPM1 mutation a benefit from alloHCT in terms of OS and EFS was not evident.</s></p><p><s>These findings are in line with two recently published studies.</s><s>Schlenk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> reported results from 323 patients with FLT3-ITD þ AML treated in 3 prospective multicenter trials.</s><s>They found a significant survival benefit of alloHCT only in patients with HR FLT3-ITD AML, defined by an allelic ratio of mut/wt FLT3 !</s><s>.51,</s><s>but not in patients with LR FLT3-ITD AML.</s><s>Remarkably, Pratcorona et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref> used the same cutoff of .5 and also found no survival benefit for patients with LR FLT3-ITD AML with the mutated NPM1 gene, whereas patients with HR FLT3-ITD AML, regardless of an NPM1 mutation, exposed a significant benefit in terms of OS and leukemiafree survival after alloHCT in first remission.</s><s>Moreover, the different impact of alloHCT in subgroups of patients defined by the allelic ratio of mut/wt FLT3 and by NPM1 mutations could explain conflicting results from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15]</ref>.</s><s>The reason for the differential impact of alloHCT in the various genetic subgroups remains to be elucidated.</s><s>Our results suggest that patients with HR FLT3-ITD AML in particular have a very poor outcome after alloHCT when performed after treatment failure or relapse, whereas a substantial fraction of patients with LR FLT3-ITD AML achieved long-term disease-free survival after salvage alloHCT.</s><s>HR FLT3-ITD is associated with loss of wt-FLT3 [2,3].</s><s>The precise biological consequence of copy-number neutral loss of heterozygosity and loss of wt-FLT3 in the context of FLT3-ITD mutations has still not been fully elucidated.</s><s>However, studies in murine models suggested that the presence of FLT3-wt might lead to heterodimerization of wt and mut-FLT3 monomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>The latter would partially block the transforming effect of mutant FLT3, probably due to altered localization of the protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>.</s><s>Reintroduction of wt-FLT3 reduces the transforming potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, loss of wt-FLT3 protein per se does not change the disease but increases the transforming effect of the mutant receptor tyrosine kinase.</s><s>This mechanism could be responsible for the contradicting reports on the impact of alloHCT in FLT3-mutated AML.</s><s>Because the effect on disease control is much higher in patients with loss of wt-FLT3, the advantage of alloHCT can be revealed more easily in patients with HR FLT3-ITD .</s></p><p><s>Generally, outcome analyses based on the administered treatment may be biased by a selection of physically fit patients for alloHCT.</s><s>In our data, a selection of fitter patients for alloHCT in first remission appears unlikely.</s><s>Such a selection bias would not explain the differential impact of alloHCT in genetic subgroups.</s><s>Moreover, the observation that 79% of patients with HR FLT3-ITD who were not transplanted in first remission received alloHCT later in the course of the disease argues against such a selection bias.</s><s>Yet, the general limitations of retrospective studies have to be taken into account when interpreting our findings.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we provide additional evidence that patients with HR FLT3-ITD AML and patients with LR FLT3-ITD AML without concomitant NPM1 mutation benefit from postremission therapy with alloHCT.</s><s>In our study the cutoff for the ratio of mut/wt FLT3 alleles was based on previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</s><s>However, we admit that more effort is needed to define the optimal cutoff with concomitant mutations.</s><s>Finally, although</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Consort flow diagram showing patient numbers according to randomization and FLT3-ITD ratio focusing on the transfer to alloHCT in first remission.Patients with an allelic ratio of mutant FLT3-ITD &gt;
