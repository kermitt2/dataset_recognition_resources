cassette will be transcribed ending with a stop codon and a poly-A signal (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,B</ref>).</s><s>A large number of splice variants of the human Ca v 3.2 gene have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Zhong et al., 2006)</ref> but all these splice variants use the same start codon and it is therefore unlikely that transcripts exist with

enzymes respectively, and the fragment was gel purified.</s><s>Each of the gel purified fragments were co-transfected with the pSKCa v 3.2DTA plasmid into temperature activated EL350 cells by

is expressed in about 7% of the DRG cells, which were mainly TrkB + and TrkC + , with only a small percentage expressing TrkA.</s><s>In a further analysis using viruses containing a Cre-dependent reporter in our Ca v 3.2 Cre mice we could label and characterize the nature of adult sensory neurons that express Ca v 3.2.</s><s>The results of these experiments revealed that there are two major populations of Ca v 3.2 expressing sensory neurons; first low threshold Aδ-fiber mechanoreceptors (D-hair receptors) that exclusively innervate hair follicles and a population of peptidergic nociceptors that innervate muscle, but not the skin.</s><s>We could not demonstrate expression of Ca v 3.2 in tyrosine hydroxylase positive sensory neurons which have been postulated to be C-fiber low
