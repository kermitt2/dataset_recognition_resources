<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral data.</head><p><s>Participants' subjective awareness was assessed trial wise using a four-point confident rating scale that ranged from very sure to very unsure.</s><s>In addition, their task performance in a 2-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) task was used to assess their awareness on objective criteria.</s><s>The two groups did not differ in how often they indicated to be subjectively unaware of the stimuli (TD: 65.2% ± 5.2 SEM and ASD: 71.2% ± 6.8 SEM; t(32) = −0.71,</s><s>p = 0.48) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</s><s>In these least confident trials, the average 2AFC performances neither significantly differed between groups (t(32) = 0.61; p = 0.55) nor from chance level (50%) within each group (TD: t(19) = 1.32, p = 0.20; ASD: t(13) = 0.04, p = 0.97; one sample t-tests) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</s><s>In addition, a Bayesian analysis for uniform distributions above and below 50% revealed Bayes factors that smaller than 0.33 for both groups (TD: 0.11 and 0.01; ASD: 0.05 and 0.05), providing substantial evidence for the null hypothesis, that is, no difference from chance level.</s></p><p><s>Eye tracking data.</s><s>Despite complete unawareness of the stimuli, the two groups differed significantly in their eye movements towards the face stimuli (t(18.83)</s><s>= 2.68, p = 0.015; degrees of freedom are adjusted for unequal variances by the Welch-Satterthwaite method) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Critically, while the TD group had a strong unconscious preference for the faces with direct gaze 3 (M = 11.36%</s><s>± 5.2 SEM; t(19) = 2.16, p = 0.043; one sample t-test against 0), participants in the ASD group not only lacked such a preference for direct gaze but instead tended to show a priority for averted gaze (M = −21.52%</s><s>± 11.1 SEM; t(13) = −1.94,</s><s>p = 0.07), suggesting an unconscious avoidance of eye contact in this group.</s><s>Overall, the proportion of trials in which a saccade was made was similar in the TD and ASD groups (TD: 71.8% ± 4.5 SEM; ASD: 68.3% ± 5.9 SEM; t(32) = 0.47, p = 0.64), indicating that the difference in saccadic preference was not due to a systematic group difference in the frequency of eye movements.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study we replicate our previous finding that TD individuals have an unconscious bias towards faces with direct gaze <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> while showing that adults with ASD do not show such a bias, but, to the contrary, a tendency towards preferring faces with averted gaze.</s><s>This finding provides the first evidence that the atypical responses to eye contact commonly observed in ASD do not depend on the conscious perception of others' faces and their gaze directions.</s></p><p><s>Previous research on the extent to which atypical responses to others' eye gaze in autism are based on automatic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> have produced inconsistent results.</s><s>In response to visible face stimuli, patients with ASD show fast and reflexive-like eye movements away from the eye region <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , while in other tasks they do not exhibit impairments in rapidly orienting towards others' eye gaze <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s>However, responses to visible face stimuli could, at least in part, be based on voluntary or strategic processes.</s><s>In contrast, behavioural responses to stimuli that are suppressed from awareness preclude the influence of voluntary and strategic processes since in this case, the individual completely lacks any conscious knowledge about the stimulus.</s><s>Previous research also showed that the access to awareness, that is, the detection of an initially suppressed stimulus, is faster for faces with direct versus averted gaze in TD but not in ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s><s>However, it is critical to note that this finding does not allow for the conclusion that atypical responses to eye contact in ASD are independent of visual awareness, as this approach does not provide unequivocal evidence for the processing of stimuli in the absence of awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> .</s></p><p><s>The current results therefore go substantially beyond these previous findings by showing that, even when face stimuli are completely suppressed from awareness (as evidenced by a meticulous trial-by-trial assessment of awareness using subjective and objective measures), individuals with ASD avoid eye contact.</s><s>This suggests that atypical responses to eye gaze in ASD do not require the recruitment of high-level brain processes for the active avoidance of eye-contact; rather, these responses may rely on lower-level brain circuits that are thought to underlie fast and automatic eye gaze processing, involving subcortical structures via magnocellular channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>The magnocellular pathway is crucial for transmitting low spatial frequency information to the amygdala, the successful functioning of which is required for the processing of social and salient information <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, the amygdala is directly involved in detecting salient facial features and drives reflexive eye movements towards them <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>It has further been previously suggested that altered visual scan paths for faces in ASD are related to a hypofunction of the amygdala <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s></p><p><s>During typical development, early sensitivity to eye gaze develops rapidly through the magnocellular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>In ASD, neurodevelopmental abnormalities in magnocellular cells are thought to lead to disruptions in brain networks involved in social orienting, which could result in a decreased saliency and sensitivity to eye gaze information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s>Our finding of unconscious eye contact avoidance could thus be the direct consequence of such a magnocellular processing deficit.</s><s>Alternatively, or in addition, it is conceivable that individuals with ASD consciously avoid eye contact throughout life (e.g., to reduce negative arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> ), causing an impaired sensitivity to direct gaze due to reduced exposure, which may in turn contribute to altered unconscious processing of gaze cues in the long run.</s><s>Together, both of the above theories could lead to the reported abnormal amygdala responses to eye gaze in ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Whether the unconscious avoidance of eye contact reflects a basic magnocellular deficit in gaze processing or rather a consequence of the voluntary avoidance of eye contact throughout development is an intriguing question that will require the investigation of unconscious gaze processing early in the course of the disorder.</s><s>Akin to atypical brain function <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> , we speculate that unconscious biases may even be present in ASD before overt behavioral phenotypes.</s><s>Supporting the interpretation that an early basic deficit in eye gaze processing underlies unconscious eye contact avoidance, a recent study reported that in children with autism reduced attention to the eyes is due to a passive insensitivity to social signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>It has been recently proposed that the employment of eye tracking may prove beneficial for the screening of and differentiation between patients with ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>Eye tracking and gaze-contingent designs in particular provide further insights into face processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> as well as a better understanding of social interactions in ASD <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>In light of evidence showing that neural responses to eye gaze in infants predict the later development of autism <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , our present results offer a promising starting point for investigating the extent to which altered automatic eye gaze processing is predictive of the later development of autism.</s><s>Unconscious avoidance of eye contact may provide a useful marker for participants' automatic attentional preferences unbiased by voluntary responses.</s></p><p><s>Finally, a potentially important therapeutic consequence of our current results could be that interventions, which currently focus on only overt social deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , shift their focus to include the training of fast and reflexive reactions, for example by reinforcing reflexive shifts to direct gaze with a reward.</s><s>Such a strategy could help overcome obstacles in the treatment of impaired social functioning that are due to an active avoidance of social signals.</s></p><p><s>To our knowledge, this is the first study providing direct evidence for the unconscious avoidance of eye contact in individuals with ASD.</s><s>By showing that atypical responses to eye gaze in ASD can occur unconsciously, and by thus indicating a highly automatic avoidance of eye contact, our findings go substantially beyond the current literature on gaze processing and provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying impaired social functioning in ASD.</s><s>Finally, our current results pave the way for future investigations into unconscious gaze processing in infants and provide a starting point for the development of new therapeutic interventions targeting impaired sensitivity to social cues in autistic individuals.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>The experimental design was similar to the study by Rothkirch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>First, participants' dominant eye was determined using an eye dominance test <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>Details of the eye dominance test are explained in a previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>Both, the eye dominance test and the main experiment used the method of continuous flash suppression to render the stimuli invisible to participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>In this method, a low-contrast, static stimulus of interest, which is presented to one eye, is suppressed from awareness by the simultaneous presentation of high-contrast, dynamic mask images to the other eye.</s></p><p><s>In the main experiment, all stimuli were presented within a white frame (12° × 12°) with a grey background (luminance: 30 cd/m²).</s><s>Trials started with a white central fixation cross (0.6° × 0.6°) for 1500 ms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>If participants did not fixate the cross, the cross was thickened and displayed on the screen till central fixation was established.</s><s>Then, two intervals each with a duration of 800 ms followed, during which high-contrast greyscale mask stimuli (12° × 12°) were flashed to the participant's dominant eye at a frequency of 10 Hz to induce continuous flash suppression.</s><s>Two low-contrast face stimuli (root mean square contrast of 0.03), one with direct and the other with an averted gaze were presented concurrently with the masks.</s><s>The face stimuli were presented to the non-dominant eye, in one of the two intervals, within the left and right half of the white frame (eccentricity: 3.4°).</s><s>Both face stimuli were presented either 3° above, below, or at the horizontal meridian.</s><s>Participants' task was to actively search for the faces by making eye movements.</s><s>Upon the first eye movement that landed on a face, both faces were removed from the screen which helped reduce the risk of participants becoming aware of the faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</s><s>The two intervals were separated by a fixation period of 750 ms and each interval was followed by the presentation of CFS masks for 200 ms to both eyes, to prevent after images.</s><s>After the second interval, participants were prompted with two questions.</s><s>The first was a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task where they indicated the interval in which the face stimuli were presented.</s><s>In the second question, participants had to indicate Participants made eye movements to search for the face stimuli and indicated in a

experiment consisted of 8 runs of 38 trials each.</s><s>Each run had two 'dummy' trials where the face stimuli were presented at full contrast to the dominant eye.</s><s>These trials were included to maintain participants' motivation to search for the faces and were discarded from all analyses.</s><s>Prior to the start of each run, a nine-point calibration of the eye tracker was performed.</s><s>All conditions, i.e. the allocation to one of the two intervals and the spatial location of the faces was randomized and counter-balanced across trials.</s></p><p><s>Data Analyses.</s><s>Analyses of behavioral data.</s><s>For each participant, trials in which they indicated to be least confident were selected and included in all further analyses.</s><s>To test whether participants were able to discriminate the face-present from the face-absent intervals despite their low confidence, a one sample t-test was performed on the 2AFC task performances of both groups against the chance level of 50%.</s><s>However, since a non-significant result of a t-test does not provide conclusive evidence for the null hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> , we additionally performed a Bayesian analysis using an online Bayes calculator (http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Zoltan_Dienes/inference/bayes_factor.swf).</s><s>The Bayes analysis was performed on a uniform distribution varying from 0 to 50% and from 50 to 100% to test that the data were neither significantly above or below chance.</s><s>Bayes factors (BF10) &lt; 0.33 provide substantial evidence for the null over the alternative hypothesis, BF10 &gt; 3 can be interpreted as evidence for the alternative over the null hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Analyses of eye tracking data.</s><s>Pre-processing of eye tracking data comprised interpolation of missing data points on the basis of a cubic-spline interpolation if no more than 24 ms of consecutive data were
