<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anti-VEGFR-3 treatment results in inhibition of GVHD-associated lymphangiogenesis</head><p><s>To selectively inhibit lymphangiogenesis during GVHD, we used the anti-VEGFR-3 monoclonal antibody mF4-31c1, which specifically antagonizes the binding of VEGF-C to VEGFR-3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>We first confirmed by flow cytometry that immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, granulocytes, dendritic cells and monocytes do not express VEGFR-3 in different wild type mice strains as well as in allo-HSCT recipients with aGVHD (data not shown).</s><s>In the LP/J → C57BL/6 model we injected mF4-31c1 or control antibody at a dose of 1mg per mouse every second day from day 0 and harvested organs for immunofluorescent staining as well as flow cytometry.</s><s>Quantification of Lyve1 positive area showed a significant reduction of lymph vessel density in the colon of mF4-31c1-treated allo-HSCT recipients vs control antibody treated allo-HSCT recipients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A-B</ref>).</s><s>In the mesentery we found a non-significant trend toward a lower lymph vessel density in mF4-31c1-treated allo-HSCT recipients vs control antibody treated allo-HSCT recipients during aGVHD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C-D</ref>).</s><s>We next analyzed mesenteric lymph nodes and found no significant differences in lymph vessel density between the groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref>).</s><s>The amount of lymph vessel specific endothelial cells in peripheral lymph nodes of mF4-31c1 treated allo-HSCT recipients was moderately reduced (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3F</ref>), again without reaching statistical significance.</s><s>To exclude the possibility that anti-VEGFR-3 therapy has any effects on hemangiogenesis, we stained colon and liver sections from control antibody and mF4-31c1 treated allo-HSCT recipients with aGVHD against the blood vessel marker CD31 and found no significant differences in blood vessel density (supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>) between the GVHD vs no GVHD cohorts.</s></p><p><s>We conclude that the anti-VEGFR-3 antibody mF4-31c1 effectively inhibits GVHD-associated lymphangiogenesis in colon.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bone marrow only</head><p><s>Finally, VEGFR-3 has been described as being expressed on small subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells. <ref type="bibr"

vasculature that may have contributed to the observed efficacy.</s><s>However, this possibility appears less likely because the specificity of the antimurine VEGFR-3 blocking antibody, which we have used in our experiments, to bind to lymphatic vasculature was previously demonstrated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>In addition, we found no considerable expression of VEGFR-3 on immune cells during aGVHD.</s></p><p><s>In our experimental models as well as in patient biopsies, we found that aGVHD is associated with increased lymph vessel density in the intestinal tract.</s><s>In the murine models, we used anti-VEGFR-3 antibodies and observed the most effective reduction of lymph vessel density in the colon, whereas the reduction of lymph vessel density in lymph nodes and the mesentery was less prominent.</s><s>This may be due to target organ tropism of GVHD.</s><s>However, tissue heterogeneity of the lymphatic vascular system, which has been described in detail recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> could also be involved.</s><s>Depending on the organ and the associated physiologic and pathologic condition, lymph vessels show tissue-specific functional specialization.</s><s>For example, lymph vessels in the intestinal tract and the mesentery show specialized features for fat absorption and metabolism, a different junctional organization than skin dermal capillary vessels, and display a set of differentially expressed genes, in comparison with dermal lymphatic endothelial cells.</s><s>Nevertheless, our murine data showing lymphangiogenesis in destructive mucosal lesions in the colon strongly correlate with the pathogenic situation in the patient, in which we see most prominent lymphangiogenesis in mucosal ulcerations.</s></p><p><s>In tumor-bearing allo-HSCT recipients, we found no significant differences in malignant lymphoma growth between anti-VEGFR-3 antibody and control antibody-treated

may be explained by the fact that VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are expressed on hematopoietic precursor cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42</ref></s><s>Furthermore, the activation of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 has been demonstrated in the reconstitution of hematopoiesis and engraftment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44</ref></s><s>Notably, we demonstrated improved
