<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this first large-scale GWA meta-analysis study for lean mass that included most of the cohorts worldwide with lean mass phenotypes, we identified and successfully replicated five GWS loci (in/near HSD17B11, VCAN, ADAMTSL3, IRS1, and FTO genes) for whole body lean mass and three of these (in/near VCAN, IRS1, and ADAMTSL3 genes) for appendicular lean mass, both important for sarcopenia diagnosis.</s></p><p><s>This study contributes to a better understanding of the biology underlying inter-individual variation in muscle mass, since lean body mass consists primarily of muscle mass (especially in the extremities).</s><s>Genetic determinants of lean body mass cannot be studied specifically by using anthropometric measures such as height, waist circumference, hip circumferences, or BMI, as evidenced by our finding of associations between genetic loci and lean mass that were not observed in results from the GIANT consortium <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> .</s><s>Four novel GWS loci for lean mass phenotypes harboring ADAMTSL3, VCAN, HSD17B11, and IRS1 genes have biologic effects supporting their role in skeletal muscle.</s><s>Although the functional involvement of the ADAMTSL3 gene (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain with thrombospondin type I motifs-like 3) remains unknown, it has been shown to be consistently associated with adult height in large human samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , including individuals of African ancestry <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>The gene is expressed ubiquitously, including in skeletal muscle but the lead GWAS SNP in this locus was not significantly associated with expression of ADAMTSL3 in any of the tissues examined.</s><s>One might hypothesize that our observed association between this gene and lean mass could be a reflection of an allometric relationship between muscle mass/size and body size <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Since our analyses were adjusted for height, it is plausible that variation in ADAMTSL3 is associated with muscle mass directly.</s><s>In fact, in a recent study that identified classes of potentially regulatory genomic elements that are enriched in GWAS loci, the height phenotype was almost exclusively enriched in DNAse sites in muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>In our study, we observed enrichment of regulatory genomic elements in this locus in both skeletal muscle and smooth muscle, which may not fully support a unique role of this gene in only skeletal muscle tissue.</s></p><p><s>Versican (VCAN) plays a role in intercellular signaling and in connecting cells with the extracellular matrix, which also is important for the skeletal muscle.</s><s>Interestingly, VCAN facilitates chondrocyte differentiation and regulates joint morphogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and therefore has a wider role in the musculoskeletal health.</s><s>The GWAS SNP in the HSD17B11 locus was significantly associated with the HSD17B11 gene expression in skeletal muscle.</s><s>Hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 11 (HSD17B11) functions in steroid biosynthesis, and most relevant to muscle tissue, contributes to androgen catabolic processes.</s><s>Although not much is known about how variants in this gene associate with sex-hormone related human phenotypes, androgen metabolism is certainly a driver of muscle tissue anabolism and catabolism.</s></p><p><s>As for the FTO locus, variants in the FTO gene, which is known to regulate postnatal growth in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , have been found to be associated with adiposity/obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> and related traits, such as BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , metabolic syndrome/type 2 diabetes and even with menarche <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</s><s>Apart from its role in adiposity, in two recent candidate gene studies, SNPs in FTO were found to associate both with DXA-derived fat and lean mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , and in one, the association for lean mass was only slightly attenuated after fat mass adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , similar to our results using fat mass-adjusted lean mass.</s><s>Also, FTO knockout mice have been shown to have not only reduced fat mass, but also decrease in lean mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> .</s><s>Recently, obesity associated non-coding sequences in the FTO gene were found to be functionally connected to the nearby gene, IRX3, by directly interacting with the promoters of this gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> , suggesting obesity SNPs located inside the FTO gene may regulate gene expression other than FTO.</s><s>Our GWAS lead SNP rs9936385 in the FTO locus was in LD with the obesity GWAS SNP and located in the same haplotype.</s><s>A denser fine-mapping study using sequencing of the FTO locus with a better resolution will be helpful in narrowing down the FTO region to identify potential causal variant(s).</s><s>The actual function of the variants and the underlying mechanisms of FTO's involvement in skeletal muscle biology still need to be further elucidated by in vitro and animal experiments.</s></p><p><s>The other body composition-related gene that was successfully replicated is the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), which belongs to the insulin signaling pathway and participates in growth hormone and adipocytokine signaling pathways.</s><s>Besides being overexpressed in adipocytes, IRS1 is also highly expressed in skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , IRS1 polymorphisms have been associated with fasting insulin-related traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> , adiposity <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , and serum triglycerides/HDL cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .</s><s>Our GWAS lead SNP rs2943656 was associated with IRS1 gene expression in skeletal muscle obtained from the GTEx project.</s><s>Interestingly, another SNP, rs2943650, near IRS1 in high LD with our lead SNP (R 2 = 0.854) was previously found to be associated with percent body fat in the opposite direction from the association that we find with lean mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>The body fat percentage decreasing allele in this study was associated with lower IRS1 expression in omental and subcutaneous fat <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Another study reported an association between a SNP in high LD (rs2943641) with IRS-1 protein expression and insulin-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase activity in skeletal muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>Also rs2943656 was associated with obesity traits in the GIANT Consortium; the allele associated with greater lean mass was inversely associated with obesity traits.</s><s>Further understanding of the potential functional effects of these variants in the IRS1 locus are needed to determine whether they have pleiotropic and opposite effects on fat and lean tissue.</s><s>The same is true for variants in the FTO locus for which the allele that was associated with greater lean mass was previously reported to be associated with greater fat mass.</s></p><p><s>From the current eQTL data analysis, we have no definitive evidence that the non-coding GWAS SNPs (or variants in high LD) functionally influence gene expression of IRS1, HSD17B1, and FTO in skeletal muscle.</s><s>Use of a larger reference panel for imputation in the GWAS sample, and analysis of larger tissue expression data sets coupled with conditional analysis will help reveal if underlying functional associations exist.</s><s>It should be emphasized that with the current data we are not able to determine which SNPs may be functional and it is possible that the identified lean mass variants are not driving the associations with expression.</s><s>Using ENCODE and Epigenetic Roadmap data, we found that the GWAS SNPs (or SNPs in LD with these SNPs) were significantly enriched in the predicted gene regulatory regions (in our case, enhancers) not only in skeletal muscle, but also in smooth muscle, fat and brain tissues.</s><s>With the complexity of lean mass phenotypes, we cannot rule out the possibility that these genes are involved in regulating lean mass biology via tissues other than skeletal muscle.</s></p><p><s>Using results from the overall meta-analysis, the percent variance explained by the successfully replicated SNPs was 0.23% and 0.16% for whole body and appendicular lean mass, respectively.</s><s>Estimates were slightly higher when we used individual level data from the Framingham Study cohorts (percent variance explained of 0.97% and 0.55% for whole body and appendicular lean mass, respectively).</s><s>This relatively small percentage of explained variance is not dissimilar to other body composition measures such as bone mineral density of the femoral neck, for which 63 SNPs explained 5.8% of the variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</s><s>To estimate the proportion of variance for lean mass explained by all genotyped SNPs across the genome in Framingham Study participants, we applied a GREML model implemented in the GCTA package <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> with the assumption that all 550K genotyped SNPs captured ≥80% of the common sequence variance in the Framingham Study participants who are Caucasians of European ancestry.</s><s>We estimated that the proportion of whole body lean mass and appendicular lean mass variance explained by all genotyped SNPs together was 43.3% (SE: 2.7%) and 44.2% (SE: 2.6%), respectively (after adjustment for age, age 2 , sex, height and fat mass), suggesting most of the heritability of lean mass was not detected in the current study due to the limitations of study design (only common variants in this study).</s><s>This percent variance is similar to the 45% of the variance explained for height using this method <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Because of the substantial sexual dimorphism in body composition with men having higher muscle mass compared with women <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> , we performed both sex-combined and sex-stratified analyses.</s><s>We examined potential sex differences in the genetic associations.</s><s>Lean mass is a highly heritable trait and the heritability is of similar magnitude in both genders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> .</s><s>No formal interaction test between SNP and sex was significant for any of these SNPs.</s><s>Thus, our findings do not support any substantial sex-specific genetic influence for any of the successfully replicated lean mass SNPs.</s><s>We cannot rule out the possibility that the reported GWS SNPs are false-positive findings, although the chance of such false positives is extremely low due to the robustness of replication in our well-powered study.</s><s>There are also other limitations to our study.</s><s>Because lean mass is correlated with fat mass, we adjusted for fat mass to focus our search on genes contributing to lean mass independent of those regulating fat mass.</s><s>A potential limitation with this strategy of adjusting for fat mass is that the power to identify genetic signals with a similar impact on lean and fat mass will be reduced.</s><s>Nevertheless, the FTO signal was found to be significantly associated with lean mass after fat adjustment and the direction of this association was the same as the association with fat mass.</s><s>Since androgens have a major impact on muscle mass, it is a limitation of the present study that the X chromosome, harboring the androgen receptor gene, was not included in the present meta-analysis.</s><s>Another potential weakness of this study is our decision to meta-analyze body composition results using two different techniques (BIA and DXA).</s><s>Nevertheless, the two methods are highly correlated (r = 0.83 for Framingham cohort participants), and by combining them power to detect GWS loci was greatly enhanced.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, in this first large-scale meta-analysis of GWAS, five GWS variants in or near the HSD17B11, VCAN, ADAMTSL3, IRS1, and FTO genes were found to be robustly associated with lean body mass.</s><s>Three of these loci were found to be significantly enriched in enhancers and promoters in muscle cells, suggesting that our signals have a potential functional role in muscle.</s><s>Our findings shed light on pathophysiological mechanisms underlying lean mass variation and potential complex interrelations between the genetic architecture of muscle mass, fat mass, body height and metabolic disease.</s></p></div>
