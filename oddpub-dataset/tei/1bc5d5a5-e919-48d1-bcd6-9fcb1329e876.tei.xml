<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Background: The last two human genome assemblies have extended the previous linear golden-path paradigm of the human genome to a graph-like model to better represent regions with a high degree of structural variability.</s><s>The new model offers opportunities to improve the technical validity of variant calling in whole-genome sequencing (WGS).</s><s>Methods: We developed an algorithm that analyzes the patterns of variant calls in the 178 structurally variable regions of the GRCh38 genome assembly, and infers whether a given sample is most likely to contain sequences from the primary assembly, an alternate locus, or their heterozygous combination at each of these 178 regions.</s><s>We investigate 121 in-house WGS datasets that have been aligned to the GRCh37 and GRCh38 assemblies.</s><s>Results: We show that stretches of sequences that are largely but not entirely identical between the primary assembly and an alternate locus can result in multiple variant calls against regions of the primary assembly.</s><s>In WGS analysis, this results in characteristic and recognizable patterns of variant calls at positions that we term alignable scaffold-discrepant positions (ASDPs).</s><s>In 121 in-house genomes, on average 51.8 ± 3.8 of the 178 regions were found to correspond best to an alternate locus rather than the primary assembly sequence, and filtering these genomes with our algorithm led to the identification of 7863 variant calls per genome that colocalized with ASDPs.</s><s>Additionally, we found that 437 of 791 genome-wide association study hits located within one of the regions corresponded to ASDPs.</s><s>Conclusions: Our algorithm uses the information contained in the 178 structurally variable regions of the GRCh38 genome assembly to avoid spurious variant calls in cases where samples contain an alternate locus rather than the corresponding segment of the primary assembly.</s><s>These results suggest the great potential of fully incorporating the resources of graph-like genome assemblies into variant calling, but also underscore the importance of developing computational resources that will allow a full reconstruction of the genotype in personal genomes.</s><s>Our algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/charite/asdpex.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>alternate loci.</s><s>This offers many opportunities to the genomics and bioinformatics communities to adapt analysis procedures to a more sophisticated model of the human genome, but it also presents substantial technical challenges, since many of the currently used programs for alignment, variant calling, and analysis expect reads and features to have a single location within a haploid assembly model <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>The (SAM) format for sequence alignments is able to represent reads that align both to chromosomes of the primary assembly (i.e., chr1-22, chrX, chrY, and chrMT) and to an alternate locus, whereby the alignment to the chromosome of the primary assembly is considered to be the representative alignment, and alignments of the same read to non-reference chromosomes, called supplementary alignments, are linked to the representative alignments.</s><s>However, analogous extensions of the alogous extensions that would link variants called from the same reads to multiple loci are not available.</s></p><p><s>The characterization of variants in an individual genome is one of the most important tasks in medical genomics, especially in diagnostic settings or in projects that aim to identify novel disease-associated genes.</s><s>Alternate loci for highly variable regions such as the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) locus may differ at tens of thousands of positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and thus there is a substantial potential to improve the accuracy of variant calls by exploiting the information in the new genome assembly model.</s><s>In this work, we present an analysis of the implications of the alternate loci for variant calling.</s></p><p><s>We provide an implementation of the algorithms used in the work under a Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 license at https://github.com/charite/asdpex.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GRCh38 genome assembly data</head><p><s>Prior to the GRCh37 assembly, the human genome reference sequence was represented as a single consensus sequence referred to as the golden path <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Several chromosomal regions display a sufficiently high degree of variability that they cannot be adequately represented by a single sequence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>For this reason, the GRC began to provide alternate sequences for selected variant regions through the inclusion of alternate locus scaffolds (or alternate loci) starting with the GRCh37 human genome assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>An alternate locus is a sequence that is an alternate representation of a genomic region in a largely haploid assembly.</s><s>Thus, alternate loci are provided for genomic regions that show substantial variability in the population and are embedded in an otherwise haploid representation of the genome.</s><s>For the analysis described in this work, the Genome Reference Consortium build 38 patch 2 assembly of the human genome was used (GRCh38.p2).</s><s>This build has a total of 178 alternate-locus-containing regions associated with a total of 261 alternate locus scaffolds.</s></p><p><s>In our work, we refer to segments of the primary assembly unit that are associated with one or more alternate loci as REF-HAP sequences, and we refer to the alternate loci as ALT-HAP sequences.</s><s>The alternate loci have a number of different patterns of alignment with the REF-HAP sequence (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure">S1-S5</ref> and Additional file 1: Supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alignments of ALT-HAP and REF-HAP sequences</head><p><s>For each of the 178 alternate-locus-containing regions in the GRCh38.p2</s><s>assembly, we performed pairwise alignments between the REF-HAP and each of the alternate loci at the region.</s><s>Alignments for each of the alternate loci in the alts_accessions_GRCh38.p2 and the various alt_scaffold_placement.txt files were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) FTP site <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>The alignments start with the Gap= flag, followed by several blocks consisting of a letter (M, I, or D) and a number (length), where (i) M indicates a matching region between ref and alt loci, potentially with mismatches but without gaps; (ii) I indicates an insertion in the alt scaffold (i.e., additional sequence information in the alt scaffold); and (iii) D indicates a deletion in the alt scaffold (e.g., Gap = M23343 D19 M5 D24 M4 D11 M88 D1 M54 I1 M59 ...).</s><s>Manual inspection revealed that parts of these alignments are often suboptimal in the sense that potentially alignable regions are split into multiple small alignment blocks (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure">S6 and S7</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Therefore, we used the following strategy to redefine the sequence alignments for each alignment of an alternate scaffold against the reference.</s><s>Our method identifies seed sequences as relatively long M blocks (i.e., matches or mismatches with no gaps).</s><s>In many cases, there are multiple mismatching bases at the very beginning and end of M blocks, and for this reason we remove 5% but not more than 50 nt on both ends of the seed.</s><s>For each match (M) block in the original alignment, we considered the sequence to be a seed sequence if the trimmed M block was longer than 50 nt (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>Some of the general feature format (GFF) files representing the alignments contain a second alignment line.</s><s>In this case, one finds a large insertion (I) followed by a large deletion (D) in the main alignment; this represents an inversion (see Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s><s>To handle this, we split alignments into blocks defined by the large insertion/deletion boundaries and aligned these blocks separately.</s></p><p><s>Another relevant issue with the alignments is that they ignore long stretches with Ns in the alternate scaffold sequences, that is, N bases are treated as matches (e.g., KI270905.1,</s><s>GL000258.2,</s><s>and GL383571.1).</s><s>If the stretch of N bases was larger than 10 nt, we split the seed into two separate blocks to either side of the N bases.</s></p><p><s>The preprocessing steps described above are summarized in Additional file 1: Supplemental Algorithm S1.</s><s>The output of the preprocessing consists of a series of seeds of 50 nt or longer in length.</s><s>The seeds were then used for a banded chain alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> using the C++ library SeqAn <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> version 2.0.1.</s><s>The parameters used for the alignment were match: 5, mismatch: −2, gapextend: 0, gapopen: −20, and anchor bands: 10.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we note that the alignments between regions and alternate loci begin with identical anchors, such that the beginning and end portions of the alignments are identical.</s><s>No differences between the two sequences occur in these regions, and the analysis described in the following sections was, thus, limited to the portion of the alignment between the first and the last difference within each alignment (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of alignable scaffold-discrepant positions</head><p><s>We show that stretches of sequences that are largely but not entirely identical between the primary assembly and an alternate locus can result in multiple variant calls against regions of the primary assembly.</s><s>We will refer to divergent positions within otherwise similar or identical stretches of alignment as alignable scaffold-discrepant positions (ASDPs); the following text will make our definition more precise.</s></p><p><s>The alignment resulting from the procedure described in the previous section was taken as the basis for the following algorithm to identify ASDPs.</s><s>Each position of the alignment was checked in turn for a mismatch or gap, and all such positions were recorded in a VCF file.</s><s>ASDPs comprise mainly single-nucleotide differences, but insertions and deletions of various sizes are encountered.</s><s>For the analysis described in this work, we classified insertion or deletion (indel) ASDPs into small-indel ASDPs with a size less than 50 bases or structural variant (SV) ASDPs.</s><s>This cutoff was chosen since most variant detection tools (e.g., FreeBayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and GATK <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>) only call indels up to this size.</s></p><p><s>The first-pass analysis described above generates a list of candidate ASDPs (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">S10</ref>).</s><s>We chose to restrict the final analysis to ASDPs that are located within relatively good segments of the alignment.</s><s>Therefore, the final list of ASDPs was generated by applying the filter that no ASDP can be located in any 50 base-pair window of the alignment in which there are more than ten discrepant positions.</s><s>That is, the window is advanced one nucleotide at a time, and if there is any window position at which there are more than ten discrepant positions, then the candidate ASDP is discarded.</s><s>We will refer to this final list of ASDPs as high-confidence ASDPs.</s></p><p><s>We note that we use the acronym ASDP to refer to a divergent position in the alignment between REF-HAP and ALT-HAP sequences, and not to a called variant; we will show that many variants called in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) overlap with ASDPs, and we will refer to such variants as ASDP-associated variants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ASDPex</head><p><s>ASDPex, the ASDP extraction algorithm, is designed to analyze individual VCF files with the goal of identifying ASDP-associated variants so that they can be marked or filtered out of downstream analysis pipelines if desired (Additional file 1: Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">S11</ref>).</s><s>Additionally, ASDPex calls the most likely combination of haplotypes for each of the 178 genomic regions.</s></p><p><s>For this purpose, ASDPex scans each of the 178 regions in turn and compares all of the associated alternate loci.</s><s>For each comparison, all variants called against the reference haplotype are assigned to the set R.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alignment of whole-genome sequencing samples and variant calling</head><p><s>To validate the ASDPs against real data, we used 121 genomes sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq X-Ten system (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea).</s><s>The reads were aligned to the GRCh37 and GRCh38 genome releases with BWA-MEM (version 0.7.12-r1039) utilizing bwakit (https://github.</s><s>com/lh3/bwa/tree/master/bwakit).</s><s>This tool, which can be used to align reads to either the GRCh37 or GRCh38 assembly, trims the reads (trimadap), and aligns the trimmed reads to the reference with BWA-MEM <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>We run bwa mem (using the run-bwamem script) as follows:</s></p><p><s>run-bwamem -sd -t 96 -R &lt;readgroup&gt; -o &lt;outfile&gt; -H hs38DH.fa</s><s>sample_R1.fastq.gz</s><s>sample_R2.fastq.gz</s></p><p><s>We note that bwa mem aligns reads to the primary assembly and the alternate loci independently, thus avoiding the potential problem that a read that aligns well to a sequence in the primary assembly and another sequence in an alternate locus is given a poor mapping quality.</s><s>In this work, we used the bwa mem alignments to the alternate loci for visualization, but we note that ASDPex uses only variant calls to the primary assembly and, thus, an alignment performed by any mapper to just the primary assembly could also be used as input to ASDPex.</s></p><p><s>Finally, samtools <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> was used to sort the alignment and SAMBLASTER <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> to mark duplicates, which resulted in the final alignment.</s><s>This final alignment was then used to call variants [single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels] using FreeBayes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>There was a mean 37-fold coverage.</s></p><p><s>Variants were normalized using vcflib vcfallelicprimitives (https://github.com/ekg/vcflib-v1.0.0) and vt normalize (https://github.com/atks/vt-v0.57).</s></p></div>
