<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Urticaria is characterized by the sudden appearance of hives, angioedema or both <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), formerly known as chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is defined by the spontaneous development of itchy hives and/or angioedema that reoccur for at least 6 weeks due to known or unknown causes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>CSU/CIU is thought to affect 0.5-1 % of the global population at any given time, with CSU/CIU accounting for approximately two-thirds of all cases of chronic urticaria (CU) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>It has been estimated that 33-67 % of patients with CSU/CIU have both hives and angioedema, with 29-65 % having hives alone and 1-13 % angioedema alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Although the clinical features and pathogenesis of CSU/CIU have been well studied over the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the humanistic and economic burden of CSU/CIU have not been elucidated in detail, specifically, in patients with an inadequate response to first-line therapies.</s></p><p><s>However, generally across all patient types, CSU/CIU can have a considerable burden on patients, healthcare systems and society.</s><s>Moreover, the current standard of care, H 1 -antihistamines at licensed doses, is only effective at resolving symptoms in less than 50 % of patients with CSU/CIU.</s><s>Further increases in dose of H 1 -antihistamines does improve treatment response, but every third or fourth patient is thought to remain refractory (symptomatic despite treatment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and may therefore have a higher burden of disease when compared to nonrefractory patients.</s><s>The burden of disease is also particularly high in patients with CSU/CIU and associated angioedema, which, when compared to hives alone, can increase disease severity and duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>In addition to the impact of the physical signs and symptoms, CSU/ CIU can also have a profound impact on the lives of patients due to factors such as sleep disruption, anxiety, embarrassment, depression and social isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Many aspects of daily activities (e.g., choice of clothes or going to the shops <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) are also negatively impacted in patients with CSU/CIU <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; and for those patients who are employed, impaired work performance or even absence from work are common <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>There is also a need to ensure timely and appropriate referral of patients with CSU/CIU to specialists in order to reduce delays in their diagnosis and the implementation of effective pharmacological management.</s><s>This is especially true for those patients who are symptomatic despite on-going treatment with current standard of care.</s><s>In many cases this need is not met, with patients seeing an average of more than two physicians before being referred to a specialist <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Reducing the burden associated with CSU/CIU therefore requires a broader understanding of the impact of these unmet needs of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The guidelines recommend a stepwise approach in the management of CSU, beginning with licensed doses of H 1 -antihistamines <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>However, many patients remain uncontrolled and in these situations, current guidelines recommend increasing the dose by up to four-fold <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>In patients non-responsive to higher doses of H 1 -antihistamines, guidelines recommend the addition of a third-line treatment option of omalizumab, ciclosporin or montelukast <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Among these third-line options, only omalizumab is currently approved as add-on therapy for the treatment of CSU/CIU in adult and adolescent (≥12 years) patients showing an inadequate response to H 1 -antihistamine treatment.</s></p><p><s>Few studies have specifically evaluated the economic impact of CSU/CIU.</s><s>In 2005, DeLong and colleagues estimated the total annual cost in the US as being $2047 per patient, with indirect costs accounting for 15.7 % ($322) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Another study analyzing 2002 data estimated the total annual cost in France as being €2128 per patient, with productivity costs accounting for 92.2 % (€1962) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s>Studies based on insurance claims cannot assess clinical aspects and patient perspectives because they lack recorded clinical data; it is also possible that the lack of specific International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for CSU/CIU <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, may have resulted in an underestimated number of affected patients.</s><s>As such, the true economic cost of CSU/CIU needs to include both direct costs, such as medication and costs of treatment, as well as indirect costs related to lack of productivity and absence from work.</s></p><p><s>Importantly, there are no studies which specifically evaluate the burden of disease in patients who are nonresponsive to standard-of care (H 1 -antihistamines at licensed doses).</s><s>The objective of ASSURE-CSU is to identify and quantify the humanistic, societal and economic burden of disease in patients with inadequately controlled CSU/CIU, with a focus on patients whose disease persists for ≥12 months.</s><s>This study will evaluate health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) using patient-reported outcomes (PROs), healthcare resource utilization, absence from work and productivity loss among patients with CSU who are currently symptomatic despite treatment.</s><s>This study, collecting real-world data in this patient population, will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of CSU/ CIU and its associated unmet need.</s></p></div>
