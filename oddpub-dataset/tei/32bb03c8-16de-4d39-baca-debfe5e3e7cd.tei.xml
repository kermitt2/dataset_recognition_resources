prescribed to 85.7% of our AF patients with VKAs slightly more preferred to DOACs (43.2% vs. 37.9% respectively).</s><s>Possible explanations for such physician's preference were the prevalence of VHD (i.e., valvular AF) in our study population and mostly the significantly higher cost of DOACs compared to VKAs in Bulgaria.</s><s>The rate of oral anticoagulant treatment in AF patients, presented by other authors differs widely.</s><s>Jain et al. reported that anticoagulant prescription in AF patients increased from 9% (1995-1998) to 30% (2011-2014) <ref type="bibr"

<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>The PREFER registry including &gt;7000 patients from 7 European countries showed that the three most commonly administered antiarrhythmic drugs in AF
