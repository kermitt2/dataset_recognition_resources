<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>In general terms, the expression of genes can be studied from a static or temporal point of view.</s><s>Static microarray experiments allow measuring gene expression responses only at one single time point.</s><s>Therefore, data obtained from those experiments can be considered as more or less randomly taken snapshots of the molecular phenotype of a cell.</s><s>However, biological processes are dynamic and thus, the expression of a gene is a function of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>To be able to understand and model the dynamic behavior and association of genes, it is important to study gene expression patterns over time.</s></p><p><s>However, compared to static microarray data, the analysis of time-course data introduces a number of new challenges.</s><s>First, the experimental costs for the generation of data as well as the computational cost increases with the increase in the number of introduced time points.</s><s>Second, hidden correlation caused by co-expression of genes makes the data linearly dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Finally, one has to be aware of additional correlations existing between neighboring time points clearly revealed in published gene expression profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Several different algorithms have been suggested to analyze gene time-course microarray data with regard to differential expression in two or more biological groups (e.g.</s><s>exposed to radiation vs. non-exposed) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless solitary identification of differentially expressed genes does not help to determine the molecular mechanisms in the investigated biological groups.</s><s>Therefore, it is not only important to know differentially expressed genes per se, but also how those genes interact and regulate each other in order to determine specifically deregulated molecular networks.</s></p><p><s>Currently, many different algorithms including cluster analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and supervised classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are used to identify relationships between genes.</s><s>However, both of these methods suffer from serious limitations.</s><s>First, the timing information of the measurements is not incorporated and, therefore, the intrinsic temporal structure of the time-course data is neglected.</s><s>Second, the available standard clustering and classification methods are not designed to measure statistical significance of the results based on a statistical hypothesis test.</s><s>By nature of these methods, clusters or classes of genes with similar expression patterns will always be identified but they do not provide a measure of how reliable this information is.</s><s>For this reason, we preferred usage of a dynamic network modeling approach that allows delineation of relationships between genes along with providing statistical significance for these relationships.</s></p><p><s>The aim of the present study was to identify and compare signaling pathways involved in the radiation responses of normal cells differing in their radiation sensitivity that could be used to modulate cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation.</s><s>For this, we propose an approach that combines the detection of genes differentially expressed over time based on statistics determined by natural cubic spline regression (NCSRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> followed by dynamic gene association network (GAN) reconstruction based on a regularized dynamic partial correlation as implemented in the GeneNet R-package <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Most exploratory gene expression studies focus only on the identification of differentially expressed genes by treating them as independent events and do not seek to study the interplay of identified genes.</s><s>This makes it difficult to tell which genes are part of the interaction network causal of the studied phenotype and which are the most "important" with regard to the context of the investigation.</s><s>The herein present approach combines the identification of differentially expressed genes and reconstruction of possible associations between them.</s><s>Further analysis of identified GANs then allows hypothesizing which genes may play a crucial role in the investigated processes.</s><s>This should markedly increase the likelihood to find meaningful results from an initial observation and help to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.</s><s>We applied our workflow on time-course transcriptome data of two normal and well-characterized lymphoblastoid cell lines with normal (20037-200) and increased radiation sensitivity (4060-200), in order to identify molecular mechanisms and potential key players responsible for different radiation responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s>Our exploratory approach provides novel and informative insights in the biology of radiation sensitivity of non-tumor cells after exposure to ionizing radiation with regard to the identified signaling pathways and their key drivers.</s><s>Moreover, we could demonstrate that spline regression in differential gene expression analysis for the purpose of prior selection in gene-association network reconstruction outperforms another commonly used existing approach for time-course gene expression analysis.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of reconstructed networks</head><p><s>The evaluation of the two networks derived after 1 Gy irradiation of the cell line with increased sensitivity showed that the network reconstructed with the differentially expressed genes determined using BETR did not contain significantly more common edges than random networks (p = 0.529), whereas the network reconstructed with the differentially expressed genes determined by NCSRM did (p = 0.048).</s><s>The networks derived after 10 Gy irradiation of the cell line with increased sensitivity and 10 Gy irradiation of the normal sensitive cell line contained significantly more edges that were common with the Reactome network compared to random networks for both methods.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>The success of tumor radiation therapy predominantly depends on the total applied radiation dose, but also on the tolerance of the

were compared with the density of the Reactome interaction network in order to assess their complexity.</s><s>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0160791.t002</s><s>towards radiation, which greatly varies on an individual level due to inherited susceptibility, is one of the most important limiting factors for dose escalation in radiooncology treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s>To account for radiation sensitivity of normal tissue in personalized treatment approaches the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be thoroughly understood in order to identify molecular targets for the modulation of radiation sensitivity and molecular markers for the stratification of patients with different intrinsic radiation sensitivity.</s><s>In the present study we identified significantly differentially expressed genes over time between the radiation-treated group and the control group to be used as prior genes for GAN reconstruction.</s><s>Two doses of gamma irradiation were used to characterize the differences in radiation response of the two lymphoblastoid cell lines with known differences in radiation sensitivity.</s><s>The dose of 10 Gy was selected following the fact that the same dose has been applied in a previous research project examining the radiation sensitivity of the same lymphoblastoid cell lines analyzed in the study at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>The dose of 1 Gy reflects the dose that is delivered as part of the so called "low-dose bath" to the tumor-surrounding tissue during the radiotherapy of the tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we conducted time-resolved transcriptome analysis of radiation-perturbed cell culture models of non-tumor cells with normal and with increased radiation sensitivity in order to work out the molecular phenotype of radiation sensitivity in normal cells.</s><s>Moreover, we present an innovative approach for the identification of GANs from time-course perturbation transcriptome data.</s><s>The approach comprises three major steps: 1) the identification of differentially expressed genes from time-course gene expression data by employing a natural cubic spline regression model (NCSRM); 2) the use of a regularized dynamic partial correlation method to infer gene associations network from differentially expressed genes; 3) the identification and functional characterization of the key nodes (hubs) in the reconstructed gene dependency network (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our proposed method for the detection of differentially expressed genes over time is based on NCSRM with a small number of basis functions.</s><s>A relatively low number of basis functions generally results in a good fit of data and, at the same time, reduces the complexity of the fitted models.</s><s>Treating time in the model as a continuous variable, a non-linear behavior of gene expressions was approximated by spline curves fitted to the experimental time-course data.</s><s>Considering temporal changes in gene expression as continuous curves and not as single time points greatly decreases the dimensionality of the data and thereby decreases computational cost.</s><s>In addition, the proposed NCRSM does not require identical sampling time points for the compared treatment conditions.</s><s>Furthermore, no biological replicates are needed.</s><s>Therefore, the method is applicable to data generated according to a tailored time-course differential expression study design and to data that were not specifically generated for time-course differential expression analysis, e.g.</s><s>existing/previously generated data from clinical samples.</s><s>Thus, the adaption of the method to differential expression analysis comprises the potential to reanalyze existing data, address new questions in silico and thereby potentially add new or additional value to existing data.</s><s>Incomplete time-course data, e.g.</s><s>due to the exclusion of samples for technical reasons, that often create major problems for the estimation of the model, are also suitable for fitting the spline regression model as long as enough data points remain in the data set.</s><s>This is especially valuable when data on certain time points, derived from a very limited sample source, have been excluded from a time-course data set and cannot be repeatedly generated.</s></p><p><s>Since gene expression is not only dynamic in the treatment group but also in the control group, the inclusion of the time-course control data greatly improves the ability to detect truly differentially expressed genes, as the gene expression values are not referred to a single time point with static gene expression levels only.</s><s>Comparing a treatment group to time point zero does not provide a proper control over the entire time-course, although it is widely practiced <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The proposed workflow is implemented in an open-source R-package splineTimeR and is available through Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org).</s></p><p><s>Amongst a panel, the two lymphoblastoid cell lines that were different with regard to radiation sensitivity after irradiation with 10 Gy <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, also responded differently with regard to the quantity of differentially expressed genes.</s><s>Interestingly, cells with normal radiation sensitivity barely responded to 1 Gy irradiation at the transcriptome level.</s><s>Only seven genes (FDXR, BBC3, VWCE, PHLDA3, SCARF2, HIST1H4C, PCNA) were identified as differentially expressed, whereas for the cell line with increased sensitivity 2335 differentially expressed genes were detected after exposure to the same dose.</s><s>A similar behavior was observed for those two cell lines after irradiation with 10 Gy.</s><s>We detected 6019 and 3892 genes as differentially expressed in the sensitive and normal cell lines, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Those results are in a good agreement with the previous proteomic study where more differentially expressed proteins were detected for the same sensitive cell line compare to the cell line with normal radiation sensitivity 24 hours after irradiation with 10 Gy <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, for both applied doses, the radiation sensitive cells exhibited much more pronounced transcriptional response compared to the cells with normal radiation sensitivity and thereby underlines the expected radiation response of those two cell lines.</s></p><p><s>Concerning qualitative differences in the transcriptomic response of normal sensitive cells and cells with increased sensitivity after treatment with 1 Gy and 10 Gy pathway enrichment analysis was performed.</s><s>Differentially expressed genes identified for all considered treatment conditions except for the normal sensitive cells after exposure to 1 Gy radiation showed statistically significant enrichment of pathways.</s><s>Most of which were in agreement with known radiation responses such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, oxidative stress response or pathways related to apoptosis (S2 Table) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the pathway enrichment analysis results suggest plausibility of generated data and, more importantly, underline the meaningfulness of our suggested approach based on cubic spline regression for differential gene expression analysis of time-course data.</s><s>However, differential expression analysis alone followed by pathway enrichment analysis does not provide any mechanistic insights.</s><s>For this reason we performed GAN reconstruction using identified differentially expressed genes.</s><s>Based on the assumption that the expression levels of functionally related genes are highly correlated, partial correlation was used for GAN reconstruction.</s><s>In simple correlation, the strength of the linear relationship between two genes is measured, without taking into account that those genes may be actually influenced by other genes.</s><s>Partial correlation eliminates the influence of other genes when one particular relationship between pair of genes is considered.</s><s>Network reconstruction was performed separately for the cell line with increased radiation sensitivity after 1 Gy and 10 Gy and for the cell line with normal radiation sensitivity after 10 Gy of radiation dose.</s><s>Due to
