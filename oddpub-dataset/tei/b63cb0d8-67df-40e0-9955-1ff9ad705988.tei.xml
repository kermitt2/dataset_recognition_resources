<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>The evidence from this systematic review suggests that the Clubhouse Model is effective in important domains in spite of significant methodological limitations in some studies.</s><s>Many of the observational studies only report findings comparing Clubhouse members with one another and did not report findings from pre-post comparisons, making it difficult to determine whether clubhouse membership itself produced benefits.</s><s>Many of the studies that we reviewed did not report effect size estimates or lacked information needed to calculate them.</s><s>There were many different types of outcome measures and analysis methods reported in the studies in this review, making difficult to calculate effect sizes that would be useful in summary form or for a metaanalysis.</s></p><p><s>Clubhouses have expanded the array of supports they offer over time.</s><s>Approximately one third of the studies were conducted more than 10 years ago and it is unclear whether they apply in a contemporary and specialized service environment.</s><s>Programs with complex arrangements like the Clubhouse Model may not easily lend themselves to RCT's.</s><s>Researchers often examine the impact of a service provided within a particular model rather than the impact of the model as a whole.</s><s>These program models do not always rely on effects of specific services and have generalized protocols and processes whose effects are difficult to isolate <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Wolff 2000)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>We restricted our final sample to Clubhouses that were accredited and/or followed the International Clubhouse Standards.</s><s>Some studies in our initial search were conducted prior to the establishment of Clubhouse International, while others conducted later did not indicate whether the Clubhouse being examined was affiliated with Clubhouse International.</s><s>Most of the Clubhouses studied in this review did not receive fidelity checks; or the researchers conducted the studies prior to the establishment of the Clubhouse Accreditation process and the development of the Clubhouse fidelity instruments.</s><s>In the future, it will be important to conduct studies of accredited Clubhouse programs with strict fidelity to the model in order to evaluate the model and generalize to Clubhouses nationally or internationally.</s><s>Researchers that conduct studies of the Clubhouse Model should utilize rigorous designs and measures and publish whether the ''Clubhouse'' studied had fidelity to the model.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Administrators of mental health programs are, to an increasing extent, required to show funders that the programs they plan to implement are effective.</s><s>This has been one of the driving forces behind the increasing popularity of evidence-based practices.</s><s>Building the evidence base to examine the cost and impact of reductions in hospitalizations, incarcerations and other outcomes among participants in Clubhouses and other mental health settings would be beneficial to mental health administrators, particularly in an era of limited funding.</s><s>Many of the existing services or programs have yet to be thoroughly investigated making it impossible to know which have the best outcomes.</s></p><p><s>Unless these programs are included in research, stakeholders have no scientific way of knowing how these programs compare to existing EBPs.</s><s>These models may risk elimination because of a lack of empirical research as opposed to a lack of effectiveness.</s><s>Devoting resources to comprehensive research examining a wider variety of existing and innovative services like Clubhouses will increase the quantity and quality of the evidence base.</s></p><p><s>Peer driven, recovery-oriented models of psychiatric rehabilitation, such as the Clubhouse Model, are needed and expected in today's array of supports for individuals living with mental illness.</s><s>The Clubhouse Model is consistent with recovery practices with its emphasis on member choice, self-determination, community integration, equal partnerships with members and staff working side-by-side, offering hope, and helping individuals live a meaningful life.</s><s>The emphasis on recovery is reflected in the growth of the literature on the Clubhouse Model in recent years <ref type="bibr">(Biegel et al. 2013a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Conrad-Garrisi 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Conrad-Garrisi and Pernice-Duca 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hancock et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Pernice-Duca et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Raeburn et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Raeburn et al. 2016a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tanaka et al. 2015)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This study provides a synthesis of the best evidence available for the Clubhouse Model.</s><s>Clubhouses are a promising practice and the research supporting Clubhouses is growing, but additional studies are necessary to provide a clearer and more contemporary basis for evaluating the Clubhouse Model.</s><s>Next steps include studies using rigorous methods including RCTs, studies with matched participants, or observational studies to evaluate programs with fidelity to the Clubhouse Model and develop evidence for use in a meta-analysis.</s><s>Studies that examine the Clubhouse Model and other established evidence based practices would be useful.</s><s>In addition, services offered by Clubhouses such as outreach or supported housing that have not been thoroughly examined would benefit from research.</s><s>It will also be important to examine the impact of the Clubhouse Model where it has been adapted to serve other populations than those with severe mental illness, such as individuals diagnosed with brain injuries.</s></p><p><s>Even with these reservations, the studies in this review provide enough evidence of the Clubhouse Model's effectiveness to assure administrators that Clubhouse programs are worthy of support as one component of a spectrum of rehabilitative services for persons with serious mental illness.</s></p></div>
