<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Immunoproteasome expression in the murine lung.</s><s>As immunoproteasome expression in the lung has not been investigated in detail so far, we first examined total expression levels of immunoproteasome subunits in the murine lung compared to liver and spleen including tissues from LMP2 and LMP7 deficient mice as controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Wildtype lungs contained intermediate amounts of the immunoproteasomal subunits LMP2 and LMP7 compared to liver and spleen.</s><s>While LMP7 levels were unchanged in LMP2 deficient mice, LMP2 protein levels were evidently decreased in LMP7 deficient mice and the unprocessed pro-form of LMP2 accumulated in spleens of LMP7 deficient mice.</s><s>To confirm incorporation of immunoproteasome subunits into active 20S proteasomes and their relative distribution compared to standard β -subunits, we next isolated active 20S proteasomes from the lungs of healthy wildtype mice via sucrose-gradient fractionation and separated them on a 2D gel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>By mass spectrometry of excised spots, we detected all different 14 subunits of the 20S proteasome.</s><s>All three immunoproteasome subunits were present in addition to the three standard proteasome subunits β 1, β 2, and β 5.</s><s>Each immunoproteasome subunit was identified from three distinct spots, indicating post-translational modifications of these subunits.</s></p><p><s>To specify the pulmonary cell types that contain immunoproteasomes, we stained murine lungs with LMP2-and LMP7-detecting antibodies using lungs of the respective knockout animals as controls.</s><s>Although we tested several commercially available antibodies, immunohistochemical detection of LMP7 proved to be unspecific as controlled by lungs of LMP7 knockout mice while staining for LMP2 was specific (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>): Alveolar epithelial and parenchymal cells of the lung expressed only very low amounts of LMP2, whereas alveolar macrophages were highly positive for this immunoproteasome subunit.</s><s>Individual cells in the vicinity of airways also exhibited prominent LMP2 staining.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunoproteasome expression is not altered between donor and COPD lungs.</head><p><s>In a next step, we thoroughly investigated immunoproteasome expression in the human lung by using native PAGE and immunoblotting of human donor lung tissue.</s><s>We unambiguously identified the immunoproteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7 mainly in active 20S but also to some extent in 26S fractions as confirmed by blotting for respective proteasomal 19S (Rpt5) and 20S subunits (α 1-7) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Immunohistochemical analysis of LMP2 in end-stage COPD tissue (GOLD stage III and IV) from explanted lungs revealed no obvious alteration in cell-type specific expression of LMP2 compared to lungs from human donors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>We observed prominent but variable staining for LMP2 mainly in alveolar macrophages.</s><s>While bronchial epithelial cells showed some positive staining, alveolar epithelial cells were negative for LMP2.</s><s>In addition to alveolar macrophages, cells in the vicinity of airways also showed some LMP2 reactivity.</s><s>However, our immunohistochemical staining was heterogeneous and did not allow a reliable quantification of LMP2 expression levels in lung tissue samples of COPD patients compared to controls.</s></p><p><s>In human lung tissue homogenates from cancer resections of never-smokers, ex-smokers, and COPD GOLD stage I and II classified patients, we again did not observe any significant difference in the levels of LMP2 and LMP7 between these groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>Of note, expression of the 20S proteasome was also not altered in COPD tissue compared to non-COPD controls, indicating that the proteasome is not obviously dysregulated in these samples.</s></p><p><s>Active immunoproteasomes are induced by IFNγ in parenchymal cells of the lung.</s><s>With the basal expression levels of immunoproteasomes being low in parenchymal cells, but high in immune cells of the lung, we next investigated to what extent immunoproteasomes can be induced in parenchymal cells by IFNγ , which has been shown as a major cytokine involved in acute virus infection and a major inducer of immunoproteasomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s><s>We confirmed IFNγ -mediated induction of immunoproteasomes in primary parenchymal cells of the murine and human lung: IFNγ strongly induced immunoproteasomal gene expression in mouse primary alveolar type II cells (pmATII) after 24 h of treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>LMP2 and LMP7 protein levels were both strongly induced in primary human (phLF) and mouse lung fibroblasts (pmLF) after IFNγ stimulation for 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>Similar to tissue homogenates shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, LMP7 was induced in fibroblasts from LMP2 deficient mice to the same degree as in wildtype mice, but the unprocessed pro-LMP2 accumulated in LMP7 deficient fibroblasts.</s></p><p><s>To define the kinetics and activities of newly formed immunoproteasomes after IFNγ stimulation in detail, we treated the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 from 2 up to 72 h with IFNγ .</s><s>mRNA levels of all three immunoproteasome subunits were upregulated after 2 h and further increased up to 24 h in  A549 cells upon IFNγ treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s><s>Transcript levels of NLRC5, a recently identified transactivator of LMP2 and MHC class I genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , transiently peaked at 6 h but declined after 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Protein levels of both LMP2 and LMP7, were upregulated already after 6 h and stayed elevated until 72 h after IFNγ treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>The unprocessed pro-form of LMP2, which indicates that the protein is not yet incorporated into mature 20S proteasome complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , was detected between 6 and 24 h of IFNγ treatment suggesting that LMP2-containing immunoproteasomes are only finally assembled 48 h after IFNγ stimulation.</s><s>As total 20S proteasome levels, however, were not altered, these results indicate a shift from standard 20S towards immunoproteasome expression in IFNγ -exposed lung alveolar cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>).</s><s>De novo assembly of active immunoproteasomes was further proven by use of activity-based probes (ABP).</s><s>ABPs covalently bind to and label only active catalytic β -subunits of the intact 20S catalytic core <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s>Here, we made use of three distinct site-specific ABPs that allowed us to discriminate the active standard and immunoproteasome subunits <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>Native lysates of IFNγ -treated A549 were incubated with the respective ABPs and then separated under denaturing conditions to quantify the labeled catalytic subunits of the proteasome: The activity of all three immunoproteasome subunits, LMP2, MECL-1, and LMP7, increased up to 24 h and slightly decreased at 72 h after IFNγ treatment while the standard catalytic subunits β 1, β 2, and β 5 were inversely regulated after an initial 24 h activation burst (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>The novel technique of ABP detection in native gels revealed ABP labeling of five different active 26S and hybrid proteasome complexes with a slight shift from active

lower than in mouse spleen.</s><s>While we could specifically detect LMP2 and LMP7, immunodetection of the third immunoproteasome subunit MECL-1 was unspecific with several commercially available

immunoproteasome subunits was found in three distinct protein spots indicating post-translational modifications or isoform expression in the mouse lung.</s><s>However, our mass spectrometry analysis did not allow us to identify any modifications, which was beyond the scope of this project.</s><s>Further analysis of native proteasome complexes in the lung by blotting of native PAGE gels revealed that 20S immunoproteasomes can be found both in the 20S and 26S proteasome fraction of mouse and human lungs (Figs.</s><s><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a, 4d and  5d</ref>), implying that

express immunoproteasomes after IFNγ stimulation, thus enabling immunoproteasome-dependent antigen presentation.</s><s>Interestingly, fibroblasts from LMP7 deficient mice express some unprocessed LMP2 compared to wildtype mice.</s><s>It was previously shown that LMP7 is necessary for efficient incorporation of LMP2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> , which explains our observation of the

type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>In A549 cells, the pro-form of LMP2 was detected until 24 h after IFNγ treatment, while pro-LMP7 was not detectable at any time-point (even though the LMP7 antibody we used detects both the unprocessed and mature form of LMP7).</s><s>This might be due to preferential incorporation of pro-LMP7 into 20S compared to its standard proteasome counterpart

possible with commercially available proteasome substrates.</s><s>A striking feature of these activity-based probes is that beyond quantification of the three main proteasomal activities, we can specifically discriminate activities for the standard and the respective immunoproteasome subunit counterparts β 1/LMP2, β 2/MECL-1, and β 5/LMP7 as they are labeled within the same lysate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>).</s><s>The novel combination of activity-based probe labeling of all catalytic active sites of the proteasome with native gel electrophoresis permitted us to assign newly assembled immunoproteasomes to active 20S and 26S proteasome complexes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>).</s><s>Using this innovative biochemical toolbox, we showed that IFNγ can rapidly induce expression and assembly of active immunoproteasomes in parenchymal cells of the lung.</s><s>This cannot be achieved with conventional and commercially available proteasome activity assays.</s><s>With these techniques at hand, we also assessed immunoproteasome activity in the course of virus infection of the lung.</s><s>For that, we used the model of MHV-68, since

.</s><s>In our MHV-68 infection model (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5 and 6</ref>), we were able to detect increased immunoproteasome transcript and protein levels which were highest 14 days after viral infection.</s><s>While mRNA transcripts were back at baseline at day 148, protein levels of LMP2 and LMP7 were still increased, suggesting proteasome stabilization and extended half-life of proteasomes after infection.</s><s>This might also explain the observation of slightly increased standard proteasomes on the protein and activity levels at day 14, which cannot be explained by increased transcript levels (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5 and 6</ref>).</s><s>Total proteasome activity, as assessed by fluorescent activity-based probes, was transiently increased up to twofold during infection and was back at baseline after 148 days.</s><s>The increase in proteasome activity was attributed to an increase in both 20S and 26S activities which both comprised the virus-induced immunoproteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7.</s><s>These data suggest ubiquitin-dependent and -independent degradation of proteins by immunoproteasomes during infection.</s></p><p><s>Over the course of infection, we observed a shift in standard versus immunoproteasome activity in MHV-68 infection, which was resolved for the catalytic subunit pair MECL-1/β
