ethanol consumption in flies and humans.</s><s>Drosophila lacking Rsu1 show reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation.</s><s>We show that Rsu1 is required in the adult nervous system for normal sensitivity and that it acts downstream of the integrin cell adhesion molecule and upstream of the Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) GTPase to regulate the actin cytoskeleton.</s><s>In an ethanol preference assay, global loss of Rsu1 causes high naïve preference.</s><s>In contrast, flies lacking Rsu1 only in the mushroom bodies of the brain show normal naïve preference but then fail to acquire ethanol preference like normal flies.</s><s>Rsu1 is, thus, required in distinct neurons to modulate naïve and acquired ethanol preference.</s><s>In humans, we find that polymorphisms in RSU1 are associated with brain activation in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation in adolescents and alcohol consumption in both adolescents and adults.</s><s>Together, these data suggest a conserved role for integrin/Rsu1/Rac1/actin signaling in modulating rewardrelated phenotypes, including ethanol consumption, across phyla.</s><s>A lcohol consumption has a worldwide prevalence of 42% (1), and alcohol is the third most serious risk factor for health loss worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</s><s>The genetic contribution to the development of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) has been estimated at 40-60% based on family, adoption, and twin studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>.</s><s>Although several studies in humans and model organisms have described genes and molecular pathways involved in alcohol responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>, our molecular understanding of how AUDs develop is still incomplete.</s></p><p><s>The vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a genetically tractable organism used to model addiction-relevant, ethanol-induced behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>.</s><s>When exposed to ethanol vapor, flies display biphasic behaviors similar to those elicited in humans.</s><s>Low ethanol doses induce a state of disinhibition and increased locomotor activity, whereas higher doses lead to loss of postural control and sedation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s>Flies also display addiction-like behaviors similar to mammals.</s><s>In an ethanol consumption and preference assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, for example, flies gradually acquire alcohol preference and will overcome an aversive stimulus to consume alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In addition to the similarities that mammals and flies display in their behavioral responses to ethanol, numerous genes and signaling pathways affect alcohol-induced behaviors across organisms.</s><s>In vitro and in vivo studies in Drosophila and mammals have revealed a link between alcohol and the actin cytoskeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>When cultured primary mouse neurons are exposed to ethanol, there is a gradual decay in filamentous actin that correlates with decreased NMDA receptor current <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Mice with a genetic KO of the actin-capping protein epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (EPS8), which displays reduced decay of both filamentous actin and NMDA receptor current in the presence of acute ethanol, show increased alcohol preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Flies with mutations in the arouser gene, encoding an EPS8 homolog, also show an ethanol sensitivity phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A major regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics is the Rho family of small GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, and mutations in these genes affect alcohol-induced behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>Adult loss of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activity, for example, leads to enhanced sensitivity to alcoholinduced sedation, whereas loss of the Rac1 down-regulator Rho-GAP18B causes reduced sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</s><s>Although these studies have shown that Rho family GTPases play a role in alcohol responses, the upstream signaling pathways modulating their effects on actin cytoskeletal dynamics are not understood.</s></p><p><s>Here, we describe the identification and characterization of mutations in the icarus (ics) gene encoding Ras suppressor 1 (Rsu1), which exhibits reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation.</s><s>Our experiments reveal that ics mediates normal behavioral responses to ethanol in the adult nervous system by regulating actin dynamics downstream of integrin and upstream of the Rac1 GTPase.</s><s>Although WT flies gradually acquire ethanol consumption preference over several days, flies completely lacking Rsu1 show heightened naïve preference that does not increase further over the time of the assay.</s><s>Conversely, flies lacking Rsu1 only in the mushroom bodies (MBs) show no naïve preference and also, fail to acquire preference over time, suggesting that distinct neural circuits mediate naïve and acquired ethanol preference.</s><s>In humans, RSU1 was associated with frequency of lifetime drinking in an adolescent sample and alcohol dependence in an independent adult replication sample.</s><s>In adolescents, RSU1 was also associated with altered functional MRI activation in the ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation.</s><s>Our findings, thus, highlight Rsu1 and the integrin/Rsu1/Rac1 signaling pathway as important modulators of reward-related phenotypes, including ethanol consumption across phyla.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>ics Mutants Display Reduced Sensitivity to Ethanol-Induced Sedation.</s></p><p><s>To identify genes involved in ethanol-induced behaviors in Drosophila, we screened a collection of strains carrying random insertions of a transposable P element.</s><s>We isolated one mutant that displayed reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation compared with controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1A</ref>).</s><s>DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the Gal4-containing P element in this line is inserted in the ics gene, and we, thus, labeled it ics G4 .</s></p><p><s>The ics gene had been previously identified because of its wing blister phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, and ics G4 mutant flies also exhibited wing blisters.</s><s>The original mutant, ics BG , carrying a P element insertion at the 3′ end of ics exon 3 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1D</ref>) showed reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation similar to that of ics G4 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1A</ref>).</s><s>Heterozygous ics flies showed no phenotype and were used as controls in some of the experiments below.</s><s>To confirm that the transposon inserted in ics G4 was, indeed, responsible for the ics G4 ethanol phenotype, we mobilized the ics G4 P element by supplying the transposase enzyme.</s><s>Precise excision (ics x23 ) of the P element reverted the mutant phenotype to the WT, whereas imprecise excision of the P element (ics x5 ; resulting in a deletion of 1,353 bp) (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1D</ref>) showed the ics mutant phenotype (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1B</ref>).</s><s>Expression of the Rsu1 protein was absent in ics mutants (ics G4 and ics x5 ) and normal in the precise excision ics x23 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1C</ref>).</s><s>The reduced ethanol sensitivity in ics mutants was not caused by altered pharmacokinetics, because ethanol absorption and metabolism were normal in ics G4 , ics BG , and ics x5 flies compared with controls (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1E</ref>).</s><s>Flies carrying mutations in ics also showed normal locomotion (assessed by startle-induced phototaxis and negative geotaxis as well as spontaneous daily locomotion).</s><s>These results suggest that ics mutations affect ethanolinduced behavior without generally disabling the flies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Significance</head><p><s>Genetic factors play a major role in the development of human addiction.</s><s>Identifying these genes and understanding their molecular mechanisms are necessary first steps in the development of targeted therapeutic intervention.</s><s>Here, we have isolated the gene encoding Ras suppressor 1 (Rsu1) in an unbiased genetic screen for altered ethanol responses in the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster.</s><s>Our behavioral, genetic, and biochemical experiments show that Rsu1 links signaling from the integrin cell adhesion molecule to the small GTPase Rac1 in adult neurons to regulate actin dynamics and alcohol consumption preference.</s><s>We also show that variants in human RSU1 associate with altered drinking and brain activation during a reward prediction task, thereby validating the predictive power of our approach.</s></p><p><s>Rsu1 Is Required in the Adult Nervous System for Normal Ethanol Sensitivity.</s><s>To confirm that the reduced ethanol sensitivity of ics mutants was caused by loss of Rsu1 protein expression, we restored expression of Rsu1 by using the Gal4/UAS system (18) and introducing a UAS-Rsu1 cDNA transgene.</s><s>We drove expression of Rsu1 in ics G4 mutant flies by taking advantage of the transcriptional activator Gal4 contained within the inserted P element, which disrupts Rsu1 expression while also expressing Gal4 under the control of the endogenous ics promoter and enhancers.</s><s>Homozygous ics G4 flies carrying the Gal4-transactivated UAS-Rsu1 transgene showed WT ethanol sensitivity and restoration of WT Rsu1 protein expression levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>).</s><s>ics G4 drove expression of a UAS-GFP reporter in the brain, including in the MBs and neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis; there were no obvious differences between ics G4 mutant and WT flies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1B</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To investigate if ics G4 -driven expression in the nervous system was necessary for normal ethanol responses, we suppressed the expression of the UAS-Rsu1 cDNA in neurons using a panneuronal inhibitor of Gal4, elav-Gal80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</s><s>Neuronal suppression of Rsu1 expression prevented rescue of the ics G4 phenotype by the UAS-Rsu1 transgene (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).</s><s>To ask whether exclusive expression of Rsu1 in the nervous system was sufficient to rescue the ics mutant phenotype, we used the neuron-specific driver elav-Gal4 to drive expression of UAS-Rsu1 in the ics mutant background.</s><s>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, reduced ethanol sensitivity of ics x5 was restored to WT levels when we expressed Rsu1 exclusively in neurons.</s><s>Taken together, these data indicate that Rsu1 functions in the nervous system to regulate ethanol-induced behavior.</s></p><p><s>Neurons expressing Gal4 in ics G4 mutant brains seemed no different from behaviorally normal ics G4 /+ heterozygotes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1B</ref>), suggesting that Rsu1 is not needed to properly set up ethanol response neuronal circuits.</s><s>Given that ics mutant flies show a developmental wing blister phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, it was possible that we could have missed subtle developmental defects.</s><s>We, therefore, wished to directly test the requirement for Rsu1 in adult flies using Gal80 ts , which allows for temperature-dependent suppression of Gal4 driver activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s>Using this system, the expression of Gal4 is suppressed at 18 °C but not at 29 °C.</s><s>We first asked whether expression of UAS-Rsu1 cDNA during development only was able to restore normal ethanol-induced sedation to ics mutant adults.</s><s>We reared flies (ics G4 UAS-Rsu1;Tub-Gal80 ts ) at 29 °C, allowed developmental expression of Rsu1, and then, suppressed expression during adulthood by shifting the flies to 18 °C for 3 d after eclosion.</s><s>Expression of Rsu1 in this manner was unable to rescue the reduced ethanol sensitivity of ics G4 mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).</s><s>Conversely, when we raised flies at 18 °C, blocking Rsu1 expression during development but allowed Rsu1 expression in adulthood by shifting the flies to 29 °C for 3 d after eclosion, the phenotype of ics G4 mutants was completely rescued to WT levels (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>).</s><s>These data suggest that Rsu1 functions in the adult fly to regulate normal ethanol-induced behaviors and that Rsu1 is not required for the developmental wiring of neural circuits involved in regulating ethanol responses.</s></p><p><s>Rsu1 Functions Downstream of Integrin Signaling.</s><s>Developmental experiments show that Rsu1 acts in concert with the scaffolding protein PINCH (particularly interesting new cysteine-histidinerich protein) to inhibit the JNK signaling pathway downstream of the integrin signaling receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>We, therefore, investigated whether perturbation of the integrin signaling pathway in Drosophila would alter ethanol sensitivity.</s><s>As previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, flies heterozygous for mutations in the β-integrin-encoding gene myospheroid (mys ts2 ) showed increased sensitivity to the sedating effects of ethanol compared with the WT (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) (mys ts2 homozygotes are not viable).</s><s>When we introduced the ics G4 mutation into this genetic background, the mys ts2 ics G4 double-mutant flies showed the same reduced ethanol sensitivity as ics G4 mutant flies (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>), suggesting that Rsu1 controls ethanol-induced behavior downstream of the integrin receptor.</s><s>We also observed genetic interactions between ics alleles and mutants in the genes encoding PINCH and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>), further supporting our hypothesis that Rsu1 affects ethanolinduced behaviors by regulating the integrin signaling pathway.</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ics G4/G4 ics G4/G4 ics G4 / + ics G4 / + Tub-Gal80 ts &amp; 0 1 0 2 0 ST50 (min) ics G4/G4 ics G4/G4 ics G4 / + ics G4 / + UAS-Rsu1</formula><p><s>Rsu1 Acts Upstream of Rac1 and Affects Actin Dynamics.</s><s>Because Rsu1 acts in concert with PINCH to inhibit JNK activity during development <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, we tested for potential genetic interactions between mutations in ics and basket (encoding JNK).</s><s>We were unable to find any such interaction or a sedation phenotype in basket mutants, which is consistent with two previous studies reporting the absence of an ethanol sedation phenotype in basket mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>.</s><s>Other than JNK, other downstream targets of integrin signaling include Rho family GTPases.</s><s>Depletion of human Rsu1 in a human breast cancer cell line elevates the levels of activated Rac (Rac.GTP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, suggesting that Rsu1 reduces Rac1 activation.</s><s>We, therefore, investigated whether Rsu1 functions through Rac1 to affect ethanol-induced responses.</s><s>Expressing dominant negative (DN) Rac1 in ics-Gal4-expressing cells (ics G4 /+;UAS-Rac1 DN /+) resulted in increased sensitivity to ethanolinduced sedation (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).</s><s>This increased sensitivity remained the same in the ics G4 homozygous mutant background, suggesting that Rac1 regulates ethanol responses downstream of Rsu1.</s></p><p><s>We next determined whether Rsu1 physically interacts with Rac1 by cotransfecting Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells with FLAG-tagged Rsu1 and various Rho GTPases tagged with YFP.</s><s>Immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody pulled down both GTPlocked Rac1 G12V [constitutively active (CA)] and GDP-bound Rac1 T17N (DN) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>).</s><s>It did not, however, coimmunoprecipitate Rho1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>) or Cdc42, suggesting that Rsu1 is a specific binding partner for Rac1 in the Rho family of small GTPases.</s></p><p><s>Our genetic data indicated that Rsu1 acts upstream of Rac1 to oppose the latter's activity.</s><s>We, therefore, hypothesized that, in the absence of Rsu1, there would be increased Rac1 activation.</s><s>We found that knockdown of Rsu1 with RNAi in S2 cells (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>) increased levels of Rac.GTP loading (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</s><s>In addition, both overexpression of Rac1 CA and Rsu1 knockdown caused a decrease in the globular to filamentous actin ratio (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> D and E).</s><s>Taken together, these data indicate that Rsu1 binds to Rac1 and destabilizes actin filaments through Rac1 inhibition.</s></p><p><s>ics Mutants Show Increased Alcohol Preference in Drosophila.</s><s>We next asked whether ics mutant flies exhibit an alcohol-drinking phenotype.</s><s>Flies were tested in an ethanol consumption preference assay [capillary feeder (CAFÉ)] <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>.</s><s>WT flies gradually acquire preference for ethanol over 3 d, showing that alcohol is reinforcing consummatory behavior (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>), which likely involves reward pathways.</s><s>Conversely, ics G4 mutant flies showed significant naïve preference for ethanol on day 1, which remained unchanged over 4 d of the assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>).</s><s>This enhanced preference in ics mutants was caused by an increase in ethanol consumption, whereas the total food consumption volume was no different from the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>).</s><s>Introducing UAS-Rsu1 driven by ics G4 into the mutant flies restored this phenotype to WT (i.e., gradual acquisition of preference over the first few days of the assay) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The MBs are a brain center in Drosophila involved in higherorder processing, such as associative olfactory learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> and ethanol-reinforced odor preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s>We next asked whether Rsu1 was required in the MB for normal ethanol preference in the CAFÉ assay.</s><s>Using an MB-Gal80 transgene, we inhibited MB expression of Rsu1 in ics G4 ;UAS-Rsu1 flies (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>.</s><s>Like the WT, these flies showed no naïve ethanol preference, but unlike the WT, they did not acquire ethanol preference over the 4-d span of the experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref>).</s><s>To confirm that loss of Rsu1 from the MB caused this lack of acquired ethanol preference, we knocked down Rsu1 expression specifically in adult MB.</s><s>Using a mifepristone-inducible MB-GeneSwitch driver (28), we found that adult expression of both UAS-Rsu1-RNAi and UAS-Rac1 CA overexpression led to a complete loss of ethanol preference (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>).</s><s>Together, our data show that flies globally lacking Rsu1 display high naïve preference that does not change over time.</s><s>Conversely, flies lacking Rsu1 only in the MB show neither naïve nor acquired preference.</s><s>Both are in contrast to WT flies, which show no naïve preference but gradually acquire preference in the CAFÉ assay over a few days.</s><s>Flies lacking Rsu1 in the MB only showed normal ethanol-induced sedation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5D</ref>).</s><s>These findings indicate that naïve responses to ethanol, such as naïve preference and sensitivity to sedation, are mediated by Rsu1 in neurons outside the MB, whereas within the MB, Rsu1 is essential for gradual acquisition of preference.</s></p><p><s>RSU1 Genotypes Are Associated with Reward Anticipation and Alcohol Consumption in Human Adolescents.</s><s>We next sought to translate our Drosophila findings to humans.</s><s>Alcohol drinking activates the reward system, and alcohol preference and drinking behavior are associated with reward anticipation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s>Reward anticipation can be reliably measured during the monetary incentive delay (MID) task <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, where subjects must press a button on seeing an object on the screen.</s><s>The form of the object determines whether subjects can accrue a large, small, or no monetary win if pressing the button in time.</s><s>To test a possible association of SNPs in human RSU1 with reward anticipation, we measured brain activation with functional MRI blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during the MID task.</s><s>We first conducted neuroimaging analyses in 1,303 adolescents of the IMAGEN cohort who were assessed at age 14 y old.</s><s>We observed extensive activation in the brain comparing the anticipation of a large win with no win, including in the VS, a region crucial for reward processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>In this region of interest, we detected an association of the minor T allele of rs7078011 in RSU1 with increased VS activation, which remained significant after controlling for the 70 SNPs present at the RSU1 locus in the IMAGEN dataset (P 10,000permutation = 0.046) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6A</ref>).</s><s>However, we did not detect association of rs7078011 with frequency of lifetime drinking at 14 y old in the IMAGEN sample.</s><s>Because rs7078011 is localized in the seventh intron of human RSU1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6B</ref>), we hypothesized that it may be a marker for an unidentified linked causal variant in the vicinity.</s><s>Of 70 SNPs identified in RSU1, 22 SNPs were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs7078011.</s><s>These SNPs covered the eighth exon of the gene (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6B</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S6</ref>).</s><s>To investigate if rare variants are present in the gene locus covered by these SNPs, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data of the eighth exon in reference datasets (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and 1000 Genomes Phase III).</s><s>Here, we detected several rare variants (minor allele frequency &lt; 1%) with a predicted disruption of protein function.</s><s>These variants are either missense [i.e., rs144428707 (SNP), rs375646999 (SNP), rs375416941 (SNP), rs372364335 (SNP), and rs199904406 (SNP)] (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) or splicing related [i.e., rs373104238 (indel)].</s><s>However, our datasets did not have sufficient power to allow stable association analyses of these potentially causative polymorphisms.</s></p><p><s>We, therefore, carried out a linear kernel-based association analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> of the SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs7078011.</s><s>Kernels combine the contribution of genetic variations, thus enabling detection of genetic effects that cannot be represented by a single SNP alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</s><s>Although kernel analyses do not indicate directionality of an association, they are particularly sensitive

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Role of Rsu1 and Integrin Signaling in Ethanol Sensitivity.</s><s>The Rho family of small GTPases is known to regulate ethanol-induced behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, but the upstream pathways that signal to these GTPases in this context are largely unknown.</s><s>In this report, we characterize the effects of ics/RSU1 on ethanol-related behaviors.</s><s>We isolated mutations in the Drosophila ics gene because of their reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation.</s><s>Drosophila Rsu1, like its human homolog RSU1, is a 32-kDa protein with a C-terminal domain that contains seven leucine-rich repeats and binds to the integrin effector PINCH to inhibit JNK signaling.</s><s>In flies, absence of Rsu1 leads to abnormalities during wing development and dorsal closure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the ics mutants that we isolated exhibit wing blisters similar to the ones caused by the loss of integrin, PINCH, and ILK, suggesting that Rsu1 acts in concert with these proteins in integrin-dependent cell adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>Our data indicate that, in the regulation of adult ethanol behaviors, Rsu1 acts downstream of integrin to antagonize integrin signaling, which was suggested by the fact that loss of Rsu1 leads to reduced ethanol sensitivity, whereas loss-of-function mutations of integrin, PINCH, and ILK result in the opposite phenotype: enhanced ethanol sensitivity.</s><s>Thus, Rsu1 has modulatory roles on integrin signaling that are context-dependent.</s><s>During wing development, Rsu1 mediates integrin signaling to antagonize JNK <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, whereas in the adult nervous system, Rsu1 antagonizes integrin signaling to suppress Rac1 activity.</s></p><p><s>Rsu1 Regulates Actin Dynamics.</s><s>We were unable to observe any genetic interaction between Rsu1 and JNK mutants.</s><s>We, therefore, hypothesized that Rsu1 might act through the small Rho family GTPase Rac1 to regulate ethanol-induced behaviors, because depletion of Rsu1 enhanced Rac1 activation and cell migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</s><s>We found that Rsu1 acts upstream of Rac1 to antagonize Rac1 activity in both flies and cell culture.</s><s>Rsu1 coimmunoprecipitated specifically with Rac1 (but not Rho1 or Cdc42) from Drosophila S2 cells but did not show a preference for either GTP-or GDP-bound Rac1.</s><s>Because Rsu1 does not contain a potential Rac-inactivating, GTPase-activating (GAP) domain, we hypothesize that Rsu1 prevents Rac1 from interacting with its relevant activators and/or effectors, possibly by sequestering them or occluding binding sites within Rac1.</s><s>We show that normal ethanol-induced behaviors, including sedation sensitivity and consumption preference, require proper Rsu1 and Rac1 function in the adult nervous system.</s><s>Together, our findings suggest that integrin signals to Rac1 through Rsu1 to regulate actin dynamics, which is known to be required for proper synaptic function <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref> as well as behavioral responses to drugs of abuse <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>It also establishes integrin/Rsu1 as an important functional input into the regulation of actin dynamics with behaviorally manifest consequences.</s><s>Involvement of Rsu1 in Higher Behaviors.</s><s>Our further characterization revealed different behavioral roles for Rsu1 in anatomically distinct neuronal circuits.</s><s>For normal naïve responses to ethanol, Rsu1 functions in the nervous system outside of the MB.</s><s>Absence of Rsu1 from these non-MB neurons resulted in reduced sensitivity to ethanol-induced sedation as well as naïve preference for ethanol in a choice assay.</s><s>In contrast, loss of Rsu1 in MB led to normal naïve ethanol sedation sensitivity and consumption preference but caused a failure to acquire ethanol preference, suggesting that activated Rac1 in the MB prevents this behavioral plasticity.</s><s>Indeed, when we overexpressed Rac1 CA in adult MB, the flies failed to acquire ethanol preference.</s><s>Conversely, flies lacking Rsu1 throughout the brain showed high naïve ethanol preference, suggesting that activation of Rac1 outside the MB promotes naïve preference.</s><s>Thus, Rsu1 has opposite effects on ethanol preference depending on the affected circuits.</s><s>Such opposite effects are reminiscent of mouse findings, where suppression of Rac1 in the nucleus accumbens promoted conditioned place preference (CPP) for cocaine <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, whereas global Kalirin7 KO (a Rac1 activator) led to reduced cocaine CPP <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</s><s>Our data expand on these findings by showing that (i) similar to mammals, gene function in distinct circuits can differentially affect drug preference in Drosophila, (ii) in addition to Kalirin7-mediated activation, integrin/Rsu1-regulated suppression is an important input into Rac1 regulation, and (iii) we extend the mouse Rac1 findings from effects on cocaine-mediated reinforcement (in CPP) to voluntary drug/alcohol consumption in both Drosophila and humans.</s></p><p><s>Previous studies have shown a remarkable conservation of genetic determinants of alcohol and substance use behavior across both species <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s>We investigated whether RSU1 was involved in human reward processing and alcohol-drinking behaviors, including addiction, by analyzing several datasets, including the IMAGEN adolescent imaging genetics cohort <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, the SAGE alcohol dependence dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>, and the NFBC1966 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</s><s>Like most other large genetic datasets, these samples have been analyzed in various different projects.</s><s>Repeat analysis raises the question of a potentially greater false-positive rate, because correction for multiple testing is usually confined to the number of tests within one project.</s><s>Although an increased risk for falsepositives is a real possibility, we have mitigated it by (i) testing a very specific hypothesis, which has been experimentally supported in the Drosophila studies presented, and (ii) validating our results across different independent datasets.</s></p><p><s>Because we were interested in investigating the genetic basis of mechanisms that convey increased risk for alcohol-drinking behavior, we first analyzed the population-based IMAGEN sample of 14-y-old adolescents who did not meet criteria for AUDs.</s><s>In this sample, a generic reward stimulus as presented in the MID task might be more salient and a more reliable activator of the reward system than alcohol-specific cues.</s><s>Using this approach, we first carried out single-SNP analyses to identify a marker for the strongest genetic signal for VS activation during reward anticipation in the RSU1 gene.</s><s>This analysis resulted in the detection of the association of VS activation during reward anticipation but not frequency of lifetime drinking with SNP rs7078011 localized in intron 7 of RSU1.</s></p><p><s>We hypothesized that rs7078011 might be a marker of potentially causative rare genetic variants.</s><s>Indeed, analyzing wholegenome sequencing data, we detected several rare variants in the genomic locus delineated by 22 SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs7078011 that probably impair protein function of Rsu1.</s><s>Although our datasets were underpowered to carry out a genetic association analysis of the rare variants detected, we were able to carry out a kernel-based association analysis with these 22 SNPs.</s><s>Using the kernel method, we confirmed the association of RSU1 with VS activation during reward anticipation in the IMAGEN dataset, and we also found an association of the RSU1 kernel with frequency of lifetime drinking in the same sample.</s><s>The fact that the association of rs7078011 with the investigated phenotypes was less stable than the association of the kernel is in keeping with the possibility of rare variants underlying the observed associations.</s><s>When rare causal variants are present, their linkage disequilibrium with noncausal SNPs with higher frequencies might vary from sample to sample.</s><s>This variability can be caused by recurrent rare mutations or admixture of populations with different genetic backgrounds.</s><s>It is, thus, possible that the same rare variant can be linked with different alleles in different samples.</s><s>Such differential linkage could lead to falsenegative findings if only the same SNP was analyzed.</s><s>Alternatively, different rare variants within the observed gene locus might associate with different phenotypes under study.</s><s>Using a kernel analysis allowed us to overcome these problems.</s></p><p><s>Our kernel analyses in additional independent datasets revealed an association of RSU1 with adult alcohol dependence but not with adult drinking behavior in a general population sample.</s><s>Because early substance use in adolescents is a risk factor for adult alcohol dependence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>, these results might indicate that the effect of Rsu1 on reward processing influences a risk drinking trajectory at very early stages of exposure to alcohol.</s><s>However, one limitation of our study is that it is not possible to unambiguously rule out an association of adult alcohol drinking in the population with RSU1.</s><s>The markedly different LD structure of RSU1 in the NFBC1966 cohort might have masked an association of the kernel.</s><s>The observed nominal association of the RSU1 haplotype 4 with the amount of drinking might, indeed, indicate a weak signal in this locus.</s></p><p><s>The haplotypes included in the kernel are distributed around exon 8, which encodes one of seven leucine-rich repeats found in the Rsu1 protein that are crucial for its interaction with PINCH1 (48).</s><s>In human glioma cells, an alternative splicing site has been described, which gives rise to an exon 8-deleted splice variant of RSU1 translating into a less stable protein with reduced function <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that the rare variants detected might result in an impaired interaction of Rsu1 protein with PINCH and/or decreased protein stability.</s><s>Such decreases might disrupt Rsu1 function in a way analogous to the knockdown of Rsu1 in Drosophila, causing the alcohol preference phenotype.</s><s>However, additional investigations are required to analyze the effect of these variants on Rsu1 function and test their association with alcohol drinking in large metaanalyses.</s></p><p><s>Together, our data show that Rsu1 regulates reward-related behaviors, such as ethanol consumption, in flies and humans.</s><s>We found no structural abnormalities associated with Rsu1 variants in either flies or humans but show that Rsu1 is required after development in adult flies for normal ethanol-induced behaviors.</s><s>Our data from both species are, therefore, highly concordant.</s><s>We hypothesize that the physiological process underlying these phenotypes is synaptic plasticity.</s><s>In the integrin/Rsu1/Rac1 signaling cascade, both integrin (50) and Rac1 (13) are known to affect synaptic structure and plasticity.</s><s>Our findings, thus, underscore the use of model organisms.</s><s>For one, they are useful in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of genes mediating addiction-like behaviors.</s><s>Also, they show remarkable predictive power with unbiased forward genetic screens in generating testable hypotheses that can be translated to human phenotypes.</s></p></div>
