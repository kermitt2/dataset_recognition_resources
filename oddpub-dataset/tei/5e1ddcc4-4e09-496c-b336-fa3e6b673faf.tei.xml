<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>Over the past decade, at least 25 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that Internet interventions can reduce depression symptoms among program users and thereby contribute to improving the quality of care for persons with unipolar depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andersson and Cuijpers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Andrews and Titov, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Andrews et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Barak et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cuijpers et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Johansson and Andersson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Richards and Richardson, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>Consensus seems to be emerging that welldesigned depression-focussed Internet interventions are efficacious, and that more relevant research challenges now concern the identification of moderators and mediators, health economic evaluations, the transfer of interventions to routine care settings, and exploring combinations of Internet interventions with pharmaceutical or face-to-face psychotherapeutic treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andersson and Titov, 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>This positive appraisal of the research evidence has been expressed enthusiastically in recent years <ref type="bibr">(Andrews and Titov, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Titov, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kazdin and Blase, 2011)</ref>, although it is not shared by all.</s><s>For example, a recent review noted several methodological shortcomings plaguing this field, including the scarcity of non-inferiority comparisons with established treatments, the absence of valid diagnostic procedures and outcome assessments beyond self-report, and the predominant focus on short-term effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Arnberg et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, most currently studied interventions come from a small number of countries, particularly from research groups in Sweden, Australia, and the Netherlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Arnberg et al., 2014)</ref>, although others may be catching up.</s></p><p><s>Questions also remain with regard to the merit of purely stand-alone interventions, which are typically associated with smaller effect sizes, compared to programs that are accompanied by personal support (e.g., "blended", "guided", or "supported" online interventions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Johansson and Andersson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Richards and Richardson, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>As Kazdin and Blase remarked <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kazdin and Blase, 2011)</ref>, though, "the arbiter of the value of a treatment is not necessarily in its effect size … but where that intervention fits into a broader portfolio to help reduce the burden of mental illness" (p.</s><s>29).</s><s>Conceivably, unsupported or minimally supported interventions could also play a useful role, especially when combined with available treatments, although little research has addressed this issue.</s><s>Interestingly, recent research also suggests that the effectiveness of unsupported interventions can be enhanced by integrating automated forms of support, such as regular reminder e-mails <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Titov et al., 2013)</ref>, so there are several good reasons for continuing to investigate such programs.</s><s>Our goal in this study, therefore, was to further examine the benefits of an unsupported version of an Internetbased depression intervention in a trial that has several methodological improvements over earlier studies.</s></p><p><s>In previous work, members of our research group have developed and examined a depression-focussed Internet intervention that has been studied in three published RCTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berger et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Meyer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moritz et al., 2012)</ref>: the Deprexis program.</s><s>We regard the results from these trials as encouraging, particularly when compared with other "self-guided" (i.e., unsupported) Internet interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cuijpers et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>The Deprexis program is primarily cognitive-behavioural in content focus but also includes integrative elements, such as acceptance and mindfulness, interpersonal relatedness, positive psychology, and the facilitation of basic psychological needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Meyer et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It can be deployed both in an unsupported <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Meyer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moritz et al., 2012)</ref> or a supported version <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berger et al., 2011)</ref>, which allows clinicians to track program use and symptom trajectories in order to intervene accordingly.</s><s>There is a need to replicate the program's effects in methodologically stringent trials, as previous studies have suffered from shortcomings such as lack of diagnostic interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Meyer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Moritz et al., 2012)</ref>, small sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Berger et al., 2011)</ref>, or high attrition rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Meyer et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>There is also a need to examine in more detail whether Internet interventions such as Deprexis are particularly beneficial for certain patient groups, such as those with milder versus more severe symptoms or with versus without concurrent treatment.</s><s>Although Internet-based depression interventions are often regarded as an appropriate first step primarily for persons presenting with mild to moderate symptoms (National Institute for <ref type="bibr">Health and Clinical Excellence, 2009)</ref>, evidence from a patient-level meta-analysis suggests that more severely depressed patients might derive greater benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bower et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>For severely depressed patients, personally supported rather than standalone Internet interventions may seem like a more suitable option, though, not only for ethical and safety reasons but also because they have been found to produce larger effects, on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Johansson and Andersson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Richards and Richardson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Berger et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>However, we believe that it is also important to examine the effects of online interventions that are offered without support among the severely depressed, for several reasons: Firstly, interventions that do not require personal support resources can be offered reliably and efficiently to large numbers of people in need, even when resources are scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kazdin and Blase, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Secondly, whereas it may be hard to tease apart which aspects of "guided treatments" are responsible for any observed clinical benefits (i.e., the quality or extent of support, the therapeutic relationship, or the software itself), studying unsupported treatments offers the possible methodological advantage of clear causal interpretability.</s><s>Thirdly, many people with severe depression already receive some form of treatment involving personal contactperhaps as many as 80% in Europe <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(McCracken et al., 2006)</ref> so it seems relevant to ask whether offering an Internet intervention as an additional tool might have an incremental or synergistic effect when combined with treatments patients already receive.</s></p><p><s>The goal of the present trial, then, was to examine the effects of the Deprexis program among adults screened for severe depression symptoms in a moderately sized pragmatic RCT.</s><s>A large and publically funded RCT (N1000 participants) focussing on the program's effects among people with mild to moderate depression symptoms is currently underway (the EVIDENT trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Klein et al., 2013)</ref>).</s><s>However, participants with severe symptoms were not admitted for participation in that trial, even though Internet interventions may be most beneficial among more severely depressed persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bower et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, the present trial was initiated for those who had expressed interest in participating in the EVIDENT trial but did not meet inclusion criteria due to scoring above the severity threshold on a screening questionnaire, as described below.</s></p><p><s>As a pragmatic trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zwarenstein et al., 2008)</ref>, the present RCT aimed to test whether offering Deprexis to this group, above and beyond any to standard care they might receive, would reduce depression severity at a greater rate than what would be observed without this program (i.e. in a control group).</s><s>We also aimed to examine secondary outcomes, including anxiety, somatic symptoms, and health-related quality of life, and to examine whether early perceptions of program helpfulness would predict pre-post symptom reduction.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Procedure and study design</head><p><s>This was a parallel-group pragmatic randomized controlled trial.</s><s>Participants were randomized to two groups: (1) Care-as-usual (CAU) or (2) CAU plus the Internet intervention (i.e.</s><s>access to the Deprexis program for 3 months).</s><s>Participants randomized to the treatment group were invited to use the online intervention without guidance or support.</s><s>That is, there was no contact between participants and studyrelated personnel, with the exception of the pre-randomization telephone-administered diagnostic screening interview.</s><s>This design was chosen because it allowed us to evaluate the intervention effect in relatively pure form, without the potential boost conferred by personal support or the therapeutic relationship, while retaining the advantage of collecting valid diagnostic information from a structured interview.</s></p><p><s>Diagnostic status (presence of current Major Depressive Episode (MDE) or Dysthymic Disorder (DD) according to DSM-IV criteria) was determined with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lecrubier et al., 1997)</ref>), which was administered via telephone by trained interviewers with a university degree in psychology who were in advanced professional training to become licensed psychotherapists.</s><s>The MINI has been shown to be an efficient tool that can help improve the accuracy of diagnoses, compared to routine physician diagnoses, which are often unreliable <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pinninti et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mitchell et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>The MINI was also used to confirm the absence of clinical exclusion criteria (likely diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, or suicidality).</s><s>To ensure patient safety, a personal emergency plan was also discussed with each participant during the telephone interview.</s><s>That is, emergency contact options were discussed, including the contact details of local psychiatrists, physicians and clinics, as well as emergency telephone hotlines.</s></p><p><s>Randomization was conducted with an allocation schedule of random numbers that was created by a computerized random number generator.</s><s>Participants who were deemed eligible after the telephone interview were consecutively placed on this list by one of the researchers (J.B.), who did not conduct telephone interviews and did not have contact with or knowledge of individual study participants.</s><s>Participants were informed of the outcome of the randomization by a standard e-mail, in which those in the treatment condition received their access voucher that enabled them to log onto the intervention and use it freely (without time-limit and at no cost) for a subsequent 90 day period.</s></p><p><s>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the German Psychological Association (DGPs, reference number SM 042012_amd_122012), and the trial was entered in an international trials registry (NCT02178631 at ClinicalTrials.gov).</s><s>Before providing consent, all participants received written information about the aims and procedures used in the study and were informed that they could withdraw at any point without negative consequences.</s><s>The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki <ref type="bibr">(World Medical Association, 2001)</ref> and took place between 02/2013 and 04/2014.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The present study aimed to test the effectiveness of the Deprexis program among adults presenting with depression symptoms in the severe range, most of whom were receiving heterogeneous forms of concurrent treatment.</s><s>Of note, we examined the effects of an Internet intervention without personal support in a population that is comparatively difficult to treat, given the elevated symptom severity levels and high rates of depression chronicity as well as early onset.</s><s>The main findings were: (1) that the effectiveness of Deprexis over a 3-month period, delivered without personal program support, could be replicated, compared to a CAU control condition; (2) that effects on secondary outcomes such as somatic symptoms and quality of life were weaker, with the exception of significant effects on anxiety in per-protocol analyses (marginally significant in ITT analyses); (3) that the treatment effects on depression severity could be largely maintained up to six months, although group differences were smaller at that point, (4) that concurrent antidepressant use might moderate the effects of the intervention, such that substantial benefit may occur among patients on antidepressants who use Deprexis as an adjunctive treatment tool.</s><s>Additionally, we replicated previous findings by showing a high level (around 80%) of patient satisfaction with the program.</s><s>We also showed for the first time that perceptions of early alliance/helpfulness after an average of three weeks could predict treatment response over 3 months quite powerfully, even when controlling for early symptom reduction.</s></p><p><s>We interpret these findings as further evidence supporting the specific effects of the Deprexis program on its intended outcome: depression reduction.</s><s>There was also evidence for sustained effects after treatment discontinuation (i.e. group differences when the post-treatment to 6 month follow-up period was examined), although the differences between the treatment and control group were smaller at that point, and responder analyses revealed few significant group differences at follow-up.</s><s>Several explanations may be invoked for these smaller differences at follow-up: Firstly, Deprexis usage was limited to a 90 day period.</s><s>Our findings suggest that this may be too brief and should perhaps be changed to a longer period, at least for severely depressed individuals.</s><s>Secondly, we note that even at 6 months, between-group effect sizes in the small to medium range were observed for the primary outcome (i.e. between 0.20 and 0.50).</s><s>Thirdly, it is important to note that large improvements were observed among control participants, which may be explained, in part, by regression to the mean, although other processes (e.g.</s><s>differential treatment-seeking) may also be involved.</s><s>Indeed, it seems reasonable to expect that control participants would actively seek treatment when symptoms do not improve over time, particularly in a country such as Germany, where a great variety of inpatient and outpatient treatment services are available at no direct cost to patients (i.e.</s><s>covered by mandatory health insurance) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gaebel et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the equivalence of the treatment and control groups over longer periods cannot be assumed, and future investigations should attempt to disentangle how differential treatment utilization might influence symptom trajectories over time.</s></p><p><s>In summary, though, these results replicate previous findings by demonstrating that considerable rates of depression reduction appear to occur as a consequence of using the program, with effect sizes closely resembling those observed in previous trials.</s><s>The findings also suggest that the benefit of the program is particularly strong if combined with antidepressant medication (or possibly with psychotherapy).</s><s>These findings suggest, then, that Deprexis is an effective Internet-based psychological intervention for adults reporting depression symptoms in the severe range.</s><s>Given that several previous trials have shown similar effects, the effects associated with this program can be considered robust, in our opinion.</s><s>Among participants who engaged with the program with reasonable intensity (at least four sessions and at least one hour), clinically meaningful symptom reductions of at least 5 points on the PHQ-9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kroenke et al., 2010)</ref> were observed in nearly 2 out of 3 cases at post-treatment, even though such change also occurred in the control condition in about 1 out of 3 cases.</s></p><p><s>An intriguing preliminary finding was that effects were particularly strong among those who were on concurrent antidepressants and used the program as an adjunctive treatment tool.</s><s>We can only speculate about explanations for this finding.</s><s>One potential explanation is that participants on antidepressants who participated in this trial were disenchanted with the effects of their medication and, therefore, strongly desired additional help.</s><s>Once they received it from the online intervention, they may have benefitted particularly strongly.</s><s>Another possible explanation is that simultaneously receiving antidepressants and engaging with cognitive-behavioural techniques produces synergistic effects.</s><s>For example, antidepressants can improve hippocampal function, which facilitates learning and thus may potentiate the effects produced by cognitive-behavioural interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Craighead, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>It remains to be seen, though, whether this interaction effect can be replicated and, if so, whether broader dissemination of the program as an adjunct to antidepressant medication or psychotherapy is a feasible dissemination avenue.</s><s>Such combinations of Internet-based and conventional treatments are regarded as promising future directions by many <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Andersson and Titov, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, the question of when, how, and for whom psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions should be combined is a topic of considerable research interest, and evidence currently supports the idea that chronically depressed patients, in particular, may benefit more than others from combination treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Craighead, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Clearly, the ways in which software-based as well as face-to-face psychological interventions should be combined with pharmacotherapy deserve further research attention.</s></p><p><s>Our findings also showed that program users seem to develop a good sense early on of how helpful the intervention will eventually be for them, even as early as three weeks after first logging on.</s><s>Early alliance/helpfulness ratings predicted outcome rather powerfully, consistent with decades of psychotherapy research suggesting that the alliance between patients and therapists is a robust predictor of outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Martin et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>An emerging literature is examining the role of the alliance in Internet-based treatments, although most studies have focussed on interventions in which personal support is included, and findings so far seem mixed, with the alliance sometimes predicting outcome and sometimes only weakly or not at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Knaevelsrud and Maercker, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Andersson et al., 2012b)</ref>.</s><s>Our findings suggest that exploring early impressions of perceived fit, helpfulness or common ground between patients' perceptions and the program's approach might be fruitful.</s><s>Previous research suggests that early alliance ratings might reflect, in part, early symptom change or baseline patient characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Webb et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Klein et al., 2003)</ref>; however, it is noteworthy that alliance ratings predicted pre-post symptom reduction even when controlling for baseline symptom severity and early symptom change.</s><s>We acknowledge that the "alliance" between a program user and a software-program is not equivalent with the human alliance or emotional bond emerging between a patient and his or her therapist.</s><s>Instead, what we measured with the adapted HAQ-11 may reflect users' sense of perceived helpfulness, plausibility and personal fitand these early impressions appear to be good predictors of ultimate clinical benefit, even if they are not synonymous with the concept of the therapeutic alliance between two persons.</s></p><p><s>Several strengths as well as limitations of the trial ought to be noted.</s><s>Among the strengths, diagnoses were confirmed with a validated structured interview, study attrition rate was low (b20%) 2 , intervention uptake was good (80% of those who logged on received what we consider to be a minimally sufficient "dose"), and the study included a sample that was larger than many other trials in this field.</s><s>However, limitations must be kept in mind, including limited power to detect small to moderate effects, the limited ability to ensure equivalence between the control and treatment groups over a longer period of time, lack of outcome ratings beyond self-reports, relatively short follow-up period, and the attenuated baseline depression range due to the high initial inclusion criterion.</s><s>Some of these limitations will be rectified in the much larger EVIDENT trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Klein et al., 2013)</ref>, although that trial targets mild to moderate depressive symptoms.</s><s>Other Deprexis studies are underway (e.g., see ClinicalTrials.gov:</s><s>ISRCTN20165665 and NCT01663649 or German Clinical Trials Register [www.drks.de]:</s><s>DRKS00003564), which may shed further light on questions such as moderation and mediation of effects, optimal deployment settings, and robustness of effects when using rater-based measures and considering longer follow-up periods.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, we believe that these findings contribute to the literature by replicating and extending effects of an Internet-based depression intervention and by examining moderators and response predictors, such as concurrent treatment and early perceived helpfulness.</s><s>More research is needed to address remaining methodological limitations and to improve our understanding of the psychological and biological mechanisms that explain how the kinds of treatment effects we observed unfold.</s></p><p><s>2 Attrition was much lower in the present trial than one might expect for unsupported Internet interventions.</s><s>At least two explanations for this seem plausible: Firstly, pretreatment diagnostic interviews are rare in trials with unguided interventions, but they were used here and may have bolstered commitment to participate <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Johansson and Andersson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Berger et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Secondly, the relationship between depression severity and attrition perhaps deserves research attention because the high symptom load among more severely depressed participants might motivate them to use the intervention more, and complete assessments more diligently, than might be true for their less depressed counterparts.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig.
