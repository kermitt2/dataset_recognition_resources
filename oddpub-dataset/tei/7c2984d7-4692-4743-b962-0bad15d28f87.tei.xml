<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Response Facilitation Can Serve as a Possible Measure of Multisensory Integration</head><p><s>Stimulus detection, on average, is faster and more accurate in situations where the target is presented redundantly, i.e., on several sensory channels.</s><s>In the multisensory literature, this facilitation is commonly called redundant-targets effect (RTE) or redundant-signals effect (RSE); both terms are largely used synonymously.</s><s>In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these effects of multisensory processing exclusively as redundantsignals effects.</s><s>The response speedup is commonly explained by assuming that an internal decision criterion is reached faster when multiple targets are presented simultaneously, compared to the single-target situation.</s><s>Similarly, redundant information reduces stimulus ambiguity, hence allowing for a higher accuracy of responses.</s></p><p><s>However, RSEs can result from statistical facilitation merely due to probability summation alone.</s><s>A popular probability summation model was introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Raab (1962)</ref> with the idea of a race between parallel single-target detection processes during a multiple-target situation.</s><s>The process finishing first "wins the race, " elicits a response, and, therefore, determines the behavioral response time.</s><s>These so-called race models operate according to a separate-activation model with a first-terminating stopping rule (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Colonius and Vorberg, 1994)</ref>.</s><s>They implicitly assume unlimited-capacity processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Colonius, 1990)</ref>, meaning that the speed of one detection process is not influenced by other, simultaneous, detection processes.</s><s>For example, detection of a unimodal target should happen at the same speed as detection of the same target in a multimodal situation.</s><s>Therefore, if RT distributions of the single-target detection processes overlap, the observed RTs in redundant-target trials will, on average, be faster than the unimodal RTs.</s><s>"Slow" responses of one singletarget detection process can be replaced by "faster" responses of another, simultaneous detection process.</s><s>The observed RT speedup would thus be a statistical artifact only.</s><s>In sum, an RSE that can be fully accounted for by a race model does not provide strong evidence for multisensory integration.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, integration can be inferred if RTs are faster than predicted by race models.</s><s>Specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Miller (1982)</ref> derived an upper bound to the bimodal RT speedup possible in any race model, the so-called race model inequality (RMI) or Miller bound.</s><s>It is based on the assumption of maximum negative dependence between the channel processing speeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Colonius, 1990)</ref>, that is, if the participant detects a signal on one channel at a given bimodal trial, the other channel will fail to detect the target.</s><s>Violations of this criterion, i.e., faster responses than predicted by the RMI, support coactivation models.</s><s>They demand that processing of different sensory channels be pooled prior to the decision stage and therefore refute all race models in favor of "true" multisensory integration.</s><s>Satisfaction of the RMI, on the contrary, does not necessarily exclude coactive processing.</s></p><p><s>Numerous studies have investigated response facilitation to bimodal stimuli in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gielen et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Miller, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Forster et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Diederich and Colonius, 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Whether the combined presentation of congruent (that is, redundant) visual-olfactory information can likewise facilitate object perception remains unclear and was investigated with the present study.</s><s>Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that bimodal visual-olfactory object identification is facilitated compared to identification of either of the unimodal constituents alone.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, we examined whether facilitation is more pronounced for perceptually aligned compared to physically aligned stimuli.</s><s>For this, we conducted two experiments in which the bimodal constituents were either presented physically (Experiment 1) or perceptually (Experiment 2) simultaneously.</s><s>We compared the observed RTs and response accuracies to the predictions of different models of probability summation.</s></p></div>
