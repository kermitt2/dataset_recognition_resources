<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p><s>Participants were national coordinators, families with disabled children, and professionals providing services for disabled children.</s><s>National coordinators were asked to provide email contacts for leads of professional networks working with disabled children as well as of families' and disabled young people's networks to enable dissemination of links to the surveys.</s><s>National coordinators were also asked to indicate in which languages these surveys were required.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey dissemination and sampling</head><p><s>Preliminary translations of the surveys for professionals and families were from English into 25 languages using Google auto-translate.</s><s>Translated surveys were then validated by student volunteers from the University of Sunderland and by EACD contacts who were fluent in the appropriate language.</s><s>The survey questions were uploaded on to online survey software (www.surveygizmo.com)</s><s>by the second author.</s><s>Using non-probability convenience sampling, all surveys were shared via member organizations of disabled young people, parent carers, and professionals who agreed to collaborate with the EACD by sharing the survey links with their members.</s><s>Participation was entirely voluntary and consent implied by participation.</s><s>The chair of the Sunderland National Research Ethics Committee advised no further ethical permission was required.</s><s>National coordinators who did not return a completed survey within 1 month were sent a reminder from the chair of EACD (GC).</s></p><p><s>The professionals' and families' survey links were open for 3 months from December 2016.</s><s>Each week, charts of response rates from families and professionals by country were sent to national coordinators to stimulate interest and encourage further responses.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary of the main findings</head><p><s>Whilst this study set out to examine the impact of austerity on the experiences of families and professionals, one of the main findings was that regardless of austerity, families with disabled children and professionals caring for them across Europe reported that care has declined in recent years.</s><s>Professionals working with families with disabled children reported cuts to services, increased waiting times, and less time allocated to see each child compared to 3 years ago.</s><s>More than half of professionals reported worse working conditions in the last year.</s><s>Worse working conditions were significantly more commonly described by professionals from countries in austerity than from countries without austerity, as were observations of direct and indirect impact of austerity cuts.</s><s>Quality targets for services for disabled children were more likely to be met in countries without austerity than in those where such measures were in place.</s><s>This is despite professionals in countries without austerity reporting a higher mean increase in waiting times compared to 3 years ago than professionals from countries with austerity.</s><s>It is noteworthy, however, that professionals in countries without austerity were more likely to report changes in referral criteria to limit referrals than professionals in countries with austerity, which may be a factor in enabling quality targets to be met.</s></p><p><s>More than nine in every ten families reported worsening quality of services for their disabled children compared to 3 years ago, regardless of austerity.</s><s>Most families reported their disabled child's health, education, and social care needs to be less well met than 10 years ago.</s><s>Families with completely dependent disabled children reported the worst experiences, in terms of how well their needs were met compared to 10 years ago.</s><s>Families from countries with austerity cuts reported more difficult access to welfare support and benefits.</s><s>Whilst more professionals in countries with austerity reported worsening access to social care support than 3 years ago, the views of families were the opposite: families in countries without austerity reported the worst access to social care support.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with other literature</head><p><s>Previous studies evidence variation in outcomes for children linked to socio-economic factors and austerity cuts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as well as variation in aspects of care for disabled children. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19</ref></s><s>Despite systems being in place in England to collect data at the point of care about the multifaceted needs of disabled children, 10 these have not yet been widely adopted in most European countries, so there is still no source of internationally comparable data about the needs or experiences of disabled children and their families.</s></p><p><s>In 2013 as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, the European Commission made a recommendation to invest in children to break the cycle of disadvantage. 20</s><s>Despite UK mortality rates for infants and children being worse over time compared to other European countries, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref> calls by researchers, professional groups, and non-government organizations for children to be prioritized in all policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref> have not yet been acted upon in all countries.</s></p><p><s>8]<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref> These changes are likely to shift the perceptions of families and professionals about service availability and quality.</s><s>Reports from these and other countries reporting no austerity were generally more positive than from countries reporting austerity.</s></p><p><s>The Equality and Human Rights Commission has a statutory obligation to regularly report on progress across England, Scotland, and Wales on equality and human rights progress for disabled people. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">23</ref></s><s>In their 2017 report, there is evidence not only of lack of progress, but that things have gone backwards in some areas, leaving disabled people more disadvantaged in UK society, especially those with learning disabilities and mental health conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24</ref></s><s>ore families that include a disabled person live in poverty, and have inadequate access to mental health services, adequate housing, and transport to enable their participation in society and achieve their hopes and dreams.</s><s>The UK, along with many other countries, has signed up to the UN Conventions on the Rights of the Child and Rights of Persons with Disabilities, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">25</ref> which was designed to protect the equal rights to the best outcomes for disabled people.</s><s>However, the Equality and Human Rights Commission 2017 report concludes that, 'It is a badge of shame on our society that millions of disabled people in Britain are still not being treated as equal citizens and continue to be denied the everyday rights non-disabled people take for granted, such as being able to access transport, appropriate health services and housing, or benefit from education and employment'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24</ref></s></p></div>
