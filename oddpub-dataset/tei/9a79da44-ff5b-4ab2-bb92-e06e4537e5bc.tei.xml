<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Time-differentiated targeted temperature management after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTH48) is an international multicentre randomised pragmatic clinical trial.</s><s>It is the first randomised trial to explore the influence of prolonged targeted temperature management (TTM) on neurological outcomes in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients.</s><s>In 2002 two randomized studies demonstrated an effect on cerebral outcome of TTM at 33 °C for respectively 12 and 24 hours following OHCA.</s><s>This led to international guidelines recommendations of the use of TTM.</s><s>Animal studies have demonstrated that cooling for periods longer than 24 hours might even add to the beneficial effect.</s><s>Furthermore in neonates it is good clinical practice to cool patients with anoxic brain injury for 72 hours.</s><s>However we found no human interventional studies comparing different durations of TTM after cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).</s><s>Enrolment of patients began 16 February 2013, and the last of the 355 patients was included 1 June 2016.</s><s>The complete six-month outcome data will be accessible in December 2016.</s><s>The study protocol was published previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>According to good clinical practice, and in order to prevent outcome reporting bias and data-driven analyses, it is recommended to prepare and publish a statistical analysis protocol (SAP) for the main trial before any data analyses are initiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our detailed SAP was formulated while data were still being collected, and it was approved by the trial steering committee.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial overview</head><p><s>The TTH48 trial is an investigator-initiated, international, multicentre, outcome assessor-blinded, parallel group, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing TTM at 33 (+/-1) °C for 24 and 48 hours in OHCA patients.</s></p><p><s>The aim of TTH48 is to compare the effects of prolonged (48 hours) and standard duration (24 hours) of TTM at 33 (±1) °C (TTM33) in comatose OHCA patients.</s><s>Our hypothesis is that 48 hours of TTM results in better neurological outcomes (primary outcome) and lower mortality (secondary outcome) without an increase in adverse effects.</s><s>In line with previous TTM studies, the primary outcome is defined as the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at six months after cardiac arrest, at this time the recovery potential following OHCA induced cerebral injury is fully exploited.</s><s>The study comprises adult comatose patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) suffering from OHCA.</s><s>The published trial protocol (version 6.3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> is available online at http://www.tth48.com</s><s>In total, ten intensive care units (Aarhus, Helsinki, Aalborg, Tallinn, Stavanger, Brussels, Berlin, Copenhagen, Odense and Turku) in six Northern European countries participated in the study.</s><s>The last trial patient was randomised on 1 June 2016.</s><s>The protocol was prepared according to the current version of the Helsinki Declaration (2013) and approved by the local and regional research ethics committees listed in the appendix.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim</head><p><s>To prepare a detailed statistical analyses protocol for the TTH48 trial.</s></p><p><s>We will also predetermine covariates, adjust analyses and select subgroups for analysis, and use the OHCA score, a validated score for predicting poor outcomes after OHCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcome</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary outcome</head><p><s>The primary outcome is the CPC score at six months after cardiac arrest.</s><s>As in the previous TTM trials, good neurological outcomes are defined as CPC scores of 1 or 2, and poor neurologic outcomes are defined as CPC scores of 3, 4 or 5 (death).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary outcomes and adverse events</head><p><s>The secondary outcomes are as follows: 1) mortality within six months after cardiac arrest, 2) CPC score at hospital discharge, 3) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on day 4 after cardiac arrest, 4) adverse event(s), registered on day 4 and at discharge from hospital and defined as the occurrence of one or more events such as cerebral, circulatory, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, metabolic measures, infection or bleeding, 5) progression of GCS from days 1 to 7 in the ICU, 6) GCS score at ICU discharge and hospital discharge and 7) CPC score at 30 and 90 days after cardiac arrest.</s><s>A complete list of adverse events is presented in the previously published protocol paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Power analyses and randomisation</head><p><s>From a clinical point of view we considered an absolute difference of 15% between the treatment groups to be relevant.</s><s>For sample size calculation an equation for comparing two rates was used.</s><s>A centre effect was not taken into account.</s><s>To detect a 15% absolute difference in good outcomes (CPC score of 1 or 2) between the two groups (two-sided) with 80% study power and a 5% significance level (alpha), 169 patients were randomly assigned each group (n = 338).</s><s>To compensate for losses between follow-ups and withdrawals of consent, the sample size was increased by 5% (17 patients) forming a study population of 355 patients.</s><s>The web-based clinical trials management system "TrialPartner" was used for randomization and data collection.</s><s>Patients were assigned (1:1) to the treatment regimens by block randomisation using randomly permuted block sizes of 6,4 and 2 -stratified in terms of trial centre, age (above and below 60 years) and initial rhythm (shockable or nonshockable).</s><s>TrialPartner permits, with a personal log-in, 24 hour randomization.</s><s>All actions in the system are logged.</s><s>The investigators did not know the block sizes.</s><s>Inclusion of patients was stopped on 1 June 2016, resulting in the inclusion of 355 patients.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary outcome</head><p><s>The primary outcome is CPC score at six months after cardiac arrest.</s><s>CPC scores of 1 and 2 indicate good neurological outcomes and scores of 3, 4 or 5 indicate poor neurological outcomes.</s><s>The statistical null hypothesis is that there is no difference in primary outcomes between 24 and 48 hours of TTM.</s><s>This will be tested in the modified ITT population by applying Fisher's exact (or chi-square) test to a 2 × 2 contingency table.</s><s>The primary trial outcome will be reported as an unadjusted ratio with 95% CI and an absolute risk difference with 95% CI.</s><s>Any significant difference in the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) for benefit or harm (with 95% CI) will be reported.</s></p><p><s>The second analysis of the primary outcome data, adjusted for the predetermined baseline covariates, will include all randomised patients who received the intervention and did not withdraw their consent according to the modified ITT principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The third analysis of the primary outcome, adjusted for the predetermined baseline covariates, will include randomised patients who did not violate any major protocols (per-protocol analysis).</s></p><p><s>The fourth analysis of the primary outcome data will be adjusted for pre-specified covariates and any significant imbalance in baseline covariates (P &lt; 0.05).</s></p><p><s>The fifth analysis will be a sensitivity analysis of predefined sub-groups (as described earlier).</s></p><p><s>All of these analyses will use logistic regression models.</s><s>The goodness-of-fit of the logistic regression models will be assessed by graphical diagnostics and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.</s><s>The results will be reported as ORs with 95% CI.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary outcomes Mortality</head><p><s>A time-to-event analysis will be performed for mortality (up to six months after cardiac arrest) using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models and hazard ratios with 95% CI.</s></p></div>
