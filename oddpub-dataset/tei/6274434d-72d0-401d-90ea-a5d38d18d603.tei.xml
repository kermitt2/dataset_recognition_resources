<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patient characteristics</head><p><s>Between January and November 2009, 50 patients with advanced CRPC were screened at 12 centers in Germany and Italy.</s><s>44 patients were eligible, started treatment with CV9103 and were included in the safety population.</s><s>Of these, 12 patients were enrolled in the phase I part of the study and 32 patients in the phase II part.</s><s>Of all patients, 40 (91 %) were evaluable for PSA response and 2 (5 %) for tumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</s><s>At the highest dose level, 33 (86 %) patients were evaluable for immune response analysis.</s><s>Patient baseline characteristics are depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</s><s>36 patients had metastatic disease, including 26 patients evaluable for immune response.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Treatment</head><p><s>During the phase I part, 12 patients received 256 (n = 3), 640 (n = 3), or 1280 μg (n = 6) mRNA.</s><s>In the phase IIa part, another 32 patients were enrolled to receive the recommended dose (RD) of 1280 μg mRNA defined in phase I.</s><s>All 44 patients received at least 2 vaccinations, 31 patients (70 %) received complete treatment with 5 vaccinations (see Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</s><s>5 phase I patients (11 % of total patient population) had a change in dosing, including 3 patients with a dose escalation as permitted by the protocol (1 at 256 μg, 2 at 640 μg).</s><s>Two patients of the highest dose group had dose reductions to 640 μg due to adverse events (AEs; urinary retention, flank pain, and vomiting).</s><s>Reasons for premature treatment discontinuation were disease progression (n = 6), disease progression and possibly related serious adverse events (grade 3 urinary retention, n = 1; grade 3 urinary retention with hydronephrosis, n = 1), unrelated serious adverse events (n = 2), non-compliance (n = 1) and withdrawal of consent (n = 1).</s><s>Within the subgroup of metastatic patients, 4 were treated in the phase I part at 256 μg (n = 2) and 640 μg (n = 2) and 32 in the phase IIa part at 1280 μg mRNA.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety results</head><p><s>Treatment-related AEs were experienced by 39 (89 %) patients, with a total of 282 related AEs reported.</s><s>The most frequent treatment-related side effects were injection site erythema and injection site reaction in 27 (61 %) and 21 (48 %) patients, respectively.</s><s>Fatigue (18 %), pyrexia (16 %), chills (11 %), and influenza-like illness (11 %) were also frequently reported (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>A trend for a dosedependency of these AEs was not observed.</s><s>In general, AEs were manageable and resolved upon therapy.</s></p><p><s>The majority of related AEs were of mild to moderate intensity.</s><s>In 5 (11 %) patients, related AEs of CTCAE grade 3 were reported, including urinary retention (n = 3), vomiting (n = 1), disease progression (n = 1), decreased neutrophil count (n = 1), flank pain (n = 1), confusional state (n = 2), dyspareunia (n = 1), and hydronephrosis (n = 1).</s><s>The decreased neutrophil count (800/μl with a total leucocyte count of 3900/μl) was measured only at the week 5 visit and neutrophils were again within normal range in week 7.</s><s>The patient was otherwise asymptomatic.</s><s>Lifethreatening related AEs (CTCAE grade 4) were not observed.</s><s>One fatal AE was reported for a 68-year old patient with bone metastases and a history of obstructive pulmonary disease and right-sided heart insufficiency.</s><s>He was hospitalized due to disease progression and bronchopneumonia 1 month after having received the 4th vaccination.</s><s>The event was considered possibly treatment related since a relationship to vaccination could not be excluded.</s></p><p><s>A total of 21 serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 9 (20 %) patients, with the most frequent SAEs being urinary retention and anemia in 3 (7 %) patients each and hematuria in 2 (5 %) patients.</s><s>SAEs considered possibly treatment-related were reported in 2 (5 %) of patients (grade 3 urinary retention and grade 3 urinary retention with hydronephrosis) and occurred after the second vaccination.</s><s>The events resolved after symptomatic and antibiotic treatment.</s><s>No adverse events indicating autoimmune reactions were reported.</s></p></div>
