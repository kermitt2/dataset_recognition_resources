<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Population</head><p><s>The cohort consisted of patients newly treated for type 2 diabetes with sulfonylureas in monotherapy between 1 April 1998 and 31 March 2013, with follow-up until 31 March 2014.</s><s>Cohort entry was defined by the date of the first sulfonylurea prescription.</s><s>We excluded all patients ,40 years of age, as well as those with ,1 year of medical history in the CPRD before cohort entry.</s><s>We also excluded patients prescribed other antidiabetic drugs at any time before cohort entry.</s><s>Because this study aimed to be representative of real-world practice, patients with a history of cardiovascular disease at cohort entry were not excluded.</s></p><p><s>Patients meeting the study inclusion criteria were followed until the earliest of the following events: treatment discontinuation, add-on, or switch (defined in detail in EXPOSURE DEFINITION), occurrence of one of the study outcomes (defined in detail in STUDY OUTCOMES), death from any cause, end of registration with the general practice, or end of the study period (31 March 2014).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exposure Definition</head><p><s>Patients were classified into two groups based on the sulfonylurea they initiated: pancreas nonspecific, long-acting sulfonylureas (glyburide and glimepiride), and pancreas-specific, short-acting sulfonylureas (tolbutamide, gliclazide, and glipizide; reference group) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s>Other compounds such as chlorpropamide or gliquidone were excluded becauase of the low number of exposed patients (less than five).</s><s>We used an as-treated exposure definition in which patients were considered continuously exposed if the duration of one prescription overlapped with the date of the subsequent prescription.</s><s>In the event of nonoverlap, we allowed for a 30-day grace period between two successive prescriptions.</s><s>Termination of treatment was therefore defined by either the absence of a new prescription by the end of a 30-day grace period, a switch to a different sulfonylurea group, or an add-on or switch to another antidiabetic drug, whichever came first.</s><s>Switches within the same group of sulfonylureas (e.g., glyburide to glimepiride or vice versa) were permitted.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Outcomes</head><p><s>We considered five outcomes: hospitalization for AMI, hospitalization for ischemic stroke, cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for hypoglycemia.</s><s>Hospitalization for AMI and ischemic stroke were identified using the HES and the ONS databases (AMI ICD-9 codes: 410.x;</s><s>ICD-10 codes: I21.x; ischemic stroke ICD-9 codes: 433.x, 434.x, and 436.x;</s><s>ICD-10 codes: I63.x and I64.x; in primary or secondary position).</s><s>The diagnostic codes to identify AMI in HES have been shown to be highly valid (.90%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, whereas the validity of stroke diagnoses in administrative data is also high (.80%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s>Cardiovascular death was identified in the ONS (underlying cause of death; ICD-9 codes: 390.x-398.x,</s><s>401.x-405.x,</s><s>410.x-417.x,</s><s>420.x-429.x</s><s>[except 427.5], 430.</s><s>x-438.x,</s><s>440.x-447.x;</s><s>and ICD-10 codes: I00.x-I77.x</s><s>[except I46.9]), and all-cause mortality was identified from all three databases.</s><s>Hospitalization for hypoglycemia was identified in HES (ICD-10 code: E16.2; in primary or secondary position).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-Dimensional Propensity Score</head><p><s>For each patient, we used multivariable logistic regression to calculate a highdimensional propensity score (hdPS); this method empirically selects covariates based on their prevalence and potential for confounding <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</s><s>The hdPS defined the probability of being exposed to nonspecific, long-acting sulfonylureas as compared with specific, short-acting sulfonylureas, conditional on several predefined and 500 empirically identified covariates measured at cohort entry.</s></p><p><s>We identified the empirical covariates from seven data dimensions (five dimensions from the CPRD: drug prescriptions, procedures, diagnoses, disease history, and administrative information; and two dimensions form the HES: diagnoses and procedures), whereas the predefined covariates were age, sex, calendar year, duration of diabetes prior to cohort entry (defined as the time since a first diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or an elevated glycated hemoglobin A 1c [HbA 1c ] level [.7.0% or 53 mmol/mol], whichever appeared first in the medical record), alcohol-related disorders (based on diagnoses for alcoholrelated disorders such as alcoholism, alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and failure and other related disorders), smoking status (ever, never, or unknown), BMI category (,25, 25-30, or $30 kg/m 2 or unknown), HbA 1c level (#7% or #53 mmol/mol, 7.1-8.0%</s><s>or 54-64 mmol/mol, .8% or .64</s><s>mmol/mol, or unknown), heart failure, arterial hypertension, thyroid disease, cerebrovascular disease including transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation or flutter, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, previous coronary revascularization, previous myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, anemia, and diabetic complications (neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, and retinopathy).</s><s>We also included the number of hospitalizations in the year prior to cohort entry (0, 1, 2, 3, or $4).</s></p><p><s>In addition, prescriptions for angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, b-blockers, calciumchannel blockers, thiazide, loop or other diuretics, digoxin, statins, fibrates, clopidogrel, warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioid analgesics, acetaminophen, and nitrates in the year prior to cohort entry were assessed.</s><s>We also assessed the overall number of nonantidiabetic drugs in the year prior to cohort entry (0, 1, 2, 3, and $4).</s><s>The hdPS procedure was repeated for each outcome, because this method calculates a bias term that accounts for the association with a specific outcome.</s><s>Patients in nonoverlapping regions of the hdPS were trimmed from the analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p><s>We used descriptive statistics to summarize the characteristics of the patients in the cohort.</s><s>Crude incidence rates of each outcome were calculated with 95% CIs based on the Poisson distribution and expressed as number of events per 1,000 patients per year.</s><s>Moreover, we conducted five separate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models that provided estimates of the hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% CIs for each outcome.</s><s>The models for AMI, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death were adjusted for hdPS deciles as well as for history of the respective outcome (or, in the case of cardiovascular death, history of AMI or ischemic stroke).</s><s>The model for all-cause mortality was adjusted for hdPS deciles.</s><s>The model for severe hypoglycemia was adjusted for hdPS quintiles.</s><s>We also conducted a post hoc secondary analysis assessing the risks of all study outcomes separately for each of the two pancreas nonspecific, long-acting sulfonylureas (i.e., glyburide and glimepiride), given the previously reported pharmacologic differences between the two compounds regarding their effect on ischemic preconditioning and their risk of hypoglycemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity Analyses</head><p><s>We conducted four sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings.</s><s>First, to assess possible exposure misclassification, we repeated the analyses using a 60-day grace period between nonoverlapping successive prescriptions.</s><s>Second, to assess potential informative censoring in the as-treated approach (i.e., to account for the possibility that censoring was related to the outcome), we repeated the analyses using an intentionto-treat approach with a maximum follow-up of 1 year.</s><s>In the intention-totreat approach, patients are assumed to be continuously exposed to their initial treatment for the whole duration of follow-up, regardless of any switching or discontinuation that occurs.</s><s>Third, a sensitivity analysis was conducted after excluding patients receiving tolbutamide, because this first-generation sulfonylurea was shown to be associated with increased mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, the analyses for AMI, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular death, and severe hypoglycemia were repeated after excluding patients with a history of these events.</s><s>All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://www.r-project</s><s>.org/).</s></p></div>

contradicting results <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s>To date, several observational studies have suggested that individual sulfonylureas, and particularly glyburide, possess an increased cardiovascular risk as compared with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>.</s><s>However, methodological limitations, including exposure misclassification, timelag bias, and selection bias, could affect the validity of these results (2).</s><s>Our findings indicate that the binding of glyburide and glimepiride to cardiac and vascular structures, as reported in several preclinical studies (5), does not necessarily translate into an increased risk of ischemic adverse events or cardiovascular death as compared with other pancreas specific sulfonylureas.</s><s>Possible explanations include reduced sulfonylurea concentrations on site (i.e., in cardiomyocytes or vascular smooth cells), thus alleviating the consequences of receptor binding or the existence of competing factors in the cardiovascular system, such as the impact of certain sulfonylureas on atherosclerosis or weight gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Our findings on hypoglycemia are concordant with those of previous clinical trials and observational studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>.</s><s>They also support the hypothesis that   <ref type="formula">23</ref>) compared longacting with short-acting sulfonylureas but did not show a difference in hypoglycemic risk.</s><s>However, in contrast to our study, their outcome definition was based on outpatient diagnoses rather than events leading to hospitalization.</s><s>As their outcome definition likely included a mix of both mild and severe cases of hypoglycemia, direct comparison between the two studies is challenging.</s><s>Moreover, the inclusion of mild hypoglycemia as their outcome definition may have introduced misclassification in the timing of the outcome, resulting in a dilution of the association <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(24)</ref>.</s><s>Indeed, as mild hypoglycemia is generally self-managed by patients, it is possible that the date of the hypoglycemic event recorded is inaccurate.</s><s>Hypoglycemia has been implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular adverse events and all-cause mortality in patients with diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(25)</ref>.</s><s>The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) found severe hypoglycemia to be a predictor of both cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(26)</ref>.</s><s>The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial also indicated that severe hypoglycemia could contribute to cardiovascular adverse events <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(27)</ref>.</s><s>In our study, the increased hypoglycemic risk associated with pancreasnonspecific, long-acting sulfonylureas was not accompanied by an increased cardiovascular or mortality risk, arguing against a major contribution of hypoglycemia in sulfonylurea-related cardiovascular disease or mortality.</s><s>However, the much lower incidence rate of hypoglycemia in our study cohort relative to the rates of the other outcomes could have masked its true impact, thus hampering definite conclusions.</s></p><p><s>Our study has a number of strengths.</s><s>First, it is one of the first studies to group sulfonylureas based on important pharmacodynamic (i.e., specificity to pancreatic b-cells) and pharmacokinetic (i.e., duration of action) properties, thus accounting, at least partly, for the high pharmacologic heterogeneity of this drug class.</s><s>This classification does not consider the varying effects of the two pancreas-nonspecific sulfonylureas (i.e., glyburide and glimepiride) on ischemic preconditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</s><s>However, we did consider this phenomenon in a secondary analysis, in which the risks of all study outcomes were assessed separately for glyburide and glimepiride, and found a similar risk profile.</s><s>Second, the population-based design, the inclusion of patients with previous events, and the few exclusion criteria make its results highly generalizable.</s><s>Third, the definition of hypoglycemia was based on solely hospitalization-associated events, which likely maximized the specificity of this outcome definition.</s></p><p><s>Our study also has some limitations.</s><s>First, because of its observational nature, there is potential for residual confounding.</s><s>However, the application of a new user design with an active comparator and the use of robust statistical adjustment such as the hdPS likely minimized this potential bias.</s><s>Second, the result for hypoglycemia in our sensitivity analysis using an intention-to-treat approach was attenuated and no longer statistically significant.</s><s>Although a dilution of the effect is a potential limitation of such analyses, the existence of informative censoring in our primary analysis cannot be ruled out.</s><s>Third, the results of this study are generalizable to the use of sulfonylureas as firstline treatment; further research is needed to evaluate the safety of sulfonylureas when used as second-or third-line treatment.</s><s>Fourth, because of the relatively short follow-up of the study, it is not possible to exclude long-term differences in risks in cardiovascular and mortality outcomes between the two groups.</s><s>In summary, our population-based cohort study showed no difference in the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality between pancreas-nonspecific and pancreas-specific sulfonylureas, thereby contradicting previous studies and arguing that the clinical implications of the lack of pancreas specificity of certain sulfonylureas may have been overstated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr">29)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, it corroborates the previously reported increased risk of severe hypoglycemia associated with long-acting sulfonylureas as compared with shortacting compounds.</s><s>The sponsors were not directly involved in the design and conduct of the study; the collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; or the preparation, review, or
