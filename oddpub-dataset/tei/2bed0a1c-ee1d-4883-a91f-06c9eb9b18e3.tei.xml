control cells had undergone an average of 3.9 cell divisions, whereas the two groups of cyclin A2 knockdown cells (sh4 and sh5 cultures) completed 3.6 and 3.1 divisions, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>).</s><s>This observation suggests that the terminal cell division is impaired in cells with reduced levels of cyclin A2.</s><s>Next, we pulse-labeled the cultured cells with 5-ethynyl-2' deoxyuridine (EdU), a modified nucleoside that gets incorporated into newly synthesized DNA, to assess cell cycle progression.</s><s>There was no significant difference between knockdown and control cells at 24 hours (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>); as expected the majority of cells were in S phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>At 48 hours ~70% of control cells had exited the cell cycle and were in the G0/G1 state and ~25 % were in G2/M.</s><s>In contrast, there was an increase (20-30% of total cells) in G2/M with a concomitant reduction in the fraction of cells in G1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>) 48 hours following the knockdown of cyclin A2.</s><s>We stained for phosphorylated histone H3 (phospho-histone H3), a well-known marker of mitosis (prior to anaphase), to assess the stage of G2/M at which this accumulation occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>The fraction of cells with phospho-histone H3 -about 1% -was not affected by a knockdown of Ccna2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</s><s>This demonstrates that the accumulation of cells in G2/M is not attributable to an accumulation of cells in the early stages of mitosis, since dephosphorylation of histone H3 only occurs during anaphase.</s><s>This observation suggests that erythroid cells with reduced cyclin A2 levels either accumulate in G2 phase prior to entry into mitosis or fail to undergo cytokinesis appropriately after progression through anaphase.</s></p><p><s>We therefore analyzed cytocentrifuge slides at 24 and 48 hours to attempt to gain insight into the nature of this arrest during terminal erythropoiesis.</s><s>While knockdown and control cells at 24 hours showed no appreciable morphological differences, at 48 hours there was a 7-fold increase in the number of binucleate orthochromatic erythroblasts in both cyclin A2 knockdown cultures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E, F</ref>).</s><s>Thus, cells with reduced cyclin A2 levels frequently fail to undergo cytokinesis during the terminal erythroid cell division, but nonetheless go on to enucleate, forming larger red blood cells than normal.</s><s>We noted on 48 hour cytocentrifuge specimens from the cyclin A2 knockdown cells many instances of binucleate cells that were undergoing enucleation, suggesting that this phenomenon does indeed occur and explains the observation that such cells can still undergo enucleation and therefore end up larger in size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Our findings illustrate an important and previously unappreciated mechanism that regulates red cell size and that appears to underlie human inter-individual variation in this trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s>By regulating the ability of cells to progress through the final cytokinesis during terminal erythropoiesis, cyclin A2 regulates red blood cell size.</s><s>We have previously shown that the number of cell divisions during terminal erythropoiesis is critical for determining red cell size and number and is affected by variation in cyclin D3 levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>In contrast, in the absence of cyclin A2, only passage through cytokinesis in the final division of erythropoiesis appears to be affected, while prior divisions occur without observable perturbations.</s><s>This may explain why the regulatory variants upstream of cyclin A2 are only significantly associated with red blood cell size in humans.</s><s>While A-type cyclins have previously been implicated in the regulation of entry into mitosis in other cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, our finding that this factor is necessary for the initiation of cytokinesis has not been previously described and may be unique to terminal erythropoiesis.</s><s>We note that the phenotypic similarity between the cytokinesis defect with reduced cyclin A2 and that observed in the context of congenital dyserythropoietic anemias is striking and there may be molecular connections between these pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Our studies defining the roles of cyclin A2, cyclin D3, and BCL11A in erythropoiesis illustrate how the genetic contribution to variation seen in GWAS provides only a minimal estimate of the biological contribution and major perturbations of these genes can show dramatic phenotypes that illuminate fundamental molecular mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Human CCNA2 mRNA expression levels in (A) purified human hematopoietic tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and (B) a panel of 79 human tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Expression data was analyzed as previously described, except microarray gene expression was not normalized to 0 in (A).</s><s>(C) CCNA2 protein levels of whole fetal liver and cultured fetal liver cells at indicated timepoints as assessed by western blot.</s><s>ACTB was used as a loading control.</s><s>(D, E) CCNA2 mRNA expression levels of primary human and murine stage-fractionated human erythroblasts cultured from blood-derived progenitors.</s><s>Expression peaks in both species at the polychromatophilic erythroblast stage.</s><s>RNA-seq data was obtained and analyzed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>FKPM = fragments per kilobase of transcript per million; ProE = proerythroblast; BasoE = basophilic erythroblast; eBasoE = early basophilic erythroblast; lBasoE = late basophilic erythroblast; PolyE = polychromatophillic erythroblast; OrthoE = orthochromatophillic erythroblast.</s><s>(F) Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis of transcription factor GATA1 occupancy at the human (top) and murine cyclin A2 locus (bottom).</s><s>GATA1 occupancy is observed both intronically and in the proximal promoter region.</s><s>Nucleosome depleted regions (NDR) are shown across the human CCNA2 locus and overlap with GATA1 occupancy.</s><s>(G) Ccna2 mRNA expression as measured in murine erythroid cell line G1E-ER4 before and after reactivation of GATA1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1.</s><s>Cyclin A2 expression and regulation in human and murine erythroid tissues</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="9,156.36,62.00,359.28,254.09" type="bitmap" /></figure>
