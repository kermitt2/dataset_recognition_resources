<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Sequence alignments show strong conservation in the membrane segments of FliP, particularly in TM3 and TM4.</s><s>Invariant residues include Asp197 near the middle of TM3, Lys222 in TM4, and a stretch of methionine residues in the loop connecting TM3 to TM4, which is predicted to lie on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</s><s>In a mutational study of conserved charged residues of the apparatus, replacements of Asp197 and Lys222 caused a substantial reduction in function as assayed on motility plates <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>The strong sequence conservation in TM3 and TM4 and the significant motility defects of Asp197 and Lys222 mutants indicate that these parts of FliP contribute in an important way to the transport process.</s><s>We hypothesized that TM3 and TM4 of FliP might be involved in forming the cargo-conducting pore, with the invariant Asp197 and Lys222 residues occurring at solvent-exposed positions in the interior of the pore.</s></p><p><s>To probe the solvent accessibility of positions in the membrane segments of FliP, single Cys replacements were made in four consecutive positions in each of the segments, and reactivity with a large sulfhydryl reagent (PEG-maleimide, MW ∼1 Kd) was examined.</s><s>FliP was detected on immunoblots using a haemagglutinin (HA) tag at the amino terminus of the mature protein (i.e., lacking the signal sequence) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The HA-tagged FliP supported motility comparable to wild type in complementation experiments with a ΔfliP strain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), and all of the Cys-replacement variants functioned as well as wild type with the exception of L225C, which showed poor motility in soft-agar assays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>) and low levels of the protein on immunoblots.</s><s>Labeling experiments used a ΔflhDC strain that expresses no other flagellar proteins and were carried out with spheroplasts to maximize FliP access by the reagent.</s><s>Products were visualized on anti-HA immunoblots; results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (panel B</ref>).</s><s>Certain of the Cys replacements in TM3 and TM4, but not in TM1 or TM2, showed significant labeling with PEG-maleimide.</s><s>Labeling was greatest at position 194 in TM3 and position 226 in TM4, which would lie on roughly the same helix faces as the invariant Asp197 and Lys222 residues.</s><s>These surfaces of TM3 and TM4 thus appear to be solvent-accessible to at least some extent.</s></p><p><s>Previous estimates of FliP stoichiometry suggested the presence of 4-5 copies per basal body <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and structural studies of a sub-domain of FliP similarly indicate the likelihood of FliP multimers <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>To further test the proposal that the apparatus contains multiple, jointly functioning copies of FliP, we examined inter-subunit complementation between FliP mutations that were previously found to cause fairly severe motility impairments individually <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Selected fliP alleles were transferred from the Cm R plasmid onto a plasmid encoding Km R , then transformed into the ΔfliP strain in pairs and tested for function in motility plates.</s><s>Motility of the E178A mutant was increased more than two-fold by co-expression of the D197N allele, even though the D197N mutation alone nearly abolishes motility (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The occurrence of such inter-subunit complementation supports the view that multiple copies of FliP function together within the apparatus.</s></p><p><s>In mutants with Cys at exposed positions in FliP, flagellar assembly might be affected by Cd 2+ , which has some affinity for the Cys side-chain.</s><s>To test this, cells of the ΔfliP strain expressing either wild-type or Cys-mutant FliP (or no FliP as a negative control) were cultured in the presence of varying concentrations of CdCl 2 , and effects on motility and growth were examined.</s><s>Motility was not strongly affected by Cd 2+ .</s><s>Growth of cells, however, was more strongly inhibited by Cd 2+ in cells expressing FliP than in the vectoronly control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s>Cd 2+ sensitivity was measured in each of the 16 Cys-mutant strains and was found to be significantly increased in the F226C mutant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, panel B).</s><s>Residue Phe226 is fully conserved in T3S systems and would lie on roughly the same face of TM4 as the invariant Lys222 (assuming α-helical structure).</s><s>Residue 193 in TM3 is also an invariant Phe and would lie on roughly the same helix face as Asp197.</s><s>A F193C single-replacement mutant did not show increased sensitivity to Cd 2+ , but a F193C/F226C double replacement showed greater sensitivity than F226C or any of the other single-Cys mutants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</s><s>To determine whether the sensitization to Cd 2+ is due to FliP alone or requires the participation of other flagellar proteins, similar experiments were done in the ΔflhDC background.</s><s>Sensitization to Cd 2+ was comparable to that observed in the ΔfliP background (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, panels C and D).</s><s>The sensitization effect is not related to the presence of the HAtag on FliP, because it was also observed with the native (non-HA-tagged) protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>, panel A).</s><s>Another toxic divalent ion, Mn 2+ , showed similar effects; cells became sensitive to Mn 2+ upon expression of FliP, and more so with the F226C mutant protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>, panels A and B).</s></p><p><s>The inhibitory effects of Cd 2+ and Mn 2+ do not appear to be due to a FliP-induced decrease in general health of the cells such as might occur if, for example, FliP jammed the translocon: FliP expression did not significantly impact cell growth prior to addition of the stressing agent (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>), and pronounced sensitization to Cd 2+ and Mn 2+ was observed at relatively low FliP expression levels (1-1.5 μM salicylate) comparable to that needed for complementation of a ΔfliP mutant (∼1 μM salicylate; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to Cd 2+ and Mn 2+ , the addition of ethanol (to 2.8%), which can readily cross membranes, had the same growth-retarding effect on cells whether or not they expressed FliP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5, panel C</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Experiments with the somewhat larger ion guanidinium also showed increased sensitivity of cells expressing FliP, in both the ΔfliP and ΔflhDC backgrounds (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>).</s><s>In contrast to the situation with the divalent ions, however, guanidium sensitization was no stronger with the F226C protein than with wild type (not shown).</s><s>Sensitivity to the much larger ion choline, by contrast, was not increased upon expression of FliP, in either background.</s><s>We hypothesized that a highly conserved, methionine-rich segment of FliP between TM3 and TM4 might form a seal at the inner end of the pore (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), in which case conductance to a larger ion might be increased by deletion of one of the Met residues.</s><s>A FliP variant lacking one of the three consecutive Met residues (ΔMet-FliP) was constructed and shown to have essentially normal function in motility assays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7</ref>).</s><s>When expressed in the ΔfliP background, this ΔMet FliP variant sensitized the cells to choline (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, upper two panels).</s><s>Unlike the Cd 2+ and guanidium effects, the sensitization to choline was not observed in the ΔflhDC background or in strains with deletions of fliQ, flhA, or flhB (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>), and thus appears to require the other components of the apparatus.</s><s>Together, these observations indicate that the ΔMet variant of FliP can be incorporated into the export apparatus and confers increased conductance to choline.</s><s>Loss of the Met residue did not increase sensitivity to other ions; the already significant sensitization to Cd 2+ and guanidinium was not increased in the ΔMet mutant (Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).</s></p><p><s>If the sensitization to choline is due to its movement through the protein-export pore, then the effect should be diminished when the pore is blocked by substrate trapped in the secretion channel.</s><s>A pore-blocking substrate was engineered by fusing the fliK gene to the gene encoding the very stable designed protein TOP7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and inserted into the chromosomal ara locus.</s><s>On induction with arabinose, the FliK-Top7 protein is targeted to the export apparatus and becomes trapped in the secretion channel.</s><s>Jamming of the export apparatus by the pore-blocking FliK-Top7 protein prevented secretion of wild-type FliK and abolished motility (Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s><s>We hypothesized that blocking the secretion pore by an actively secreting FliK-Top7 protein might prevent sensitization to choline (whose conductance requires the other proteins of the apparatus in addition to FliP), but probably not to Cd 2+ (because the Cd 2+ effect requires only FliP, to which FliK should not be targeted).</s><s>In cells expressing the ΔMet-FliP variant, sensitization to choline was almost fully reversed on induction of the FliK-TOP7 blocking construct with arabinose (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</s><s>This did not occur when arabinose was added to control cells lacking the blocking construct (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>), or when the experiment used Cd 2+ instead of choline (Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</s></p><p><s>As a further means of probing the effects of FliP on membrane permeability, we monitored solute movements across the membrane through the accompanying changes in cellular refractility.</s><s>Changes in absorbance have been used previously to monitor water efflux following osmotic upshift and the subsequent adaptation events that allow water to flow back into the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we used absorbance measurements to monitor trans-membrane solute movement in cells expressing either wild-type FliP or the ΔMet variant.</s><s>Cells were equilibrated in medium of moderate osmotic strength (PBS), then diluted two-fold into the same medium supplemented with various salts at a concentration of 0.5 M (1.0 Osm/L).</s><s>Water movements were monitored by the resulting changes in OD 600 .</s><s>The initial transfer into high-salt media causes rapid water efflux that increases refractility of the cells and causes a rapid increase in OD 600 (typically by about 10-15%) that is largely complete in the dead time of a manual-mixing experiment (a few seconds).</s><s>In a subsequent slower phase, optical density decreases as water re-enters the cell, at a rate that is mainly dictated by reentry of the osmotic agent.</s><s>The experiment was carried out with chloride salts of Na + , K + , NH 4</s></p><p><s>+ , CH 3 NH 3 + , guanidinium, and choline.</s><s>For all the ions, including the large ion choline, a fairly rapid inward flow was observed when cells expressed the ΔMet-FliP variant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</s><s>When wild-type FliP was used, fluxes were much smaller for all ions except guanidinium, which was conducted about as well by wild-type FliP.</s><s>A triple mutant with the three conserved Met residues replaced by alanine also displayed high conductance to guanidinium; a triple mutant with Phe residues in place of the methionines did not (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>).</s><s>Function evidently depends on having side-chains of appropriate size and/or flexibility in this region: both the Ala and Phe triple-mutants were immotile (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Osmotic-upshift experiments were also carried out in the ΔflhDC strain that expresses no other flagellar proteins.</s><s>In this background, FliP-dependent conductance was observed only with guanidinium; the flow was slower than in the ΔfliP background and was somewhat greater for wild-type FliP than for the delta-Met variant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>).</s><s>Thus, FliP suffices to conduct guanidinium but additional components of the apparatus appear necessary to conduct the other ions examined in this experiment.</s></p><p><s>As a further test of the proposal that solutes flow through the flagellum, experiments were next carried out in a ΔflgG mutant strain.</s><s>FlgG forms the distal part of the basal-body rod, and ΔfliG cells assemble basal bodies that contain an intact export apparatus but lack structures beyond the inner rod <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>Fluxes were examined with choline chloride as the osmotic agent, and with the ΔMet-FliP variant expressed in either the ΔflgG or wild-type background.</s><s>(A background level of wild-type FliP, expressed from the chromosome, was thus also present.)</s><s>The initial absorbance increase associated with water outflow was of similar magnitude in the two strains.</s><s>A reproducible difference was observed in the timecourse of the subsequent recovery phase, with water re-entry into the wild-type cells showing a lag in wild-type relative to that in the ΔflgG strain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>).</s><s>This is as expected if choline must flow through the flagellar filament in the wild-type cells but through only the rod in the ΔflgG mutant.</s><s>Consistent with this proposal, inflow in the wild type was made faster (becoming similar to that in the ΔflgG mutant) when the flagellar filaments were sheared just prior to the experiment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, panel B).</s><s>As expected, shearing had no effect in the ΔflgG strain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, panel C).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Several lines of evidence presented here indicate that FliP is the major component forming the cargo-conducting pore of the flagellar secretion apparatus.</s><s>Recent work on SpaP, a homolog of FliP, endorses this view, and further establishes that several copies of SpaP, most likely five, can assemble into a ring with a cavity at its center <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>The present results on FliP suggest that FliP suffices to form a pore conductive to guanidium and can sensitize cells to certain cations, but does not, by itself, support large fluxes of most ions.</s></p><p><s>Chemical-accessibility experiments and mutational effects point to the close involvement of segments TM3 and TM4 in forming the pore.</s><s>These segments exhibit strong sequence conservation that includes two invariant charged residues, Asp197 and Lys222, near the middles of the segments.</s><s>Although these residues are not strictly required for transport function <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, their conservation, and the significant functional impairment that results from their mutation, point to an important role in transport.</s><s>Because a protein-conducting pore must in any case be of fairly large diameter, it is not clear why the interior of the pore would need to contain these particular residues; a variety of polar groups could presumably serve to form a large, hydrated conduit.</s><s>Based on the strict conservation and chemical properties (charge and proton-binding ability) of these residues, we suggest that they might have an active role in the transport of protein cargo.</s><s>Specifically, we suggest that they could contribute to gradient-energized active transport by enforcing the following mechanistic constraints, or "rules" on cargo transit: 1) acidic groups of the cargo will most often pass through the channel in deprotonated (negatively charged) form, and 2) basic groups of the cargo will also most often pass through in deprotonated (but in this case electrically neutral) form.</s><s>The first condition would ensure that the transit of each acidic group is actively driven by the membrane electric potential, while the second would couple transport to the pH gradient by ensuring that passage of each basic group is linked with what is effectively the movement of a proton from the outside of the cell to the inside (because the dissociating proton will leave to the inside and the new one is acquired from the outside).</s></p><p><s>If the TM3 and TM4 segments are helical, the part of the pore just 'above' the invariant charges should contain the side-chains of residues Phe193 and Phe226.</s><s>These large, hydrophobic groups might be important in modulating the conductance of the pore, possibly in minimizing leakage of solutes past the cargo.</s><s>Alternatively, or in addition, they might help shape electric fields in the channel to facilitate cargo movement (possibly contributing to the active transport process hypothesized above).</s><s>Whatever their precise function, the strict conservation of these residues implies that they contribute something important to the transport mechanism in both the injectisome and flagellar systems.</s></p><p><s>A final feature of note is the Met-rich segment predicted to lie at the inner mouth of the channel.</s><s>Among hydrophobic residues, the side-chain of Met is most flexible.</s><s>Several such side-chains (15-18 in all, in a channel formed from five or six FliP subunits) might together form a deformable gasket at the inner end of the channel, accommodating the passage of a fast-moving, irregularly shaped cargo subunit while slowing or preventing the leakage of valuable metabolites and the energy-wasting influx of protons and other ions.</s><s>The increased conductance that is observed on deletion of one of the Met residues, or mutation to residues of decreased bulk, is consistent with such a barrier function.</s></p><p><s>The structure of the FliP pore remains undetermined and will be an important goal of future studies.</s><s>Other important questions concern the stoichiometry, positions, topologies and functions of FliQ and FliR.</s></p></div>
