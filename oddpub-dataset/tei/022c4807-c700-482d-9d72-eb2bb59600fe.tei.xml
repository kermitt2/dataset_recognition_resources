<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BACC Cohort Study Population and Design</head><p><s>This study prospectively recruited 1040 patients presenting with acute chest pain in the emergency department of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf from July 19, 2013, to December 31, 2014.</s><s>Patients were included if they presented with acute chest pain and/or other symptoms suggestive of AMI, were older than 18 years, were willing to partici-pate in the study, and were able to give written informed consent.</s><s>All patients underwent a routine clinical assessment as described in the current European Society of Cardiology guidelines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s>Blood was drawn directly at admission, after 1 hour, and after 3 hours.</s><s>A primary diagnosis of AMI was adjudicated according to current guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> based on a highsensitivity troponin T assay (Elecsys; Roche Diagnostics).</s><s>The final discharge diagnosis used for the index event was additionally based on all available clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings in the course of the hospital stay.</s><s>Two cardiologists (J.T.N. and N.A.S.) who were unaware of the study troponin I data adjudicated the diagnosis independently.</s><s>If the adjudicators disagreed about the diagnosis, a third cardiologist (D.W.) refereed.</s><s>Moreover, NSTEMI type 1 or 2 was diagnosed based on the third universal definition of myocardial infarction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s>More detailed study-specific assessment is available in eMethods in the Supplement.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition of the Best-Performing Troponin I Cutoff</head><p><s>The troponin I level was determined using a high-sensitivity troponin I immunoassay (ARCHITECT i2000SR; Abbott Diagnostics).</s><s>The limit of detection for the assay was 1.9 (range, 0-50 000) ng/L.</s><s>The assay had a 10% coefficient of variation at a concentration of 5.2 ng/L.</s><s>Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation of this assay were 4.26% and 6.29%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref></s><s>he 99th percentile was 27 ng/L in the general population. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s>his assay was used in all 3 studies (BACC, ADAPT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and APACE <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> ).</s></p><p><s>We defined the optimal troponin I cutoff level to exclude NSTEMI using values of 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.2 (for the 10% coefficient of variation), 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, and 27 (as the 99th percentile of this assay) ng/L.</s><s>The cutoff level with the combination of the highest negative predictive value (NPV), maximum number of individuals with AMI excluded, exceeding the 10% coefficient of variation of 5.2 ng/L, and being an integral number was considered optimal.</s></p><p><s>Troponin I Algorithm Exclusion of NSTEMI was defined by a troponin I level less than 6 ng/L (defined as the optimal cutoff in the BACC study) at admission and after 1 hour or at admission and after 3 hours.</s><s>For comparison, we calculated exclusion of NSTEMI using only the admission value.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Independent Validation Cohorts for the Algorithm</head><p><s>The BACC study derived the 1-hour algorithm to exclude and/or identify AMI, which was validated in 2 independent cohorts.</s><s>The first cohort is from the ADAPT study <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and consists of 1748 patients with suspected AMI who presented at the emergency department.</s><s>Troponin I levels were measured on admission and after 2 hours, which was not the same time point as in our study.</s><s>Moreover, we used a second validation cohort of 2261 patients with suspected AMI.</s><s>This cohort (APACE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> was described recently, and troponin I levels were measured at admission and 1 hour.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diagnosing AMI</head><p><s>Patients presenting with acute chest pain at the emergency department make heavy use of limited medical resources.</s><s>Therefore, the need for fast but safe decision making is urgent.</s><s>9]<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref> As recently shown by Shah et al, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> this single-measurement approach enables a safe exclusion of AMI with only 0.4% false-negative findings.</s><s>In that study, however, the median time from admission until blood sampling was 54 minutes, which might explain why patients with a very early presentation were still detected.</s><s>To prevent a premature discharge of patients at high risk for future ischemic episodes, especially when patients with recent onset of chest pain (within 2 hours) are taken into account, consecutive measurements might be crucial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref></s><s>An approach using 2 consecutive measurements increases sensitivity and specificity, although prolonging the time until the final diagnosis can be made.</s><s>Herein we show that the accuracy of the 1-hour approach was comparable to the 3-hour approach.</s><s>Both approaches were superior to a single on-admission determination.</s><s>The 1-hour approach does not yet integrate any clinical measurement such as electrocardiography, which will further increase the safety of this ruleout strategy.</s></p><p><s>The rule-in algorithm identified patients with a high accuracy after 1 hour, comparable to a 3-hour approach with preserved specificity.</s><s>This approach prevents inappropriate costintensive management, which includes possibly harmful coronary angiographies.</s><s>The algorithm performed evenly well in clinically important subgroups, whereas only atrial fibrillation had an effect on the PPV.</s></p><p><s>The validation of our algorithm in other cohorts (ADAPT and APACE) demonstrated similar high performance by integrating all available cohorts with shorter than the guidelinerecommended rule-out window with this specific troponin I assay.</s><s>Results of this validation testing strengthen the concept of a rapid rule out after 1 hour only, which is now recommended by the NSTEMI European Society of Cardiology guidelines as an alternative to the standard 3-hour approach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cutoff Definition</head><p><s>Guideline-based cutoff values to rule out AMI were derived from the 99th percentile of a specific troponin assay measured in the healthy population.</s><s>These assays were characterized as sensitive assays, defined by a coefficient of variation near the 99th percentile.</s><s>Imprecision was relatively high with values below the coefficient of variation.</s><s>The current highsensitivity assays, in which precision is high at low cutoff values, are different.</s></p><p><s>To determine a valid algorithm, we calculated different cutoff values to identify the best-performing one.</s><s>These calculations resulted in a troponin I cutoff level of 6 ng/L.</s><s>This cutoff value was higher than that for the 10% coefficient of variation as a marker of imprecision of this specific troponin assay.</s><s>For comparison we used a cutoff based on the 99th percentile of the troponin I assay.</s><s>Many patients with the final diagnosis of AMI were not identified by the 99th percentile cutoff and would have been discharged without the correct diagnosis in our study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondary Events During Follow-up</head><p><s>The 1-and 3-hour algorithms using a cutoff value of 6 ng/L resulted in lower mortality than the 99th percentile cutoff, and mortality using the 1-hour algorithm was identical to that of the 3-hour algorithm.</s><s>Patients diagnosed as having NSTEMI by our algorithm had a significantly higher mortality.</s><s>Highest mortality was observed in the gray-zone group.</s><s>This group of patients with continuously elevated but stable troponin levels, which are not necessarily related to coronary disease, requires thorough monitoring and reevaluation.</s></p></div>
