evolution of genetic polymorphism remain under debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>.</s><s>Similar variations in ecological consequences for NR -for s for R -for Ns for NR  depending on the process by which diversity is established and maintained might be found in the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning.</s><s>Coexistence of diversity and its ecological function may be two sides of the same coin.</s></p><p><s>The ecological functions of genetic diversity are interpreted by analogy with the functions of species diversity in ecological communities and ecosystems.</s><s>In polymorphic populations, complementarity or selection effects, or both, can potentially lead to higher population fitness.</s><s>However, according to our conceptual model, only complementarity contributes to an increase in population fitness in a dimorphic system under balancing selection.</s><s>Moreover, the empirical data for Drosophila confirmed that complementarity of genetic polymorphism is the more important mechanism leading to enhanced population fitness.</s></p><p><s>At this time, the exact behavioural mechanism or intermorph interaction that leads to negative frequency-dependent selection and ecological improvement of polymorphic Rover/ sitter populations of D. melanogaster is unknown.</s><s>Intra-morph resource competition may lead to a rare morph advantage.</s><s>Biased encounters with the same morph might result in costly interactions (e.g.</s><s>intense resource competition) among individuals with the same morph in a polymorphic population and in inefficient food utilization in a monomorphic population.</s><s>To deduce the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection and the resulting improvement in population fitness, direct behavioural observations are needed.</s><s>Because genome-wide analyses of European and African populations of D. melanogaster did not detect for genes under balancing selection, the balancing selection acting on for may be relatively weak in natural settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>For further research, it is important to consider the possibility that increased biomass and survival rate due to the evolution of polymorphism affect long-term population performance and persistence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Although previous studies suggested that polymorphism enhances growth rate, carrying capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28]</ref>, establishment success <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref> and long-term persistence of populations or species <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref>, the long-term ecological effects of behavioural polymorphism in D. melanogaster are currently unclear because we quantified only the survival rate, body size and population biomass in the focal generation.</s><s>However, our results may provide insight into the long-term demographic effect of the polymorphism in a population.</s><s>Polymorphic conditions may increase the growth rate of the population on a timescale longer than one generation because both the number and the size of females can increase the number of progenies and biomass of subsequent generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36]</ref>.</s><s>In fact, polymorphic populations showed higher population density and productivity through increased fecundity and oviposition rate of individual females in a damselfly species <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, because the increased survival rate in polymorphic populations of D. melanogaster might be caused by efficient utilization of resources, polymorphic conditions are suggested to increase the carrying capacity of a population.</s><s>Furthermore, higher GM and lower variation of the biomass of this polymorphic population suggested that polymorphism could improve population persistence in a temporally fluctuating environment.</s><s>To confirm the demographic consequences of the evolution of behavioural polymorphism in D. melanogaster, long-term population dynamics of monomorphic and polymorphic populations should be directly assessed under both stable and fluctuating environments in future studies.</s><s>In addition, the long-term impact of polymorphism on highlevel ecological processes such as community structure and ecosystem functioning should also be prioritized in biodiversity management as well as our understanding of the further ecological role of evolutionary diversification within a population <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr"
