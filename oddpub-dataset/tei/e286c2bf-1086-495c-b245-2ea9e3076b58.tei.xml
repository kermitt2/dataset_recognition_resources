<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design and participants</head><p><s>This was a cross-sectional study.</s><s>The present study was a part of a previously published study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>, whereby a convenience sample of 107 employees who completed both ActiGraph and Fitbit Flex measures were included.</s><s>Participants from a large public University and a hospital in Singapore were recruited between February 2014 and June 2014.</s><s>Individuals were residing in Singapore and were of various ethnicities (Chinese, Malay, Indian and others).</s><s>Participants were invited to take part in this study through mass e-mailing.</s><s>Individuals who indicated interest were approached and interviewed by the researcher.</s><s>The inclusion criteria were:</s></p><p><s>1. Males and females aged 21 to 65 years 2. Either students or working adults 3. Absence of physical disabilities or illness that would create abnormal gait patterns.</s></p><p><s>The study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board (NUS-IRB Ref No.: B-14-021).</s><s>Participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p><s>The goals and procedures of the study were explained to each participant by the researcher via face-to-face interview.</s><s>Participants' information on gender, age, education level, height and weight were self-reported.</s><s>Instructions were given to the participants by trained personnel on how to put on a wrist-worn Fitbit Flex and a waist-worn ActiGraph concurrently for 7 days.</s><s>Instruction manuals on the proper use of the ActiGraph and Fitbit Flex were also given to participants for additional guidance.</s><s>Participants were instructed that the devices had to be worn for at least 10 hours/day, and could be removed at night depending on their comfort level.</s><s>They were asked to complete a daily time sheet to record each wearing day when both devices were worn while maintaining their normal activities.</s><s>Information required on the time sheet comprised of the dates they started and stopped wearing the devices.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ActiGraph wGT3X-BT</head><p><s>The ActiGraph™ wGT3X-BT monitor (ActiGraph, LLC, Pensacola, Florida, USA) is a triaxial accelerometer (Dimensions: 4.6cm x 3.3cm x 1.5cm; weight: 19 grams) worn on the waist using an elastic belt to secure above the right hip bone for quantifying the amount and frequency of human movements.</s><s>The monitor was initialized at a sample rate of 30Hz to record activities for free-living conditions.</s><s>Participants were instructed to wear the ActiGraph for 7-day.</s><s>They were allowed to remove the ActiGraph only while bathing or immersing the body in water.</s><s>ActiGraph data were downloaded using ActiLife 6 software (ActiGraph, LLC, Pensacola, FL, USA) by the researchers upon collection of the devices.</s><s>Downloaded data were integrated into 60-sec epochs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fitbit Flex</head><p><s>Fitbit Flex TM (Dimensions: 22.2cm x 6.0cm x 6.0cm; weight: 100 grams) is a wrist-worn wearable wireless sensor with a triaxial accelerometer that records physical activity throughout the day.</s><s>It can sync with a smartphone application/computer. Participants were instructed to wear the Fitbit Flex on their non-dominant wrist, for the same duration as the ActiGraph (up to 7-day) concurrently.</s><s>In general, Fitbit Flex requires the creation of individual user accounts to download stored data using a Web-based software application.</s><s>However, for the purpose of our study, anonymous user accounts were created by the study team which could only be accessed by the researchers.</s><s>Steps data were therefore stored on the devices, and the minuteby-minute Fitbit Flex data were downloaded at the end of each participant's wearing period by the study team.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data reduction</head><p><s>For wear time validation, because the ActiGraph accelerometer is an established device to measure physical activity with many validation studies determining their accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>, valid wear time determined by the ActiGraph was regarded as the reference.</s><s>A detailed description of the procedures on ActiGraph wear time validation and removal of sleep time can be found elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>.</s><s>Then, a valid day was defined as having an accumulation of !1500 steps/day with !10 hours/day restricted only to common wear time based on both ActiGraph and Fitbit Flex.</s><s>The 1500 steps/day criterion was based on a previous research conducted by Tudor-Locke et al. comparing accelerometers positioned at different locations under free-living conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>.</s><s>All participants with !4 valid days of data were included in the analysis.</s><s>Additionally, wear time was also verified based on the daily time sheets.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p><s>All statistical procedures were performed using SPSS software (version 20.0).</s><s>The significance level was set at P&lt;0.05.</s><s>Descriptive characteristics were presented as mean (standard deviation; SD) or median (interquartile range; IQR).</s><s>Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine whether the data was normally distributed.</s><s>Differences in the characteristics between genders were detected by non-parametric tests.</s><s>Mann-Whitney U test (for continuous variables), chisquared test (for categorical variables) and Fisher's exact test (for categorical variables with cells having an expected frequency of five or less) were used.</s></p><p><s>Analyses of the relationship between ActiGraph and Fitbit Flex were performed across: all participants, by each category of step-defined daily physical activity, and gender.</s><s>Because there could be potential within-subject variations, comparison of step counts for the magnitude of relationship between the two devices was done on a day-to-day basis.</s><s>Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to assess correlation and agreement, respectively in steps between ActiGraph and Fitbit Flex.</s><s>An ICC value of !0.75 implied excellent, 0.60-0.74</s><s>good, 0.40-0.59</s><s>fair and &lt;0.40 poor agreement <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>.</s><s>Median of absolute percentage error (MAPE) between devices was calculated: (absolute error/ observed steps) × 100%.</s><s>The difference in MAPE by each category of step-defined daily physical activity and gender was compared using Mann-Whitney U test.</s><s>ActiGraph derived steps/ day was used to classify two step-defined activity categories for the assessments of Spearman's rho and ICC.</s><s>The classification of days into two step-defined activity categories was adapted based on previous studies: valid days with a cumulative of !10,000 steps/day were considered as active days, and &lt;10,000 steps/day were inactive days <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">38]</ref>.</s><s>As for the Bland-Altman analysis, a non-parametric approach was adopted since the differences between the two devices were non-normally distributed.</s><s>Bland-Altman plots were presented as median, 10 th and 90 th percentiles to display variance around differences between two devices.</s><s>Proportion of agreement in achievement of 10,000 steps per day produced by ActiGraph and Fitbit Flex was assessed using Kappa.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study focused on the direct comparison of steps obtained from the Fitbit Flex and Acti-Graph.</s><s>The results show positive correlations and agreement in step counts of free-living adults as measured by the waist-worn ActiGraph and wrist-worn Fitbit Flex activity monitors.</s><s>At the same time, overestimation of step counts and classification as active days by Fitbit Flex were found.</s><s>This may have important public health implications if consumers or participants of health promotion programs are identified as being active when in fact they are not.</s><s>Recently, a number of studies have investigated the accuracy of various consumer-based physical activity trackers, recognizing the role they may play in physical activity promotion.</s><s>For instance, Case et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Storm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, and Diaz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> have validated consumer wearables for measuring steps.</s><s>However, to date very few studies have investigated the accuracy of these monitors under free-living conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s><s>This is highly important because the accuracy of devices may differ considerably in day-to-day life as compared to under highly controlled and short protocols of activities.</s><s>Recently, several studies have been conducted with regard to this important research question <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Dierker et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> assessed the validity of Fitbit Flex among 17 college-aged adults and found that although the steps measured by Fitbit Flex (9596 ± 2361 steps) were higher than the ActiGraph GT3X+ (7766 ± 2388 steps), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.052).</s><s>However, the authors instructed the participants to remove the devices while they were exercising over the 7-day monitoring period; hence it is possible that not all free-living movements have been captured as in the present  study.</s><s>In another study by Dominick et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, the Fitbit Flex registered a total of 10286 ± 3760 free-living steps/day as compared to the ActiGraph of 9639 ± 3456 steps/day (albeit no significant difference was found between devices) among 19 participants.</s><s>In contrast, Sushames et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> reported a larger absolute difference of over 3000 steps (47.0%) in free-living steps between Fitbit Flex and ActiGraph among 25 adults, of which the Fitbit Flex has underestimated step counts.</s><s>The reason for this underestimation from Fitbit Flex is unclear, but it could be related to the variability in participants' movements or undercounting of steps by the Fitbit Flex.</s></p><p><s>Different study settings and reference methods could contribute to the discrepancies in outcomes.</s><s>Kooiman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> assessed the validity of Fitbit Flex over 1 day in a smaller sample of free-living adults and found high agreements in steps with the activPAL.</s><s>They found a noticeably smaller mean absolute percentage difference of 3.7% against the activPAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>.</s><s>In accordance with our findings, another recent study comparing Fitbit Flex and ActiGraph on 48 cardiac patients (mean age: 65.5 years), in which high correlations and a difference in step counts of 1038 steps/day in the total population over 4 days of monitoring period were reported.</s><s>Thus, comparing findings among different populations can provide an implication of how reproducible and valid this device is.</s><s>It was also noted that the overestimation in step counts by the Fitbit Flex in this study resulted in a considerable misclassification of days as being active, which may have important public health implications.</s><s>As shown in our analysis, the differences in steps between Fitbit Flex and ActiGraph were larger on inactive days as comto active days.</s><s>Hypothetically, as most lifestyle activities include movements at the wrist, people might have performed movements such as hand waving that could be identified as potential false positive events/steps by Fitbit Flex.</s><s>It was apparent that wrist-movements could reflect arm/ forearm motions with a relatively small mass (while sitting), or they could be classified as step counts (while walking or running) Tudor-Locke et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref> found a large difference even using the same ActiGraph device placed between different attachment sites.</s><s>They further reported that the difference between mean steps from the wrist and waist was 2558 steps under free-living conditions, with a higher average step counts on the wrist <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>.</s><s>In line with this, Hilderbrand et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> found a 200% higher step activity from the wrist-worn GENEActiv than the waist-worn ActiGraph in some adults.</s><s>These observations suggest room for further progress, since recent studies reported using wrist-worn monitors resulted in improved wearing compliance due to comfort issues and without having the need to remove them intermittently <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Ultimately, prolonged wear time would improve data quality as the issue of missing data due to non-compliance could be minimized.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths</head><p><s>Despite the growing body of evidence, this study expands substantially on previous studies.</s><s>Most importantly, as highlighted earlier, the comparison of the devices was done under free-living conditions for estimation of unstructured lifestyle activities.</s><s>Secondly, the relationship between these devices were assessed for 7-day of wearing protocol.</s><s>Thirdly, this study was conducted among a relatively large sample of adults.</s><s>Fourthly, the performance of the devices was compared across different subgroups (males vs. females and step-defined physical activity categories).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p><s>This study may have limited generalizability as participants were predominantly females, relatively young and healthy.</s><s>Furthermore, the use of ActiGraph as the reference instrument has its drawbacks.</s><s>It is possible that the difference in steps between devices could be attributable to not only the Fitbit Flex, but also the ActiGraph, which is not the gold standard for measuring step counts <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref>.</s><s>However, the ActiGraph has been shown to be a valid tool to assess step count (as compared with the Omron pedometer and Yamax Digiwalker <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>), and it is practical for use in epidemiological studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>.</s><s>Careful consideration should also be given to the effects of movement artefact and signal noise due to the use of devices that are not attached directly to the skin (i.e.</s><s>Fitbit Flex worn on a wrist-band and ActiGraph on a waist-belt), which might have affected the devices' functionality to accurately measure step count.</s><s>Being limited to only step count data, there was no indication as to whether the activities performed were of light-, moderate-or vigorous-intensity level.</s><s>In general, step counts from accelerometers of different attachment sites (i.e.</s><s>wrist-and waist-worn) might not be ideal for a direct comparison; nonetheless, results of this study were more likely to reflect the performances of these devices in real-world practice.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>Positive correlation and agreement in step counts were found between wrist-worn Fitbit Flex and waist-worn ActiGraph in free living adults, which is consistent with the existing evidence mainly from laboratory studies.</s><s>However, a considerable overestimation of Fitbit Flex was noted, which resulted in substantial misclassification by Fitbit Flex when applying common step count recommendations.</s><s>This can have important practical implications for the use of these devices by researchers, practitioners and health promoters, which often use the achievement of certain step count goals or increases in step counts as desired outcomes.</s><s>Evidence presented in this paper adds to the existing literature on the validity of consumer devices for physical activity monitoring and these cautionary limitations should be considered in the design of study data collection and health promotion strategies.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Fig 1.
