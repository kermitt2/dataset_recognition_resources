(2) More specifically, based on "Ambulation", "Age", and "Country", can we get the number of patients?</s></p><p><s>Answering this kind of questions requires data of disparate nature and from multiple sources.</s><s>To harmonize these data into a semantic layer we need an integration platform capable of converting any data format into RDF.</s><s>This implies abstracting registry concepts and their attributes, such as Patient (sex, birthday, and country); Disease; Phenotype (motor, ambulation); and Genetic Variation and then representing them into a graph data model in which the semantics of the objects and their relationships can be described with standard or widely adopted ontologies.</s><s>Finally, patient registries data should be aggregated by concept.</s><s>In each concept, data elements, or instances that represent the same entity but have different text mentions in each registry, must be mapped to an ontology term.</s><s>For example, Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) for diseases and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for phenotypes can be used to make data interoperable and linkable in the Web of data.</s><s>The use of domain-specific and commonly used ontologies adds value to data, through an integrated knowledge base that is searchable and comparable by user and by machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, interlinking patient registry data with external linked datasets allows enriching the current knowledge in the rare disease research.</s></p><p><s>In this work, we have developed a new semantic layer on top of existing patient registries, to allow extracting anonymised data from the original datasets, translate them to a common shared exchange model, and make them available to the research community (available at http://bioinformatics.ua.pt/linked-registries-app/).</s><s>The solution addresses three key requirements from the patient registries research community: (1) data model agnostic; (2) distributed and encapsulated; and (3) knowledge-oriented.</s></p><p><s>Firstly, data harmonization strategies are data model agnostic and work regardless of registries' data format and internal structure.</s><s>This is clearly important as we are dealing with systems featuring assorted characteristics, from relational databases and service endpoints, up to Excel spreadsheets.</s></p><p><s>Next, the solution is distributed and encapsulated.</s><s>When dealing with rare disease patients, it is imperative to ensure data anonymity and privacy.</s><s>Hence, we need tools that extract meaningful data while maintaining hidden all the attributes that may disclose patients' identification.</s></p><p><s>At last, our approach takes advantage of Semantic Web technologies to improve how we publish, access, express, and share knowledge across the Web.</s><s>From a technological perspective, the system was built on top of COEUS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>, an application framework that streamlines data integration with semantic representation.</s><s>As patient registries are shared within this platform, researchers and developers are able to perform federated queries, covering miscellaneous databases, just like they would query a single local dataset.</s></p><p><s>In summary, we explore a Semantic Web approach and a nonintrusive strategy to interconnect, enrich, and federate data from multiple patient registries, allowing extending the knowledge behind these distributed repositories.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p><s>2.1.</s><s>Patient Registries.</s><s>The collection and maintenance of patient registers have been assuming a key role in the identification of new treatments and in the improvement of care.</s><s>In particular, personal genetic records are of growing interest.</s><s>These data are increasingly important for diagnosis, resolution, and therapeutic treatment of rare diseases.</s><s>Hence, databases with information about human genome, such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> or the 1000 Genomes Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, currently have a growing relevance.</s><s>Moreover, it is important to reuse these data in novel biomedical software to enable its usage on daily medical workflows.</s></p><p><s>The value of individual data increases when it is aggregated and presented in a unified way, both for humans and computers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s>Orphanet provides a public portal, for professionals and patients, with the most updated information about rare diseases and orphan drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s>It also displays information on specialized consultations, diagnostics, research projects, clinical trials, and support groups.</s><s>Diseasecard <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> is another platform that aggregates genotypeto-phenotype information regarding rare diseases, pointing to key elements for both the education and the biomedical research field.</s><s>While these systems do not provide repositories for patient-level data, they are useful resources for sharing and disseminating existing knowledge and expertise.</s></p><p><s>Besides the important role of these specialized repositories, the integration of knowledge that can be extracted from distinct electronic health records (EHRs) is also a major challenge to support personalized medicine.</s><s>Data from gene sequences, mutations, proteomics, and drug interactions (the genotype) can now be combined with data from EHRs, medical imaging, and disease-specific information stored in patient registries (the clinical phenotype).</s><s>Hence, it is crucial to start exploring patient-level data from rare diseases registries, which often include personal data, diagnosis, clinical features, phenotypes, genotypes, treatments, and clinical follow-up.</s></p><p><s>According to Orphanet, there are over 600 rare disease registries just in Europe, with different aims and objectives, with access to different resources and collecting different datasets.</s><s>Registries have traditionally been developed to accelerate the translational research pathway helping to move therapies from bench to bedside as quickly as possible.</s><s>They provide a tool for the feasibility and planning of clinical trials as well as means to identify and recruit patients into research.</s><s>However, the purpose and utility of registries has a much broader reach providing a source of natural history data and a basis for hypothesis generation that can advance research into a given field.</s></p><p><s>A single academic can set up a registry or a clinician with an interest in a particular field, or a disease network, or-as is increasingly common-a patient organization.</s><s>The variety in origin explains the variety of funding schemes (sustainability models) and data collection techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The highly developed registries (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19]</ref>) act as detailed natural history studies, with data collected at fixed time points in the clinical setting and stored in bespoke software solutions.</s><s>However, many registries are online self-report systems, with patients entering data through a Web portal.</s><s>There are also examples of a combined approach: patients initiate registration, while physicians verify details through the same Web portal.</s><s>This disparity in data collection increases the complexity of a unified system.</s><s>The data items themselves are not standardized across all rare diseases though a significant amount of effort has been applied in this area.</s><s>Some consensus has been reached in certain disease areas, such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), where a federated registry system exists under the umbrella of TREAT-NMD (http://www.treat-nmd.eu/)</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>One step towards harmonization can come in the form of international medical classifications or languages, such as UMLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> or SNOMED-CT <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, among some other terminologies, and, more recently, the use of phenotype ontologies, such as HPO <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, has been proposed as a tool for phenotype standardization.</s><s>Ontologies are structured representation of knowledge using a standardized, controlled vocabulary for data integration, organization, searching, and analysis.</s><s>The use of ontologies to identify and annotate data in patient registries ensures interoperability and access, and it also enables cross-cohort comparisons and filtering.</s><s>Importantly, it allows the development of new bioinformatics tools, covering the automated and systematic matching of clinically similar representations of phenotypes to assist in differential diagnosis, among others.</s></p><p><s>These patient-centric databases offer unique specialized views over their internal datasets.</s><s>However, while there are huge amounts of data scattered throughout multiple stakeholders, they are wildly difficult to obtain or access.</s><s>The main reasons are the lack of semantic compatibility and the evident low motivation of data owners to share and spread their valuable datasets and, thus, individual efforts remain isolated.</s><s>This is a critical hindering factor in rare disease research, where a sole centre may collect only a small number of patients with a certain disease.</s><s>The outcome of this is that, in the end, there is not enough data to generate statistically meaningful conclusions.</s><s>As such, we cannot discover or infer new knowledge because there is no access to a minimal amount of patient data.</s></p><p><s>To cope with these challenges we need a platform that offers a unique holistic view promoting the collaboration of multiple entities towards the study of rare diseases and assessment of patients' evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</s><s>According to our study, only one related exchange platform was developed regarding the rare diseases domain: The Matchmaker Exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>.</s><s>This platform provides a systematic approach to create a federation network of genotypes and phenotypes databases through a common application programming interface (API).</s><s>This helps in the process of finding common genotype/phenotype pairs in multiple individuals.</s><s>However, this approach requires deposition of the data into the main database or the setup of local instances, always ensuring a set of services and end users agreements.</s><s>Comparatively, our proposed solution is more generic and suitable for the creation of independent systems that can be plugged into any existing patient registry without changing it.</s><s>Furthermore, as our system relies on Semantic Web technologies and standards, this will promote a better translation, federation, and discovery of new knowledge.</s><s>By exploring the Matchmaker system (and its different aims), we believe that our approach is a better milestone towards semantic interoperable rare diseases knowledge.</s></p></div>

that is, SPARQL queries can be forwarded to several patient registries endpoints.</s><s>COEUS acts here as a middleware component between the patient registry triple store and the public knowledge federation layer.</s></p><p><s>Finally, at the upper level researchers can perform general queries that combine data from one or more patient registries.</s><s>In a sense, query federation enables performing SQL-like UNIONs or JOINs across multiple knowledge bases.</s><s>This empowers knowledge inference and reasoning queries to go beyond what is currently possible.</s><s>The first step consists in defining the best ontologies to map common patient's data.</s><s>HPO <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, UMLS <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[34]</ref>, ICD <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[35]</ref>, and ORDO <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref> are the most widely used ontologies in the rare diseases field.</s><s>One of the great advantages of using Semantic Web technologies is that any external ontology can be used to complement or extend COEUS internal model.</s><s>As long as clinicians understand the new predicates, any number of properties can be included, semantically mapping concepts or entities to existing ontologies or adding further properties to describe entities or concepts.</s><s>Moreover, we may combine multiple ontologies, that is, the same data element can be mapped to terms from more than one ontology, optimising its expressiveness and enriching the way it can be used in future research environments.</s><s>In this step, semiautomated annotation tools such as SORTA <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[36]</ref> and EGAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref> along human curation experts play an important role for the annotation of biomedical data (e.g., phenotypes, diseases).</s></p><p><s>The second step of the pipeline consists in the configuration and deployment of a new COEUS instance.</s><s>The setup involves defining how data will be extracted and mapped into the selected ontology terms.</s><s>Using COEUS connectors we have to specify where the data comes from (Excel, CSV, or XML files; SQL databases; or SPARQL/LinkedData endpoints) and how we will map it to the ontologies.</s><s>For instance, for a patient registry available as a CSV file, we need to specify the file location and, for each mapped ontology term, the column containing the actual data elements.</s></p><p><s>In the following stage, the semantic translation process, knowledge base elements, and their data and object properties are created in real-time from the integrated data.</s><s>This step elevates data in primitive formats to a new semantic abstraction level.</s><s>The process is complete when all data are imported into a new triple store, making it available for external use through the various data publishing endpoints.</s><s>ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) processes in its engine.</s><s>These algorithms facilitate the "triplification" process, in which all data are converted to a simple subject-predicate-object model.</s><s>Moreover, it makes the integrated information available through a hierarchical model establishing relationships between data in an "Entity-Concept-Item" structure (e.g., Protein-Uniprot-P51587).</s><s>To create each registry's knowledge base according to this organized model, we must fulfil some initial requirements.</s><s>Essentially, there are three main steps to achieve the final solution: the first is data selection, the second is the data sources configuration, and last one is the data integration process.</s><s>In the first step, we have applied a preselection process to all registries data.</s><s>In this process, we select the desired information for our study avoiding sensitive data and considering only nonidentifiable data.</s><s>Patient registries have a lot of information, but some are redundant and incomplete.</s><s>Regarding that, applying this initial filtering process is vital to build a consistent database.</s><s>This process was only possible due to the involvement of respective data owners that translated what their data means.</s><s>In the final stage of this initial filtering process, we exported the files of the distinct registries.</s><s>Each dataset was imported to a separated COEUS instance, as we plan to have four distributed systems.</s><s>In the second step, we define the data sources attributes for each registry.</s><s>This starts by creating one Resource (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, block 1-ontology mapping) in the knowledge base that contains the respective data elements such as Endpoint location (i.e., the registries file location), Publisher (i.e., CSV file), CSV Starting line (i.e., 1 as the registries file has headers), and Method (i.e., cache as we will load the entire file into the system).</s><s>Additionally, for each Resource, a combination of parameters (i.e., Selectors) must also be included to establish the mapping between the information to be extracted from the registry (e.g., for each column) and the respective formal ontology terms that connects it.</s><s>For instance, we can make use of the Human Disease Ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[38]</ref> term has symptom to establish the connection between a Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) patient and the identified symptoms: coeus:Patient X doid:has symptom obo:HP 0001324 (i.e., muscle weakness.).</s><s>Likewise, we link each patient to its respective identifier by creating a Selector that makes the linkage between the CSV first column (with the patient IDs) in the parameter query and the property dc:identifier from the Dublin Core Ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Establishing all these mappings in the registries records makes the foundation of an interconnected network of relationships between patients and respective features possible.</s><s>An overview of the knowledge base model is available in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>, showing a simplified view of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy Type 1 (omim:158900) patients relationships.</s></p><p><s>After these configurations, the last process encompasses the automatic integration and semantic mapping of data sources.</s><s>To expose data, we provide several interoperability features such as SPARQL endpoint and a Linked Data interface.</s><s>The SPARQL endpoint works as a federated query system, in which we can perform complex queries across patient registries.</s><s>The Linked Data interface provides easy access to the patient information through the Web Browser or similar applications.</s></p><p><s>All the described processes are managed through COEUS Web user interface that provides an easy-setup solution to the installation and configuration process.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p><s>The IRDiRC (International Rare Diseases Research) consortium defined several overarching objectives, to achieve until 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[40]</ref>.</s><s>Some of these goals include, for instance, to make data accessible to the research community or to promote tools and standards that simplify networking between data centres.The present solution was built upon these general needs, offering an opportunity to access patients distributed data in a common Web platform.</s><s>The semantic layer approach offers a technological solution that enables data and metadata sharing, following common ontologies and standards, as described in the whole document.</s><s>In our research work, we identified how these Semantic Web technologies can be tailored to the patient registries integration scenario.</s><s>Although our results are successful, they highlight two major issues.</s></p><p><s>First, identifying the proper common ontology to be used across patient registries is a cumbersome challenge.</s><s>While COEUS empowers this process at the technical level, there still has to be an agreement between stakeholders on what ontologies will be used and how will their data be properly mapped to them.</s><s>This introduces a new challenge, as distinct ontologies need to be adequately mapped <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref>.</s><s>In this point, it is important to highlight that the creation of mappings between patient registries elements and ontologies is a critical point for data quality and reliability.</s></p><p><s>Rare diseases registry researchers frequently need to extract the primary clinical information and translate it into the registry data elements.</s><s>This process is the key for the validity of outcomes that are under the scope of the registry.</s><s>Both phenotypic information and final diagnosis have to be derived from the clinical examination, genetic, histopathological, and other laboratory tests, and radiological images, among some other specific sources, which are all challenging due to their heterogeneity and complexity.</s></p><p><s>In addition, standardization of the primary sources of information is an important issue for registries, but, in some situations, it is not possible.</s><s>The translational process from the real clinical status of the patient to the information saved and stored into the registry database implies some potential risk of introducing some bias information.</s><s>The establishment of mappings between information based on ontological terms could lead us to obtaining standardized data, but not valid results.</s><s>Thus, when phenotypic data are not well defined or it is incorrectly translated into the database elements, this phenotypic information might be linked to wrong ontological terms.</s><s>Likewise, ontological terms are not always as comprehensive as free text and, therefore, the ability of an ontology to cover all phenotypic traits of specific diseases is another limitation factor.</s><s>In this regard, the collaboration with ontology developers in order to expand with further ontological terms and, hence, to align ontology representations with the current knowledge is needed.</s><s>This active translational dialogue among the actors in the clinical and research domains is important both to stimulate the use of standards in patient registries and to ensure an appropriate description of the current domain knowledge in biomedical ontologies.</s><s>In this challenging scenario, the mapping of clinical terms has to be undertaken according to quality procedures.</s></p><p><s>Nevertheless, several organizations are publishing common data element models in order to solve the interoperability problem among different patient registries.</s><s>Although these efforts ensure interoperability within the selected domain, interoperability across application domain boundaries is not automatically possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, there are over 600 rare disease registries in Europe alone, the majority not currently using a specific ontology.</s><s>Although there is an overall desire in the community to increase harmonization, there is a lack of time and resources to change established procedures.</s></p><p><s>Second, convincing data owners of the true value of sharing their registry data is a cumbersome task.</s><s>In addition to the privacy and security issues, data owners fail to realize the incentives underlying the sharing of their data.</s><s>To overcome this in the future, financing projects should include clear guidelines to mandate the anonymous sharing of data for research purposes.</s><s>Including these political policies would shed a new light on the benefits of sharing rare disease patient data with a broader community, truly unlocking its potential.</s></p></div>
