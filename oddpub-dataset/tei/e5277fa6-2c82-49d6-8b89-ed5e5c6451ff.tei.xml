<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Stability of the stereoisomers.</s><s>For complex containing four optical centers, there are sixteen possible stereoisomers or eight pairs of enantiomers.</s><s>Because physical properties of enantiomers are indistinguishable (except for the interaction with polarized light), we consider only 8 stereoisomers.</s><s>DFT calculations at BLYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level of theory were carried out to gain more insight into the relative stability of the considered isomers in the singlet ground state (S0).</s><s>Calculations revealed that all isomers belong to the less than 16 kcal/mol energetic range (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</s><s>Studied set of structures can be divided into two groups: low-lying (RSRR, RSRS, RRSS, and RRSR) and high-lying (RSSS, RSSR, RRRS, and RRRR) isomers.</s><s>In the lowest triplet state (T1), energy profile for the studied isomers is very similar to the singlet one.</s><s>RSRR isomer exhibit the greatest stability, while RRRR is less stable with the energy difference between them of about 14 kcal/mol.</s><s>Regardless of isomer, the singlet state is the lowest-lying state.</s><s>The S0-T1 gap is characterized by a value of 28-30 kcal/mol depending on the isomer (detailed data about relative stabilities of isomers in S0 and T1 states are given in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>, SI).</s><s>According to Martin and co-workers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> relative stability of isomers is determined by two factors acting in different directions:</s></p><p><s>(1) strong repulsive interactions between lone pair of Cl ligand and π-system of phenyl ring and (2) stabilizing CH-π interactions between CH3 group of methylated cyclopentadienyl ligand and π-system of phenyl ring. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref></s><s>e studied complexes are unique objects.</s><s>From one side, four chiral centers open a variety of potential opportunities in the field of (stereo)chemical transformations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>From the other side, a chemical structure of complexes itself, namely the fact that electron acceptors (fullerene C60 and Cp* ) are located at opposite ends with respect to metallic center, creates the prerequisites for the formation of entirely different CT states with localization of the exciton on different and remote from each other fragments.</s></p><p><s>Usually for analyzing photoinduced electron transfer (ET) one uses two fragment model consisting of donor and acceptor sides.</s><s>In this study, a multi-fragment model is applied to examine in detail the role of metal atom and different ligands in ET.</s><s>Each system has been split into 6 fragments -Ir and Cl atoms, pyrrolidine moiety with the carboxyl group, as well as phenyl (Ph), pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) and fullerene C60 fragment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</s><s>Cp* and fullerene fragments exhibit electron acceptor properties, whereas Ir, Cl, Ph and pyrrolidine bridge fragments are electron donors of different power.</s><s>Analysis of excited states was carried out in terms of excitation delocalization, charge transfer (CT) and charge separation (CS) contributions.</s><s>In the studied complexes, several types of excited states can be distinguished: locally excited states (LE), where exciton is mostly localized on a single fragment (in our systems all low-lying LE states are confined on C60), excited states corresponding to CT and mixed states, having comparable contributions of LE and CT.</s><s>Below we considered 50 lowest singlets and triplets excited states for each of isomers.</s></p><p><s>Singlet states.</s><s>Predicted 50 lowest singlet excited states for each of eight studied complexes belong to the energy band from 2.4 to 4.6 eV (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) in the gas-phase.</s><s>Several lowest excited states are LE states with electronic transitions occurring on C60 fragment.</s><s>For all isomers, first excited state is mostly associated with HOMO-LUMO transitions.</s><s>First states demonstrating charge separating characteristics have been found in 3.0 -3.2 eV region (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) dependent on isomer.</s><s>Specified CT states are not pure with respect to the involved fragments, i.e. two fragments simultaneously acts as an electron density donor.</s><s>In each case, denoted states correspond to the transition of the electron density from metallic center including Cl ligand to Cp* moiety.</s><s>Further, in the energy range of 4.2-4.6 eV the CT states where electronic transitions metallic center including Cl ligand to fullerene C60.In the range of 4.4 -4.6 e, electronic transitions from fragment 3 and 4 to fullerene C60 are occurred.</s><s>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>Singlet excitation energies (EX, eV) major orbital contributions (HOMO(H) -LUMO(L)) and its weight, oscillator strength (f) and charge transfer values (CT, e), charge values on Ir atom in ground state (q(Ir) GS) and changes in Ir charge state (Δq Ir, e) for the studied stereoisomers of Ir half-sandwich fullerene C60 complex in the gas-phase.</s><s>For each transition involved fragments or fragments whose contribution is maximal (Assoc.</s><s>fragments) are shown.</s><s>Thus, for the described system, depending on the excitation energy it is possible to populate charge transfer states with the different character.</s><s>This can have a significant impact on the behavior of the complex in photoinduced catalytic reactions.</s><s>However, transitions between molecular orbitals corresponding to the aforementioned (F1 → F5 and F1 → F6) CT states are characterized by the relatively small probability for the mentioned transitions.</s><s>On average, oscillator strength for F1 → F5 transitions varies from 0.001 to 0.01, while for F1 → F6 it is from 0.01 to 0.03.</s><s>Low oscillator strength values limit potential usage of this complexes.</s><s>Then, we decided to check out the "brightest" transitions associated with CT states.</s><s>For this complex, the strongest oscillator strength is about 0.09 -0.17, dependently on particular isomer.</s><s>Surprisingly, we have found that only for RSRR isomer most intense transition is relate to CT state in which electron density is transferred from Ir to fullerene C60.</s><s>In every other cases, transitions with highest oscillator strength were connected with pyrrolidine bridge (F3) or phenyl ring (F4) to fullerene moiety (F6) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).Visualization of the described above locally excited states and CT states characterized by F1 → F5 as well as F1 → F6 transitions for RSRR isomer are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</s><s>The electron density changes observed on Ir atom clearly demonstrate the peculiarity of RSRR stereoisomer.</s><s>In accordance with Mulliken population analysis, the change of Ir charge in case of RSRR isomer is 0.11 e, which is almost twice larger than for any other isomer.</s><s>At the same time, taking into account that charge on Ir atom in the ground state is about 0.38-0.40</s><s>e, the indicated changes can be considered as significant.</s></p><p><s>In other words, depending on the isomers we can efficiently generate CT excited states of different nature.</s><s>Such stereospecificity towards photoinduced electron transfer provides an attractive pathway for photocatalytic reactions, where only one of the stereoisomers demonstrate activity while others remain inactive.</s></p><p><s>Triplet states.</s><s>First 50 triplet excited states have been studied as well.</s><s>Low-lying triplet LE T 1 and CT T states show behavior similar to those in the corresponding singlet states.</s><s>Namely, first triplet excited state is mostly associated with the excitation localized at fullerene C60 moiety and corresponds to HOMO to LUMO+1 transition, while HOMO-LUMO excitation leads to the 3 rd triplet LE.</s><s>Similarly to singlet exited states the lowest charge separated state corresponds to the transition of the electron density from metallic center including Cl ligand to Cp* moiety.</s><s>In contrast to singlet excited states, no one of considered triplet CT excited states does not correspond to electronic transitions from Ir fragment to C60.</s><s>Detailed information concerning triplet excited states as well as frontier molecular orbitals representing LE T and CT T states are given in Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S2</ref>, SI.</s></p></div>
