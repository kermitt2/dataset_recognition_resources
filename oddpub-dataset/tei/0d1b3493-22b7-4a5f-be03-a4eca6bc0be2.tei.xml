<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The studies presented here establish that the Ca V 2.2 antagonist, conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide/prialt), effectively blocks inflammatory pain in a mouse model of induced arthritis, but also reveal that this blockade severely enhances the ongoing joint inflammation and deformation.</s><s>We show for the first time the deleterious impact of this type of analgesics on ongoing inflammation, suggesting that the activity of Ca V 2.2 channels in nociceptor neurons that innervate the injured joint is ultimately beneficial to re-establish the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and of the osteoclast-activator RANKL.</s></p><p><s>In arthritis, as in other inflammatory disorders, pain intensity does not necessarily reflect disease activity, since pain often persists in patients with adequately controlled inflammation.</s><s>Indeed, inflammation in the joint causes peripheral and central sensitization, which is

devastating consequences of administering Ca V 2.2 inhibitors to patients suffering from arthritis even if these inhibitors provide pain relief.</s><s>Our findings are reminiscent of the risks and benefits observed with antibodies against neurotrophin nerve-growth factor (NGF).</s><s>NGF, similarly to Ca V 2.2, is a key regulator of peripheral nociception that mediates release of neurogenic

analyse the local, micromilieu (synovial fluid) for key molecules that are up-or down regulated in the absence of pain sensing, therefore we can only speculate on the mechanisms involved.</s><s>Other studies suggest that Ca V 2.2 is involved in regulating monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), a cytokine that recruits monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells to the sites of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s>In this context, CGRP has been shown to inhibit IL-1β-induced endogenous MCP-1 secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>.</s><s>These

severe bone damage.</s></p><p><s>There is clear evidence that the local release of proinflammatory neuropeptides from peripheral terminals of afferent nerve fibers contributes to the development of

particularly in joints with heavy inflammatory infiltration, suggesting that the articular expression of nociceptive neuropeptides may be regulated differently at different stages of arthritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</s><s>It is possible that the basal activity of Ca V 2.2 is necessary for the proper homeostasis of the system.</s><s>For instance, it has been speculated that inhibition of Ca 2+ currents at sensory nerve endings may directly influence their sensitivity by changing the spike frequency adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>.</s><s>It is also possible that other signalling events may take place upon reduction of Ca V 2.2 calcium influx.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, blocking Ca V 2.2 -mediated pain neurotransmission in our arthritis model amplified inflammatory events to such an extent that RANKL expression was enhanced, thus promoting osteoclast differentiation and activation and concomitant bone erosion and deformation.</s><s>Despite their obvious efficacy, the use of MVIIA peptide toxins and derivatives to alleviate pain in patients with inflammatory arthritis could be very harmful and ought to be assessed with extreme care.</s><s>Further insight into the role of Ca V 2.2 channel activity and hyperactivity in the regulation of the complex crosstalk between the immune system and the nociceptive pathways might provide safer analgesic alternatives for the treatment of this most common cause of disability.</s></p></div>
