<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study design, participants and study conduct</head><p><s>Twenty-five healthy male subjects underwent 90 days of 6 head-down tilt bed-rest (HDT) as part of the 'Long Term Bed Rest' (LTBR) Study at MEDES in Toulouse, France.</s><s>The LTBR Study was supported by the European, French and Japanese space agencies (ESA, CNES and NASDA).</s><s>The LTBR Study was approved by the Toulouse I ethics committee (CCPPRB Toulouse I) of the Rangueil University Hospital as well as the ethical committee of the Free University of Berlin.</s><s>All subjects gave their informed written consent.</s><s>Subjects were randomised to either a group performing high-intensity eccentric-concentric resistance exercise on the 'flywheel' exercise device (flywheel group; n=9; mean(SD) age, height and weight: 31.0 (5.5) years, 1.75 (0.05) m and 70.9 (5.4) kg) or a group that performed no exercise (inactive group; n=16; 32.5 (3.4) years, 1.74 (0.04) m, 70.3 (6.1) kg).</s><s>Diet was strictly monitored and controlled during the in-house periods.</s><s>Meals were prepared by the hospital kitchen to achieve energy intake with 30% fat, 15% protein and 55% carbohydrate and this was supervised by a dietician.</s><s>Data on subjects' physical activity levels showed that 90 days after bed-rest, subjects' total physical activity scores were significantly less than before bed-rest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Countermeasure exercise</head><p><s>The flywheel exercise programme was designed to target muscle and bone in the lower limbs.</s><s>The exercise device was designed to be gravity-independent.</s><s>During the concentric contraction phase, the energy applied to the foot plate by the subject was transferred to the flywheels via a strap which was wound around the flywheels.</s><s>Then, during the eccentric phase, the rotating flywheels provided resistance.</s><s>Repetitions were performed as one continuous movement cycle, that is, movement was not ceased between each repetition.</s><s>Prior to bed-rest all subjects performed two familiarisation sessions with the training apparatus on 2 days separated by 4-6 days.</s><s>In the first session, subjects practised the manoeuvres on the flywheel device at low to moderate effort intensities and in the second session, subjects were progressed to putting in maximum effort.</s><s>During bed-rest, the flywheel group performed supine leg press exercises (4 sets of 7 repetitions, 2 min between sets; targeting the hip and knee extensor groups) with then 5 min rest and then calf-raise exercises (4 sets of 14 repetitions, 2 min between sets; targeting plantar flexors) every third day from the fifth day of bed-rest onwards.</s><s>At the start of each set of exercises, two submaximal manoeuvres of the action (ie, leg press or calf-raise) were performed and these were immediately followed by the prescribed number of eccentric-concentric repetitions at maximum contraction.</s><s>The subject was encouraged to put maximum effort into each concentric-eccentric loading cycle.</s><s>After maximal concentric contraction at the initiation of the movement, the subject was instructed to start eccentric contraction (deceleration) once half of the range of motion was passed with then maximal effort into an eccentric contraction towards the end of the range of motion.</s><s>Electrogoniometers positioned at the knee and ankle provided instantaneous feedback on joint position via a screen positioned in the subject's field of view.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Magnetic resonance imaging</head><p><s>A 1.0T Siemens Somatom Impact (Erlangen, Germany) scanner was used to conduct MRI before bed-rest (Baseline), on day 27 (HDT27) and day 89 (HDT89) of bed-rest, and then 13 days (R+13), 90 days (R+90), 180 days (R+180) and 360 days (R+360) after bed-rest during the recovery phase.</s><s>Both lower limbs, starting at the hip joint and extending to the feet, were scanned (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Images were then stored for offline analysis.</s><s>To blind the operator (DLB) to group and study date, each data set was coded with a random number (obtained from www. random.org).</s><s>The operator used ImageJ (http://rsb.</s><s>info.nih.gov/ij/) to measure the area of muscles of the lower limb in every image on the right side of the body (see online supplementary figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For the quadratus femoris and obturator internus muscles, based on our prior data <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> it was deemed necessary to measure both left and right sides with the results averaged prior to further analysis.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Countermovement jump</head><p><s>For the comparison of changes in countermovement jump performance to muscle atrophy we used data from previously published work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> where detailed methodology of the countermovement jump test was reported.</s><s>For the purpose of the correlation analyses, only data on percentage change between baseline and first testing session after bed-rest (day 3 after bed-rest; n=25) and the last testing session in the recovery phase (180 days postbed-rest; n=24) were used.</s><s>We examined peak jump power; similar results are seen when assessing peak jump height or acceleration.</s><s>The reproducibility of countermovement jump power in adult and elderly subjects is excellent <ref type="bibr">21 22</ref> with data from our own laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> on 24 men aged 20-45 years tested 4 days apart showing a between-day correlation of 0.93 for countermovement jump power.</s><s>Percentage change in peak jump power versus before bed-rest was used in correlation analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p><s>Analysis was done on an 'intent-to-treat' (ITT) approach.</s><s>For the primary analysis, data were converted to fractional change in muscle volume and compared with the prebed-rest value.</s><s>To examine whether the rates of atrophy differed between groups, non-linear mixed-effects modelling was used to calculate exponential decay rates per week of bed-rest (e k * weeks ; where k is the decay rate coefficient and weeks is the week of bedrest).</s><s>A factor of 'group', with subsequent analysis of variance (ANOVA), was examined to determine whether rate of muscle atrophy differed significantly between groups.</s><s>To examine the recovery of the musculature after bed-rest, the data on whole muscle volume were used.</s><s>A 'study-date' effect with a priori contrasts comparing each time point to baseline was evaluated.</s><s>Linear mixed-effects models were implemented.</s><s>For correlation analyses, Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between percentage change in muscle volume and percentage change in countermovement jump power.</s><s>An a level of 0.05 was taken for statistical significance.</s><s>To guard against false positives, all p values were adjusted by the false discovery rate method.</s><s>The 'R' statistical environment (V.3.0.2, www.r-project.org) was used for all analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>One flywheel subject ceased the training protocol after 7 weeks bed-rest due to a previously unreported knee injury, but he completed the bed-rest study phase.</s><s>This subject was treated as a flywheel subject in the ITT analysis.</s><s>Data from one inactive subject were lost on HDT29.</s><s>Two inactive subjects did not attend on R +90 and one of these also did not attend scanning on R+180.</s><s>One flywheel subject did not return for the final scanning session on R+360.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects in the inactive group</head><p><s>In the inactive subjects, the soleus and gastrocnemius medialis showed the fastest rates of muscle atrophy (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) both losing 28% of their volume by end of bed-rest (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>This was followed by the remaining muscles of the lower leg (with the exception of the anterior tibial muscles), vasti, biceps femoris long head and semimembranosus (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The other members of the hamstrings, semitendinosus and biceps femoris short head, while atrophying, did not show as rapid atrophy of other members of the hamstrings.</s><s>Of the muscles localised at the hip joint, quadratus femoris atrophied the fastest and of the medial thigh muscles, the greatest atrophy was seen in adductor magnus.</s></p><p><s>Impact of flywheel exercise ANOVA showed that flywheel exercise significantly reduced the rate of atrophy of the posterior calf muscles soleus (p&lt;0.001;</s><s>figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), gastrocnemius medialis (p&lt;0.001),</s><s>gastrocnemius lateralis (p=0.02) and tibialis posterior with flexor digitorum longus (p=0.04).</s><s>At the thigh, flywheel exercise reduced atrophy of the vasti (p&lt;0.001) and adductor magnus muscles (p&lt;0.001).</s><s>Lower gluteus maximus and rectus femoris atrophied significantly in the inactive group and not in the flywheel group, but the differences between the groups were not statistically significant on ANOVA (p&gt;0.07).</s><s>Similarly, gracilis atrophied significantly in the flywheel group but not in the inactive group, however the difference between groups in the rates of atrophy was not significant (p=0.28).</s><s>The flywheel exercise had no impact on atrophy of the hamstrings or other muscles of the thigh and hip.</s></p><p><s>Long-term recovery of muscle volume after 90 days bed-rest study Of the muscles that atrophied during bed-rest, significant atrophy was still present 13 days after bed-rest (tables 1 and 2).</s><s>By 90 days after 90 days bed-rest, all muscles returned to their prebed-rest volumes.</s><s>In the inactive subjects only, some muscles showed hypertrophy in the months after bed-rest.</s><s>Specifically, at the hip, adductor brevis was increased in volume on 180 days (+6.0%, p=0.008) and 360 days (+4.9%, p=0.040) of recovery and obturator externus also showed greater volume in recovery (90 days: +8.6%, p=0.004; 180 days: +7.6%, p=0.007; 360 days: +6.4%, p=0.009).</s><s>In the thigh, semimembranosus (180 days: +2.7%, p=0.019; 360 days: +4.3%, p=0.020) and sartorius (180 days: 3.8%, p=0.023; 360 days: +5.0%, p=0.010) were hypertrophied in the long term after bed-rest.</s><s>In the calf, soleus (180 days: +3.9%, p&lt;0.001; 360 days: +4.3%, p=0.004) and medial gastrocnemius (360 days: +3.9%, p=0.040) also showed increased volume late in recovery.</s><s>This effect was not seen in the flywheel group (table 1,2; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>The current study permits some important insights into countermeasure exercise prescription.</s><s>The flywheel exercise countermeasure was effective, compared with control, in preventing or reducing atrophy in the monoarticular knee extensors (vasti), mono articular hip extensors (adductor magnus) and ankle dorsiflexors/toe flexors.</s><s>The actual exercise time was 7-9 min 'time under tension' with 20 min total training time including rest breaks.</s><s>Importantly, these findings underscore <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> that a short duration, high load, resistance exercise programme can be very effective in reducing muscle atrophy in bed-rest.</s><s>Previous studies that have implemented low load, non-specific muscle exercises, were unsuccessful at reducing muscle atrophy: whole body vibration in standing in a squat position without exercise did not impact lower limb muscle atrophy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> nor did whole body vibration implemented in supine position prevent spinal muscle atrophy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s>Furthermore, exercise protocols involving aerobic-based cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> and lower body negative pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> were largely ineffective at reducing lower limb muscle atrophy.</s><s>An ergometerbased cycling exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> can be effective in reducing lower limb suspension induced muscle atrophy when higher intensities, and hence need for higher force muscle contraction, are implemented.</s></p><p><s>The countermeasure programme did not have an impact on atrophy in the hamstrings, which are important for ambulation.</s><s>Of the hamstrings, semimembranosus and biceps femoris long head are primarily hip extensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> with semitendinosus playing more of a role in control of knee flexion. <ref type="bibr">29 30</ref></s><s>In contrast, another research group <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> reported complete prevention of hamstring muscle atrophy due to their resistance exercise protocol in 20 days bed-rest when the leg press exercise was performed up to 110 of hip flexion.</s><s>This underscores the need for greater specificity of exercise prescription for the hamstrings.</s></p><p><s>Maintenance of the calf musculature in disuse bed-rest via exercise has, in a number of studies, proven difficult.</s><s>In the current study the atrophy of the calf muscles was significantly reduced, but muscle atrophy still occurred: 20% of soleus muscle volume was lost in the flywheel group compared with 29% loss in the inactive group at the end of bed-rest.</s><s>Prior work does suggest that higher volumes of calf muscle exercise do appear to have a greater protective effect: when resistive vibration exercise including calf press exercises was performed three times a week, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> 15% loss in soleus muscle volume after 56 days of bed-rest was observed, compared with 7% loss in soleus muscle volume after 56 days of bed-rest in another study 2 where resistive vibration exercise was performed 11 times a week.</s><s>However, for the calf muscles, there is evidence in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> that attaining hypertrophy in ambulant exercise studies is more difficult with standard hypertrophy protocols than it is for the knee extensors.</s><s>This is in line with the notion that muscles that are typically load-bearing in daily life are more difficult to hypertrophy than nonload-bearing muscles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s>Investigation of other exercise modes, such as treadmill running or jumping exercises, is needed to improve exercise prescription for preventing disuse atrophy of the calf musculature.</s></p><p><s>Recovery of muscle volume occurred in all muscles by 90 days after prolonged bed-rest.</s><s>We observed, however, increase of muscle volume over and beyond the prebed-rest baseline volume in the inactive subjects in the long term after bed-rest.</s><s>Importantly, this effect was observed in major muscle groups and not just in minor and/or small muscle groups.</s><s>The time subjects spent lying supine prior to MR-scanning was strictly controlled in this study.</s><s>Also, this effect was seen only in the inactive subjects, not in the flywheel exercise subjects (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>We can therefore rule out a systematic, confounding, effect particular to the current study.</s><s>In further support of our interpretation, peripheral</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Continued</head><p><s>quantitative CT examinations were performed in the same collective <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> and these investigations also showed significant increases in lower leg muscle area 90 days and beyond after bed-rest.</s><s>After another 56 days bedrest study performed at a different facility, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> the authors observed a statistical trend towards an overshoot of calf musculature area recovery after bed-rest, again specific to the inactive group, but not the exercise group, of that study.</s><s>While we cannot be certain that this muscle hypertrophy involved true muscle fibre hypertrophy, we did not see any association between these muscle volume increases in the long term after bed-rest with improvements in countermovement jump performance.</s></p><p><s>Finally, of the muscles active in the hip joint, the quadratus femoris showed the fastest rate and extent, of atrophy.</s><s>When we observed this in a prior bedrest study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> we were not sure if this was a chance finding.</s><s>In a recent cadaver study, one group concluded that quadratus femoris is a primary extensor of the hip when it is in a flexed position. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref></s><s>n line with this, recent fine-wire electromyography findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> found that quadratus femoris shows a peak of activity in walking and running during the first part of stance (ie, when the flexed hip begins to bear load) and also in late swing phase in running, presumably to decelerate the flexing hip during late swing.</s><s>Overall, the recent finding shows that quadratus femoris is important for load-bearing and control of extension force at the hip joint, particularly in a flexed position.</s><s>This helps to understand why quadratus femoris in particular is affected in disuse.</s></p><p><s>It is important to mention limitations of the current work.</s><s>As is typical of bed-rest studies in Europe, only one gender was included in the study in an effort to reduce intersubject variability.</s><s>As such, we cannot be certain that our results are applicable to female bed-rest participants.</s><s>The number of subjects was limited due to logistical and financial restraints.</s><s>Due to the limited number of subjects, some non-significant results for the effect of the exercise protocol may represent false negatives.</s><s>For some smaller muscles, such as adductor brevis and obturator externus, reproducibility of the measurements is not as high as for larger muscle groups and non-significant findings for these muscles might be false negatives.</s><s>Even though the current study provides important evidence for exercise prescription in astronauts, application of the current protocols to spaceflight could not occur on a 1:1 basis.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, the current study investigated the impact of 90 days bed-rest on atrophy of the muscles of the lower limb, the impact of a flywheel exercise countermeasure, and the recovery of the musculature after  bed-rest.</s><s>The greatest rates and extent of atrophy was seen in the soleus and gastrocnemius medialis, followed by the gastrocnemius lateralis, peroneals, vasti, biceps femoris long head, other posterior calf musculature, semimembranosus, anterior tibial muscles, adductor magnus and quadratus femoris.</s><s>The flywheel exercise countermeasure was effective, compared with control, in preventing or reducing atrophy in the vasti, adductor magnus and ankle dorsiflexors/toe flexors.</s><s>Thus, a short-duration high-intensity resistance exercise programme performed every third day can be effective in preventing muscle atrophy in disuse.</s><s>The countermeasure was, however, not effective in preventing atrophy of the hamstrings, medial thigh muscles, ankle evertors and dorsiflexors.</s><s>Finally, in the long term after bed-rest we saw that inactive subjects exhibited an overshoot of muscle volume recovery in some muscle groups compared with before bed-rest.</s><s>Strong positive correlations between calf and thigh muscle atrophy were seen at the end of bed-rest, implying a dependence of jump performance loss on atrophy in these muscles.</s><s>Since no positive correlations were seen 180 days after bed-rest, this implies that increased muscle volume seen in the inactive control group long-term after bed-rest (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>; tables 1 and 2) was not associated with functional benefits.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 Atrophy and impact of exercise on muscle atrophy values are mean (SD) time constants ('k') of exponential decay of muscle volume per week of bed-rest.</s><s>*: p&lt;0.05;
