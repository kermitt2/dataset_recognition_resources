<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>With the present study, we provide data on the agreement of estimates of renal function based on plasma creatinine or cystatin C with measured endogenous creatinine clearance in ICU patients.</s><s>In accordance with other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, we observed extreme values of measured endogenous creatinine clearance in patients with plasma creatinine concentrations below the upper reference limit (≤0.8 mg/ dL for women, ≤1.1 mg/dL for men), clearly illustrating the  need for a more reliable quantification of renal function in this population.</s></p><p><s>Although the bias of all three estimates appeared acceptable, it is obvious that their precision is limited and may be completely misleading with regard to the actual renal function.</s><s>Both creatinine based estimates tended to overestimate low or normal CL CR -values, which was also reflected by a low sensitivity to detect patients with reduced renal function.</s><s>In this range, the cystatin C based Hoek formula was significantly more precise, and notably more sensitive with similar specificity.</s><s>A plausible explanation for this is that cystatin C does not depend on muscle mass, unlike creatinine.</s><s>All three formulae were derived from non-critically ill populations, and imply certain relationships between measures of body size (weight or BSA) and the production of cystatin C or creatinine.</s><s>Loss of muscle mass due to immobilisation and catabolism is certainly a prominent feature in many critically ill patients, and necessarily affects the accuracy of creatinine based estimates.</s><s>Cystatin C might therefore offer an advantage for assessing renal function both in clinical routine and research, when a timed urine collection or the clearance of an exogenous marker is not available.</s><s>However, its exact significance must be further explored and defined, also to justify the much higher costs (in our institution ca.</s><s>10€ per determination compared with 0.50€ for creatinine).</s><s>Although there are several reports on cystatin C-guided therapy with vancomycin or aminoglycosides <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, such informations are generally lacking for most drugs.</s><s>Further open issues are the availability of standardised commercial assays, and confounding effects of various disease states.</s><s>In contrast to initial reports, the production of cystatin C is not entirely constant either <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>In the context of critical care, particularly inflammation, glucocorticoids and dysthyroid states could influence its levels, but also preexisting conditions such as obesity and smoking.</s><s>Unfortunately, these confounding conditions were not assessed in our study, but given their rather generic nature it appears safe to assume that many patients with one or more of these conditions were represented in the study.</s></p><p><s>Baptista and colleagues made similar observations in 54 critically ill patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Although patients with plasma creatinine &gt;1.3 mg/dL were excluded, 8 h-CL CR ranged from 16.2 to 378.3 mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 , and the Cockcroft-Gault, the MDRD and the CKD-EPI formulae were unreliable (cystatin C was not determined).</s><s>Villa and colleagues compared the reciprocals of plasma cystatin C and creatinine with 24 h-CL CR in 50 critically ill patients at risk for developing acute renal failure, and reported a much stronger correlation for 1/cystatin C than for 1/creatinine <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, Delanaye and colleagues reported data from a study in 47 critically ill patients, in which a true gold standard, iohexol clearance, was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Cystatin C was superior to creatinine to detect patients with GFR &lt;60 mL/min, but patients with a plasma creatinine concentration &gt;1.5 mg/dL were excluded from the study.</s><s>In general, our results agree with these previous findings, but significantly extend the body of evidence in a large cohort (n = 100) of unselected (with regard to renal function) ICU patients.</s></p><p><s>Of concern is the lack of agreement of any of the three formulae with high CL CR -values, and their low sensitivity to detect patients with augmented renal clearance (CL CR &gt; 130 mL/min/1.73</s><s>m 2 ), who are at risk for inappropriately low drug concentrations, e.g. of antibiotics.</s><s>This again calls to mind that none of the formulae was designed for critically ill patients, but rather for detection and followup of chronic renal disease.</s><s>When augmented renal clearance is suspected, it seems advisable to rely on the endogenous creatinine clearance rather than on estimates.</s></p><p><s>Several limitations must be mentioned.</s><s>Our data were extracted as a secondary analysis from pharmacokinetic studies on renally eliminated antibiotic agents.</s><s>Reliable quantification of renal function was therefore an important feature of the study designs, but some aspects were neglected, which would be necessary for a more thorough assessment of renal function parameters in critically ill patients.</s><s>For one, renal function in critically ill patients is certainly dynamic.</s><s>Glomerular filtration (as only the most important part of "renal function" in the context of drug dosing) can rapidly change due to e.g.</s><s>hemodynamic alterations or systemic inflammation, two common events in ICU patients.</s><s>Patients' conditions were clinically judged to be "stable", but more formal criteria (e.g. for vasopressor doses, fluid balance or urine output) would have been preferable.</s><s>Second, the length of the urine collection periods were quite variable between patients, being only ~2 hours in some cases.</s><s>Although such short periods have been reported to adequately substitute longer intervals (24 hours) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the results would be easier to interprete if a uniform protocol had been used for all patients, even if our sensitivity analysis did not show an  influence of the duration of urine collection.</s><s>Finally, endogenous creatinine clearance is also only an approximation of glomerular filtration.</s><s>Besides free glomerular filtration, it is also subject to tubular secretion which becomes quantitatively more important when GFR decreases <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>Tubular secretion of creatinine may be differentially affected by chronic or acute renal disease, and can be inhibited by a number of drugs (e.g.</s><s>trimethoprim and cimetidine), which leads to a lower endogenous creatinine clearance despite constant GFR <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s>(In fact, blocking tubular secretion of creatinine by coadministration of cimetidine has been suggested as a mean to improve the accuracy of endogenous creatinine clearance measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.)</s><s>Cimetidine is not in use in the participating ICUs, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is administered only rarely (for prevention or treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii infections); the prevalence of specific chronic disease (e.g.</s><s>glomerulonephritis) was certainly minimal in our population of surgical ICU patients, whereas both degenerative loss of renal function and acute kidney injury probably accounted for the large part of patients with reduced CL CR .</s><s>Unfortunately, however, a more detailed analysis is not possible because these informations were not systematically recorded.</s><s>The use of a true gold standard, i.e. clearance of an exogenous marker such as inulin or iothalamate, would certainly have been desirable, but is unlikely to be done in clinical routine or on a large scale in clinical studies.</s><s>As a compromise of validity and practicability, the use of endogenous creatinine clearance as reference, as done in the present study, seems therefore justified.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>We assessed the agreement of the Cockcroft-Gault formula, the CKD-EPI formula (both based on plasma creatinine) and the Hoek formula (based on cystatin C) with measured creatinine clearance in a comparatively large and unselected cohort of surgical ICU patients.</s><s>In accordance with previous findings, extreme values of creatinine clearance were observed in patients with plasma creatinine concentrations below the upper reference limit.</s><s>The Hoek formula was significantly more precise than the other two formulae.</s><s>The value of cystatin C for clinical decision making and to guide drug dosing in ICU patients should be further defined (e.g. by inclusion in pharmacokinetic studies), before it may find a role in clinical routine.</s><s>However, identification and quantification of augmented renal clearance without urine collection remains problematic.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>°Measured endogenous creatinine clearance (normalised to 1.73 m 2 body surface area): °CL CR = (urine volume × urine creatinine)/(collection time x plasma creatinine)/BSA × 1.73 °According to Cockcroft-Gault [7] (normalised to 1.73 m 2 body surface area): °eCL CG = (140age x weight)/(72 x plasma creatinine)/BSA x 1.73 x 0.85 for women</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
