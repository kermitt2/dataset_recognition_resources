<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited chronic and life limiting condition among Caucasians <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> with estimated between 70,000 and 100,000 patients worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Due to advances in diagnoses and clinical care, the great majority of the affected children nowadays survive into adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, CF as progressive and multi-organ disease impacts the functioning of the lungs and the pancreas, and requires an extensive and time-consuming therapy.</s><s>Maintaining the daily diseasemanagement is a challenge and coping with disease progression puts a high burden on the patients themselves and especially on their caregivers.</s><s>Although the majority of caregivers cope well with their child's disease, parents of children with chronic conditions are known to be at high risk for developing psychosocial problems or disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and for impairments in their quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>There is also substantial evidence of impaired life satisfaction and of a high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression among caregivers of children with CF <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>Within the context of chronic conditions parents are confronted with real threats, which might be overwhelming and may lead to difficulties to cope with everyday life and problems in the management of their child's treatment routines.</s><s>Fear of disease progression is known to be a relevant cause of distress in patients with chronic somatic conditions or their partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>It is likely an issue for parental caregivers as well.</s><s>In the long term the caregivers' illness-related distress may impair adherence to treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and thus result in worse disease outcomes in the child <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Although there is some evidence for especially cognitivebehavioral and problem solving interventions for parents of children with chronic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> studies investigating interventions for parents of children with CF are scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Although the European consensus about standards of care in patients with cystic fibrosis claims integrated psychosocial care in CF centers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, just a fractional amount of parents with clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety and/or depression received some kind of mental health care in a German study <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, indicating limited utilization and access to integrated psychosocial care.</s><s>Du to unresolved reimbursement problems only a minority of German CF centers are able to directly offer psychological interventions to caregivers, and referrals to mental health services are impeded by long waiting lists.</s><s>Barriers to caregivers' treatment comprise long distances to the CF center, restricted time capacities to care for themselves due to the demanding management of their child's disease, or less awareness of the own well-being compared to the well-being of the child.</s></p><p><s>A wide range of studies on several mental disorders indicate that web-based interventions are efficacious and effective opportunities to overcome the mentioned barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s>Research on web-based interventions in the context of pediatric chronic conditions is increasing.</s><s>Studies on asthma or diabetes focused on optimization of disease management or on the patients themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Only few studies addressed caregivers.</s><s>Some of those studies examined online peer support, for example for parents of children with asthma and allergies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, or educational programs to support parents following pediatric injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, or web-based problem solving intervention for families with children with traumatic brain injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>However, no study so far investigated a web-based psychotherapeutic intervention solely for caregivers to address parental distress, related to the chronic condition of their child.</s></p><p><s>Due to the relevance of accessible psychotherapeutic support for caregivers of children with chronic conditions, the aim of the current study was to develop a web-based intervention for distressed caregivers of minors with CF which enables them to better cope with fears and demands of their child's illness and evaluate it within a pilot study.</s><s>We focused on the following research questions: First, we examined whether a web-based cognitive-behavioral writing therapy is feasible.</s><s>Secondly, we investigated whether the intervention is efficacious to reduce symptoms of anxiety from pre-treatment to post-treatment (primary outcome).</s><s>Furthermore, we expected that fear of disease progression and symptoms of depression would also decrease, parental quality of life (PQoL), as well as effective parental coping would increase.</s><s>At least, we hypothesized that the benefit of treatment would persist until three months after completion of the intervention.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial design</head><p><s>This study was conducted as a single-group intervention study.</s><s>Primary outcome were symptoms of anxiety.</s><s>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Ulm.</s><s>All participants provided their written informed consent.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and procedure</head><p><s>The study was conducted through a secure internet platform (https://muko-wep.ulmer-onlineklinik.de/).</s><s>Participants were recruited over a period of six months (June 2012 to December 2012) by various ways of distribution of information.</s><s>In collaborating German speaking CF centres, flyers were distributed during routine visits.</s><s>Information about the study was published in a member magazine, on the Facebook page and send via mailing lists of the German Cystic Fibrosis Association.</s></p><p><s>Eligible were caregivers of a child with CF (0-17 years) with clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety (≥8) on the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, being fluent in written German language, and having access to the internet during the intervention.</s><s>Parents needed to be free of psychotic symptoms and suicidality.</s><s>Parents who reported one of those symptoms were immediately contacted by the PI of the study to clarify symptoms and indication for psychiatric care.</s><s>Parents who reported starting or changing of psychotropic medication about six weeks prior or during the intervention period, as well starting a competitive psychotherapy were excluded from the analysis.</s></p><p><s>Interested parental caregivers could register on the study website and then completed questionnaires.</s><s>Parents turning out to be eligible for the study were asked to provide their written informed consent via mail.</s><s>Parents who did not qualify for the study received a message recommending other opportunities to receive support.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention</head><p><s>The web-based psychological support program for caregivers (WEP-CARE) was developed by a clinical expert panel, based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and a review of the literature on families coping with the CF of a child.</s><s>The panel comprised clinicians with expertise in psychological counselling of patients with CF and their caregivers, and a clinician-researcher with expertise in internet-therapy.</s><s>It is designed as web-based cognitivebehavioral writing therapy with three treatment components addressing the following disease-related aspects considered as relevant for caregivers of a child with CF: 1) exposure to thoughts associated with anxiety and enhance cognitive coping with the disease, especially with fears of disease progression, 2) sharing responsibility for the treatment of the child, and 3) increasing self-care.</s></p><p><s>Once a week, one writing assignment should be completed within a timely standard of dealing approximately 45 minutes with the topic.</s><s>The caregivers provided their written responses to nine standardized writing assignments and received individualized feedback to each delivery by their therapist within 48 hours.</s><s>Thus, the communication of participants and interventionists was asynchronous all the time.</s><s>Details of the treatment components and the corresponding writing assignments are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The intervention program was provided by two trained and supervised psychotherapists with expertise in psychosocial care for patients with CF and their families.</s></p><p><s>Usability testing of WEP-CARE was conducted with three caregivers.</s><s>The treatment manual is available from the authors on request.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outcomes</head><p><s>Demographic and medical information were collected at baseline.</s><s>All other questionnaires were administered at baseline, after completion of the last treatment session, and three months after completion of the program.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographic and medical information</head><p><s>The following socio-demographic and medical data were collected by a self-constructed questionnaire: caregivers' age, gender, native language, education level, employment status, living situation, experiences with the internet, and recently received psychological care, as well as the child's age, gender, and the following health-related variables: pulmonary function (FEV 1 %), CF-related diabetes, haemoptysis, pneumothorax, chronic colonization with germs, liver problems, and being on a waiting list for a transplantation.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p><s>The current study aimed to evaluate a newly developed web-based cognitive-behavioral writing therapy for distressed caregivers of children and adolescents with CF.</s><s>Altogether, the results confirm that web-based writing therapy is feasible for parents of children and adolescents with CF and efficacious to reduce distress and improve quality of life.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Feasibility</head><p><s>The aimed recruitment rate of a minimum of 30 parents starting the intervention was achieved within a recruitment period of six months.</s><s>The number of parents, who did not complete the program, was comparable to dropout rates of face-to-face psychotherapy and equal to rates of completers reported for other web-based psychotherapeutic interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Reasons for not completing varied and only one participant reported problems with the setting and the structure of the program.</s><s>The time needed by the caregivers to pass through the whole program was of high range.</s><s>The different duration for completion might be caused by intermediating time consuming demands due to the child's illness as well as by the high workload and daily treatment routine in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, the treatment could be conducted in accordance to the treatment manual.</s><s>Overall, our findings indicate that the program was feasible for the participants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacysymptoms of anxiety</head><p><s>Significant large and clinically relevant effects could be demonstrated on symptoms of anxiety at the end of intervention, as well as at three-month-follow-up.</s><s>On average the caregivers' symptoms of anxiety decreased 4.7 points on the anxiety subscale of the HADS from an  elevated to a normal level.</s><s>This finding is in line with previous studies on web-based CBT for anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> or PTSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Efficacy -fear of disease progression, depression, quality of life, and coping</s></p><p><s>The results show that the caregivers' fear of disease progression and symptoms of depression decreased, and parental quality of life increased between pre-intervention and post-intervention as well as between pre-intervention and 3-month follow-up.</s><s>The significant reduction of both symptom scores indicates that participants as expected learned to cope with perceived fears and threats related to the illness of their child.</s><s>Increase of parental quality of life in the domains 'emotional stability' and 'self-development' is consistent with the three main treatment components of the intervention and with the results of a systematic review on the application, clinical efficacy, and costeffectiveness of internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy, demonstrating large effect sizes for internet-based treatments of depression, anxiety disorders, and healthrelated anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Regarding parental coping, just a trend for increase in effectiveness in coping strategies was found for the subscale 'maintaining social support' at post-treatment.</s><s>Potential explanations are that the CHIP questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> assesses general coping patterns in various situations rather than unique coping strategies and that there was just one treatment component explicitly addressing one of the three coping patterns assessed with the CHIP, namely 'sharing responsibility for treatment'.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strengths and limitations</head><p><s>To our knowledge this is the first study evaluating a web-based psychological intervention for caregivers of a child with CF.</s><s>However, some limitations should be mentioned.</s><s>Due to the pilot character of this study a control group was lacking.</s><s>We are not able to draw a conclusion whether the reported effects are specifically due to the participation on this intervention program.</s><s>We did not investigate superiority of WEP-CARE to usual care, to the spontaneous course of psychological symptoms or to other active comparators.</s><s>The findings should be cautiously generalized to larger populations of caregivers due to the fact that mainly well-educated mothers were reached for participation.</s><s>The requirement of written self-reflection might be associated to the level of education and literacy and therefore could be a barrier for participation for persons with a lower education.</s><s>Gender diversity is often a problem in psychotherapy research, also in other studies on webbased interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, as the lack of financial resources is an important risk factor for poorer health outcomes in pediatric respiratory diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, it should be mentioned that the requirement of internet access could be an additional barrier for those families with low income.</s><s>Limitations of self-report measures of psychological symptoms should be acknowledged.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for further research</head><p><s>Due to the preliminary results of our pilot study, WEP-CARE can be considered a promising approach to support parental caregivers of children and adolescents with CF.</s><s>The findings can be taken as base for further efficacy research and dissemination of the intervention.</s><s>Evidence for the specific efficacy and effectiveness can be aimed when conducting a randomized-controlled trial comparing to other psychological interventions, to usual care, or to no intervention.</s></p><p><s>As previously mentioned, distress and impairments of quality of life in caregivers of children with other pediatric chronic conditions is a well-known issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>, which needs to be addressed.</s><s>Transferability of the WEP-CARE for other rare and chronic diseases indicating the need to provide support to caregivers can be considered.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s>Figure 1 WEP-CARE -CONSORT flow chart of the pilot study.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,63.84,166.79,467.66,547.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
