<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Outlook</head><p><s>This study had several limitations.</s><s>Contrary to findings from an earlier pilot study, the present operationalization of LoDs revealed problems with the continuous response format that had to be mended by dichotomizing responses.</s><s>Moreover, due to the relatively brief assessment period, patients' endorsement of LoDs related to longer-term developments of urinary incontinence could not be investigated.</s><s>Also, this study would have benefited from partner-reports of patients' LoDs to arrive at more proximal predictors of partners' own emotional adaptation to support provision to patients.</s><s>In addition to urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunctions are also a common sequel of radical prostatectomy.</s><s>Future work should consider autonomy limitations due to these sexual dysfunctions.</s><s>To accomplish this, larger time-frames should be considered, as recovery from sexual dysfunctions is less frequent and usually takes longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Resnick et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, future work should study the LoD model within different patient populations who have to come to terms with varying prognoses and speed of decline or recovery.</s></p></div>
