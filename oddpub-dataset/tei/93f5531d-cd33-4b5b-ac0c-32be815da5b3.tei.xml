<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MILE Intervention</head><p><s>The manualized MILE intervention was informed by the Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">28]</ref>, the Critical Thinking and Cultural Affirmation (CTCA) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[29]</ref>, and the Empowerment Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[30]</ref>.</s><s>It is comprised of six 2-h small-group sessions held over 3 weeks and facilitated by two African American men.</s><s>The two sessions focus each sequentially on past, present, and future, encouraging participants to assess how the choices that they have made in the past and the historical and present contexts of their families and communities result in their circumstances in the present, to determine their current HIV and other health risks, and to plan for the future in ways that can lead to healthier lives for themselves and others.</s><s>Participants received $20 for completing each group session in compensation for the travel and time associated with participation.</s></p><p><s>MAALES, which has been described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, involves didactic and skill-building components addressing HIV/STI knowledge, sexual negotiation, risk reduction (including proper condom use and reducing riskly sexual behaviors related to substance use), and HIV and STI testing and treatment.</s><s>Identifying holistic health issues and goal setting, particularly related to smoking and diet, was also addressed and encouraged.</s><s>Role plays, stress-reduction exercises, games, and examination of contemporary media facilitated engagement with material and group dialogue.</s><s>MAALES was adapted for MILE to address the needs of recently incarcerated Black MSMW.</s><s>Adaptations included addressing HIV risks and harmreduction options in prisons and jails, challenges experienced during reentry, and HIV testing and stigma in custody settings; however, the intervention structure and flow remained the same.</s><s>Furthermore, MILE did not include the two booster sessions that were part of MAALES.</s><s>These adaptations were determined based on a thorough review of the MAALES curriculum by our partnering agency's Director of Education and an advisory board composed of African American MSMW and two other race/ethnicity male staff members with histories of incarceration.</s><s>Like MILE, MAALES included people regardless of their HIV status, based on community input supporting the need for interventions not limited by HIV status and not requiring HIV testing for entry.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-Incarceration Supplemental Services</head><p><s>Both the intervention and control groups were offered post-incarceration supplemental services and condoms at the baseline and follow-up surveys.</s><s>Our partner agency-Center for Health Justice (CHJ)provided the supplemental services that included an individual assessment to determine immediate and long-term service needs.</s><s>Specific services included one-on-one counseling, assistance in accessing emergency shelter, provision of bus tokens, guidance in making appointments for obtaining general relief or social security, clothing vouchers to a local thrift store, hygiene kits, food vouchers, referrals to substance abuse treatment, or aid to HIV-positive clients in accessing case management and treatment education and peer support.</s><s>Long-term transitional assistance included assisted referrals to educational resources and vocational support.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study Eligibility, Recruitment, and Randomization</head><p><s>To be eligible, potential subjects had to self-report being incarcerated in the past 12 months; oral, vaginal, or anal sex with at least one man and one woman in the last 12 months; at least one episode of vaginal or anal sex without a condom in the last 3 months; and two or more sex partners in the last 3 months.</s><s>All subjects were 18 years of age or older and self-identified as Black/ African American.</s><s>Individuals reporting injection drug use in the last 12 months were excluded.</s><s>Study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at the University of Southern California and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science.</s></p><p><s>Recruitment was accomplished through outreach by CHJ staff and chain referrals from eligible participants.</s><s>Within the jail, the study team conducted direct outreach in the unit housing self-identified gay and bisexual men and male-to-female transgendered persons and to a lesser extent, identified potential participants in the general population of Men's Central Jail.</s><s>CHJ staff members who regularly work in the unit also provided study information to individuals while providing regular services such as education.</s><s>These staff provided study information and invited those interested to call following their release.</s><s>After obtaining verbal consent, study staff collected contact information from those interested for the purpose of following up with them post release.</s><s>Eligibility screening was conducted post-release via phone.</s><s>Study staff also recruited subjects from non-custody locales likely to serve Black MSMW, but not focused on reaching sexual minority groups.</s><s>These included HIV service agencies, jobtraining centers, drug treatment programs, and agencies serving post-incarcerated populations.</s></p><p><s>Enrolled subjects were invited to recruit their peers.</s><s>A $10 incentive was provided to each participant for each successful referral of an eligible person, up to three persons.</s><s>Overall, 44% of the study participants were referrals from peers; however, in most (64%) of these cases, the referring participant did not seek out or obtain compensation for his referrals.</s></p><p><s>To reduce the potential for contamination between study arms, participants referred through peers were assigned to the same arm as the peer who referred them.</s><s>Each time 10 confirmed new eligible subjects had completed the baseline interview, randomization was conducted.</s><s>Each was re-contacted by phone, and all of those reached were assigned to either the intervention or the control arm, using the next assignment generated through a balanced block randomization program (SAS™ Cary, NC, USA).</s><s>Those not reached were considered unassigned; contact with them was attempted for up to 3 months following their baseline interview.</s><s>Individuals who were assigned to the intervention, but who did not attend the first session of the intervention, were permitted to enroll in either of the next two cohorts of intervention sessions held.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assessments</head><p><s>Interested and eligible individuals completed the consent process and baseline interviews at the study offices located in CHJ.</s><s>They provided written informed consent using an IRB-approved consent form that outlined study procedures; potential risks, benefits, and compensation; protection related to our Certificate to Confidentiality; and limits to confidentiality.</s><s>Participants then completed the audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) survey (median completion time: 118 min).</s><s>Participants later completed two additional self-administered surveys.</s><s>One survey, which largely focused on post-intervention changes in knowledge and attitudes, was scheduled for 2 weeks after the intervention period.</s><s>Another was scheduled at 3 months (median completion time: 50 min) following the intervention period to allow for assessment of behavioral changes in the preceding 3 months.</s><s>Participants received $30 for completing the first survey, $20 for the short second survey, and $40 for the full-length 3-month follow-up survey.</s><s>Follow-up surveys were conducted either at CHJ or in the field, with field follow-up being used when efforts to complete the survey in the office were unsuccessful or during the last 2 months of data collection when the study space at CHJ was no longer available.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Survey Instrument</head><p><s>The survey instrument was developed as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiative that funded this and two other intervention studies of Black MSMW.</s><s>The instrument drew from previously tested items and scales (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[31]</ref> for details).</s><s>The instrument assessed key background characteristics, including sociodemographics, incarceration history, HIV/STD testing, and diagnoses.</s><s>It also assessed for hypothesized mediators of the intervention-including HIV risk perception, lack of support/alienation, integrated racial and sexual orientation identity, symptoms of psychological distress, HIV/STD knowledge, condom carrying, and condom-related self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, peer norms, and intentions.</s><s>However, these were not examined in this preliminary examination of intervention effectiveness.</s><s>The instrument measured the following behavioral outcomes over the prior 3-month period at baseline and 3-month follow-up:</s></p><p><s>1. Number of main and non-main male, female, and transgender sex partners.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Number of episodes of vaginal and anal sex with</head><p><s>and without condoms with each partner gender.</s><s>3. Substance use, with items on alcohol use quantity and frequency from the Rapid Alcohol Problem Screen (RAPS) measure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[32]</ref> and frequency of other substance use.</s></p><p><s>We focus only on the reported sexual behaviors here.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intervention Fidelity</head><p><s>To assess fidelity to the curriculum and avoid drift, all sessions were audio-recorded.</s><s>Initially, all recordings were reviewed by the Project Director (USC) and by the lead curriculum author (John Williams).</s><s>The reviewers used a detailed form to rate the facilitators on a 4-point quality assurance scale for adherence to each curriculum activity procedure and core element and provided them with feedback after each session.</s><s>Importantly, the strength of the quality assurance lies in reviewing audio recordings of sessions, providing direct supervision to facilitators, and having a standardized process to ensure all core activities being addressed as intended.</s><s>Listening to recordings permits supervisors to evaluate not only content, but also process such as pacing, verbal tone, and voice inflection.</s><s>It also provides the opportunity to assess rapport and to offer strategies for improvement of facilitation.</s><s>These quality assurance strategies have been shown to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The mean per-session scores initially indicated 76% adherence.</s><s>A comprehensive retraining session on the curriculum then followed.</s><s>Subsequently, one out of each of the six-session recordings was randomly selected, and scored for adherence.</s><s>These scores averaged 82%, and all but one session scored at or above the accepted target of 80% adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p><s>Descriptive analyses comparing differences between those randomized to each study arm were conducted.</s><s>Outcome variables of interest were also examined for baseline differences between the intervention and control arms.</s><s>Chi-square tests were used for categorical variables and t tests for count variables.</s></p><p><s>A longitudinal, nested group-randomized model was conducted to examine differences between study arms while controlling for baseline values and other covariates and while accounting for clustering of subjects within cohorts.</s><s>The number of condomless sex acts and the number of sex partners in the prior 3 months were analyzed as both a count of episodes and as a dichotomous variable.</s><s>To reduce skewing, the number of episodes of sex without condoms in the prior 3 months was limited to 100.</s><s>For outcome analyses, we examine behavioral changes at the 3-month assessments compared to baseline.</s><s>Utilizing SAS 9.3 Proc Countreg, we attempted to fit the observed distribution for the outcome variables with four possible expected distributions (Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial).</s><s>However, the data for both count outcomes at follow-up were highly skewed (with 50% or more of the sample reporting zeros) and did not fit the distributions.</s><s>Therefore, we limited our statistical approach to dichotomous outcomes (any condomless sex and any sex partners versus none).</s><s>Proc Glimmix was used to model logistic regressions, incorporating possible data clustering within cohorts as a random effect and an unstructured variancecovariance to remove restrictions and allow for the best possible model fit.</s><s>All analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</s><s>In post hoc analysis, we addressed concerns about interview setting effects and by conducting additional analyses without the last 55 participants (who were all interviewed in the field) and by controlling for an indicator of this.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>The CONSORT chart (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) describes recruitment, enrollment, random assignments, and follow-up for the trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>.</s><s>Outreach and recruitment were conducted from 2011 to 2012.</s><s>Of the 377 screened, 252 were eligible, and 236 completed baselines.</s><s>However, 22 of these participants were withdrawn because their baseline assessments indicated that they did not meet the eligibility criteria.</s><s>This left 214 persons who were assigned to the two study arms across 23 cohorts, including 11 intervention and 12 control cohorts.</s><s>Due to incomplete data, two people were excluded from the final analysis leaving n = 212, with 100 in the intervention and 112 in the control.</s><s>Of those assigned to the intervention, 69% participated in at least one MILE session with mean session attendance being 5.</s></p><p><s>Both the intervention and control groups were eligible to receive referrals to additional support services.</s></p><p><s>Nineteen participants (9%) refused the needs assessment to initiate this process.</s><s>The remainder completed the assessment, but a relatively low percentage accepted services, with just 21% (n = 45) of both arms receiving at least one service.</s><s>Most of these received the free hygiene kits.</s></p><p><s>Most study participants were between the ages of 40 and 49 and of lower socioeconomic status; nearly half (49.0% excluding missing) had spent at least 3 years of their adult lives incarcerated.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> shows the comparison between the intervention and control condition on sociodemographics and risk behaviors at baseline.</s><s>Intervention and control condition participants differed (p &lt; 0.10) in employment, time since last incarceration, and sex with transgender partners.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref> presents baseline and follow-up outcome measures for the intervention and control conditions for the entire sample and with the final 55 participants excluded (referred to as the Blimited dataset^).</s><s>The limited dataset was constructed because we observed a significant decline in reports of any sexual activity among these participants, all of whom were interviewed in field settings.</s><s>Participants interviewed in the field during the last 2 months of data collection were less likely to report any sexual partner in the prior 3 months (23 vs 77%; p &lt; 0.001), and any condomless sex (11 vs. 59%; p &lt; 0.001).</s><s>Outcomes considered in bivariate analyses for both groups included Bany^condomless sex, mean and median episodes of condomless sex, and mean and median numbers of partners.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MILE =Men in Life Environments</head><p><s>Since condomless sex was an inclusion criterion for the study, we expected to observe declines in this variable.</s><s>However, the decline was quite large, from 100% at baseline to 48 and 34% for the intervention and control groups, respectively.</s><s>The reported means for episodes of sex without condoms declined from 27.7 to 8.0 for the intervention and 25.6 to 6.7 for the control.</s><s>Condomless sex with females accounted for the largest proportion of the reported reductions; the intervention and control arms reduced from 15.8 to 2.0 and 14.8 to 3.1, respectively.</s><s>To a lesser extent, steep drops were seen for number of partners across the intervention and control arms, with the total number of partners, reducing from a mean of 5.8 to 1.8 and 5.4 to 1.5, respectively.</s></p><p><s>We explored the possibility that the declines resulted from regression to mean (RTM), using an approach outlined, by Hopkins <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref> and Trochim <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref>.</s><s>The first step was to calculate the correlation (r) between pre-and post-test responses (0.17).</s><s>The percentage of RTM was then calculated via the formula Prm = 100 (1−r), where r equals this pre-post correlation.</s><s>This suggests 83% of the decline from the average pre-test score to the average post-test score can be explained by RTM.</s><s>The second step was to use data from a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to represent a population mean for comparison to our sample means at each time point.</s><s>This study, known as MAALES, included a more general population of bisexual Black men in Los Angeles.</s><s>Harawa et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> found a mean number of total condomless sex acts in the past 3 months of 7 at baseline and of 6 at follow-up for the control group, a 14% reduction.</s><s>Given this difference in estimated population pre-and post-means, we could expect our current study pre-or baseline mean of 27 condomless sex acts to similarly drop by 14% to 23 due to RTM.</s><s>Moreover, given our pre/post correlation of 0.17, we could also expect to see RTM that covers 83% of the distance from the expected post mean of 23 to the MAALES-estimated population post mean of 6.</s><s>Given this, we would expect a post-test mean of 9 resulting from RTM alone.</s><s>The means for the current study post-test are 8 and 6.7 for the intervention and control groups, respectively.</s><s>This analysis indicates that a considerable portion of the observed declines in risk behavior could be due to RTM.</s></p><p><s>The final outcomes analysis relied on the dichotomous variables, any condomless sex in the past 3 months versus none and any sex partners versus no sex partners.</s><s>Results from the final multiple regression outcomes are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>.</s><s>The model controlled for reported baseline values of the dependent variable, current employment, education, time to follow-up interview, interview proctor, and whether the interview was conducted in the final phase of follow-up data collection.</s></p><p><s>No statistically significant differences were found between the intervention and control arms for any condomless sex with male or female partners or across all gender groups.</s><s>Participants in the intervention arm were found to have higher odds of sex with any partner 2.49 (95% CI 1.09, 5.71).</s><s>An identical logistic regression is also presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref> that excludes from the analysis those whose data were collected in the final phase rather than controlling for this phase in the model.</s></p><p><s>However, no significant differences in outcomes were found between interventions and control conditions when excluding those who were surveyed during the final phase of follow-up.</s></p></div>

<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">40]</ref>.</s><s>Due to the substantial decline in means observed for both groups and the entry criteria that selected for individuals reporting very highrisk recent behaviors, we explored the possibility that the decline indicated the phenomenon of regression toward the mean in our study sample.</s><s>This RTM analysis indicated it would be expected to observe nearly as considerable a decline at follow-up as was observed in the current study due to RTM.</s><s>However, this assumes that the MAALES study population provides reasonable estimates for a population data comparison and does not take into account other possible reasons for the low correlation between baseline and follow-up responses.</s></p><p><s>One such reason involves participant burden.</s><s>The baseline survey lasted nearly 2 h on average, with the outcome-related questions placed as part of a very detailed set of sexual risk behavior and partner-related questions in the second third of the survey.</s><s>The anticipation of a long interview at follow-up may have led participants to select BNo^on contingency questions related to sexual risk in order to reduce the time needed to complete the survey.</s></p><p><s>Interview setting may also have influenced responses.</s><s>All participants completed the baseline survey in the study office, where they were provided with snacks, had relatively few interruptions or distractions, and were monitored by survey proctors.</s><s>Some followup surveys, including all of the final 55, were conducted in field settings.</s><s>These settings included the participants' homes, the interviewers' cars, or public settings.</s><s>Participants known to have been interviewed in these settings were significantly more likely to report no sexual activity than other participants.</s><s>Some anecdotal reports further indicate that the intervention participants were more willing than control participants to put focus and effort into completing the follow-up surveys.</s><s>Furthermore, the intervention group was significantly more likely to report any sex partner during the 3-month follow-up period in the complete dataset, but not in the limited dataset.</s><s>The higher likelihood of reporting any sexual partnership among intervention participants likely explains why odds ratios for sex risk outcomes were elevated (though non-significant) for the intervention arm.</s></p><p><s>Finally, we also point out that regardless of group assignment, all participants received some HIV prevention encouragement, including free condoms and being enrolled in a setting wherein HIV prevention messages and information were displayed and available.</s><s>It is possible that these activities contributed to short-term across-the-board risk reduction and/or increased participants' perceived desirability of providing low-risk responses at follow-up.</s></p><p><s>The MILE trial differed from the efficacious MAALES trial on which it was based.</s><s>The MAALES study was not limited to men with two or more recent partners or to those reporting recent unprotected sex.</s><s>The intervention also was designed for and tested in Black MSMW regardless of their incarceration history.</s><s>Included in the MAALES but not the MILE intervention MILE Men in Life Environments a Logistic regression models controlled for length of time between baseline and follow-up interviews and baseline values for current employment, level of education, the proctor conducting the interview, and whether the interview was conducted in the final phase of follow-up data collection.</s><s>Models also accounted for clustering within groups b Analyses were conducted both as a complete case design as well as excluding cases (n = 55) collected during final phase of followup.</s><s>These cases were known to have been interviewed in field settings at follow-up were booster sessions held at 9 and 18 weeks' postcompletion of the core intervention.</s><s>In terms of methodological differences, the MAALES trial involved a much larger group of randomized study participants (n = 386) and included follow-up assessments at both 3 and 6 months, with statistically significant interventionassociated declines in risk behaviors observed only at 6 months.</s><s>Median completion time for the baseline MAALES survey was just 88 min, compared to 118 for MILE.</s><s>The difference may have motivated more MILE participants to want to shorten the duration of the follow-up survey.</s><s>Despite the equivocal findings in the MILE trial, we point to some important successes.</s><s>The study was able to locate, enroll, and engage a significant number of eligible men from a stigmatized population over a short time period.</s><s>In addition, an excellent retention rate was achieved, despite high rates of housing instability and recidivism.</s><s>Furthermore, although the percentage of the intervention group that initiated the MILE intervention sessions was suboptimal (69%), the high attendance rates of those who did and positive participant feedback speak to its value and relevance to attendees.</s><s>Participants reported being drawn to a holistically targeted intervention that addressed them as Black men rather than men defined by a particular sexual orientation.</s></p><p><s>Recent developments in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42]</ref>, research demonstrating the effectiveness of treatment as prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[43]</ref>, and the success of HIV testing and rapid entry into HIV care <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">45]</ref> have led to a sharp turn away from purely behavioral interventions toward more biomedical strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref>.</s><s>However, there remains a need for behavioral approaches to ensure that high-risk populations, such as recently incarcerated Black MSMW, have the knowledge, skills, and self-empowerment they need to effectively access biomedical interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref>.</s><s>A new set of trials, focused on promoting access and adherence to newer biomedical prevention strategies, is needed to address large racial and social disparities in HIV.</s><s>Trials such as MILE may be used to inform approaches to recruiting and following high-risk, under-resourced, and frequently ignored groups for purposes of improving utilization of HIV testing and treatment, as well as pre-exposure prophylaxis.</s><s>We argue that a combination of approaches is needed at both the individual and populations levels, particularly for highly marginalized populations who frequently experience pressing health threats-signaling the importance of intervention benefits that extend beyond reducing HIV incidence and uncontrolled viremia.</s><s>Nevertheless, implementation issues in testing these approaches must be carefully attended to, and efforts to assess for intervention benefits should avoid substantial assessment burdens for study participants and include objective assessments wherever possible.</s></p><p><s>Compliance with Ethical Standards Study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at University of Southern California and the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science.</s><s>Interested and eligible individuals completed the consent process and baseline interviews at the study offices located in CHJ.</s><s>They provided written informed consent using an IRBapproved consent form that outlined study procedures; potential risks, benefits, and compensation; protection related to our Certificate to Confidentiality; and limits to confidentiality.</s><s>Those initially contacted in jail provided verbal consent for collection of their locator information in jails for potential study enrollment postrelease, using IRB approved forms and processes for this purpose.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc><div><p><s>Invalid data, removed from analysis: n=2 Received referral/support services: n=24 (21%) Assigned to Intervention: n=100 Attended Session 1: n=69 (69%) Received referrals/support services: n=21 (21%) Immediate Post Interview: n=90 Three Month Interview: 94 (94%) Immediate Post Interview: n=87 (78%) Three Month Interview: 101 (91%)</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
