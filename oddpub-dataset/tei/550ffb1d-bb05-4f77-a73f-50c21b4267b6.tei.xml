immune activation, which can be achieved by virus-induced inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), the prototype member of the arenavirus family, elicits CTL eff responses of high magnitude and cytolytic capacity, in combination with life-long CTL immunity.</s><s>These features, together with a low hazard profile for humans, have rendered it a primary workhorse of immunologists since the 1930s (ref.</s><s>17).</s><s>Experimental LCMV infections in humans have documented a systemic inflammatory reaction, accompanied by a lymphoblastic reaction in peripheral blood <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , which was reminiscent of the massive CTL eff response in infectious mononucleosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>Accordingly, studies in accidentally LCMV-infected laboratory workers have confirmed that, analogously to mice, high frequencies of effector memory CTL are maintained for several years after a single acute infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>These features in combination with low seroprevalence in the human population <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> raised our interest in LCMV as a live-attenuated cancer immunotherapy platform, to deliver TAA-specific immunization alongside with potent innate immune activation.</s></p><p><s>We and others have previously reported that interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a key driver of potent and protective CTL eff responses to several replicating RNA and DNA viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>Subsequently, IL-33 was found to also be essential for antiviral Th1 CD4 responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and for graft-versus-host disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>Collectively, these reports underscore the global significance of IL-33 in promoting type 1 immune responses (reviewed in ref. 25), besides an additional undisputed function in type 2 immune responses such as in the context of allergy and immunity to parasites.</s><s>Upon release from necrotic cells, IL-33 signals through its receptor ST2 on activated CD8 þ T cells, thereby enhancing clonal expansion, effector differentiation and ultimately CTL efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s><s>By contrast to wild-type LCMV (LCMVwt), however, replication-deficient LCMV-based vectors (rLCMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> ) fail to trigger the IL-33 alarmin pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Hence we engineer a TAA delivery platform based on live-attenuated LCMV (artLCMV).</s><s>Unlike replication-deficient rLCMV vectors, artLCMV targets not only dendritic but also lymphoid stromal cells, thereby triggering the IL-33-ST2 alarmin pathway and inducing superior TAA-specific CTL eff responses.</s><s>The activation of critical innate immune pathways including alarmins represents a discriminating feature of replicating microbial delivery systems, which might be decisive for the success of active cancer immunotherapy.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>Generation of genetically stable and live-attenuated artLCMV.</s><s>We aimed at combining tumour antigen vaccination with infection-induced alarmin signals.</s><s>Hence we sought a strategy how to stably incorporate transgenes into replicating LCMV.</s><s>The virus' genome consists of two negative-stranded RNA segments designated L and S, respectively, encoding two viral genes each (LCMVwt, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTR) and an intergenic region (IGR) flank the ORFs on each segment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>Reverse genetic tools are available to efficiently tailor the infectious virus' genome for medical application <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>As reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , transgenes of interest can be accommodated in the LCMV genome by segregating the viral glycoprotein (GPC) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes onto artificially duplicated S segments (S NP , S GP in r3LCMV, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>According to the originally published vector design strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , both NP and GPC remain under control of their respective regulatory RNA elements (natural positioning; r3LCMV).</s><s>Genetic and phenotypic stability represent key criteria for manufacturing and clinical translation of live-attenuated viral vector systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s><s>Accordingly, observations on transgene loss in r3LCMVinfected animals (see below) prompted us to search for molecular strategies to stabilize r3LCMV genomes.</s><s>By placing GPC under 3 0 UTR control, we generated viruses with an artificial genome organization (artLCMV, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</s><s>The reasoning was that, although a rare event in negative strand RNA viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , inter-segmental recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> would reunite NP and GPC on a single S segment, thereby deleting the transgenes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</s><s>The arenavirus promoter consists of an intra-segmental RNA hybrid formed by a highly conserved stretch of 19-21 terminal nucleotides in each segment's 5 0 UTR and 3 0 UTR.</s><s>Therefore, viral promoter activity requires both, a 5 0 UTR and a 3 0 UTR on each RNA template (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</s><s>Unlike in r3LCMV, a recombination event reuniting the NP and GPC ORFs of artLCMV would occur at the expense of losing the 5 0 UTR, thus creating an inactive recombination product devoid of a viral promoter (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</s><s>Both, r3LCMV and artLCMV were significantly attenuated in cell culture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>).</s><s>Flow cytometric studies with green (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (tomato) co-expressing viruses (r3LCMV-GFP/tom, artLCMV-GFP/tom) revealed that red/green double-positive virions were outnumbered by a 4tenfold excess of bi-segmented replicationdeficient particles, carrying either only S GP or S NP in combination with the L segment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref>, see Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for flow cytometry gating strategies).</s><s>An immunofocus assay (IFF)-based quantification of S NP -only and S GP -only virions yielded analogous results (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Hence, attenuation was, at least in part, due to inefficient co-packaging of S NP and S GP segments.</s><s>To study the genetic stability of artLCMV and r3LCMV we exploited AGR mice.</s><s>Owing to targeted deletions of RAG1 (T-cell and B-cell deficiency) as well as of the type I and type II interferon genes, AGR mice readily reveal an attenuated virus' reversion to virulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</s><s>We measured viral loads in blood by IFF, relying on the detection of the viral structural protein NP (NP-IFF, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>Within the first 20 days after infection, r3LCMV and artLCMV remained at considerably lower titres in blood than LCMVwt, which was in line with published data documenting in vivo attenuation of r3LCMV <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>After 30-40 days, however, r3LCMV-infected AGR mice reached NP-IFF titres identical to those infected with LCMVwt.</s><s>Conversely, artLCMV viremia remained at low levels throughout the observation period of 120 days (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>).</s><s>In artLCMV-infected animals, the assessment of total infectivity by NP-IFF and the quantification of GFP-expressing viruses by GFP-IFF yielded comparable titres on day 5 as well as on day 120 after infection, indicating that the transgene had been retained (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b,c</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, r3LCMV-GFP-infected mice turned GFP-IFF-negative while abundant NP-IFF infectivity persisted, suggesting that the virus had lost its transgene.</s><s>Indeed, the viral NP was abundant in the liver and spleen of r3LCMV-GFP-infected mice, as expected, while GFP was absent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, liver and spleen of artLCMV-GFP-infected animals exhibited dense green fluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>; analogous data for blood monocytes in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>).</s><s>To verify whether r3LCMV-GFP had inactivated its transgene by recombining its two S segments, as hypothesized (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), we relied on an PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR)-based sequencing strategy (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>).</s><s>Recombined S segment RNA species (S rec , Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>) reuniting NP and GPC sequences in a single RNA molecule were detected in ten out of ten r3LCMV-GFP-infected AGR mice from two independent series of experiments.</s><s>In contrast, the blood of 11 artLCMV-infected mice was free of detectable S rec RNA.</s></p><p><s>Sequence analysis of S rec segments revealed that individual non-homologous recombination events had occurred in each animal, with breakpoints in the GFP-IGR border region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>Genetic tags in the IGR and GPC sequences of r3LCMV-GFP excluded laboratory contaminations as potential confounder in these analyses and assigned genetic elements in S rec to its parental S NP or S GP segments (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2f,g</ref>).</s><s>We found that a cDNA-derived bi-segmented virus with an exemplary S rec segment (S rec #1) grew to LCMVwt titres in cell culture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>).</s><s>In combination with the inefficient copackaging of S NP and S GP in tri-segmented particles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>), this finding explained the selective advantage and consistent outgrowth of S rec segments in r3LCMV-infected AGR mice.</s></p><p><s>Apathogenic artLCMV induces potent CTL eff responses.</s><s>In vivo attenuation represents a prerequisite for the use of live vaccine delivery platforms in immunocompromised cancer patients.</s><s>Infection of wt mice with LCMVwt, but not with artLCMV resulted in viremia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, low level artLCMV infectivity was only transiently detected in spleen and liver on day 4 and was cleared by day 7, whereas LCMVwt persisted for 10 days at high titres (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</s><s>LCMVwt can
