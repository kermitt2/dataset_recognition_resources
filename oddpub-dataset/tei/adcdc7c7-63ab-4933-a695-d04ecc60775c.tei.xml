<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p><s>Dental implants have shown a high success rate for rehabilitation of edentulous patients if certain conditions are met during treatment.</s><s>Nevertheless, the risk of failure remains difficult to predict.</s><s>The achievement of osseointegration depends on many factors, such as a suitable host, biocompatible materials, careful surgery, and an appropriate healing time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The primary stability comes from the mechanical anchorage between the bone tissue and the pitch region of the implant immediately after implantation.</s><s>The secondary stability comes from the formation of new vital bone, which replaces the gap between the local bone and the implant surface and replaces the necrotic bone.</s></p><p><s>The external morphology of the dental implant is a factor which leads to the mechanical engagement of the implant with the bone.</s><s>Three-thread-design dental implants consist of three different thread designs.</s><s>The first design is the micro-thread, or supra-fine thread, which is on the coronal third of the implant fixture and is attached to the cortical bone.</s><s>These small, fine threads are designed for force distribution, an increase in the bone-implant contact area and a decrease in the force concentration at the abutment-implant connection area.</s><s>The second design is the reverse buttress thread, which is on the middle third of the implant fixture.</s><s>This design increases the retention between the implant and spongy bone and produces resistance to compressive force.</s><s>The third design, the condensed thread, is located at the apical third of the implant fixture.</s><s>The thinness at the beginning of this thread and an increase in thickness along the implant fixture are designed for the soft spongy bone condensability <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Osseointegration, a continuous process, represents the coupling of the osteoclast and osteoblast activity for bone repair, formation, and adaptation to function <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s>Implant-bone integration is separated into three phenomena.</s><s>The first phenomenon is distance osteogenesis.</s><s>Distance osteogenesis means that bone formation takes place from the local bone toward the implant surface.</s><s>This event is anticipated to happen in cortical bone healing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>The second phenomenon is contact osteogenesis, in which bone formation takes place from the implant surface toward the local bone.</s><s>This osteogenesis consists of the early phase of osteogenic cell migration, osteoconduction, and de novo bone formation.</s><s>The de novo bone formation at a solid surface has four stages.</s><s>The first stage is secretion of the two noncollagenous proteins, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein.</s><s>The second stage is calcium phosphate nucleation, which consists of the calcium binding at the calcium binding sites of these proteins.</s><s>The third stage is the crystal growth phase.</s><s>The last stage of de novo bone formation is derived from collagen production and subsequent collagen mineralization.</s><s>Finally, bone remodeling is the third phenomenon of implant-bone integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Osteocalcin (OC) is the most plentiful noncollagenous protein of the bone matrix.</s><s>It is secreted from odontoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoblasts, in order to bind hydroxyapatite and calcium during matrix mineralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>It is one of the serological markers in the bone formation process.</s><s>Numerous studies have shown increased OC levels in bone formation.</s><s>However, increased OC level relates more to osteoid formation than matrix mineralization during bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein.</s><s>Its function is catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters at a basic pH level.</s><s>Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) is known to be involved in bone calcification.</s><s>It is secreted by osteoblasts to provide a high phosphate concentration at the osteoblast cell surface during bone mineralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The measurement of implant stability is based on the clinical, histological, biomechanical, and biochemical approaches.</s><s>The resonance frequency analysis (RFA), a noninvasive clinical implant stability measurement, has been used in many studies.</s><s>Meta-analysis of 47 studies has revealed a statistically significant correlation between RFA and insertion torque <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Numerous clinical studies have used the resonance frequency analysis technique on various implant designs to determine implant stability during the osseointegration period <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr"

target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Evaluation of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF), a noninvasive, clinical, biochemical approach has been used to assess and to predict the peri-implant tissue loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The purposes of this study were to examine the correlation between the stability of dental implants and bone formation markers during the healing period and to monitor the stability of dental implants during a 3month period using the resonance frequency analysis method.</s><s>The null hypothesis of the study is no correlation between the stability of dental implant and bone formation markers.</s><s>Due to the three-thread-design of the implants, the authors also aim to measure the average implant stability quotient using RFA during the healing period.</s></p></div>
