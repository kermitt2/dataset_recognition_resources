<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Objective.</s><s>To reach a European consensus on the definition and characterization of the main organspecific extraglandular manifestations in primary SS.</s></p><p><s>Methods.</s><s>The EULAR-SS Task Force Group steering committee agreed to approach SS-related systemic involvement according to the EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) classification and proposed the preparation of four separate manuscripts: articular, cutaneous, pulmonary and renal ESSDAI involvement; muscular, peripheral nervous system, CNS and haematological ESSDAI involvement; organs not included in the ESSDAI classification; and lymphoproliferative disease.</s><s>Currently available evidence was obtained by a systematic literature review focused on SS-related systemic features.</s></p><p><s>Results.</s><s>The following information was summarized for articular, cutaneous, pulmonary and renal involvement: a clear, consensual definition of the clinical feature, a brief epidemiological description including an estimate of the prevalence reported in the main clinical series and a brief list of the key clinical and diagnostic features that could help physicians clearly identify these features.</s><s>Unfortunately we found that the body of evidence relied predominantly on information retrieved from individual cases, and the scientific information provided was heterogeneous.</s><s>The analysis of types of involvement was biased due to the unbalanced reporting of severe cases over non-severe cases, although the main sources of bias were the heterogeneous definitions of organ involvement (or even the lack of definition in some studies) and the heterogeneous diagnostic approach used in studies to investigate involvment of each organ.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Primary SS (pSS) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease that may be expressed in many guises: the disease spectrum extends from sicca syndrome to systemic involvement (extraglandular manifestations) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>While sicca features affect primarily quality of life and cause local complications in the mucosa involved, systemic involvement marks the disease prognosis.</s><s>SS patients may develop a large number of extraglandular manifestations, either as the presenting manifestation or during the evolution of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Various studies have analysed the prevalence and characteristics of systemic involvement in pSS with differing results, which may be due to the small number of patients analysed, the different sets of classification criteria used and, especially, the lack of a standardized definition of the main organ involvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The EULAR has recently promoted and supported an international collaborative study (the EULAR-SS Task Force) aimed at developing consensual disease activity indexes in SS.</s><s>The project steering committee, with the formal approval of all the SS Task Force participants involved in the study, decided to develop two indexes [the EULAR Sjo ¨gren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI) and the EULAR SS Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI)] <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s>The ESSDAI index activity included organ-by-organ definitions that were agreed on by a large number of experts in SS, thus providing a standardized instrument for the homogeneous evaluation of systemic activity in clinical trials and daily practice.</s><s>The ESSDAI has high content validity since it includes definitions of the main systemic manifestations seen in the largest series of patients with pSS and stratifies the items of each domain according to severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p><s>The broad consensus obtained on the ESSDAI score provides an excellent opportunity to refine the characterization of SS-related systemic involvement using an evidence-based methodological approach according to the organ-by-organ classification used in the ESSDAI.</s><s>We carried out a systematic review focused on 273 articles on SS-related systemic features reported in patients fulfilling the 2002 AmericanEuropean Consensus Group (AECG) criteria (see supplementary reference list, available at Rheumatology Online) in order to collect currently available evidence that may pave the way for characterization (definition, prevalence, clinical characteristics and diagnostic approach) of the main organ-specific extraglandular manifestations in pSS following the ESSDAI organ-by-organ classification.</s><s>This is the first article focused on the characterization of joint, cutaneous, pulmonary and renal involvement.</s></p></div>
