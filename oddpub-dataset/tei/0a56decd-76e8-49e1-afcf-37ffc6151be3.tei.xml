<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>The clinical findings together with lactic acidosis and 3-MGA accumulation during recurrent metabolic crises in the affected children of the observed family were highly suggestive of mitochondrial disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Biochemical analysis in muscle revealed a reduced or abolished complex V assembly that was caused by the absence of the protein complex (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Meanwhile, the candidate gene TMEM70 causing a complex V deficiency with morphological stigmata, cardiomyopathy, and metabolic crises frequently occurring in families of Roma ethnic background had been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The homozygous TMEM70 (c.317-2A&gt;G) mutation in intron 2 was found in children I, IV, and VI and segregated with the disease within the family.</s><s>This mutation has been shown to result in aberrant splicing and a loss of the TMEM70 transcript <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>To date, at least 14 additional TMEM70 mutations have been described leading to a broad clinical spectrum such as hypospadia <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or pulmonary arterial hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, as summarized in Magner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Two of the four affected children died within 60 hours postpartum of metabolic crises and heart failure due to cardiomyopathy refractory to treatment.</s><s>In all children, the initial treatment of metabolic crises aimed to stop catabolism and establish an anabolic metabolism.</s><s>Therefore energy supply avoiding an increase of lactate through glucose was provided with offering alternative substrates for the Krebs cycle, such as amino acids and fat.</s><s>In refractory situations, a mix of cofactors and additional essential amino acids were added to relieve the metabolic crisis.</s><s>The concept of supplementing essential precursors of the Krebs cycle is referred to as anaplerotic therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>An effect of L-carnitine, an important compound inside the therapy regimen, was shown in a liver disease mouse model, where mitochondrial abnormalities improved upon treatment with L-carnitine <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>Standardized clinical trials evaluating anaplerotic therapy are lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, but out of different treatment strategies in 48 patients with TMEM70 deficiency some general recommendations have been deduced by Magner et al. consisting basically of moderate glucose supplementation, high dose lipid infusions, and acidosis correction via bicarbonate infusions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>The effect of -carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin C administered here cannot be evaluated exactly; still, given the few therapeutic options in mitochondrial diseases, these supplements additionally improved the situation during metabolic crises in our patients.</s></p><p><s>In the course of the diagnostic process, muscle biopsies were taken from three affected children.</s><s>Light microscopy analyses did not reveal any major pathological findings and were especially lacking ragged-red or COX-deficient fibres that would have been suggestive of a mitochondrial disease (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, muscle biopsy from a non-Roma patient with compound heterozygous TMEM70 mutations (c.317-2A&gt;G and c.494G&gt;A, p.Gly165Asp) taken at 30 months of age demonstrated the presence of ragged-red fibres, which were not present in our patients nor in the other reported cases with different mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s>It is not clear by which effects the presence of ragged-red fibres can be explained in the relatively mildly affected child above.</s></p><p><s>Additional electron microscopic investigations in our patients' muscle tissues (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) revealed a spectrum from mild to more severe pathological alterations including giant mitochondria, subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria, globular inclusions, concentric cristae formation, cristae fragmentation, and crystalloid inclusions.</s><s>Child IV showed most extended morphologic alterations of muscle tissue and mitochondria and died within 60 hours after birth.</s><s>Children I and IV with milder ultrastructural alterations are long-term survivors.</s><s>Prognostic impact of the ultrastructural findings remains speculative.</s></p><p><s>Jonckheere et al. reported a fragmented mitochondrial network and swollen, irregularly shaped mitochondria with partial to complete loss of the cristae in fibroblasts of a patient with a deletion of TMEM70 exon 2 (g.2436-3789).</s><s>The successful restoration of mitochondrial morphology by supplement of the wild type TMEM70 vector in patients' fibroblasts directly links the observed abnormalities to the defect <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>In summary, there is much evidence that the complex V defect resulting from the TMEM70 mutations directly affects mitochondrial morphology.</s></p><p><s>Our electron microscopic examination of the muscle biopsies also showed protrusion of mitochondrial material at the myofibres' surfaces as well as circular extracellular membranous structures in close vicinity of the myofibres (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>).</s><s>Paracrystalline inclusions can be frequently seen in mitochondrial disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, but perisarcolemmal accumulated mitochondria have not been reported so far in complex V defects.</s><s>To date, only single reports about the so-called "free-floating" mitochondria exist.</s><s>In Sod1 mutant mice modelling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), extracellular free-floating mitochondria have been described in the brainstem.</s><s>They were located extracellularly between capillaries and astrocyte processes and accompanied by edema.</s><s>In this case the "free-floating mitochondria" were interpreted as a result of a blood brain barrier breakdown related to a basement membrane defect in Sod1 mutant mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Cells are believed to have acquired mitochondria from invading aerobic bacteria more than a billion years ago employing ATP as energy source and accepting the bacteria's residency inside  <ref type="figure">(c, d</ref>), and child II (e-h), magnification as indicated by the scale bar.</s><s>We detected abnormal mitochondria with concentric cristae (a, cc) as well as subsarcolemmal (sl) accumulation of swollen mitochondria (m) with crystalline inclusions (ci) in child I (b).</s><s>In child IV, sample quality was not optimal;

however, further studies are necessary to decipher the relevance of these observations.</s></p></div>
