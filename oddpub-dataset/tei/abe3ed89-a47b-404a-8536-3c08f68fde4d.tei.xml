<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In our multicentre registry analysis of 22 411 patients who had continuous thoracic epidural analgesia, tunnelling was strongly

adjusted these confounding factors in our comparison of tunnelled and not tunnelled catheters.</s><s>Moreover, we used propensity-matched sensitivity analysis.</s><s>As a result of the remaining imbalance after matching, we added all imbalanced covariables in a multivariable model when comparing the two groups for the risk of infection.</s><s>The overall incidence of thoracic epidural catheter infections was 4.9%, which is higher than previously reported.</s><s>Differences are most likely to result from varying definitions of infection and inflammation, duration of catheter use, preventive hygiene measures, and probably, many unknown factors.</s><s>A strength of our study is that infection grades were clearly defined a priori and data collected prospectively.</s></p><p><s>Tunnelling is generally used to avoid dislocation of catheters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s>However, tunnelling seems to decrease the risk of neuraxial catheter-related bacterial colonization rate in infants and children. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>For example, bacterial colonization rates in untunnelled catheters were three times higher than in tunnelled epidural catheters (29 vs 11%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s>One retrospective review in cancer patients found a tendency to lower infection rates when subcutaneous injection ports were used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref></s><s>urthermore, Sellmann and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> showed a tendency to lower colonization rates in a very small number of thoracic epidural catheters.</s><s>Tunnelling is also thought to reduce the risk of infection for peripheral catheters <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> and even bloodstream infections. <ref type="bibr">17 26</ref></s><s>he mechanism by which tunnelling reduces infection risk remains unclear.</s><s>Bacterial migration along the epidural catheter track is the most common route of epidural catheter colonization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref></s><s>Tunnelling certainly leads to a better fixation and less movement between the catheter and skin, thereby reducing bacterial transport by the catheter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s>The cutaneous midline of the vertebral column is an area of higher density of sebaceous glands, which may increase infection risk for midline catheters.</s><s>Tunnels guided laterally off the midline will exit the skin in an area with fewer sebaceous glands, which may reduce infection risk.</s></p><p><s>Tunnelling is advocated by many to reduce catheter migration and premature failure of epidural analgesia.</s><s>In contrast, there has been concern that the risk of infection may be increased, because multiple skin penetration, which is necessary for the tunnelling, is a known risk factor for infection per se.</s><s>Therefore, our analysis primarily focused on this discrepancy.</s><s>When multiple punctures for epidural catheter placements are necessary, additional tunnelling seems to have the strongest protective effect against infections in our analysis.</s></p><p><s>We additionally analysed whether premature failure of analgesia has any association with tunnelling by looking at information about pain intensity, infusion rate, and patient satisfaction.</s><s>Twenty-four hours after catheter placement, patients with tunnelled catheters had significantly less pain despite similar infusion rates.</s><s>Patients with tunnelled catheters were also more satisfied with their care.</s><s>However, these data have to be interpreted with caution because the analysis was not primarily focused on pain or patient satisfaction, and the relevant data are missing in about half the patients.</s></p><p><s>We demonstrate a clear and strong association between epidural catheter tunnelling and reduced infection risk.</s><s>However, we do not have information on duration of hospitalization, long-term outcomes, or mortality; consequently, we cannot determine whether the observed infections were linked to more serious outcomes.</s><s>As in any non-randomized analysis, residual confounding may introduce error, which will not be eliminated by our propensity-matched sensitivity analysis.</s><s>An additional limitation is that various types of tunnelling were carried out, and tunnelling distance presumably varied, but these potentially important details were not recorded.</s></p><p><s>During the 7-yr observation period, there were presumably improvements in knowledge, skills, techniques, and disinfectant methods.</s><s>However, our results were adjusted for the year of surgery, which was not a significant predictor of infection risk.</s><s>Within the restraints of routine data acquisition, we were not able to gather detailed information about the exact technique used for tunnelling (direction and subcutaneous length).</s><s>Results may differ for less experienced centres.</s><s>Consistent with this contention, there was heterogeneity in the incidence of infection amongst the hospitals in our analysis.</s><s>Therefore, the hospitals were added as confounders in our multivariable model.</s><s>The heterogeneity between the hospitals is also a result of different contributions of confounders between the centres (e.g.</s><s>ASA score, surgery, age, and multiple skin puncture).</s><s>To include these heterogeneities between the hospitals in our analysis, we additionally performed a GEE analysis and included all hospitals as a separate condition.</s><s>The GEE showed similar results that tunnelling reduces the risk of thoracic epidural catheter-related infection.</s></p><p><s>Registries critically depend on the quality of data entry and handling; the validity of registry analyses thus always depends on the quality of the underlying data.</s><s>Infection data in our registry were specifically collected concurrent with patient care using a priori definitions.</s></p><p><s>In summary, catheter tunnelling was associated with fewer infections of thoracic epidural catheters, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.51 (95% CI 0.42-0.61).</s><s>Tunnelling thus appears to be a reasonable option for thoracic epidural catheters expected to remain in situ for more than a few days.</s></p></div>
