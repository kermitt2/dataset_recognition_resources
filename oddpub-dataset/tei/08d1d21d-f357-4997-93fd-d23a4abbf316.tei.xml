<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects and Treatment</head><p><s>The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the MP have been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>; briefly, adult subjects (18-80 years) with spasticity of the upper limb due to stroke (at least 3 months after the last stroke) were eligible for participation in the MP.</s><s>Participants had to have a flexed elbow, flexed wrist, and clenched fist clinical pattern of spasticity with muscle tone score of at least 2 on the Ashworth Scale (AS) at each site, and a clinical need for a total dose of 400 U incobotulinumtoxinA into the affected upper limb.</s><s>The primary criteria for inclusion in the OLEX were completion of the preceding 12-week MP interval and a clinical need (in the opinion of the local site investigator) for continued treatment with 400 U incobotulinum-toxinA in the affected upper limb; safety criteria (e.g., minimum body weight, negative pregnancy test) were also applied.</s></p><p><s>The OLEX was designed to closely mirror the treatment of upper-limb spasticity in everyday clinical practice.</s><s>Whereas the study MP required a primary target clinical pattern to be chosen by the investigator and associated muscles treated using a predefined total fixed dose and range within the pattern <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>, in the OLEX the treatment of muscle groups associated with each clinical pattern of spasticity (e.g., flexed wrist, clenched fist, flexed elbow, pronated forearm, thumb-in-palm) was determined at the discretion of the investigator.</s><s>Dosing was determined according to the subject's clinical need, within a range of doses predefined for each muscle (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>The total fixed dose for each OLEX injection cycle was 400 U.</s><s>If the investigator determined at the 12-week follow-up for any given cycle that the subject did not require treatment with 400 U incobotulinumtoxinA, the subject exited the study.</s><s>All injections were guided by electromyography, electrical muscle stimulation, or ultrasound.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy Assessments</head><p><s>Changes in muscle tone were assessed using the AS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>, a 5-point scale for the quantitative determination of muscle tone ranging from 0 (no increase in muscle tone) to 4 (limb rigid in flexion or extension).</s><s>AS assessments were performed prior to each injection and at follow-up Efficacy of the previous OLEX injection cycle was further evaluated using Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s><s>This subjective outcome measure was based on the investigator's clinical assessment of each subject's global change in upper-limb spasticity at the 4-week, follow-up visit when compared to the respective injection cycle baseline visit.</s><s>GICS assessments were also completed by the subject and the subject's caregiver (if applicable).</s><s>A 7-point, balanced Likert scale was used to quantify responses as follows: -3 = very much worse; -2 = much worse; -1 = minimally worse; 0 = no change; ? 1 = minimally improved; ? 2 = much improved; and ? 3 = very much improved.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Safety Assessments</head><p><s>Subjects were actively prompted to report any adverse events (AEs) during each visit or via telephone contact.</s><s>A specific questionnaire designed to elicit information related to an AE of special interest (AESI), defined as an AE occurring after treatment that may indicate toxin spread within the injected limb or more diffusely, was administered to subjects at each visit.</s><s>Standard physical and neurological examinations were performed at the OLEX interval visits.</s><s>International normalized ratio and pregnancy testing, where applicable, were conducted prior to each study injection.</s><s>Clinical laboratory evaluations included hematologic and chemistry blood tests at week 12 of each cycle, and assessments of glucose and alkaline phosphatase levels were additionally performed at week 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Results observed during this OLEX demonstrate that repeated injections enabled subjects to achieve improvements in muscle tone and the investigator's GICS scores at the 4-week postinjection visit of each cycle.</s><s>At the conclusion of the MP and OLEX of this study, subjects had received 3-4 total injections of 400 U incobotulinumtoxinA over 48 weeks.</s><s>Overall, the mean changes in AS scores and the proportions of AS responders across all clinical patterns of upper-limb spasticity investigated during the OLEX were similar to those observed in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16]</ref> and the MP of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s><s>The general trend of these observations was that the extended treatment stabilized the tone reductions following active treatment in the MP.</s><s>Notably, for all five clinical patterns, baseline-to-baseline comparisons suggest that there may have been some cycle-to-cycle carryover effects.</s><s>The changes in responder rates (number of subjects with at least a 1-point AS score change) in each OLEX cycle assessed at 4 weeks post-injection were statistically significant at the exploratory level (P \ 0.0001 vs cycle baseline throughout) for each of the five treated clinical patterns, with a lower response rate observed for the thumb and pronator muscle groups than for the other muscle groups.</s><s>Assessments by the investigators, subjects, and caregivers using the GICS confirmed that the vast majority of subjects showed The volumes of incobotulinumtoxinA injected were similar between muscle groups and in all three injection cycles.</s><s>The safety profile observed during the OLEX was similar to the study MP, with no new or unexpected AEs.</s><s>Repeated incobotulinumtoxinA injections were well tolerated overall, consistent with previous studies of botulinum neurotoxin type A formulations in the treatment of post-stroke spasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[25]</ref>, including a study investigating the long-term safety of repeated high doses of incobotulinumtoxinA over 2 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Study limitations previously discussed for the MP <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref> also apply to the OLEX.</s><s>The total dose and injection intervals were all fixed by the study protocol, and although the protocol allowed more flexibility with regard to the doses per muscle for the OLEX, the treatments administered may not be entirely reflective of clinical practice.</s><s>In real-world settings, the severity and pattern of upper-limb spasticity can differ markedly from patient to patient, and physicians may vary doses and injection intervals to meet individual patient needs.</s><s>Indeed, a recent survey of physicians treating spasticity with botulinum neurotoxin injections reveals a common belief that better outcomes are linked to individualized dosing regimens, which may include shortening injection intervals to minimize the risk of wear-off phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[27]</ref>.</s><s>A recent study showed that a higher total dose results in improvements in muscle tone, goal attainment, and other functional measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[28]</ref>.</s><s>Given the low immunogenicity of incobotulinumtoxinA <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[29]</ref>, emerging literature Overall, these data support previous findings that incobotulinumtoxinA improves muscle tone in post-stroke upper-limb spasticity and confirm that repeated incobotulinumtoxinA injections at 12-week intervals are well tolerated, safe, and effective for the treatment of post-stroke upper-limb spasticity in adults.</s></p></div>
