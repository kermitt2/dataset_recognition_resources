<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMPORTANCE</head><p><s>Treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) preserves surfactant and keeps the lung open but is insufficient in severe surfactant deficiency.</s><s>Traditional surfactant administration is related to short periods of positive pressure ventilation and implies the risk of lung injury.</s><s>CPAP with surfactant but without any positive pressure ventilation may work synergistically.</s><s>This randomized trial investigated a less invasive surfactant application protocol (LISA).</s></p><p><s>OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that LISA increases survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' gestational age in extremely preterm infants.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS</head><p><s>The Nonintubated Surfactant Application trial was a multicenter, randomized, clinical, parallel-group study conducted between April 15, 2009,  and March 25, 2012, in 13 level III neonatal intensive care units in Germany.</s><s>The final follow-up date was June 21, 2012.</s><s>Participants included 211 of 558 eligible (37.8%) spontaneously breathing preterm infants born between 23.0 and 26.8 weeks' gestational age with signs of respiratory distress syndrome.</s><s>In an intention-to-treat design, infants were randomly assigned to receive surfactant either via a thin endotracheal catheter during CPAP-assisted spontaneous breathing (intervention group) or after conventional endotracheal intubation during mechanical ventilation (control group).</s><s>Analysis was conducted from September 6, 2012, to June 20, 2013.</s></p><p><s>INTERVENTION LISA via a thin catheter.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</head><p><s>Survival without BPD at 36 weeks' gestational age.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p><s>Of 211 infants who were randomized, 104 were randomized to the control group and 107 to the LISA group.</s><s>Of the infants who received LISA, 72 (67.3%) survived without BPD compared with 61 (58.7%) of those in the control group.</s><s>The reduction in absolute risk was 8.6% (95% CI, −5.0% to 21.9%; P = .20).</s><s>Intervention group infants were less frequently intubated (80 infants [74.8%] vs 103 [99.0%];</s><s>P &lt; .001)</s><s>and required fewer days of mechanical ventilation.</s><s>Significant reductions were seen in pneumothorax (5 of 105 intervention group infants [4.8%] vs 13 of 103 12.6%]; P = .04)</s><s>and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (11 infants [10.3%] vs 23 [22.1%];</s><s>P = .02),</s><s>and the combined survival without severe adverse events was increased in the intervention group (54 infants [50.5%] vs 37 [35.6%];</s><s>P = .02;</s><s>absolute risk reduction, 14.9; 95% CI, 1.4 to 28.2).</s></p><p><s>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE LISA did not increase survival without BPD but was associated with increased survival without major complications.</s><s>Because major complications are related to lifelong disabilities, LISA may be a promising therapy for extremely preterm infants.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>This study evaluated whether LISA is feasible in infants at 23 weeks to 26 weeks 6 days' GA, and whether this treatment increases survival without BPD at 36 weeks' GA compared with conventional surfactant administration protocols.</s><s>An increased rate of survival without BPD was not demonstrated, possibly because the primary outcome of the control group was better than expected.</s><s>Survival without BPD in both groups was higher than that reported in earlier comparable randomized trials, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> which raises the possibility that the NINSAPP trial enrolled healthier infants.</s><s>However, the inclusion rate of NINSAPP (37.8%) was similar to that of the Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and Oxygenation Randomized Trial 3 and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or Intubation at Birth 2 trial (28% and 37%, respectively), and none of the trials enrolled infants younger than 24 weeks' GA who have the highest risk for BPD and death.</s><s>Furthermore, some centers participating in the NINSAPP trial enrolled up to 70% of eligible infants and logistic regression analysis including GA, center, and allocation group revealed no influence of the center.</s><s>This finding indicates that the effect persists even if, perhaps based on certain resuscitation strategies, most infants are stabilized with CPAP and LISA.</s><s>An alternative explanation for the unexpectedly favorable outcome of the NINSAPP control group is the short duration of mechanical ventilation.</s><s>Recent meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> revealed a superiority of interventions that avoided mechanical ventilation compared with those that used positive pressure ventilation.</s></p><p><s>Although we failed to show a benefit with regard to the primary outcome, we observed significant differences in important secondary outcomes.</s><s>Rates of pneumothorax and severe intraventricular hemorrhage were lower in the intervention group, in line with LISA studies 9,10 that reported lower rates of severe intraventricular hemorrhage.</s><s>Furthermore, for the intervention group, an increased rate of survival without major complications was observed.</s><s>Combined outcomes are problematic since each morbidity may be influenced by several factors.</s><s>We had prespecified this secondary outcome since it is the most predictive factor for a life without disability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Survival without major complications was part of the analyti-  cal statistical plan, but this was analyzed only in an exploratory manner and was not adjusted for multiple comparison.</s><s>This lack of adjustment is a limitation of the study.</s><s>With regard to the short-term safety of the LISA method, we evaluated the rates of successful applications and adverse events during applications.</s><s>More than one attempt at surfactant administration was needed in 27% of the infants in both groups.</s><s>LISA resulted in higher rates of transient hypoxemia and bradycardia.</s><s>Desaturation and bradycardia have been seen in other trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> using LISA.</s><s>Although desaturation and bradycardia have no obvious effect on short-term outcome but could theoretically have an influence on long-term development, follow-up of infants who experience these complications is mandatory.</s></p><p><s>Our study has some limitations.</s><s>First, it was not blinded, so it is possible that the clinical course of individual infants was influenced by the treating physicians knowing the group allocation.</s><s>Although extubation criteria were defined, delay of extubation in some cases of the intervention group cannot be ruled out, resulting in longer times of mechanical ventilation than necessary.</s></p><p><s>Second, in the study protocol a pragmatic decision was made concerning surfactant dosing.</s><s>Infants received at least 100 mg/kg elevated to the content of the vial.</s><s>This resulted in different doses depending on the birth weight of the infants.</s><s>Because a dose of 200 mg/kg is considered to be superior to 100 mg/kg, infants with a higher birth weight may be at a disadvantage. <ref type="bibr">24</ref></s><s>However, the dose did not influence the results of the present study since it was identical in both groups.</s></p><p><s>Third, the intervention group received early caffeine treatment, whereas the control group received caffeine first at extubation.</s><s>Because caffeine is known to have an effect on BPD, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> an influence of the timing of caffeine administration on the primary outcome cannot be excluded.</s><s>Furthermore, drug therapy was not standardized between study centers.</s><s>However, this lack of standardization seems to be of minor importance since randomization was stratified by centers, and no significant differences between control and intervention groups were observed with regard to medication.</s></p></div>
