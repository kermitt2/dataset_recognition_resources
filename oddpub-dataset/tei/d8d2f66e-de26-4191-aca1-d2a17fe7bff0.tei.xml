<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedures in the RCT (MIPS1)</head><p><s>We included healthy full term infants (37 to 42 weeks of gestational age) with a birth weight above the 10 th percentile for gestational age according to locally applicable growth charts.</s></p><p><s>Infants at risk for atopic diseases, i.e. those with a first degree relative with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis, were excluded.</s><s>Infants with neonatal diseases requiring antibiotic treatment, and infants who had previously received formulae containing prebiotics or probiotics were also excluded.</s><s>Mothers who could not or did not fully breast-feed their infants were asked to participate in the study and to be randomised to one of the two formula groups before the child reached eight weeks of age.</s><s>If the parents gave their consent, randomisation occurred the same day.</s><s>Thus, randomisation and start of the study formula was done at any time before eight weeks after birth.</s></p><p><s>Parents were invited to participate with their child in the follow-up study if their child had completed the RCT (MIPS1), and if they had not moved to another area.</s><s>We did not exclude those children who had received treatment with antibiotics, or those who had received supplementation with prebiotics or probiotics.</s><s>The follow up study took place from November 2008 to February 2011.</s><s>The study was approved by all local ethical review boards of the participating hospitals: Ethikkommission, Ethikausschuß 2 am Campus Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, Germany;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p><s>We included 672 (60% of the 1130 participants in MIPS1) in the MIPS follow up study.</s><s>Of the original study population (n = 1130), 458 children were not included in the follow-up study: 129 children did not complete the RCT (MIPS1), and another 329 children could no longer be contacted because they had moved to another area or had changed their contact information.</s><s>We included 232 (56% of the 414 participants in this group in MIPS1) from the PG, 243 (58%) from the CG, and 197 (66%) from the BG (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Differences in baseline characteristics, including those which may be associated with the outcome, were compared within the treatment groups (PG and CG) between the original MIPS1 study population versus the MIPS follow up study population.</s><s>The only statistically significant difference we found was in the number of rooms in the house in the PG (MIPS1 (n = 414) 3 (3-4) rooms versus in MIPS follow-up (n = 232) 4(3-5) rooms), and in the CG (MIPS1 (n = 416) 3 (3-4) rooms versus in MIPS follow-up (n = 243) 4 (3-4) rooms).</s><s>This was similar in the Prebiotics Group and the Control Group.</s></p><p><s>The baseline characteristics at the beginning of the MIPS follow-up study are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</s><s>We found no statistically significant differences between the PG and the CG.</s><s>Median age of inclusion in the RCT was 30 days of life for the prebiotics group (PG), 32 days for the control group (CG), and 50 days for the breast fed group (BG).</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> shows the data about the vaccination pattern in the PG, CG, and BG.</s><s>There were no statistical differences between the PG and CG.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the adjusted frequency of fever episodes and other illness symptoms during follow-up.</s><s>We found no statistically significant differences between the PG and the CG in the occurrence of fever and other illnesses: in the PG 1.17 (median value, interquartile range 0.50-2.08)</s><s>febrile episodes per year were reported versus 1.20 (0.52-2.57) in the CG (p = 0.22); and 1.48 (0.65-2.60) in the BG.</s><s>We found a higher frequency of 'other symptoms' runny or blocked nose in the BG versus the CG.</s></p><p><s>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref> we present the duration of illness episodes in days.</s><s>There was a shorter duration of 'diarrhoea' in the PG versus the CG (P = .01).</s></p><p><s>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref> the use of antibiotics is shown, with no statistical significant differences between the two study formula groups.</s><s>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ref> shows the use of antipyretics.</s><s>We found no statistical significant differences between the two study formula groups.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>In this study we show that it is unlikely that dietary prebiotic supplementation in the first year of life has an effect on the frequency of febrile episodes in otherwise healthy non-atopic children during their third to their fifth year.</s><s>We found a reduction of one day of the duration of episodes of diarrhoea (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>).</s><s>The clinical significance of this finding may be limited, although shortening the duration of illness by a day is certainly relevant for parents.</s><s>In the MIPS1 study we failed to find an effect of prebiotic supplementation in reducing the frequency of febrile episodes in the first year of life while previously we found a small difference in the frequency of febrile episodes in the first six months in the PG versus the CG (both median values 0.13, P&lt;0.05) in favour of the PG.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> In an additional post hoc 'per protocol' analysis, we used the data of the participants who had either received prebiotic formula or the control formula exclusively for the first four months of life (20 weeks) or who had been breastfed exclusively for the first four months of life (20 weeks), had completed the MIPS1 until their first birthday, and had completed the follow-up from their third to their fifth birthday only (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>For this posthoc analysis we assessed the occurrence of febrile episodes between their third to their fifth birthday.</s><s>No statistically significant difference in the PG versus the CG was found.</s><s>We may speculate that the effect of prebiotics is found only at the time the prebiotics are given, i.e. the period during which the infants received the prebiotics-supplemented   formula as the greater part of their nutritional intake.</s><s>After this period other products increasingly predominate the nutritional intake of the child and the effect of prebiotics may fade away.</s><s>Although it might be speculated that the effect of the study formula was limited because this was often combined with breastfeeding, this was, in fact, not the case: 67-85% of children received exclusive study formula feeding (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s>However, the frequency of febrile episodes in this healthy non-atopic study population in developed countries may be too low to demonstrate a statistically significant effect: in the MIPS 1 study overall there were 1.2 fever episodes per year, and in the MIPS follow up study 1.2 to 1.5 fever episodes per year.</s><s>Aside from the low occurrence of the main study outcome (i.e. the frequency of febrile episodes), another limitation of this study is the substantial number of children which were lost to follow up since the start of the RCT (60% of MIPS1 participants were included).</s><s>The main reason for this is likely to be the relatively long time interval (two years) between the end of the RCT and the start of the follow up study.</s><s>Additionally, about a third of those not included in the follow up study were children who did not complete the RCT (n = 129).</s><s>We did a post hoc sample size calculation with the assumption of two febrile episodes per year (and two years of observation) and a reduction of10% in the intervention group (alpha 0.05 and power 0.80, two-sided) resulting in 1203 children per group.</s><s>These numbers may suggest that the power of the study is limited.</s><s>However its use is not primarily interpreting data.</s><s>An indication of the value of the study results may come from the 95% confidence interval limits for the difference between PG and CG which are -0.74 and 0.40, with a mean difference of -0.17 (Least Square Means, ANCOVA).</s><s>It is very unlikely that the difference between PG and CG is more than one fever episode per year.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> If an effect of prebiotic supplementation exists, this is likely to be small and not clinically relevant.</s><s>We found only one difference in baseline characteristics in the original MIPS1 study population versus the MIPS follow-up study population, but this difference (number of rooms in the household) was similar in the PG and CG.</s><s>Thus, although the original MIPS1 study group and the current MIPS follow up group differ as to this one baseline characteristic, this is unlikely to affect the validity of the comparison between the PG and CG.</s></p><p><s>The incidence of reported febrile episodes being lower that expected may at least partly be explained by the relatively very healthy study population (i.e.</s><s>without a family history of atopic disease).</s><s>The incidence of febrile episodes also may have been influenced by the fact that the main outcome (febrile episodes) relied on parental reports.</s><s>However, this outcome is close to everyday practice in the way that illnesses are recognised in families with young children.</s><s>By prospective documentation (using a diary, repeated telephone calls and visits) any loss of information was further minimalised.</s><s>An underestimation of the number of febrile episodes may have been caused by the use of rectal temperature measurements since many parents currently prefer the use of a tympanic thermometer.</s><s>Based on our three-monthly telephone contact with the parents our impression is that for the purpose of the study parents all were highly compliant with all aspects of the study, including the use of a rectal thermometer.</s><s>We cannot exclude with certainty that no febrile episodes were missed.</s><s>Data using more objective outcome measures such as GP or pediatrician visits were not collected.</s><s>Clear and uniform criteria would probably result in the discounting of at least some illness episodes not fulfilling the criteria.</s><s>Data on the use of antibiotics or antipyretics do not show clinically relevant differences between the two study formula groups (PG and CG).</s><s>We conclude that an effect of prebiotic supplementation in the first year of life is unlikely to reduce the number of infections at age three to five years.</s></p><p><s>Our data suggested a higher frequency of 'runny or blocked nose' (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>) in the non-randomised BG compared to the CG.</s><s>We found similar results in MIPS1.</s><s>This difference may be associated with a different parental attitude towards illness of their children in the non-randomised BG.</s><s>As a group breast feeding parents have a higher socioeconomic and educational level compared to parents who choose to formula feed their child.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref>Recent studies from developed countries demonstrated a clear association of breastfeeding with fewer infections.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> Problems with controlling for possible confounders such as hereditary and household factors remain.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> In this study data about nutritional habits have not been collected.</s><s>Recent studies showed influence of dietary micronutrient intake on the occurrence of infections.</s><s>Most of these studies have been done in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> in specific patient groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>, or do not present data about infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>.</s><s>It is difficult to extrapolate these study results to other populations.</s></p><p><s>In this study we supplemented the infant formula with three oligosaccharides: neutral shortchain galacto-oligosaccharides, neutral long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides, and pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides.</s><s>As yet, there is no clarity as to the optimal composition and amount of prebiotics.</s><s>Thus far, most studies used a combination of short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides.</s><s>A study in mice showed a stimulatory effect on the Th1 type immune response when pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides were added to the mixture.</s><s>( <ref type="formula">7</ref>) A recent RCT demonstrated that a mixture containing neutral and acidic oligosaccharides added to the milk of breast milk-fed and to the formula of formula-fed preterm babies did not reduce the occurrence of infectious diseases in these infants.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23]</ref> Differences in the composition of the prebiotic mixtures are small, but it is unknown if these may lead to different results.</s><s>The results of our study cannot be extrapolated to other prebiotics.</s></p><p><s>The results obtained in our previous studies and in the present study, do not support the use of this mixture to reduce the frequency of infections in children up to five
