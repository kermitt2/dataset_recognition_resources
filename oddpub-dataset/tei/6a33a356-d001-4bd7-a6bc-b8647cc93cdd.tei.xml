<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p><s>In recent years, the process of vaccine development has evolved drastically.</s><s>Yet, the main requirement on vaccines have not changed: the establishment of a long-lasting and pathogen-specific immunological memory as a result of a concerted immune response.</s><s>Subunit vaccines are highly focused and specific, but often suffer from reduced immunogenicity, low reactogenicity, and limited availability of innate defense triggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Although adjuvants are applied to compensate for these deficiencies by activation of different cell types or by a long-lasting release of antigen, the frequently-used aluminum salts and mineral oil lead to diminished immune responses or side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Recently, in vitro experiments showed that the adjuvant component α tocopherol elevated the risk of narcolepsy after H1N1 vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Covalent linkage of immunogenic agents with the vaccines, e.g., by cross-linking, could be used for the enhancement of efficacy.</s><s>Recombinant protein vaccines opened a way to introduce immunogenic agents immediately during the production process.</s><s>This could be done by additional immunogenic peptides, which are bound N-or C-terminally to the protein backbone, or by introduction of non-human posttranslational modifications, e.g., via glycosylation in the case of glycoprotein vaccines <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>These foreign glycosidic structures are able to interact with the conserved Toll-like receptors and, by that, stimulate the immune system comprehensively.</s><s>Therefore, they can be used as adjuvants in vaccine development which mainly boost the recognition of very small inoculants, like toxins, subcellular components, or viral proteins.</s><s>In this study a subunit vaccine candidate against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was used as a model.</s><s>It was recombinantly produced in its native and afucosylated forms.</s><s>However, glycans with and without fucose are both common in humans and, therefore, a direct adjuvant role is highly unlikely.</s><s>This is in contrast to monosaccharides artificial to humans, e.g., N-glycan-bound xylose, which may work as adjuvants <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>RSV causes infections of the lower respiratory tracts and has a prevalence of nearly 100% within the first 24 months of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The virus is a certain threat to prematurely-born children and immunocompromised people.</s><s>According to estimates, 600,000 people die as a result of RSV infections each year <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The common antibody treatment with Palivizumab is of short protective effect, cost intensive, and restricted to infants of high risk.</s><s>DeVincenzo et al. developed an oral RSV entry inhibitor (named GS-5806) which lowered the viral load and the disease symptoms in a double-blind placebo-controlled exposition study <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s>However, until now, there has been no vaccine available and, recently, a phase III study by Novavax failed to confirm vaccine efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The RSV envelope consists of two major proteins, RSV-G (where G stands for glycoprotein) and the "fusion" protein RSV-F.</s><s>Both proteins have been used as targets in previous attempts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>).</s><s>In this study, we focused on the highly-conserved RSV-F which is responsible for virus spreading by fusing with neighboring healthy cells.</s><s>It contains three N-glycans playing a critical role in this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>For vaccine production, a soluble variant of RSV-F was constructed lacking the transmembrane region, but fused with a C-terminal Factor Xa cleavage site and a 6xHis-tag.</s><s>The construct contains two furin cleavage sites that allow proteolytic processing of RSV-F within the trans-Golgi.</s><s>This mechanism results in the native active form (disulfide-linked F1 and F2 subunits) and release of the p27 peptide.</s></p><p><s>It became obvious in recent years that the predictive value of substance testing in animals is limited and the phylogenetic distance between laboratory animals and humans is considerable <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s>RSV vaccines are often tested in mice or cotton rats which, in part, mimic human responses.</s><s>However, there is no single globally-accepted animal-model for the study of RSV vaccines and none in which RSV disease fully matches that of humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>Several studies failed to transfer positive results from rodents, or even primates <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, to humans.</s><s>In addition, animal studies are outside the scope of this (preliminary) study.</s><s>In vitro models exist that, e.g., mimic the pediatric bronchial epithelum via a 3D air-liquid interface model <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or investigate the growth of RSV in primary cells from the human respiratory tract <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>However, these models cannot display the well-concerted interaction of immune cells.</s><s>Therefore, we determined the immunogenic potential of the produced vaccine candidates with the altered glycosylation pattern by performing stimulation experiments in a highly-specialized perfusion reactor system named the Human Artificial Lymph Node reactor (HuALN ® , ProBioGen AG, Berlin, Germany) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>It has been developed to model the human immune system in vitro for testing of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines, assessing immunomodulation, immunogenicity, and immunotoxicity.</s></p><p><s>The reactor allows long-term co-cultivation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and matured dendritic cells (mDC).</s><s>In a 3D hydrogel matrix cells can migrate to form immune-competent micro-organoid structures and dendritic cells form a network in which B-and T-cells can swarm and cluster.</s><s>The HuALN ® enables the analysis of cellular and humoral immunity on the basis of various read-out parameters, e.g., cytokine profiles, histological studies and the cells can be harvested for further analysis, like gene expression profile studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Here, we performed standard HuALN ® 28-day cultivation experiments, where cells of healthy donors were repeatedly stimulated with mDC and RSV-F variants and cell culture supernatants were collected on a daily basis.</s><s>The concentrations of six key cytokines were quantified with a bead-based suspension assay (BioPlex, BioRad).</s><s>These key cytokines were identified in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and cover cellular (IL-2) and humoral (IL-4) immune response, as well as pro-(IFN-g, TNF-a) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines and growth factors (GM-CSF).</s><s>Since cells can only be harvested at the end of the trial, the same experiment was conducted in a fed batch microtiter plate with a comparable stimulation pattern.</s><s>For a comprehensive gene-expression analysis mRNA was analyzed with a Nanostring nCounter ® Gene Expression panel covering more than 500 immunology genes.</s><s>The most stable expressed reference genes in this experimental set-up were identified in an extensive study beforehand and have been cross-checked with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Cytokine Analysis</head><p><s>Three HuALN ® reactors were run with fucosylated RSV-F, RSV-F Fuc-, and one negative control.</s><s>Quantification of the secreted cytokines in the cell culture supernatants was used to evaluate the extent of the humoral and cellular activation of the immune cells.</s><s>Since only 100 µL of supernatants were available per day, multiplexed assays were required to quantify the six key cytokines IL-2, IL 4, IL-10, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, and TNF-α.</s><s>Bead-based suspension assays allow the quantification of up to 100 analytes in as little as 50 µL, thus enabling the measurement of duplicates.</s><s>Bio-Plex Express Kits were used with the help of an automated liquid handling robot in order to achieve very high precision and repeatability.</s><s>Mean recovery rates of spike-in-controls were between 91% and 122%, and for 70% of all data points error limits were below 20% (median error rate 10.4%).</s><s>The time course of the cytokine secretion is shown for all stimulation experiments in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The cytokine pattern reveals differences in the mode of stimulation of the immune system.</s><s>Overall, RSV-F Fuc-generates a stronger pro-inflammatory and Th2-based response, while RSV-F strongly suppresses the inflammation process and the T-cell response is more Th1-pronounced.</s><s>Details of the cytokine pattern are discussed below.</s></p><p><s>Only in the initial phase of the cultivation can a stronger pro-and anti-inflammatory response be observed for RSV-F-stimulated cells.</s><s>After restimulations at day 7, 14, and 21 the pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine secretions show individual characteristics, especially differences in the particular duration of their release.</s><s>In general, the pro-inflammatory response is higher in the afucosylated viral antigene than in the fucosylated one.</s><s>In particular, TNF-α secretion clearly correlates with the time points of restimulation.</s><s>In contrast, the anti-inflammatory IL-10 response is more strongly pronounced in RSV-F.</s><s>As a result, the IFN-γ response is suppressed after the first restimulation on day 7 in the wild-type control.</s><s>IL-10 shifts the immune response indirectly in favor of Th2 cells, B-cells, and the humoral response, while IFN-γ suppresses the same.</s><s>In RSV-F Fuc-stimulated cells the Th2 activation is mediated via the immunologically-relevant secretion of IL-4.</s><s>While its initial secretion is low, the response to restimulations is well-modulated and indicates a highly specific mode of action for the afucosylated RSV-F protein.</s><s>RSV-F stimulated cells lack this prominent Th2 activating response.</s><s>Overall, the observed concentrations of Th1 activating IL-2 are unexpectedly low.</s><s>RSV-F treatment always shows elevated IL-2 levels one day after restimulation.</s><s>In contrast, the highest IL-2 concentration is reached on day 7 after RSV-F Fuc-treatment and is heavily delayed from the initial stimulation.</s><s>IL-2 is bound to the IL-2 receptor during T-cell proliferation, which might lead to lower IL-2 concentrations in the cell culture supernatant.</s><s>In contrast, IFN-γ secretion, which is one of the effector cytokines of activated Th1 cells, is elevated.</s><s>Hence, activation of Th1 cells can be concluded and a well-balanced Th1/Th2 response is demonstrated.</s><s>Finally, GM-CSF secretion of RSV-F Fucstimulated cells corresponds with each restimulation, but shows decreasing concentrations.</s><s>GM-CSF promotes the development of monocytes and granulocytes and, thus, facilitates the cellular response and adaptive immunity, since monocytes can mature into dendritic cells.</s></p><p><s>Unstimulated cells (negative control) exhibit two stress responses.</s><s>Within the first days of cultivation levels of TNF-α and IL-10 are already increased, which is true for all cytokines, with the exception of TNF-α, from day 16.</s><s>The initial release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines can be induced by overnight resting (e.g., after thawing the cells) and is reported for TNF-α, but not for IFN-γ, by Kutscher et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s>Secondly, the bolus for negative controls contained medium in the same volume as for the vaccine stimulations.</s><s>Thus, necrotic cells may be whirled up, disintegrated at once, and raise interferon levels of healthy cells nonspecifically.</s><s>As a result, IL-2 concentration increases at day 21.</s><s>More importantly, PBMCs react or die spontaneously at this time point due to the absence of any kind of stimulation.</s><s>This is in line with the normal lifespan of naïve and resting T-cells in vitro, which need to be stimulated with cytokines for survival or proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Gene Expression Analysis</head><p><s>To get a general idea of changes of the gene expression between stimulants we performed a cluster analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>) using hclust in R (version 3.3.2).</s><s>As expected, these clusters are mainly time-dependent, with the exception of LPS.</s><s>Both RSV-F protein-stimulated cells show higher dissimilarity of LPS samples compared to the unstimulated negative control, due to the different mode of action of LPS.</s><s>Interestingly, after 48 h of cultivation, RSV-F Fuc-is clustered outside the closer-related fucosylated RSV-F and negative control.</s><s>This indicates that the onset of immunologic reactions is stronger for the afucosylated viral antigene.</s></p><p><s>To analyze differences of gene expression pattern of this time point in more detail, fold-change estimates were built from the nCounter assay for each stimulation type.</s><s>We did not use any specific thresholds to identify genes with a particularly strong fold change, but identified significantly differentially-expressed genes between both RSV-F protein treatments with the help of NanoStringDiff R package.</s><s>Clusters of genes that are functionally associated with the identified genes or of primary immunologic function were grouped and further analyzed.</s><s>In accordance with the hclust analysis the early response after 48 h of cell stimulation showed the most prominent and informative differences in gene expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>), whereas data of day 5 and 7 often showed transient effects over time (data not shown).</s><s>PBMC were incubated for 28 days and stimulated with RSV-F protein variants and the according maturated DC at days 0, 7, 14, and 28 (dotted lines).</s><s>Some maximum values are cut off (IL-10 and TNF-α) for better resolution of lower concentrations.</s><s>Since both cytokines can act in an autocrine-like manner, the height of the values is of minor importance, immunologically, if a certain threshold is exceeded.</s><s>Several clusters show comprehensive upregulation of gene expression for RSV-F Fuc-but not for RSV-F, stimulation after 48 h of stimulation.</s><s>These clusters cover cellular, humoral, innate, and adaptive immunity, as well as the related transcription factors or activation markers and are discussed in detail.</s></p><p><s>To augment the cytokine analysis, clusters of Th1-, Th2-, and Th17-related genes were analyzed.</s><s>Apparently, differences in the expression of Th1-associated genes are negligible, however, IL2 and IFNG (coding for IL-2 and IFN-γ) were upregulated-providing evidence that RSV-F Fuc-evokes a certain Th1 response, although IL-2 concentrations were comparably low in cell culture supernatants of RSV-Fuc-treated cells.</s><s>In the Th2 panel all interleukins and transcription factors are upregulated in RSV-F Fuc-, but not in RSV-F, which is in compliance to the cytokine data from the HuALN ® experiment.</s><s>The Th17 panel shows the most significant differences in the expression of Interleukin 17 subunits and Th17 associated transcription factors (RORC, STAT3).</s><s>Activation of Th17 cells is favorable, since they play critical roles in host defense against pathogens at mucosal sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, where RSV infections takes place.</s><s>Both Th2, as well as Th17, promote B cell development and interact closely with B cells in response to pathogens.</s><s>Th17 cells are involved in B cell recruitment, and Th17 activity may encourage antibody production <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, which is promising since a high titer of neutralizing antibodies is often seen as an indicator for successful RSV protection <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>B cell development markers show significantly higher expression by the afucosylated viral protein than in wild-type RSV-F.</s><s>Among them is, e.g., BLNK, which plays a critical role in orchestrating the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition.</s><s>Furthermore, genes that code for receptors for the Fc region (FCGRs and FCAR) of monomeric or complexed immunoglobulins (Ig) are partially activated.</s><s>They have comprehensive functions in innate, adaptive, and humoral immune responses by modulating subsequent effector and regulatory processes, like phagocytosis of immune complexes and antibody production.</s><s>The upregulation of these genes proves that immune cells respond to the inflammatory reaction by going into an alert state and expect a humoral immune reaction.</s><s>The upregulation of IgG and IgA, but not IgE is of interest, since both classes of antibodies transcytose across the epithelial cells to enter the lumen of the respiratory tract, bathes the mucosal lining, and can protect against RSV disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Along with this, there is an overall increased expression of observable genes associated with the activation, differentiation or proliferation of T cells and DCs in RSV-F Fuc-.</s><s>This is accompanied with a generally stronger activation of parts of the innate immune system comprising antiviral and antimicrobial components, as well as lectins in cells stimulated with RSV-F Fuc-, but not in wild-type RSV-F-stimulated cells.</s><s>Moreover, the expression of chemotactic ligands and receptors is more pronounced in the afucosylated RSV-F protein.</s><s>Lastly, RSV-F Fuc-shows a comprehensive upregulation of signaling molecules of the JAK/STAT and NFKB pathway, which leads to broad activation of transcription factors.</s></p><p><s>LPS, a widely used inflammation control, worked efficiently in this study.</s><s>It generated a strong pro-inflammatory response and also activated LPS-induced genes like CD14 (a co-receptor of TLR 4) and other typical LPS-induced chemokines (CCL2, CCL19, and CCL20).</s><s>However, in comparison to both RSV-F proteins, it failed to activate the Fc receptor expression.</s><s>In further studies, a more specialized positive control can be used, consisting of a mix of different stimulants which, themselves, address distinct cell types and their pathways.</s><s>Thus, an encompassing activation of the immune system may be elicited.</s></p><p><s>Since PBMCs are a mixture of cells, differential gene expression may be masked and a strong activation of a small fraction of cells cannot be distinguished as significant.</s><s>Thus, we accepted somewhat lower p-values within the analysis of differential gene expression.</s><s>Optimally, cells need to be separated (e.g., into Th1, Th2, Th17, and DC) and analyzed individually to allow an exact assignment of significant changes in the gene expression.</s><s>A higher number of tests will be necessary; however, smaller individual gene sets will be appropriate in subsequent experiments.</s></p><p><s>The humoral immune response can be further investigated in the HuALN ® system.</s><s>The experimental setup was not designed for a deeper analysis of B-cells and any generated antibodies.</s><s>Nevertheless, we see an upregulation of the Recombination Activating Gene 2 (RAG2) after 48 h of stimulation for the afucosylated F-protein, but not for the wild-type F-protein.</s><s>However, the expression of RAG1 and Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AICDA), which is heavily involved in somatic hypermutation, is downregulated.</s><s>This may represent a kind of intermediate incomplete activation status due to the lack of additional factors (e.g., stromal cells).</s><s>Recently, the physiology of the HuALN ® system has been further improved by establishing a differentiation protocol to generate lymph node stromal-like cells from mesenchymal stromal cells for co-cultivation in the existing allogenic PBMC and mDC system <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s>We believe that this improvement can further enhance the analysis of relevant glycoengineered viral antigenes.</s></p><p><s>Investigation of the glycosylation pattern of the produced antibodies or other immunologicallyimportant molecules is highly interesting in itself, since it correlates with the vaccine's mode of action.</s><s>Mahan et al. revealed that distinct glycosylation patterns are programmed, and even remembered, after immunization, when adjuvant stimulation addressed Toll-like receptors (TLRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s>However, the responsible glucuronyltransferases are only partially covered by the used NanoString panel, and have to be analyzed with custom assays in the future.</s></p><p><s>The analysis of cytokines and of the gene expression within suggests different modes of activation between both RSV-F types, which can be attributed to the fucosylation state of the RSV-F protein.</s></p><p><s>Afucosylation led to a much stronger pro-inflammatory Th2 and Th17 based activation.</s><s>However, in this study we were unable to address the molecular mechanism of this effects experimentally.</s><s>It is known, that the interaction of immune receptors could be mediated by the degree of fucosylation of ligand glycans.</s><s>The most prominent example is the improved binding of fucose-deficient IgG1 to human FcγRIIIA <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, fucosylation of glycans may influence the conformation of the RSV-F proteins.</s><s>In this context, unmasking of complete epitopes is unlikely due to the small size of fucose, but increasing accessibility of epitopes by the immune system might be possible.</s><s>A second explanation for the observed small, but significant, differences in immunogenic potency of RSV-F and RSV-F Fuc-might be the proportion of remaining pep27 at the purified proteins.</s><s>Although we cannot detect significant differences by semiquantitative densitometry, an influence of pep27 on immunogenicity is suggested.</s><s>An immunomodulatory role has been found for bovine RSV pep27 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>; however, no such role has been attributed to the human RSV intervening peptide, which does not share a sequence similarity with its bovine counterpart.</s></p><p><s>However, most importantly, in this study we showed that the HuALN ® reactor and the downstream analysis methods are able to discriminate the effects caused by very small modifications of the glycan structure.</s></p><p><s>Recently, Rosenlöcher et al. reported the gradual fucosylation of recombinant glycoproteins by exploiting the salvage pathway of the same cells used in this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>Supplementation of the culture media with distinct concentrations of fucose could allow a fine tuning of the Th1/Th2 balance and the strength of the inflammatory process.</s><s>Furthermore, by supplementing immunogenic fucose analogues in the culture media, the immunogenicity of recombinant protein vaccines could be further modulated.</s></p></div>
