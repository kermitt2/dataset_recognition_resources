<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Subjects</head><p><s>Data used in this project were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).</s><s>The ADNI was initiated in 2003 by the NIA, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration, pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations for the development of diverse biomarkers for the early detection of AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (For more information on study procedures see http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/).</s></p><p><s>For this study, patients with a baseline diagnosis of MCI and a follow-up time of at least 36 months were extracted from the ADNI database.</s><s>Patients who were diagnosed with MCI, NL or MCI to NL at all visits during the 3-year follow-up were included in the MCI-stable group, whereas patients whose diagnosis changed to AD during the 3-year follow-up were regarded as MCI-converters.</s><s>After this procedure, 237 patients were selected, 151 of which belonged to the MCI-stable group, and 86 to the MCI-converter group (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Features</head><p><s>Based on the ADNI database, features from 10 modalities were extracted including neuropsychological testing (NP, 15 features), medical history (MEDHIST, 21 features), medical symptoms at baseline (BLSYMP, 25 features), neurological and physical examinations (EXAMS, 28 features), MRI lesion load (LESION, 1 feature), MRI volume-based morphometry (VOLUME, 24 features), voxel-based morphometry (VOXEL, 117 features), laboratory data including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations (BIO, 47 features), PET scans (PET, 7 features), and demographic information about age, gender, and education (DEMO, 3 features).</s><s>This resulted in a total of 288 features (see Table <ref type="table">B</ref>.4).</s><s>All features were obtained from the baseline visits of the patients.</s></p><p><s>Please note that we here only used the sum scores of the different neuropsychological tests because we assumed that they cover all important aspects of the test.</s><s>However, because it might be also interesting to look at specific domains of cognition, we performed additional analyses on the subscores of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Score (ADAS) and the functional activities questionnaire (FAQ).</s></p><p><s>In our final feature set, 7.94% of data were missing (9.1% in the MCI-stable group and 5.9% in the MCIconverter group).</s><s>The number of missing values per feature varied between 0% and 82.12% for MCI-stable patients and 0% and 89.53% for MCI-converters (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> for details).</s><s>In about 20.14% of the features, no data were missing.</s><s>In five features including CSF data, more than 50% were missing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Missing data handling</head><p><s>We compared three ways of missing data replacement: mean imputation, imputation by the EM algorithm, and a combined imputation.</s></p><p><s>In mean imputation, the mean value over all nonmissing data is calculated for each of the features individually.</s><s>This value is then substituted for all missing values of the respective feature.</s><s>To account for categorical and discrete variables we first determined the scale for each of the features and then substituted with the mode, median, or mean value accordingly.</s><s>The main advantage of mean imputation is its low computational cost.</s><s>However, the estimates are often biased <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>A less biased treatment of missing data can be achieved by using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>This is an iterative procedure which switches between an expectation (E) and a maximization (M) step until the most likely values for the missing data are found.</s><s>We used here a regularized version of the EM algorithm described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> (The code can be found at http://www.clidyn.ethz.</s><s>ch/imputation/).</s></p><p><s>Because a considerable fluctuation of EM estimates has been found for categorical features <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, a third imputation technique was implemented which is a combination of mean and EM imputation: for all categorical features mean imputation was performed and the EM imputation was then only carried out on the remaining noncategorical features.</s><s>The performance of these three imputation techniques was evaluated on a complete version of the given data set, where only features without missing values (58 instead of 288 features) were contained.</s><s>Subsequently, we randomly deleted 0% to 90% of the data and calculated the mean squared error between the imputed and true values.</s><s>Because the combined method produced lower errors for almost all cases than mean imputation and EM algorithm alone (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), we decided to use the combined method for all further analyses.</s><s>Importantly, imputation values were calculated based only on training data and were then used to replace missing values in both training and test data.</s></p><p><s>Additionally, we investigated which classification algorithm comes closest to recovering the prediction accuracy of the complete data (as above 58 out of 288 features).</s><s>We therefore performed the different classification analyses (see section 2.4) for the complete data set and a series of incomplete data sets, in which we randomly deleted 0% to 90% of the data (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</s><s>Missing data were replaced via combined imputation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Feature selection</head><p><s>To assess the importance of certain features or feature combinations, we looked at the following sets: all features together, single features and each feature domain (NP, ME-DHIST, etc.).</s><s>Additionally, we compared automatic with manual feature selection.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Automatic feature selection</head><p><s>For automatic feature selection, we implemented two different approaches: F-score and Forward/Backward Feature Selection.</s><s>In both approaches, feature selection was performed on independent feature selection sets determined by a threefold nested cross-validation.</s></p><p><s>The F-score measures the ability of a feature to discriminate between two classes and is calculated as the betweenclass variance divided by the within-class variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>It is fast and easy to calculate but ignores dependencies between features.</s><s>Here, features were ranked by the F-score in the training set and the 10 best ranked features were used for classification.</s></p><p><s>In forward and backward feature selection, the accuracy of a classifier is used as a criterion for feature selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we used an SVM with default parameter (C 5 1) and 10-fold cross-validation.</s></p><p><s>In a forward feature selection the idea is to start with the single best feature, then add other features incrementally and keep only those which increases the classification performance.</s><s>Backward feature selection starts with all features and then features are incrementally removed from the feature set.</s><s>To achieve a more robust selection procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, feature selection was repeated 20 times based on the feature selection set and only those features were included which were selected in a certain fraction of the cases (1 for backward selection and 0.2 for forward selection).</s></p><p><s>The average number of features for forward selection was 9.49 and for backward selection 281.84.</s></p><p><s>The 10 most commonly chosen features for the F-score and forward selection are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. Please note that the feature ranking is averaged over the different analyses and therefore does not reflect a certain combination of features in a particular analysis.</s><s>However, all three feature selection methods can lead to a feature set containing highly correlated variables (e.g. the ADAS-11 and ADAS-13).</s><s>Whereas the F-score assesses each feature independently and thus do not take interactions between the features into account, forward and backward selection add or remove features incrementally and thus combinations of features are assessed.</s><s>Counterintuitively, by reducing the noise the combination of highly correlated and even redundant variables can lead to a better class separation than when using the features alone (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Manual feature selection</head><p><s>In manual feature selection, experts of the different fields (namely, R. Buchert A. Maeurer, A. Roberts, L. Spies, and P. Suppa) have chosen altogether 36 features.</s><s>The feature selection procedure was as follows: For each domain an expert was appointed who was asked to select, from a list of possible features taken from the ADNI database, those features that according to their knowledge are most important in characterizing Alzheimer's disease.</s><s>The only specification we made was that the number of features per domain should not exceed 10 features.</s><s>In particular, the expert features included seven features from NP (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Score 11 and 13 [ADAS 11 <ref type="bibr">and 13]</ref>  Abbreviations: FAQ, Functional Activities Questionnaire; ADAS, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Score; AVEASSOC, average regional association cortex value; X2SDSIGPXL/X3SDSIGPXL, number of pixels with Z-scores 2/3 standard deviations; SUMZ2/SUMZ3, sum of pixel Z-scores 2/3 standard deviations; BCVOMIT, vomiting; NXHEEL, cerebellar-heel to shin; MIDTEMP, volume of middle temporal lobe; LEFT-HIPPO/RIGHTHIPPO, volume of left and right hippocampus; AVEREF, average regional value of the reference region used for normalization; DIG-ITSCOR, Digit Symbol Substitution Test.</s></p><p><s>MEDHIST (Family History Questionnaire, Medical History of neurological, psychiatric or cardiovascular disease), five features from BIO (ApoE4-alleles 1 and 2; Abeta, Tau, and Ptau), one feature from LESION (white matter lesion load), six features from VOLUME (volumes of left and right middle/inferior temporal lobe, left, and right hippocampus), seven features from PET (averaged uptake values in 18F-FDG images in frontal and association cortex and sum of pixel-wise Z-scores), and three features of DEMO (age, gender, and education).</s></p><p><s>These expert features were further divided into standard and advanced features.</s><s>Standard features comprised all features from DEMO and MEDHIST, the neurospychological screening procedures MMSE, CDR, GDS, and NPI and gene data from BIO (in total 16 features).</s><s>All other expert features belonged to advanced features (in total 20 features).</s><s>Importantly, experts assessed the importance of the single features based on their general knowledge and did not use the ADNI data set at hand.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Classification</head><p><s>For the classification of features, we used three different supervised learning algorithms: SVMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, a single classification tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and Random Forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s>All three algorithms are used here to learn a model between baseline features and group membership (either MCI-converter or MCI-stable) based on training data, which is then evaluated on independent test data.</s></p><p><s>SVMs are a very popular classification method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> and have been used for disease classification, including Alzheimer's disease, before <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>SVMs find a decision boundary which maximizes the margin between two groups.</s><s>We used here the library for support vector machines (LIBSVM) LIBSVM toolbox for MATLAB <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and default parameters (C 5 1) based on standardized features (Software can be found at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/wcjlin/libsvm/ ).</s><s>Nonlinear kernels such as the RBF kernel are often associated with an improvement in accuracy and have the advantage to account for complex interactions in the data.</s><s>To assess the importance of nonlinear interactions, we additionally show results on a subset for a linear SVM.</s></p><p><s>Classification trees are a tree-based technique for partitioning complex decisions into a number of simpler decision rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>The motivation using decision trees is the interpretability of decisions.</s><s>However, a single classification tree strongly depends on the training data and even small variations in the input data can lead to a completely different tree structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s>Here, we used MATLAB's fit function from the ClassificationTree class.</s></p><p><s>Random Forest is an ensemble method, where a number of classification trees is grown and the output is determined by a majority vote among all trees <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s>Because the classification is not based on only one tree, Random Forests are thought to produce more robust classification results.</s><s>However, this is achieved at the cost of the interpretability of the decision process.</s><s>Here, we used the software of L.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Comparison of mean and combined imputation</head><p><s>Results of SVM analyses for expert features and features obtained via the F-score were not significantly different for mean imputation and the combined method (P 5 .36 and P 5 .70).</s><s>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, we show the balanced accuracy for SVM, classification tree, and Random Forest separately for different amounts of missing data.</s><s>As expected the classification accuracy decreases for all three algorithms with higher percentages of missing data, and the variance is highest for missing values between 30% and 60%.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Prediction based on neuropsychological subscores</head><p><s>To determine the impact of cognitive subdomains, we performed additional SVM analyses on the subscores of ADAS and FAQ (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</s><s>For the ADAS, most successful subdomains were word recall (66.69%), naming (67.39%), and orientation (65.60%).</s><s>For the FAQ, we found the subdomains of financing (68.22%), assembling of documents (72.48%), and remembering of appointments (69.76%) as most predictive.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p><s>In this study we have shown that the conversion to AD within 3 years can be predicted with a comparably high accuracy based on a heterogeneous set of features, even when certain parts of data are missing.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Comparison of classification algorithms</head><p><s>Among the algorithms evaluated in the present study, nonlinear SVMs produced best classification results.</s><s>The superiority of SVMs against other machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy has been reported in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s>SVMs generally seem to be quite tolerant toward irrelevant features, most likely because they successfully exploit dependencies among features <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>Most classification algorithms have problems when dealing with large and noisy data sets comprising also collinearities in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s>In a recent review, however, it has been shown that our proposed classification algorithms are quite robust with respect to collinearity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s>Whereas SVMs alleviate the multicollinearity problem via regularization, in Random Forests it is alleviated via choosing a random subset of features for each tree.</s><s>Dormann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> come to the conclusion that in terms of accuracy it does not make a big difference whether one "ignores" the collinearity in the data or apply diagnostic tools such as the variance inflation factor.</s><s>Nevertheless, those tools might be helpful in interpreting the data.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Feature selection</head><p><s>Manual and automatic feature selection significantly improved the performance of all three classification algorithms.</s><s>If expert features are available, the choice of these might be the preferable way.</s><s>But if not, we demonstrated that automatic feature selection methods, in particular feature selection based on the F-score or forward selection, can achieve similar classification performance.</s><s>Be eliminating on average only six to seven features, the backward feature selection provided worst results.</s><s>Generally, it is said that forward selection selects much less features than backward feature selection and this way leads often to higher classification accuracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Because the effect of deleting single features especially from a large and noisy data set is expected to be relatively low, the classification accuracy in backward selection saturates at a quite early level.</s><s>However, there are cases in which backward selection gives superior results, especially in cases where the interaction between several features should be taken into account (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</s><s>Over forward and backward selection, the F-score has the additional advantage that it is easy to compute and does not depend itself on a classification procedure.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Missing data</head><p><s>In most studies, the problem of missing data is solved by restricting automatic classification to patients with complete data <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s>However, this becomes a problem especially in the case of multimodal data, because the probability that test results are missing increases with the number of tests.</s></p><p><s>In this study, we substituted missing values to produce a complete data set.</s><s>This has the advantage that every machine learning algorithm can be used for classification.</s><s>In accordance with other studies the EM algorithm and the combined method produced a lower error between imputed and actual values <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s>However, in this study we found that in terms of accuracy, it does not make a large difference whether the combined method or mean imputation is used.</s></p><p><s>For all three classification algorithms, a similar pattern for different percentages of missing data has been observed.</s><s>However, SVMs started with the highest accuracy and also provided the highest mean value over all analyses.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">ROC optimization</head><p><s>Our proposed ROC optimization yielded the 50:50 balance of sensitivity and specificity only for SVMs.</s><s>It is evident that the desirable balance of sensitivity and specificity depends on the task and might change when new treatment options become available.</s><s>However, ROC adjustment can also be used to optimize for specific values of sensitivity or specificity depending on predefined costs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Best single features</head><p><s>The best performing single feature was the FAQ, which is interesting since this measure, in contrast to the MMSE, is not used in everyday clinical routine.</s><s>Its relevance for the prediction of conversion to AD has been previously shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Within the FAQ, the ability of assembling documents such as tax records had the strongest influence on the later diagnosis.</s><s>Future studies might evaluate whether the FAQ or similar scores assessing cognitive and social functioning should play a stronger role in diagnostic guidelines.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Best modalities</head><p><s>In accordance with other studies mostly focusing on the domains neuropsychology, MRI, and PET <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> our analyses also identified these modalities as containing Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Multimodal classification</head><p><s>There are a number of studies that also explored the use of multimodal data for either diagnosing AD/MCI (vs.</s><s>healthy controls) or predicting the conversion from MCI to AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>All these studies come to the conclusion that multimodal prediction is superior to unimodal prediction (accuracy was typically increased by 2%-7%).</s><s>In our case, the best multimodal accuracy only slightly exceeded the best unimodal accuracy.</s><s>This may be explained by the simplicity of our approach: Features were just concatenated into one vector.</s><s>By this, we did not make any use of the specific covariance structure between the modalities.</s><s>However, all of the mentioned studies were based only on a certain combination of complete neuropsychological, MRI, CSF, gene, and PET data and not as in our study on an incomplete set comprising features from all modalities available in ADNI.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.8.">Limitations</head><p><s>First, the algorithms we used produce only dichotomous class labels and can therefore not directly be used for expressing uncertainty.</s><s>Future studies might exploit probabilistic models for generating probabilistic outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Second, we did training and testing both on baseline MCI-patients after the guideline that training and testing data should be of the same kind.</s><s>However, other studies have shown that a classifier can benefit from training in AD and healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Third, one may criticize that the use of neuropsychological tests introduce some kind of circularity in the analysis.</s><s>However, three of the most successfully discriminating scores were not used to make the diagnosis in ADNI, namely the FAQ, ADAS 11, and ADAS 13 (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ADNI_</s><s>GeneralProceduresManual.pdf, p. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Fourth, another point for criticism might be the fact that the expert features are based on individual expert opinions only and by this do not reflect expert knowledge that is universally valid.</s><s>Future studies might involve more sophisticated strategies such as a voting scheme over several experts or a Delphi review.</s></p><p><s>Fifth, our proposed models do not account for censoring in the data.</s><s>When such models are intended to be brought into clinical practice, it is necessary to find ways to deal with missing data due to censoring.</s><s>One possibility might be to combine SVM and Cox regression as suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.9.">Conclusion</head><p><s>Based on a large and heterogeneous set of incomplete ADNI data, the conversion from MCI to AD could be predicted with comparably high accuracy and balanced sensitivity and specificity.</s><s>We recommend the substitution of missing values via a combination of mean imputation and EM algorithm and for classification SVMs because they are very flexible toward different data characteristics.</s><s>The dimensionality of the data should be reduced to the most relevant features either by hand based on expert knowledge or by an automatic feature selection method.</s><s>Future studies should explore the use of probabilistic models for disease prediction based on incomplete data and more sophisticated ways of combining the data of different modalities.</s></p><p><s>1.
