<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRC core components are expressed in BTC cell lines</head><p><s>The core components of the PRC1 complex BMI1/ BMI1 and RING1B could be detected in all BTC cell lines at a various extent on mRNA level and/or protein level, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s>Correlation analysis of mRNA and protein expression indicates a significant correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.76, p=0.029) for these eight cell lines.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PTC-209 inhibits proliferation of BTC cells</head><p><s>The effect of PTC-209 on the overall cell viability of BTC cell lines after 72 h is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>.</s><s>PTC-209 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner in seven of eight tested BTC cell lines (for significances and 10% or 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 10 , IC 50 ) see additional file 1).</s><s>There was no significant correlation between expression of BMI1/BMI1 and the effect of PTC-209 on the number of viable cells (IC 10 , p=0.8 and p=0.5 for mRNA and protein, respectively).</s><s>GBC cells showed a significant response in all, but the two lowest PTC-209 concentrations and displayed low IC 10 and IC 50 values (additional file 1).</s><s>Therefore, we used this cell line for all subsequent experiments.</s></p><p><s>To further analyze the effect of PTC-209 on proliferation and survival of BTC cells, clonogenic assays were performed, indicating that treatment of BTC cells with PTC-209 completely inhibited growth of clones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> for GBC; see additional file 2 for other cell lines).</s></p><p><s>To evaluate whether these observations are caused by either growth arrest or a direct cytotoxic effect (e.g.</s><s>apoptosis), we measured caspase activity in PTC-209treated GBC cells.</s><s>PTC-209 only slightly increased caspase activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), indicating that the observed effects of PTC-209 on cell viability might be not primarily caused by induction of apoptosis, but rather by a stop of cellular growth.</s></p><p><s>To confirm this assumption, we analyzed cell growth using the resazurin viability assay and observed that 1.25 µM PTC-209 almost completely stopped cellular growth of GBC cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</s><s>This observation was confirmed by an additional experiment in which we monitored the confluence as a surrogate marker of cellular growth in real-time by continuous live cell monitoring over 72 h.</s><s>After calculation of the cell density for each picture, the cell growth curves (mean of five independent experiments) clearly show that PTC-209 impedes cellular growth (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly, this effect was already observable after 24 h of PTC-209 treatment as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref> (see additional file 3 for a representative video).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PTC-209 causes cell cycle arrest</head><p><s>We next studied the effect of PTC-209 on the cell cycle in GBC cells.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>, 2.5 µM PTC-209 increased cells in sub-G1 (from 25% to 35%) after 72 h of incubation.</s><s>Additionally, PTC-209 treatment caused a significant increase of cells in the G0/G1 phase, accompanied by a significant decrease of cells in the S phase after 72 h.</s><s>The percentage of cells in the G2/M phase remained unchanged (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</s><s>Time-resolved analysis of the effects of PTC-209 on the cell cycle (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>) indicates an increase of cells in the G0/G1 and sub-G1 phases and a decrease of cells in the S phase already 24 h after treatment.</s></p><p><s>To further investigate the effect of PTC-209 on the cell cycle, we performed a comprehensive qRT-PCR analysis covering changes in the mRNA levels of 84 cell cycle-related genes following 24 h of PTC-209 treatment.</s><s>We considered genes with a fold change of greater than two as up-or down-regulated, respectively.</s><s>Using this threshold, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref> shows that PTC-209 treatment caused up-regulation of seven and a down-regulation of 24 genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>, for list and results of all 84 genes see additional file 4).</s><s>Grouping of these genes shows that numerous cell cycle-promoting G1-phase genes were significantly down-regulated, including cyclins CCND1, CCND3, CCNE1, as well as CDK-2/-4, and TFDP-1/-2.</s><s>These changes were accompanied by a significant up-regulation of two G1-phase inhibitors (CDKN1A and CDKN2B).</s><s>Furthermore, we observed significant down-regulation of genes responsible for initiation of DNA synthesis (CDC6, MCM2-5).</s><s>Additionally, PTC-209 reduced mRNA levels of DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1, MRE11A, and RAD51.</s><s>In line with these observations, immunostaining revealed a reduction of cells positive for proliferation markers Ki-67, CCND1 and pHH3 after PTC-209 treatment (significant for Ki-67, CCND1; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D and 3E</ref>).</s><s>Interestingly PTC-209 caused a significant increase of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D and 3E</ref>).</s><s>This factor was also upregulated on mRNA level by trend (fold change 1.7, see additional file 4) after PTC-209 treatment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PTC-209 reduces CSC subpopulations</head><p><s>Treatment with PTC-209 caused a significant reduction of ALDH+ cells from 50% to 20% after 72 h in the GBC cell line (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A and 4B</ref>).</s><s>It is worth mentioning that in two out of four experiments, PTC-209 completely abolished the ALDH+ subpopulation.</s><s>However, this effect seems to be highly cell linedependent, since PTC-209 treatment did not cause reduction of ALDH+ subpopulation in all eight BTC cell lines (see additional file 5).</s><s>We additionally evaluated the effect of PTC-209 treatment on sphere formation of GBC cells as a second functional CSC marker.</s><s>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> and 4D, PTC-209 reduced number and size of spheres in vitro.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PTC-209 shows potential synergy with cisplatin</head><p><s>Since treatment with PTC-209 reduced mRNA levels of genes involved in DNA repair (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>) we finally tested if a combination with the standard chemotherapeutic cisplatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> shows a synergistic effect -based on the mathematical model of Chou T.C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s>Although the absolute cytotoxicity values of the combined drugs are not considerably lower compared to PTC-209 alone, eight combinations of PTC-209 and cisplatin yielded a combination index (CI) below 0.9 indicating drug synergy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p><s>In this study we provide first data on the anti-cancer effects of PTC-209 in BTC cell lines: i) treatment of eight different BTC cell lines with various concentrations of PTC-209 significantly inhibited number of viable cells in seven cell lines, ii) this effect is mainly mediated by a stop of cell growth, iii) cell cycle and gene expression analysis of cell cycle-related genes confirm a cell cycle arrest at G1/S, iv) PTC-209 may inhibit putative CSC as it reduces sphere formation and the amount ALDH+ BTC cells (cell line-dependent), and, v) combined treatment with cisplatin shows a synergistic effect for several combinations.</s></p><p><s>For one cell line (EGi-1), the number of viable cells was not reduced compared to untreated controls.</s><s>This is surprising, since EGi-1 showed the highest expression of BMI1 on mRNA level and also high expression of BMI1 protein.</s><s>The reasons remain speculative, but genetic alterations of the BMI1 gene or downstream genes might explain the non-responsiveness of this cell line.</s><s>Since all other seven BTC cell lines used in this study showed significant responsiveness for PTC-209, future projects need to investigate the underlying mechanisms of resistance to identify potential biomarkers for PTC-209 sensitive tumors.</s></p><p><s>While the anti-cancer effects of PTC-209 were mediated by cell cycle exit and apoptosis induction in colorectal tumor-initiating cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the cytotoxic effects of PTC-209 in the investigated BTC cells were rather caused by an inhibition of cell growth than apoptosis.</s><s>Following PTC-209 treatment, we saw an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, accompanied by a significant reduction of cells in the S-phase, indicating a cell cycle stop at the G1/S checkpoint.</s><s>Interestingly, this effect was already observable after 24 h of PTC-209 treatment.</s><s>This observation goes in line with findings by Ismail et al., which describe that PRC1 inhibition led to reduction of ubiquitylated H2A as early as one hour after treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, immunostaining revealed a decline of cells positively stained for proliferation markers Ki-67, pHH3 and CCND1 (significant for Ki-67 and CCND1), accompanied by a significant increase of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1B.</s></p><p><s>To provide first information on the mechanism of action of PTC-209 causing cell cycle stop in BTC cells, we comprehensively analyzed changes in expression of cell cycle-related genes after PTC-209 treatment (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> for summary).</s><s>PTC-209 significantly reduced the expression of numerous genes that promote cell cycle in the G1-phase.</s><s>To our current understanding, the CCND/ CDK4 complex activates E2F-1, which in turn leads to the transcription of its target genes, including itself, CCNE and CDC25a.</s><s>CCNE then associates with CDK2 to control G1 progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s>PTC-209 caused a significant mRNA up-regulation of the two cell cycle inhibitors CDKN1A (inhibits CCND/CDK4) and CDKN2B (inhibits CCNE/ CDK2).</s><s>Additionally, PTC-209 diminished mRNA levels of TFDP1 and TFDP2, which are known to form complexes with E2F-1 to enhance its transcriptional activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>SKP2 has been shown to be important for progression of the cell cycle in the G1-phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and PTC-209 treatment caused a significant down-regulation of SKP2 in our study.</s><s>Interestingly, a recent publication has correlated SKP2 expression in extrahepatic CC with enhanced proliferation and poorer survival and identified SKP2 as an independent prognostic marker <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s>The same study also suggests SKP2 as a potential target of E2F-1 -a gene that was significantly down-regulated after PTC-209 treatment in our study.</s></p><p><s>An important step for cell cycle progression is the  initiation of DNA synthesis.</s><s>During the G1-phase of the cell cycle, the assembly of the pre-replication complex starts by recruitment of CDC6 to the origin of replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>This allows binding of MCM2-7, a complex of six highly conserved proteins that ensures proper DNA replication <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s>When treated with PTC-209, CDC6 as well as four MCM genes (2-5) were significantly downregulated, suggesting that PTC-209 may inhibit initiation of DNA replication.</s><s>Interestingly, a study by Bracken and coworkers showed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of BMI1 resulted in diminished expression levels of CDC6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, making CDC6 a potential BMI1 target.</s><s>Increased expression of MCM genes has been found in various types of cancer and has been associated with short survival rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s>In gallbladder cancer, MCM2 has been shown to serve as an independent predictor of poor outcome, since expression of MCM2 was correlated with larger tumor mass, poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis and shorter survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While insufficient DNA damage repair can lead to the development of cancer in the first place, DNA damage repair is one mechanism of cancer cells to develop

machinery in cancer cells is a desired effect, especially when combined with DNA damaging therapies.</s><s>Following PTC-209 treatment, we observed decreased mRNA levels of BRCA1, MRE11A and RAD51, genes that are involved in homology-directed DNA repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>.</s><s>One potential underlying mechanism by which PTC-209 may inhibit DNA damage repair includes the RAD51 interacting protein RAD51AP <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>, which is also known to be an E2F-1 target <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</s><s>By down-regulation of E2F-1, PTC-209 may indirectly also diminish transcription levels of RAD51AP, which in turn (and combined with the reduced RAD51 mRNA levels caused by PTC-209 treatment) might impair RAD51 activity.</s><s>Interestingly, RAD51AP was related to therapeutic resistance in colon cancer cells, underlining its importance as a potential therapeutic target <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>.</s><s>Concerning BTC, Obama et al. demonstrated, that RAD51AP was up-regulated in intrahepatic CC and associated with proliferation, making it also a potential candidate for BTC treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</s><s>In this regard we asked the question if treatment with PTC-209 can potentially augment chemotherapy in BTC.</s><s>Based on the calculation of the combination index (CI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, several combinations of PTC-209 with the standard chemotherapeutic cisplatin showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect, making PTC-209 an interesting adjuvant drug for future more detailed studies using chemoresistant BTC cells.</s></p><p><s>In the initial study by Kreso et al., PTC-209 treatment caused apoptosis and

reduced the ALDH+ subpopulation in four cell lines (GBC, CCSW, MzChA-2 and TFK-1), whereas in the remaining four cell lines the ALDH+ subpopulation was not affected or slightly increased (BDC, EGi-1, MzChA-1 and SkChA-1), suggesting a strong cell line-dependence.</s><s>Interestingly, Shuang et al. demonstrated that the ALDH+ subpopulation in the BTC cell line TFK-1 had reduced sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and showed higher proliferation potential.</s><s>In patients, expression of ALDH1 was a predictor for poor prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>.</s><s>Additionally, we recently demonstrated that the ALDH+ subpopulation in BTC cells highly expresses known stem cell markers compared to ALDH negative cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, in the present study we observed reduced sphere formation of BTC cells in vitro after PTC-209 treatment, underlining the potential effect of PTC-209 on CSC characteristics.</s><s>This goes in line with Kreso et al., who showed that PTC-209 significantly diminished sphere-initiating cell frequency in colorectal cancer samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>While PTC-209 caused an up-regulation of BMI1 on mRNA level, BMI1 protein levels were clearly reduced after PTC-209 treatment.</s><s>This phenomenon may be explainable by an overcompensation reaction of the cells on the mRNA level.</s><s>As treatment with PTC-209 resulted in reduced ubiquitylation of H2AK119 as the effective histone modification in three out of four experiments, we conclude that the mechanism of PTC-209 involves BMI1 as a direct target -in agreement with the initial study by Kreso et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In summary, the actual study provides for the first time evidence for a significant anti-cancer activity of PTC-209 in BTC cells.</s><s>In vitro, PTC-209 treatment causes cell cycle arrest in BTC cells and cell line-dependent reduction of functional CSC characteristics.</s><s>The present data suggests that PTC-209 is a potential anti-cancer agent for BTC -provided that subsequent future studies yield conclusive data on its anti-cancer efficiency and possible side effects in an in vivo BTC model, its bioavailability in humans and possible mechanisms responsible for drug sensitivity.</s></p></div>
