<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PD1 + macrophages are enriched in gastric-cancer tissues and associated with poor patient survival</head><p><s>To evaluate the PD1 expression of TAMs in an immunocompetent syngeneic setting, we first analyzed its expression pattern in GC tissues.</s><s>We used flow cytometry to study the PD1 expression of macrophages in 26 GC specimens (paired blood, non-tumor tissue, and intratumor tissue; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), and found that intratumoral macrophages expressed a significantly higher level of PD1 than those expressed on non-tumor tissue macrophages, whereas peripheral macrophages expressed little PD1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a-c</ref>).</s><s>Furthermore, we used immunofluorescence staining to study the expression of PD1 on macrophages in 15 GC specimens (paired non-tumor tissue, and intra-tumor tissue; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The results also showed that PD1 + macrophages were accumulated at GC tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d, e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Next, we assessed the clinical relevance of intratumorous PD1 + macrophages in GC patients (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1  and 2</ref>), and found that the proportions of PD1 + macrophages determined by flow cytometry were significantly associated with disease progression in 26 GC patients (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), and that the number of PD1 + macrophages determined by immunofluorescence staining was also significantly associated with disease progression in 15 GC patients (Fig. <ref type="figure">1g</ref>, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, using 24 months as the cutoff, we found that patients with higher proportions of PD1 + macrophages in tumor showed early  recurrence of GC (Fig. <ref type="figure">1h</ref>).</s><s>Thus, these results show that PD1 + macrophages selectively accumulated at the tumor that associate with disease progression and early recurrence in GC patients.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Phenotypic and functional characteristics of PD1 + macrophages in GC patients</head><p><s>We compared the phenotypic features of GC-infiltrating PD1 + macrophages and PD1 − macrophages.</s><s>FACS analysis of typical M1 and M2 markers confirmed that PD1 + and PD1 − macrophages from GC tissues expressed more of the M2-associated surface molecules such as CD206, and less CD64 and MHC class II (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a-d</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further determine the functional characteristics of PD1 + macrophages, we analyzed their cytokine expression using ELISA and q-PCR.</s><s>Correspondingly, the PD1 + macrophages derived from GC tissues expressed higher levels of M2 markers IL-10 and CCL1, but not M1 marker IL-12p70, than PD1 − macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e, f</ref>).</s><s>We then evaluated the phagocytosis levels of PD1 + macrophages by analyzing the proportion of OVA + macrophages.</s><s>FACS analysis of PD1 − vs. PD1 + macrophages showed that PD1 + macrophages phagocytosed significantly lower OVA in vitro than PD1 − macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure">2g, h</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PD1 + macrophages exhibit immunosuppressive activity and triggering PD1 enhances this suppressive function</head><p><s>To investigate whether PD1 + macrophages could inhibit the function of CD8 T cells, human autologous peripheral blood CD8 + T cells were activated by anti-CD3/ CD28 mAb beads, and PD1 + macrophages and PD1 − macrophages were added at 1:1 ratio.</s><s>The result showed that PD1 + macrophages significantly reduced the proliferation of CD8 T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a, b</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, IFN-γ and perforin expression in CD8 + T cells decreased distinctly in the PD1 + macrophage group compared with the PD1 − macrophage group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c-f</ref>).</s></p><p><s>We also analyzed whether the PD1 signal contributes to the suppressive effects of PD1 + macrophages.</s><s>A PD1 −specific agonist significantly enhanced the ability of the PD1 + macrophages to inhibit the proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3g</ref>), and IFN-γ and perforin expressions of CD8 + T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3h</ref>).</s><s>These findings reveal a novel mechanism involving PD1 + macrophage suppressive function mediated by the PD1 signal.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PD1 + macrophages are negatively correlated with CD8 T cells in GC tissue</head><p><s>To analyze the potential function of PD1 + macrophages in immune cells, we investigate the correlation between the percent of PD1 + macrophages and lymphocytes in GC tissues.</s><s>The results showed that the percent of PD1 + macrophages was negatively correlated with CD8 + T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>), but was not correlated with CD4 + T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>These data showed that the protumorigenic activity of PD1 + macrophages might be mediated via influencing CD8 + effector T cells.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tumor-derived exosomes can promote PD1 + macrophages expansion from monocytes in vitro and in vivo</head><p><s>Interestingly, recent studies demonstrated exosomes, in particular, tumor-cell-derived exosomes, a plethora of immunomodulatory activities on dampening T-cell responses.</s><s>Thus, we hypothesized that gastric-cancer cells-derived exosomes can induce PD1 + macrophage production.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the role of GC-derived exosomes in promoting PD1 + macrophage expansion, we exposed monocytes to secreted exosomes isolated from SGC7901 gastric cancer cell line.</s><s>The isolation of exosomes was confirmed by Nano-sight, western blotting, and flow cytometry for the exosomal marker CD63 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>Treatment with exosomes resulted in an increase in PD1 expression of monocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c, d</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, exosomes coculture also led to the marked upregulation of the M2associated scavenger receptor CD206 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To further confirm the role of exosomes in the production of PD1 + macrophages, we determined their cytokine expression patterns, phagocytosis levels, and immunosuppressive activity.</s><s>Exposure of monocytes to exosomes from SGC7901 and BGC823 led to an increase in IL-10 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>) and CCL1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>), but a decrease in IL-12p70 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5g</ref>).</s><s>Moreover, FACS analysis showed that exosome-treated monocytes phagocytosed significantly lower OVA than monocytes cultured alone (Fig. <ref type="figure">5h</ref>).</s><s>The downregulation of IFN-γ, and perforin expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5i, j</ref>) and an increased ability to suppress CD8 + T-cell functions was also observed in exosome-treated monocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure">5k, l</ref>).</s><s>Importantly, treatment of monocytes and SGC7901 co-cultures with the exosome release inhibitor spiroepoxide led to a distinct reduction in the proportions of PD1 + macrophages following exposure to SGC7901 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5m</ref>).</s><s>We used a tumor-bearing mouse model to analyze the induction of PD1 + macrophages by tumor exosomes, and found that the tumor could induce PD1 + macrophage generation and that the exosome release inhibitor spiroepoxide could impair these effects (Fig. <ref type="figure">5n, o</ref>).</s><s>Thus, these results show that GC efficiently induces PD1 + macrophages from circulating monocytes by the secretion of exosomes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Here, we reported an unrecognized immunosuppressive PD1 + macrophage subset and depict the phenotype, biological function, mechanisms of induction, and clinical relevance of those cells in GC patients.</s></p><p><s>The PD1 signal is one of the best-studied and most clinically successful immune-checkpoint drug targets, and its primary function is widely understood to regulate Tcell function.</s><s>However, the expression and role of PD1 on other immune cells is poorly understood.</s><s>Previous studies have reported that macrophages expressed significantly higher levels of PD1 during the context of pathogen infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> , which resulted in macrophage dysfunction.</s><s>Here, we provide evidence that TAMs from GC patients also share markedly increased PD1 levels, which promotes GC progression by impairing the antitumor functions of CD8 + T cells.</s><s>These data are consistent with the observation that TAMs from colorectal cancer increase PD1 expression and that PD1 expression inhibits TAM′s phagocytosis and tumor immunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p><s>TAMs have been found to polarize toward an inflammatory M1 or pro-tumor M2 state, depending on

from tumor could play a key role in regulating macrophage activation during GC progression.</s><s>Interestingly, treatment of monocytes with exosomes derived from gastric-cancer cells led to an increase in the PD1 expression on monocytes.</s><s>A significant increase in the CD206, IL-10, and CCL1 expression, and a clear decrease in the MHC class II, CD64, and IL-12 expression were observed in exosome-treated monocytes.</s><s>Moreover, functional analysis shows that an increased capacity to suppress autologous CD8 + T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ expression was observed in exosome-treated monocytes.</s><s>Moreover, the exosome release inhibitor spiroepoxide led to a distinct reduction in the proportion of PD1 + macrophages following exposure to exosomes.</s><s>We used a tumor-bearing mouse model to analyze the induction of PD1 + macrophages by tumor exosomes, and found that the tumor could induce PD1 + macrophage generation and that the exosome release inhibitor
