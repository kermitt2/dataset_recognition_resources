<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p><s>Dental caries is a transmissible infectious disease caused by cariogenic bacteria, and Streptococcus mutans has been recognized as the principal etiological agent of dental caries <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s>Cariogenic virulence factors of S. mutans lead to abundant acid production, acid tolerance and stable biofilm formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s>Production of acid during metabolism of carbohydrates (acidogenicity) is one of the main virulence factors of S. mutans, in which lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) plays a critical role <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s>Aciduricity is also a pivotal virulence factor of S. mutans.</s><s>Membranebound F 1 F 0 -ATPase works as a pump to transport protons from cells and to maintain internal pH values.</s><s>This is believed as the determinant of aciduricity of this bacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s>Another critical virulence factor of S. mutans is its ability to produce glucosyltransferases (GTFs) to catalyze synthesis of intracellular polysaccharides (IPS) and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from sucrose <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s>EPS, especially water-insoluble glucans, significantly contribute to the biofilm formation and structural integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s>Hence, suppression of cariogenic virulence of S. mutans could be an appealing approach to preventing dental caries.</s><s>However, the cariogenic potential of S. mutans is not the consequences of independent expression by several virulence genes, but the results of series of coordinate regulatory events.</s><s>Regulatory systems are involved in enhancing the ecological fitness and cariogenic virulence of S. mutans <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s>The VicRKX and LiaFSR two-component signal transduction systems (TCSTS) have been reported as the master regulatory system involved in expression of GTFs, biofilm formation and environment stress tolerance in S. mutans <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s>The ComCDE system quorum sensing (QS) system enables intra-species cell-cell communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s>As these TCSTS are selective for the bacteria and not the host, they are regarded as excellent therapeutic targets for antimicrobial agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>In recent years, studies about antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been extensively conducted around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s>Over the last decade, a significant leap in studies about control of oral pathogens by AMPs was observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s>So far, many natural or synthetic AMPs have shown inhibitory effects on growth of planktonic cells and biofilm of S. mutans in vitro, including defensins, Cathelicidin LL-37, Histatin 5, Human Lactoferrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, KSL <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, L-K6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Bac8c <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and C16G2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s>Furthermore, the placebo-controlled clinical data of C16G2 rinse showed this AMP was safe and reduced S. mutans and enamel demineralization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s>These findings suggest that AMPs have potential to be another safe and promising solution to dental caries.</s><s>In combat against cariogenic bacteria, our group de novo designed and synthesized a series of cationic, amphipathic α-helical AMPs and selected the most promising one, GH12, a 12-amino acids peptide with optimal structure and potency.</s><s>Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> showed that GH12 at the concentration of 8 mg/L, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal inhibitory concentration (MBC) of GH12 against S. mutans, was potent against growth of planktonic bacteria and had a rapid mechanism of action, killing 90% of bacteria in less than 5 min of exposure.</s><s>Moreover, GH12 effectively inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation and metabolism, as well as significantly reduced the biomass of 1day old S. mutans biofilm.</s><s>Cytomembrane observation showed that GH12 had a mechanism of killing S. mutans through formation lysis and pores on the cell membrane and envelope.</s><s>Meanwhile, GH12 had showed little toxic effect on the viability of human gingival fibroblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, and kept stable in human saliva <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>GH12 has shown anticaries potential because of its bactericidal effects on S. mutans, but its interaction with virulence factors and regulatory systems of S. mutans remains to be elucidated.</s><s>The objectives of this study were to investigate effects of GH12 on acid production, acid tolerance, EPS synthesis, and biofilm formation of S. mutans in vitro, and then further explore the function mechanism of GH12 at enzymatic and transcriptional levels.</s><s>To avoid decrease in bacterial population and viability of S. mutans, we limited GH12 to subinhibitory levels.</s><s>It is the first time to systematically investigate effects of AMPs on virulence and regulatory systems of S. mutans.</s><s>Thereby, more information about GH12 could be obtained to further explain its anticaries potential.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Previously, we found that the classic de novo synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide KSL shows low potency against cariogenic bacteria, with a MIC of 62.5 mg/L and MBC of 125 mg/L against S. mutans and L. acidophilus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s>According to structure/ activity relationship studies by Giangaspero et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, we concluded that this poor efficacy may be related to that KSL does not adopt the optimal structure of cationic, amphipathic α-helical AMPs.</s><s>Similarly, we analysed the sequence and structure of a 13-residue AMP L-K6, whose hydrophilic sector was also not clearly separate from the hydrophobic sector <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, our strategy is to design and synthesize de novo a series of cationic AMPs that would be shorter, and adopt optimal amphipathic αhelical structure.</s><s>Designed through integration of existing design strategies, GH12 owns the optimal net positive charge, content of hydrophobic residues and relative amphipathicity, adopts &gt;80% the α-helical composition and shows superior antimicrobial activity against S. mutans with MIC and MBC of 8 mg/L <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s>Notably, Shang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> deduced that L-K6 exerts bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic activity against S. mutans, due to that the MBC values (12.5 μM, 19.40 mg/L) of L-K6 against S. mutans were four-fold higher than the MIC values.</s><s>However, the MIC and MBC of GH12 against S. mutans were very close, suggesting that GH12 may have other potentials.</s></p><p><s>It is well documented that the virulence factors of S. mutans essentially attribute to its clinical complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, up til now, for AMPs, there has been little literature about their anti-virulence activities against S. mutans.</s><s>Prior to our study, only that on Bac8c <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> reported limited information on its inhibition of the GTF gene expression at two-fold MBC against S. mutans.</s><s>Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first time to systematically investigate effects of AMPs on virulence and regulatory systems of S. mutans.</s><s>In the present study, we found that GH12 at 1/2 MIC inhibited various cariogenic virulence factors of S. mutans, resulting in reduced acidogenicity, compromised aciduricity, declined EPS synthesis and defective ability to form biofilms.</s><s>We also proved that GH12 functioned at enzymatic and transcriptional levels.</s></p><p><s>Glycolysis is the main pathway to produce acid in S. mutans.</s><s>LDH is one of the most important enzymes in the process.</s><s>Deficiency of LDH implies that S. mutans lose cariogenic potential <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>.</s><s>The results from the glycolysis pH drop showed reduction in the initial rate of pH drop and rise in terminal pH caused by 1/2 MIC of GH12, which were consistent with results of the lactic acid measurement.</s><s>These findings suggest the impairment in acidogenicity of S. mutans.</s><s>Moreover, GH12 at 1/2 MIC suppressed the LDH at both the enzymatic and transcriptional levels in vitro.</s><s>F 1 F 0 -ATPase, plays a major role in maintenance of ΔpH across the cell membrane of S. mutans, and the positive correlation between ATPase levels and acid tolerance has been proved <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s>GH12 at 1/2 MIC showed remarkable reduction in activity of the F 1 F 0 -ATPase, which may directly lead to a rise in the cytoplasmic acidity, followed by mortal disruption of physiological processes in S. mutans.</s><s>Thus, the survival rate of S. mutans at pH 5.0 was significantly reduced by GH12 at 1/2 MIC.</s><s>But the expression of atpD, a gene encoding α subunit of F 1 F 0 -ATPase <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, was upregulated although not statistically significant.</s><s>Considering that AMPs GH12 function via the mechanism of accumulating at the bacterial membrane and inserting into lipid bilayers <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref>, we speculate that GH12 may directly affect the activity of F 1 F 0 -ATPase, which is located at cell membrane as well.</s><s>Previous studies implied that the ATPase activity does not necessarily correlate with transcription or translation levels of associated genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>.</s><s>The action of GTFs (GTFB, GTFC, and GTFD) is recognized as the major mechanism behind sucrose-dependent adhesion and biofilm formation.</s><s>GTFB (encoded by gtfB) produces highly insoluble glucans, which constitute the scaffold of the EPS matrix.</s><s>GTFC (encoded by gtfC) catalyzes the formation of a mixture of soluble and insoluble glucans, which shape the initial EPS layers and provide binding sites for S. mutans <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45]</ref>.</s><s>In this study, GH12 at 1/2 MIC exhibited a strong ability to inhibit the synthesis of water-insoluble EPS.</s><s>CLSM observation demonstrated that GH12 at 1/2 MIC disrupted the structure and integrity of S. mutans biofilm.</s><s>Results of quantitative PCR confirmed that these inhibitory effects were due to the significant suppression of GTFs at the transcriptional level.</s><s>Notably, GH12 at 1/4 MIC just inhibited the gene expression of gtfB significantly (P &lt; 0.05), but it also showed strong capability to inhibit EPS synthesis and biofilm formation, which may results from that gtfB and gtfC genes are in an operon-like arrangement <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To cope with various environmental stress, S. mutans has developed several regulatory systems.</s><s>vicR gene encodes a VicR response regulator, which is a necessary part of VicRKX TCSTS <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>It has been reported that VicRKX TCSTS have the ability to influence the ComCDE system and gene expression of gtfBCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s>The liaR gene products play an important role in biofilm formation and stress response of S. mutans <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, phosphotransfering from LiaS to LiaR is necessary to promote expression of vicRKX genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, the downregulation of vicR and liaR may result from not only GH12 treatment, but also the interaction between the two genes.</s><s>comD encodes the histidine kinase receptor to response to competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), and comE encodes an intracellular response regulator to mediate expressions of downstream genes.</s><s>Activated ComE enables the production of mutacin Ⅳ and Ⅴ, as well as genetic competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</s><s>Significant downregulation of comDE was also observed in the 1/2 MIC group, and downregulation of comDE by 1/2 MIC of GH12 suppresses regulation of genetic competence and intra-species cell-cell communication.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ultimately as</head><p><s>Relative gene expression  summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>, suppression of theses regulatory systems induced attenuation of the stress response and the environmental adaptation in S. mutans, and consequently led to declines of cell persistence and disruption of biofilm formation and integrity.</s><s>The inhibition of GTFs at the transcriptional level lead to reduced production of EPS and IPS.</s><s>Lack of EPS disrupts both adherence of bacteria and the structure of biofilm.</s><s>When exogenous substrate is depleted, S. mutans can metabolize IPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>.</s><s>Therefore, malfunction of GTFs not only directly disrupt the biofilm integrity, but also may enhance the starvation stress of S. mutans due to reduced preservation of IPS.</s><s>Inhibition of F 1 F 0 -ATPase and small holes on the cytomembrane may directly lead to cytoplasmic acidity, which may also inhibit the normal process of glycolysis.</s><s>This will in turn diminish the ATP pool, supress the activity of the proton translocator (F 1 F 0 -ATPase) and further exacerbate cytoplasmic acidity.</s><s>When LDH catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic condition, it also converts NADH to NAD+.</s><s>Thus, the inhibition of LDH would also lead to increase in NADH.</s><s>If not regulated by NADH oxidase and superoxide dismutase in time, for instance under excess oxidative stress, these excessive reducing equivalents will have toxic effects on S. mutans <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52]</ref>.</s><s>In other words, a series of cascaded biological effects at molecular levels may be triggered by GH12 at 1/2 MIC in cells of S. mutans, which thereby leads to reduced acidogenicity, compromised aciduricity, declined EPS synthesis and defective ability to from biofilms.</s><s>Previous studies have provided evidence that antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory concentrations may induce alternations in bacterial properties, including changes in morphology and ultrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>, as well as inhibition or stimulation of virulence factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</s><s>In our study, 1/4 MIC and 1/8 MIC of GH12 could slightly enhance acid production, and cause different changes in acid tolerance and EPS production (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2-4</ref>).</s><s>1/8 MIC of GH12 promoted the gene expression of ldh, atpD, gtfC, gtfD, vicR, and liaR (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).</s><s>In particular, it is noteworthy that 1/8 MIC of GH12 significantly accelerated the process of pH drop, and slightly lowered the terminal pH (Figure <ref type="figure">2(a)</ref>), but lactic acid production and enzymatic activity of LDH were not significantly affected by GH12 at 1/8 MIC, indicating that GH12 at subinhibitory levels may also influence other glycolytic enzymes not recognized yet, such as the carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[57]</ref>, which need further studies.</s><s>Moreover, Senadheera et al. showed that inactivation of VicRK induced impaired acid production <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>, so we assumed there might be a correlation between upregulated vicR by GH12 at 1/8 MIC and accelerated pH drop, which also needs to be further investigated.</s></p><p><s>However, beyond the threshold of 1/2 MIC (4 mg/ L), all virulence factors of S. mutans were inhibited by GH12.</s><s>This saltatorial pattern has also been observed when S. mutans was treated by hydrogen peroxide, methyl viologen and chlorhexidine in studies of Bitoun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>.</s><s>Thus, for efficiently inhibiting cariogenic virulence of S. mutans, concentration of GH12 should be maintained not lower than 1/2 MIC.</s></p><p><s>In summary, based on our data, GH12 shows a potential to act as an alternative anticaries agent because GH12 at 1/2 MIC (4 mg/L) inhibited various cariogenic virulence factors of S. mutans in vitro, resulting in reduced acidogenicity, compromised aciduricity, declined EPS synthesis and defective ability to form biofilms through reducing the activity of related enzymes, downregulating virulence genes, and inactivating specific regulatory systems.</s><s>Considering the complexity of gene regulation in S. mutans, further studies with transcriptomic and proteomic approaches should be carried out.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1
