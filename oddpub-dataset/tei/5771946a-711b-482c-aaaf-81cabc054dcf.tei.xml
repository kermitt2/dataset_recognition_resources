<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p><s>A neuron can be characterized based on its response (generally, its tuning function) to various task variables.</s><s>Tuning properties for a set of neurons can then be used to categorize them into discrete subgroups with distinct functional proper-ties.</s><s>For example, one could imagine that neurons may be classified based on whether they respond to value, to space, or to both.</s><s>While such groupings may be heuristically useful, they do not necessarily identify natural clustering that, to use Plato's phrase, "carves nature at its joints."</s><s>That is, a categorization procedure either can detect discrete categories or it can artificially impose groupings on what is actually a continuum of responses.</s><s>Thus, for example, a population of neurons could have selectivities for reward and space that are drawn from two uniform and independent distributions; selecting the neurons that are most strongly reward sensitive and putting them into a category would impose a cluster on what is a actually a continuum.</s></p><p><s>Standard clustering methods like k-means do not distinguish between these two sorts (i.e., natural and externally imposed) of categories.</s><s>Instead, they produce best clusterings without providing any indication about whether the underlying distribution is more clustered than would be expected by chance.</s><s>Another approach with the same limitation is to use a cutoff like P Ï½ 0.05 to divide cells into categories and use the resulting cell classifications to make inferences about category function.</s><s>This method can be susceptible to both Type I and Type II errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Maxwell and Delaney 1993)</ref>.</s><s>Three aspects of this approach are particularly problematic.</s><s>First, it uses categorical classification (significant vs. nonsignificant) on continuous variables and thus throws away a great deal of information (a Type II error problem).</s><s>Second, whether a neuron reaches significance will depend on the number of trials collected; this arbitrary factor will increase variance in the estimate of clusterings (another Type II problem).</s><s>Third, due to the mathematics of joint probability, when data are noise limited (i.e., almost always), fewer neurons will reach significance for two variables than for either one.</s><s>This bias will lead to a systematic overestimate of coding disjunctions-that is, neurons will appear more purely categorical than they really are (a Type I problem).</s></p><p><s>Understanding the distribution of tuning functions is important for several reasons.</s><s>First, delineation of cell types is an important basic description of the nature of responses in a brain area.</s><s>Classification provides a useful way to simplify what are often complex and heterogeneous response patterns.</s><s>For example, comparisons of response properties between brain regions gives insight into the core differences in their functions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kennerley et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Seo and Lee 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Sleezer et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Strait et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, Tsujimoto et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wallis et al. 2001)</ref>.</s><s>Second, categorization provides important constraints on neural models.</s><s>For example, two-pool models of economic choice rely on classification of cells into two types based on selectivity for individual stimuli in economic choice tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Chau et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hayden and Moreno-Bote 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hunt et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Louie et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Soltani et al. 2006)</ref>.</s><s>Finally, categorization of neurons provides a possible baseline for establishing functional implications of anatomical and genetic methods that delineate specific cell types (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kvitsiani et al. 2013)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>The question of whether there are natural functional categories of cells in most brain regions remains unanswered.</s><s>This problem is particularly salient now.</s><s>Recent successes of population analysis methods have demonstrated the power of ensemble coding and distributed computation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blanchard et al. 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Churchland et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hunt and Hayden 2017;</ref><ref

al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Stokes et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s>Moreover, theoretical advances confirm the flexibility and power of mixed encoding schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barak et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fusi et al. 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ganguli and Sompolinsky 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pouget and Sejnowski 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rigotti et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rigotti et al. , 2013))</ref>.</s><s>Finally, a recent high-profile study specifically investigating the question of tuning categories reported no evidence of categorical organization in rodent parietal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Raposo et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s>This finding raises the possibility that category-free selectivity may be a general property of neural systems.</s></p><p><s>We developed a novel analysis approach by using a generative Bayesian model.</s><s>While these problems can be solved using conventional frequentist statistics, they are more naturally solved using Bayesian approaches, wherein the standard equations take into account estimates of the uncertainty in the encoding of variables in an optimal manner.</s><s>This approach also allows us to place a confidence estimate on the likelihood that null results stem from lack of sufficient power or whether they reflect true nulls.</s><s>Our model makes statistical assumptions about the components likely to have given rise to the observed firing patterns.</s><s>It identifies three potential components in any data set: 1) A no-selectivity component that generates neurons that can confidently be said to have no tuning to any task variables (that is, is did not simply fail to achieve statistical significance), 2) a set of pure-selectivity components that generates neurons that have tuning to only one task variable, and 3) a multiple-selectivity component that generates neurons that have tuning to multiple task variables.</s><s>The statistical analysis assumes that the observed data come from a weighted mixture of these components and infers the weights from the neural firing patterns.</s><s>Thus, it might discover that most neurons are purely selective (strong categorical organization, Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>) or come from one large category of multiple selectivity cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>), or even that they are nonselective (not task relevant, Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</s><s>It could also show a mixture of these sets, involving multiple discrete categories (Fig. <ref type="figure">1, D and E</ref>).</s><s>Alternatively, and in contrast to clustering methods, the analysis might show that the data are not highly informative about the classification, telling us that additional techniques or larger data sets are required.</s></p><p><s>To identify these components, we use Bayesian tools [specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling] in the programming language Stan to infer likely values of the mixture weights and parameters of these components <ref type="bibr">(Carpenter et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Our analysis starts from relatively unbiased assumptions about what the parameter values may be (see MATERIALS  AND METHODS).</s><s>Several choices in our modeling setup are designed to make this analysis robust, in particular to outliers and the presence of no-selectivity neurons.</s><s>These include deliberate inclusion of a noise component to remove the influence of no-selectivity neurons, use of t-distributions as mixture components due to their robustness to outliers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Peel and McLachlan 2000)</ref>, and inclusion of variance and covariance from the underlying regression to correctly handle uncertainty in each neuron's response profile.</s><s>Our method is publicly and freely available <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blanchard 2016)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>To validate this method, we applied it to synthetic data sets with known category structure and show that it accurately Consider a set of neurons in which cells' tuning properties for two parameters are independently assessed and then z-score transformed.</s><s>Scatter plots are cartoon versions; each dot corresponds to a neuron; the two dimensions are two tuning dimensions.</s><s>A: neurons may fall into pure-selectivity clusters.</s><s>In the example, neurons are strongly tuned for parameter 1 or 2 but not both.</s><s>B: another possibility is that neurons fall into a single larger cluster selective for both variables.</s><s>In the presence of noise, it is often difficult to distinguish pure from multiple selectivity.</s><s>C: a third possibility is that neurons will have no selectivity for either variable and will be best classified as nonselective.</s><s>Some cells may be significantly tuned, but thus number is no greater than the false positive rate expected by chance.</s><s>D: a population of neurons can also contain a combination of subsets that are pure and mixed, as for example when a population contains subpopulations correspond to each of two variables and a third that integrates them.</s><s>E: neuronal populations can also contain other mixtures of these.</s><s>In particular, our data suggest that a combination of multiple and no selectivity populations are common, perhaps even universal, in reward regions.</s><s>F: conventional clustering methods make it difficult to judge categorical structure of populations.</s><s>For example, a method like k-means clustering will divide cells into two categories (two blue ovals) even if they are from a single distribution.</s></p><p><s>infers their parameters.</s><s>We then examined functional properties of neurons in four reward-sensitive frontostriatal brain areas in a variety of economic decision-making tasks [orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Blanchard et al. 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wang and Hayden 2017)</ref>; dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, <ref type="bibr">Azab and</ref><ref

Strait et al. 2014)</ref>; and ventral striatum (VS, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Strait et al. 2015)</ref>].</s><s>For all 20 sets of variables we examined (ones relevant to economic choice and executive control) we found the same pattern: neurons fell into only two categories, one category containing all task-sensitive cells, and another one containing cells best classified as pure no-selectivity.</s><s>We found no evidence for distinct categorical tuning in any of the data sets we analyzed.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the Model</head><p><s>Consider an experiment in which two variables are manipulated independently across several trials so that there is no correlation between their magnitudes.</s><s>In a risky choice, for example, these variables could be reward amount and reward probability.</s><s>Neural firing rates are recorded for a set of neurons over a few hundred trials as these variables vary randomly and independently from trial to trial and neurons are found to encode both variables.</s><s>We wish to know whether the population of neurons encoding these two variables is naturally organized into discrete clusters.</s><s>That is, are the amount and probability neurons the same neurons or separate classes of neurons?</s><s>Or are the variables assigned at random to individual neurons?</s></p><p><s>Our model employs a two-part estimation scheme.</s><s>First, we z-score the firing rates; then we analyze each neuron's responses with a linear model and compute regression weights (i.e., beta coefficients or values) for each variable as well as the variance and covariance in these estimates.</s><s>The beta values resulting from these computations summarize the response of each neuron to each variable.</s><s>Our analysis uses a separate regression from the mixture model for reasons of computa-tional efficiency, although it is possible in principle to integrate both aspects into a single hierarchical analysis.</s></p><p><s>Thus, the basic starting point for our analysis can be viewed as a scatter plot, with a point for each neuron located at its x-location the estimated effect for one task variable and its y-location the estimated effect on the neuron for another (see, for example, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The question we address is: what unobserved components drive the pattern in this scatter plot-are there underlying populations of neurons that are selective to both task variables, to one, or to none?</s></p><p><s>To answer this question, the collection of beta weights is modeled as a mixture of nonselective vs. task selective cells, and then as cell subtypes within the task-relevant categorization.</s><s>The no selectivity cells are assumed to have beta weights drawn from zero.</s><s>In practice, of course, the measured numerical value will be different than zero due to statistical noise in sampling and estimation; our model takes this into account.</s><s>Cells that are unlikely to be no selectivity are modeled as either pure selectivity (beta is zero on one variable and nonzero on the others) or multiple selectivity (the betas come from a covariance matrix).</s></p><p><s>All of the parameters are jointly inferred from the firing patterns, meaning that we can provide estimates of the proportion of cells that are nonselective (alpha), the proportion that are purely selective (beta), the covariance matrix of cells that have multiple selectivity (1-beta), as well as the probability that any individual cell belongs to any of these categories.</s></p><p><s>The inferred distribution on covariance matrices for the multiple selectivity cells is particularly interesting because it tells us whether, for instance, cells that respond positively to reward probability likely also respond positively (positive correlation) or negatively (negative correlation) to increases in reward.</s><s>Or, if this covariance matrix has zero covariance, that would indicate that individual cells have statistically reliable but independent responses to these two task variables.</s></p><p><s>The model also includes parameters for the "scale" of firing patterns, fit separately to each mixture component.</s><s>These parameters allow the model to fit the measurement scale used empirically as well as the range of possible firing rates observed.</s><s>This feature is important because it lets the model deal gracefully with large differences in tuning strengths in different data sets or across different neuron types.</s></p><p><s>Note that the inference scheme is not dependent on a specific procedure of fitting or clustering.</s><s>Our procedure is rather a statistical technique that gives the optimal (relative to our assumptions) beliefs about what parameter values are likely, given the observed data.</s><s>For example, instead of simply being able to state that 40% of cells are task relevant, we can say that there is a 95% chance that between 35% and 50% of the cells are task relevant.</s><s>(We provide median estimates and credible intervals below).</s><s>Thus, if the data are underinformative (e.g., due to a low number of cells or trials), our technique could tell us so-the parameter values will have a large range of possible values.</s><s>Moreover, due to our use of Bayesian inference techniques, the uncertainty in each parameter appropriately adjusts for the uncertainty in the others, meaning that our estimates of variables like the covariance in task selective cells correctly adjusts for uncertainty in the categorization, as well as the uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients.</s></p></div>

median regression coefficient variance in simulated data set Ï­ 0.0019, range in true data sets Ï­ [0.0019 to 0.0107]).</s><s>As described above, we regressed the firing rates onto their tuning variables, separately for each neuron, and then obtained estimates of regression coefficient and covariance.</s><s>We then fit our Bayesian model to these outputs.</s></p><p><s>We first tested whether the model could correctly identify that a population of neurons composed of a single population with multiple selectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s>The model correctly places all of its weight on the multiple-selectivity component (median multiple selectivity weight Ï­ 1, 95% credible interval Ï­ [0.93 to 1]).</s></p><p><s>We next extended our test to consider the case of a population of cells with neurons from each component (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4, A and  B</ref>).</s><s>In this constructed population, 25% of cells were purely selective for variable 1, 25% purely selective for variable 2, 25% had multiple selectivity for both variables, and 25% had no selectivity to either.</s><s>Our model was able to accurately estimate the proportions of no-selectivity neurons (correct answer: 0.25, model median weight: 0.25, 95% credible interval: [0.15 to 0.36]).</s><s>It also captured the proportion of the signal weight that was due to multiple selectivity (correct answer: 0.33, model median 0.4, 95% credible interval: [0.24 to 0.59]).</s><s>Finally, it accurately estimated the proportion of the pureselective neurons that were sensitive to each variable (correct answer Ï­ 0.5, model median weight Ï­ 0.53, 95% credible interval Ï­ [0.36 to 0.72]).</s></p><p><s>We then tested the model's ability to detect correlations in the neurons' tunings.</s><s>In a population of neurons with tuning to two variables, there is often a fixed relationship between how they are tuned to each of the two variables.</s><s>For example, neurons positively tuned to one variable may more frequently be positively tuned to a second variable.</s><s>This relationship would be observed, for example, if neurons encode value rather than its components (e.g., reward amount and reward probability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Strait et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Strait et al. , 2015))</ref>.</s><s>Note that in this case, as above, the two regressors themselves will not be correlated with each other, even if the firing rate is correlated with both of them in the same way.</s></p><p><s>To see whether our model can detect this relationship, we tested two more simulated data sets, with the same proportions of neurons coming from each of the components as above, but with a positive correlation of 0.5 between the tunings for the two variables for the multiple-selectivity neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, C-F).</s><s>The model again was able to correctly estimate the weights for each component.</s><s>It was also able to correctly estimate the correlation in the multiple-selectivity component (correct answer Ï­ 0.5, median for the population of only multiple-selectivity neurons Ï­ 0.45, 95% credible interval Ï­ [0.33 to 0.56]; median correlation estimated for population with all components Ï­ 0.54, 95% credible interval Ï­ [0.33 to 0.76]).</s></p><p><s>Because our model is designed to deal with extremely noisy data sets, we wanted to ensure that it converged to a single set of parameters as more data were added.</s><s>We therefore tested the model's behavior for a population of 50% multiple selectivity and 50% no-selectivity neurons.</s><s>The weights assigned to these guesses rapidly converged as more neurons were added (Figs. 5A).</s><s>We also examined a population of 50% pure-selectivity and 50% no-selectivity neurons (Figs.</s><s>5B).</s><s>Finally, we tested a population of 25% pure-selectivity to variable 1, 25% pureselectivity to variable 2, 25% multiple selectivity, and 25% with no selectivity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>).</s><s>In all three cases, the model quickly converged to the correct weightings after observing data from between 50 and 100 neurons.</s><s>Additional neurons produced greater convergence but did not qualitatively affect the data.</s></p></div>

define the boundaries of where our method is most usefully applied and to point toward further extensions of the general approach.</s><s>First, the model assumes a specific form of mixture components (nonselective, pure selective, and multiple selective).</s><s>If there were a population that did not fit into these categories-for instance, two distributions with different orientations-then the population would not be well modeled by our existing framework.</s><s>Similarly, if the distributions did not have zero mean or were not unimodal, the present method would not be appropriate.</s><s>(Note that our data were z-scored and thus forced to have a zero mean).</s><s>This limitation may not be as bad as it seems.</s><s>Any such data could be incorporated in principle into a mixture model like ours by mathematically defining and including the corresponding distribution with its associated free parameters.</s><s>For instance, numerous distributions with free orientations and means could be used in situations where there are few specific hypotheses about how neural responses are likely to behave.</s><s>In this way, our approach is an instantiation of a more general technique that is increasingly common, Bayesian data analysis, where a family of hypothesized generative models may be written down, and the data can be used to optimally infer how likely each model or parameter value is.</s><s>This family of extensions of our model which focuses on modeling the underlying components of the data is likely to yield deep insights into the organization of neural systems.</s><s>A third limitation is that our approach does not work with variables that are themselves correlated.</s><s>For example, suppose that we were interested in coding of mathematical expected value (the product of probability and stakes) and probability-these two variables are themselves strongly correlated with each other.</s><s>Our analysis could not deal well with this condition.</s></p><p><s>There are also limitations on the neural data that we present.</s><s>First, our data come from a relatively narrow range of tasks and from a relatively narrow range of brain regions.</s><s>These limitations reflect the nature of the data we had available to us to use, and reflect the importance of the questions to our laboratory.</s><s>Nonetheless, these are all association regions-neither sensory nor motor-as such our results do not provide information on whether such regions (or indeed other association regions) would provide categorical responses.</s><s>A
