<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>Immune paralysis in general, and neutrophil dysfunction in particular, are common phenomena in chronic liver diseases and increase the risk of infectious complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s>SBP is by far the most common bacterial infection in this context.</s><s>This is in contrast to malignant ascites, where SBP is a rare event <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , possibly indicating differences in the response to invading pathogens.</s><s>Although it has been suggested that the peritoneal cavity in cirrhosis might  be a privileged site with specifically reduced host defence mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> , there have been limited studies evaluating ascites' neutrophil function as a potential contributory factor to the specific susceptibility of the peritoneal cavity to bacterial infections.</s><s>We therefore evaluated phagocytosis and oxidative burst activity in both ascites and blood neutrophils derived from patients with and without cirrhosis.</s></p><p><s>In a significant cohort of 63 patients with decompensated cirrhosis, we showed for the first time that, when compared with peripheral blood neutrophils, ascites' neutrophils were severely dysfunctional, showing a reduction of phagocytosis and oxidative burst rates of approximately 50% and 70% respectively.</s><s>So far, only one study <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> has investigated the functional properties of ascites' neutrophils, looking at 9 and 19 patients with and without SBP.</s><s>The presence of SBP was associated with lower neutrophil oxidative burst activity, as compared to neutrophils derived from non-infected ascites samples, but activity increased during antibiotic treatment.</s><s>However, neither the phagocytic rate nor the functional properties of the peripheral blood neutrophils have been studied.</s></p><p><s>In comparison to previous reports, the functional properties of blood neutrophils in cirrhosis were found to be less depressed in our cohort, which might be, however, partly explained by a relative underrepresentation of patients with heavily impaired liver function <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Indeed, we could confirm a significantly reduced blood neutrophils oxidative burst rate when only patients with more advanced decompensation of the liver function (i.e.</s><s>Child C and MELD ≥ 15) were analysed.</s></p><p><s>An intriguing finding of our study was the high degree of variability of ascites' neutrophil function, ranging from 0.4% to 97.3% for phagocytosis and from 0.3% to 96.7% for oxidative burst.</s><s>This result was in contrast to the results obtained from the blood-derived neutrophils, in which the activity rates were more homogeneous, ranging from 86.8% to 99.8% (phagocytosis) and from 27.5% to 100% (oxidative burst).</s><s>This variability of ascites' neutrophil activity could not be explained by certain patient characteristics, such as liver function, inflammatory parameters or age, although it is known that activation, migration and response to bacteria of circulating neutrophils depends on the degree of liver insufficiency, systemic inflammation and age <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s></p><p><s>We therefore hypothesised that peritoneal cavity-and/or ascite-specific factors must exist, and are responsible for the observed site-specific differences in neutrophil function.</s><s>Appropriate neutrophil activation is closely regulated by a number of stimulatory, but also inhibitory, factors such as immunoglobulins, complement factors, especially C3b, cytokines (IFN-γ , IL-8, GM-CSF and TNFα ) and endotoxin levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>At the time of data acquisition and the ex vivo experiments, we were not able to directly measure these factors.</s><s>However, certain results may indicate the presence or absence of such stimulating or inhibiting factors.</s></p><p><s>We were able to stratify our results according to the ascites' protein content and leucocyte count as well as the cause of ascites (cirrhotic vs. non-cirrhotic), all of which are well-known predictors of SBP risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>We found no association between ascites' neutrophil function and their protein content.</s><s>However, because both tests -phagocytosis and oxidative burst -were performed using pre-opsonised E. coli bacteria, factors associated with the opsonic capacity of ascites fluid could not be studied in our test system.</s><s>In contrast to the phagocytic rate, the leukocyte count in ascites had a weak, yet still significant, impact on the oxidative burst rate, being lower when the leucocyte count was high, thereby confirming the results of Nieto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s>The oxidative burst capacity of neutrophils derived from non-cirrhotic ascites was identical to that seen in blood neutrophils, but the phagocytosis rate was reduced by approximately 30%.</s><s>As blood neutrophil function was maintained in our cohort, and neutrophils adapt to their environment, we hypothesised that the functional properties of ascites' neutrophils may improve upon transferral to patient plasma.</s><s>Indeed, phagocytosis and oxidative burst rates did recover when ascites' neutrophils were incubated with autologous plasma, showing an increase of about 25% in both function tests.</s><s>This observation is in line with results previously published by Nieto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , which showed that host defence mechanisms are not irreversibly altered in decompensated liver disease, and that treatment as well as active modification of ambient conditions in vitro restores neutrophil function.</s><s>Lebrun et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> were the first to show that the functional properties of immune cells can be manipulated by altering their environment.</s><s>Neutrophils of healthy blood donors were brought into contact with the ascites of patients with cirrhosis (n = 32) and those of patients with malignant diseases (n = 17).</s><s>Neutrophil function was assessed by chemiluminescence with pre-opsonised zymosan, a strong stimulating signal, in all samples and in four samples from a phagocytosis test using pre-opsonised Staphylococcus aureus cells.</s><s>All functional neutrophil properties were significantly more favourable in samples derived from malignant ascites, as compared to those obtained from ascites of patients with cirrhosis.</s><s>In addition, it was effectively demonstrated that a disequilibrium between inhibitory and stimulatory signals most likely contributes to the high variability of ascites' neutrophil function.</s><s>If the ascites of patients with cirrhosis were diluted with saline, their neutrophil function was partially restored.</s><s>In contrast, when cirrhotic ascites were diluted with their counterparts derived from malignant ascites, their function was significantly improved.</s><s>It has to be pointed out, however, that there was a lack of direct evidence for environmental factors affecting neutrophil functions.</s><s>Our results may, however, stimulate further research that would elucidate the functional mechanisms that are potentially involved in neutrophil activation and migration within the micro-milieu of cirrhotic ascites.</s></p><p><s>In conclusion, this study was able to show, for the first time, that neutrophil function in ascites is severely impaired.</s><s>This may explain the high susceptibility to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients.</s><s>The dysfunction of ascites' neutrophils may be partially restored after incubation with autologous plasma.</s><s>The high functional variability observed in neutrophils derived from ascites suggests that ascites' neutrophil function is dependent on both stimulatory and inhibitory factors.</s><s>Further studies are needed to clarify the individual factors involved in ascites' neutrophil activity, as these may become potentially interesting targets for SBP treatment and prevention.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and Methods</head><p><s>Study design.</s><s>Between August 2014 and May 2015, ascites, fluid and corresponding blood samples were consecutively collected from 63 patients with decompensated cirrhosis at the Section of Hepatology, University Hospital Leipzig, for the purpose of evaluating the ascites' neutrophil function by performing in vitro tests for phagocytosis and oxidative burst.</s><s>Patients with ascites but without cirrhosis (n = 8) served as controls.</s><s>All patients with ascites, who had been admitted to our hospital, were considered for participation in the study.</s><s>In line with international clinical practice guidelines 29 , paracentesis was indicated for new-onset or worsening ascites and in cases where SBP was suspected.</s><s>Patients with ongoing alcohol abuse, who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy or who were recovering from a liver transplant were excluded from the study.</s><s>The first paracentesis after enrolment was defined as the baseline for collection of ascites and blood samples.</s><s>Any subsequent paracenteses were not included in the present analysis.</s><s>All clinical and laboratory data as obtained exclusively during routine visits not related to the study, was collected retrospectively.</s><s>The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Leipzig (No. 182 -14 -02062014).</s><s>All patients gave written informed consent.</s></p></div>
