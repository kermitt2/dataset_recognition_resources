systems as a consequence of synchronization, in particular on the circadian time scale.</s><s>As one of the most important characteristics of precise time-keeping, synchronization has usually been assessed quantitatively using the Kuramoto order parameter <ref type="bibr">(Kuramoto, 2012)</ref>.</s><s>This order parameter, however, was developed for mean-field coupled systems and does not take into account the spatial organization of the underlying oscillating system.</s><s>As a consequence, it might sometimes fail to adequately quantify the degree of synchronization in oscillating systems where the spatial extension plays a definitive role.</s></p><p><s>Our main motivating example here is the circadian spatiotemporal dynamics recorded in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is a networked ensemble of circadian oscillators <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Reppert and Weaver, 2002)</ref> that can be entrained by external light conditioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Evans

and Herzog, 2005)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Starting some fifteen years ago, it became possible to look into the spatio-temporal patterns of clock-gene expression in the SCN from living cells by time-lapse microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kuhlman et al., 2000)</ref>.</s><s>A typical technique would be to introduce a reporter construct (either GFP or luciferase) downstream from the promoter region of what is called the 'clock' gene (e.g.</s><s>Per1, Per2, or Bmal1) that is rhythmically expressed or engineered to be fused to a clock protein.</s></p><p><s>In the case of a luciferase reporter system, the strength of bioluminescence is then considered a proxy for the abundance of the product of the target gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Yoo et al., 2004)</ref>.</s><s>Next, the single-cell reporter expression in the intact network of the SCN explant can be observed in real time by a cooled-CCD camera through a microscope, thus providing detailed information on the spatio-temporal pattern formation.</s><s>In the seminal paper focusing on the synchronization in the SCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Yamaguchi et al., 2003)</ref>, it was found that the phase distribution of the rhythmic gene expression across the SCN is governed by the presence of stable patterns.</s><s>Neurons in different regions of the SCN showed stable phase relations to each other.</s><s>It was also found that suppressing inter-neuronal communication by applying the sodium channel blocker TTX led to the disruption of the synchronized neuron rhythmicity in the neonatal SCN.</s><s>Following that paper, a number of technically similar studies appeared, aimed at capturing the features of the spatio-temporal pattern formation of rhythmicity in the SCN, focusing on either the wave-like patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fukuda et al., 2011)</ref>, regional specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Evans et al., 2011)</ref>, or spatial clustering <ref

type="bibr" target="#b31">Myung et al., 2012)</ref>.</s><s>The order parameter accounts for the global degree of the temporal phase coherence among an ensemble of oscillators.</s><s>In the context of spatio-temporal pattern analysis, the order parameter has a substantial drawback: it does not assume any particular order of interacting oscillators (e.g. the spatial relation of neighbors) and treats all oscillators as indistinguishable from each other.</s><s>A hypothetical situation with half of the oscillators being out of phase from the other half would result in a zero order parameter.</s><s>Our intuition, however, tells us that there is a significant amount of order in such a constellation.</s></p><p><s>Here, we argue that Moran's I (MI) <ref type="bibr"

basic idea of MI is to prescribe a notion of distance between each of two oscillating units.</s><s>If we are interested in patterns in space, the Euclidean distance between units would be the most natural choice.</s></p><p><s>We start by giving illustrative examples of MI with artificial datasets and explaining typical behaviors of MI depending on the underlying patterns.</s><s>As a biological application, we turn to the time series of luciferase imaging from the SCN explants.</s><s>MI reveals spatial order in paradoxical cases, such as the spiral state where Kuramoto order parameter R produces a null value.</s><s>We also show that MI has potential for characterizing the coupling topology of a network.</s><s>The experimental data reveal cases in which MI and R diverge, and it is
