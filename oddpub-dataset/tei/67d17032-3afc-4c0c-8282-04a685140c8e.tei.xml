<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p><s>Electrical neuromodulation of lumbar segments improves motor control after spinal cord injury in animal models and humans.</s><s>However, the physiological principles underlying the effect of this intervention remain poorly understood, which has limited the therapeutic approach to continuous stimulation applied to restricted spinal cord locations.</s><s>Here we developed stimulation protocols that reproduce the natural dynamics of motoneuron activation during locomotion.</s><s>For this, we computed the spatiotemporal activation pattern of muscle synergies during locomotion in healthy rats.</s><s>Computer simulations identified optimal electrode locations to target each synergy through the recruitment of proprioceptive feedback circuits.</s><s>This framework steered the design of spatially selective spinal implants and real-time control software that modulate extensor and flexor synergies with precise temporal resolution.</s><s>Spatiotemporal neuromodulation therapies improved gait quality, weight-bearing capacity, endurance and skilled locomotion in several rodent models of spinal cord injury.</s><s>These new concepts are directly translatable to strategies to improve motor control in humans.</s></p></div>

plate (2 kHz, HE6X6, AMTI) located in the middle of the runway or below the treadmill belt.</s><s>Concurrent video recordings (200 Hz) were obtained using two cameras (Basler Vision Technologies) oriented at 90 degrees and 270 degrees with respect to the direction of locomotion.</s></p><p><s>Analysis of whole-body kinematics, kinetics and muscle activity.</s><s>A minimum of 10 step cycles was typically extracted for each hindlimb in each experimental task and rat.</s><s>A total of 137 parameters quantifying kinematics (n = 118) and kinetic (n = 6) and muscle activity (n = 13) features were computed for each gait cycle using custom-written Matlab scripts and according to methods described previously 7 (all the computed parameters are reported in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To demonstrate the effects of experimental conditions and extract the parameters that captured the largest amount of variance across rats or between conditions, we

scores were extracted to quantify differences between groups or experimental conditions.</s><s>Parameters highly correlated (factor loadings) with PCs that discriminated the experimental conditions were extracted and regrouped into functional clusters corresponding to basic movement features.</s></p><p><s>Dynamic trunk balance.</s><s>To quantify improvement of dynamic trunk movement during quadrupedal locomotion, we computed the mean of an ensemble of parameters related to the orientation of the trunk, the variability of trunk movement and the amplitude of trunk movement.</s><s>All parameters are reported in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s>For each component of trunk movement (amplitude, orientation and variability), we expressed these parameters along a dedicated axis that reports the degree of similarity of these parameters to those measured in intact rats (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6e</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Muscle synergy extraction.</s><s>Muscle activation signals (electromyographic data) were high-pass filtered (30 Hz) with a zero-lag fourth-order Butterworth filter, full-wave rectified, smoothed with a zero-lag fourth-order low-pass (20 Hz) Butterworth filter, time interpolated over individual gait cycles to fit a normalized time base with 200 points and averaged across all gait cycles performed by the individual rat.</s><s>The electromyographic signal of each muscle was normalized to its peak value.</s><s>We then applied a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm on these curated muscle activation signals to derive the weighting components and temporal activation profiles of muscle synergies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s></p><p><s>Spatiotemporal map of motoneuron activation.</s><s>To visualize spatiotemporal map of motoneuron activation, electromyographic signals were mapped onto the rostrocaudal distribution of the reconstructed motoneuron matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>This approach provides an interpretation of the motoneuron activation at a segmental level rather than at the individual muscle level.</s><s>The maps were constructed by adding the contributions of each muscle to the total activity at each spinal segment.</s><s>The motor output pattern of each spinal segment Si was estimated by the following equation:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">S MNij MNj EMGj MNij MNj Ni i ni ni =       ⋅       ⋅ = = ∑ ∑ j j 1 1</formula><p><s>where ni is the number of EMGjs corresponding to the ith

Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).</s><s>GMMs were applied to the temporal activation profiles of motoneuron activation within each spinal segment.</s><s>Four clusters maximized fitting quality according to Bayesian information criteria.</s><s>This analysis highlighted two main hot spots along the rostrocaudal direction, and three main timings of activation corresponding to stance, stance-to-swing transition, and late swing.</s></p><p><s>Anatomical and imaging procedures.</s><s>Spatial distribution of hindlimb motoneurons.</s><s>Rats (n = 20) received injections of Fluorogold (2% in sterile saline, 30-80 µl per muscle) into the tibialis anterior muscle, and in the same surgery, into one additional muscle on the contralateral side.</s><s>The following muscles were traced: gluteus medius, iliopsoas, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, biceps femoris, gastrocnemius medialis, gastrocnemius lateralis, extensor digitorum longus, and flexor hallucis longus.</s><s>The location of the retrogradely traced motoneurons was reconstructed in 3D from serial spinal cord sections using Neurolucida.</s><s>To merge reconstruction from several rats into a unified digital library, the tibialis anterior motor column was used as a landmark in each rat.</s></p><p><s>Microcomputed tomography.</s><s>Repeated imaging of spinal implants in vivo was conducted using the microcomputed tomography scanner Skyscan 1076 (Bruker µCT).</s><s>Scanner settings were adjusted to avoid artifacts induced by metallic parts of the vertebral orthosis (0.5-1 mm aluminum filter, voltage 70-100 kV, current 100-140 µA, exposure time 120-160 ms, rotation step 0.5°).</s><s>The resulting projection images were reconstructed into 3D renderings using NRecon and GPURecon Server (Bruker µCT).</s><s>Rats were kept under isoflurane anesthesia during the scan to reduce motion artifacts.</s><s>Segmentation and 3D model were constructed with Amira (FEI Vizualisation Sciences Group).</s></p><p><s>Measurement of vertebrae and spinal segments.</s><s>The shape of vertebrae was measured using microcomputed tomography imaging.</s><s>The spinal cords of three rats were imaged, and the entire bone structure was reconstructed in 3D.</s><s>The 3D renderings were exported in the virtual reality modeling language file format WRL that was later merged with spinal tissue and dorsal root reconstructions.</s></p><p><s>Measurements of relationships between vertebra and spinal segment morphologies were performed on fresh tissue.</s><s>For each subject, the spinal segments were identified on the basis of the innervation of the dorsal roots.</s><s>The center of the segment was defined as the entry point of the rootlets.</s><s>After measuring the length of vertebra and the relationships between vertebra and spinal segments, the entire spinal cord was extracted and the roots moved perpendicular to the spinal cord to clearly visualize the segments.</s><s>The location and length of each segment was then calculated.</s></p><p><s>Reconstruction of spinal segments.</s><s>At the end of the experimental procedures, rats were perfused with Ringer's solution containing 100,000 IU/L heparin and 0.25% NaNO 2 followed by 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, containing 5% sucrose.</s><s>The spinal cords were dissected, postfixed overnight and transferred to 30% phosphate buffered sucrose for cryoprotection.</s><s>After 4 d, the tissue was embedded and the entire lumbosacral spinal cord sectioned in a cryostat at a 40-µm thickness.</s><s>To reconstruct spinal segment morphology in a 3D model, a Nissl staining (ThermoFisher) was performed on 25 even crosssections of lumbar and sacral segments, each separated by 0.8 mm.</s><s>The slides were assembled into the Neurolucida image analysis software (MBF Bioscience) to reconstruct lumbosacral segments in 3D.</s></p><p><s>Reconstruction of dorsal root trajectories.</s><s>After fixation, the spinal cord was extracted from the vertebral canal.</s><s>The dura mater was opened along the rostrocaudal axis and gently moved on the side.</s><s>For each spinal segment, the dorsal root ganglia were identified.</s><s>The corresponding root was retracted cranially and laterally.</s><s>The entire length of the root was painted, from the cut extremity to the entrance into the spinal segment.</s><s>All the painted roots from S3 to L1 were repositioned in their original location along spinal segments, and the dura mater was sutured using surgical wire (Ethilon 6.0).</s><s>The spinal cord was then frozen and cut into 80-µm thick slices using a cryostat (Leica Instruments).</s><s>Reconstructions were conducted using every other section, corresponding to intervals of 160 µm.</s></p><p><s>The slides were assembled into the Neurolucida image analysis software (MBF Bioscience) to reconstruct the color-coded dorsal roots in 3D.</s></p><p><s>Histology of explanted spinal cord with long-term implants.</s><s>After 8 weeks of implantation, rats were perfused and their spinal cords sectioned as described above.</s><s>Astrocytic reactivity was revealed by immunohistological staining against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).</s><s>Coronal sections of the spinal segments located below the implant were incubated overnight in serum containing anti-GFAP (1:1,000, Dako Z0334) antibodies.</s><s>Immunoreactions were visualized with appropriate secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher).</s><s>Sections were mounted onto microscope slides using anti-fade fluorescent mounting medium and covered with a cover glass.</s><s>The tissue sections were observed and photographed with a laser confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica).</s><s>Immunostaining density was measured offline using 6 representative confocal images of each lumbar segment per rat.</s><s>Images were acquired using standard imaging settings that were kept constant across rats and analyzed using custom-written Matlab scripts according to previously described methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>All analyses were performed blindly.</s></p><p><s>Morphology of the entire spinal cord.</s><s>All the 3D reconstructions derived from microcomputed tomography imagining and anatomical experiments were merged to generate a global model including the bony structure of vertebrae, the shape of spinal segments, and the trajectory of each dorsal root.</s><s>We generated a database using the STL file format, which is supported by many software packages and is widely used for rapid prototyping and computer-aided manufacturing.</s><s>This database is available for download at http://courtine-lab.epfl.ch.</s></p><p><s>Computational model.</s><s>Hybrid computational model of electrical spinal cord stimulation.</s><s>We previously elaborated and validated experimentally a hybrid computational model of epidural electrical stimulation of the rat spinal cord <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>The model combines (i) finite element modeling of the entire lumbosacral spinal cord to compute the electrical fields elicited by electrical spinal cord stimulation, and (ii) anatomically and biophysically realistic neural structures to derive the type of fibers and neurons activated by the stimulation.</s><s>In the present experiments, we integrated all the results from the traced hindlimb motoneurons (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and updated the positioning of the dorsal roots in the model with the new 3D reconstructions.</s></p><p><s>Computer simulations and model predictions.</s><s>We conducted simulations to identify the optimal electrode locations to activate interneurons and motoneurons located within extensor-and flexor-related hot spots of lumbar segments during gait.</s><s>Computerized simulations, neurophysiological experiments and pharmacological testing revealed that epidural electrical stimulation activates interneurons and motoneurons indirectly through the recruitment of proprioceptive fibers feedback circuits fibers within the dorsal roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, we performed computerized simulations that searched optimal electrode locations to activate proprioceptive afferent fibers (Aα fibers) running in the dorsal roots projecting to the targeted spinal segments.</s><s>The segmental distribution of extensor-and flexor-related hot spots during gait was derived from Gaussian clustering analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p><s>To optimize electrode configurations, a grid of electrodes was positioned over the modeled lumbosacral segments.</s><s>The grid combined five active sites per segment, resulting in a total of 30 electrodes.</s><s>Active sites were located over the midline, and at 750 and 1,500 µm from the midline for the more caudal segments (L4-S1), and at 1,000 and 1,500 µm from the midline for the more rostral segments (L2-L3) in order to conform the enlargement of lumbosacral segments.</s><s>The spacing of electrodes along the mediolateral direction was selected to maximize left-right specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s>To evaluate the ability of each electrode to access the targeted dorsal roots, we elaborated an optimization algorithm that calculated the cost to achieve specificity on the basis of four factors: (i) stimulation specificity for the targeted segments, (ii) ipsilateral versus contralateral specificity, (iii) minimum threshold and (iv) specificity of the neighboring sites.</s><s>The last term was important to ensure robustness in case of electrode misplacement, inter-individual variability and post-implantation migration.</s><s>For each active site, stimulations were delivered at increasing amplitudes ranging from 50 to 600 µA.</s><s>The resulting recruitment of Ia-α fibers was evaluated for each segment at each current level.</s><s>The total number of implemented simulations reached 112,500, which required approximately 8 d of computer time (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Acute electrophysiological experiments.</s><s>Motor-evoked potentials to validate model predictions.</s><s>Adult rats were anesthetized with urethane (1 g/kg, i.p., Sigma-Aldrich).</s><s>Bipolar electrodes were implanted into a pair of antagonist muscles spanning each joint of the hindlimb: gluteus medius, iliopsoas, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus.</s><s>An extensive laminectomy was performed to expose all the lumbar and sacral segments and visualize the dorsal roots projecting to each segment.</s><s>Motor-evoked potentials were simultaneously recorded in all the implanted muscles while delivering rectangular pulses (0.2-ms duration) at 0.5 Hz through epidural electrodes.</s><s>The electrode was positioned at the locations identified by simulations using dorsal roots and the spinal cord midline as anatomical landmarks.</s><s>The intensity of the electrical stimulation was increased progressively from 20 to 300 µA.</s><s>Electromyographic signals (12.207 kHz) were amplified, filtered (1-5,000 Hz bandpass), and stored for offline analysis.</s><s>The root mean square (RMS) of the motor-evoked potentials were calculated for each muscle, and represented in color-coded spatial maps of motoneuron activation that were directly meshed onto the spinal cord model.</s><s>The methodology to compute these maps is explained above.</s></p><p><s>Spinal implants.</s><s>Epidural implants were fabricated using ultraviolet (UV) photolithographic patterning of a photosensitive polyimide, as well as microelectroforming to create gold electrodes and embedded gold interconnects.</s><s>Polyimide is a mechanically and chemically robust polymer material that showed a high level of biocompatibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .</s><s>Processing of the implants was performed on wafer scale, which allowed parallel fabrication of ten devices or more on a 125-mm silicon wafer serving as carrier wafer.</s><s>Processing started with deposition of a 20-µm thick polyimide by spin coating on the silicon substrate.</s><s>UV lithography was used to shape the polyimide-based bottom layer, which constituted the footprint of the implant.</s><s>A 200-nm thick gold layer was deposited using vacuum evaporation and lithographically structured providing a conductive seed pattern.</s><s>Gold was then electroplated to a height of approximately 6 µm to create the electrodes and leads.</s><s>A 20-µm cover layer of photosensitive polyimide resist was applied by spin coating to uniformly cover the bottom and electrode structure.</s><s>A final UV lithography step was conducted to structure the top layer of the implant, and create openings over the electrodes and contact pads.</s><s>Before peeling off the implants from the carrier wafer, holes were punctuated through the polyimide using mechanical punching to promote the growth of conjunctive tissues that stabilized implants over time.</s><s>To create a connector, the contact pads located at the extremity of the implant were glued to a small support plate made of medical-grade PMMA sheet material.</s><s>Precision-milled alignment structures allowed fine adjustment of the support plate to the polyimide-based implant, and to the extremity of the leads.</s><s>The support plate contained a seat in which a tiny printed circuit board (PCB) with conductive stripes was fixed.</s><s>Stainless steel leads with FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene) insulation (AS-632, Cooner Wire) were directly soldered to the contact pads of the implant via the contact stripes located on the PCB.</s><s>The resulting implants and connective leads were highly reliable mechanically and electrically.</s><s>Finally, the entire contact area was covered with a UV-curable, methacrylate-based resin that provided tight sealing.</s><s>For improved biointegration, the contact interface was over-molded with a thin layer of medical-grade silicone (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Long-term functionality of spinal implants.</s><s>Induction of movement and motorevoked potentials.</s><s>The ability of spinal implants to engage specific muscles and to elicit distinct movements was tested using short bursts of stimulation delivered through chronic spinal implants.</s><s>After recovery from implantation (~2 weeks), rats (n = 6) were lightly anesthetized with ketamine and suspended in the air in a custom-made jacket.</s><s>Electromyographic activity was recorded at 2 kHz in conjunction with bilateral hindlimb kinematics (described above).</s><s>Stimulations were delivered at 40 Hz and synchronized with recordings of motor-evoked potentials and kinematic data.</s><s>Stimulation conditions were randomized and blinded to the experimenter.</s><s>To avoid repeated anesthesia of animals, experiments were repeated 4 times on one day.</s></p><p><s>To verify the long-term functionality of electrodes, motor-evoked potentials were recorded weekly in fully awake rats.</s><s>For each electrode of the spinal implant, single pulses (0.2 ms, 0.5 Hz) were delivered at increasing intensities.</s><s>The current threshold necessary to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the left and right tibialis anterior muscles was measured.</s><s>The values obtained were normalized to baseline recordings and averaged across rats and electrodes.</s></p><p><s>Electrode impedance.</s><s>The impedance of electrodes embedded in the spinal implants was recorded using a bipolar electrode configuration.</s><s>The counter electrode was created by removal of the insulation of a Teflon-coated stainless wire at its extremity and implanted the electrode subcutaneously.</s><s>Impedance at 1 kHz was obtained with a potentiostat equipped with a frequency response analyzer (Reference 600, Gamry Instruments).</s><s>Weekly electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of all the electrodes of the spinal implants were made in fully awake rats.</s></p><p><s>Real-time monitoring platform and control policies.</s><s>The real-time monitoring and control platform was implemented within a multi-threaded C++ code (Visual Studio 2010, Microsoft) running on a quad-core Microsoft Windows 7 computer.</s><s>Stimulation patterns were applied via an RZ5 processing unit (Tucker-Davis Technologies) connected to an MS16 Stimulus Isolator (Tucker-Davis Technologies).</s><s>The integrated Vicon recording system generated raw 3D positions of the markers, which were imported into the C++ environment in (soft) real time via Ethernet using the DataStream SDK software.</s><s>We developed a custom algorithm for online interpolation of missing markers through triangulation and relabeling of each marker to the appropriate joint landmark.</s><s>All signals were filtered online using least mean squares adaptive filters.</s></p><p><s>The control logic triggered individual electrodes based on trajectory of left and right hindlimb endpoints.</s><s>Triggering events were extracted for each electrode individually.</s><s>Control algorithms continuously calculated the angular trajectory of the foot around a virtual center of rotation in the sagittal plane.</s><s>The change in on-off state of each electrode configuration was triggered when the angular values crossed user-defined thresholds that were previously optimized for each electrode and rat during mapping experiments (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The algorithm calculated for each gait-cycle k the estimated position of the virtual center of rotation Ĉk derived from the trajectory T k of each foot in the

at every gait cycle as:</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ˆˆ( ˆ) C C + k k = − − − 1 1 µ C C k k</formula><p><s>with an updating factor µ = 0.2.</s><s>This approach captured the natural alternation of stance and swing phases during gait despite intrinsic variability within and in-between gait cycles.</s><s>This procedure was also inherently invariant to scaling, and compliant enough to detect triggering-times with high fidelity compared to other methods that exhibit increase in variability with deteriorated gait movements.</s><s>These control algorithms provide a flexible tool to study and implement phase-dependent modulation of neuroprosthetic system in real time during gait.</s></p><p><s>To evaluate the delay in the processing time of this loop, we simulated an input and recorded the time necessary to adapt the stimulation parameters.</s><s>This delay included the processing of video recordings by the motion capture system, the transfer of this data via Ethernet to a real-time control computer, the processing of these data using dedicated libraries, the changes in the parameters of the stimulus isolator, and the delivery of the modified stimulation pulse through the plug mounted on the head of the rat.</s><s>We sent concomitant pulses at opposite ends of the loop, and calculated the discrepancy between signals after each iteration for more than 100 successive cycles.</s><s>The computed delays remained below 20 ms.</s><s>Custom-developed C++ and Tucker-Davis Technologies codes can be made available through material transfer agreement upon request.</s></p><p><s>Behavioral recordings.</s><s>Behavioral conditions.</s><s>Rats were recorded under two conditions.</s><s>First, bipedal locomotion was recorded on a treadmill while the robotic body weight support system provided optimal support against the direction of gravity and prevented lateral falls.</s><s>Second, quadrupedal locomotion was recorded along a straight runway with a flat surface and along a staircase that combined a succession of 4 steps as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> .</s><s>All the experimental conditions within and between recording sessions were randomized.</s><s>Experiments were replicated at least twice on two successive days for each reported time point.</s><s>Behavioral recordings were blinded after stimulation amplitudes were set by one of the experimenter, who remained with the animal and remained blinded to the stimulation conditions during experiments.</s><s>A second experimenter who operated the recording equipment verified the appropriate timing of spatiotemporal neuromodulation during experiments.</s></p><p><s>Spatiotemporal neuromodulation in rats with complete SCI.</s><s>Electrochemical stimulation protocols were selected on the basis of an extensive amount of previous studies in rats with complete and incomplete SCI <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> .</s><s>The serotonergic replacement therapy used during training was administered systemically before testing.</s><s>After a few minutes, monopolar electrical stimulation currents were delivered between relevant electrodes of the implants and an indifferent ground located subcutaneously.</s><s>The intensity of electrical spinal cord stimulation was tuned (40 Hz, 50-300 µA, biphasic rectangular pulses, 0.2-ms duration) to obtain optimal stepping visually.</s></p><p><s>To optimize the timing of stimulation onset and end for each relevant electrode of the spinal implant, we performed a comprehensive mapping that linked the timing of stimulation with functional effects in rats with complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord.</s><s>For each rat (n = 5), the duration of the gait cycle (800 ± 156 ms, s.d.) was normalized then divided into 10 equal bins that served as triggering events to turn the stimulation on or off.</s><s>For electrodes targeting extensor versus flexor hot spots, the stimulation was turned on or off over the entire range of bins.</s><s>A total of 10 steps were usually recorded for each electrode and bin.</s><s>Temporal structure was optimized on the basis of the modulation of a few gait parameters that characterized the expected effects of the stimulation.</s><s>The timing of the electrodes targeting the extensor hot spot was driven by the amplitude of ankle extensor muscle activity, the amount of vertical ground reaction forces, and the intensity and amount of foot acceleration at push off (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</s><s>The timing of the electrodes targeting the flexor hot spot was driven by amplitude of flexor muscle activity, the amount of foot dragging, step height, and the intensity and orientation of foot acceleration at swing onset (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>).</s><s>These parameters were weighted equally for identification of the optimal temporal structure for each hot spot.</s></p><p><s>After optimization of the temporal structure, the ability of spatiotemporal neuromodulation to mediate superior facilitation of locomotion compared to continuous neuromodulation was tested in the same rats during bipedal locomotion on a treadmill.</s><s>A total of 10 to 20 successive steps were recorded during continuous neuromodulation (40 Hz, 20-200 µA, biphasic rectangular pulses, 0.2-ms duration) applied through electrodes located over the midline of spinal segments L2-L3 and S1 (conventional protocols) and through spatially selective electrodes located on the lateral aspect of the same segments.</s><s>Locomotor performance was compared with neuromodulation applied through the same spatially selective lateral electrodes

months after SCI, when functional recovery had plateaued <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s>Rats performed four successive trials without stimulation and with the serotoninergic replacement therapy and spatiotemporal neuromodulation, both along the runway and staircases.</s><s>Bilateral hindlimb and trunk kinematics were recorded during these trials.</s><s>The percentage of tumbles,
