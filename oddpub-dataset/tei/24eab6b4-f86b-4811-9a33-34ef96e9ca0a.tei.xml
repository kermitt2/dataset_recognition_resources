<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL strongly correlates with cell cycle arrest</head><p><s>For understanding common principles how melanoma cells are sensitized for TRAIL-induced apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation was induced by cell confluence, serum starvation, or CDK4/6 inhibition.</s><s>TRAIL-sensitive cell lines (A-375, SK-Mel-13, and Mel-HO) responded to TRAIL with 4-18% apoptosis at normal seeding (LD, low density: 50-60% confluence, Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>In contrast, TRAIL was inefficient in TRAIL-selected cells (A-375-TS and SK-Mel-13-TS) and in intrinsically TRAIL-resistant cell lines (MeWo and Mel-2a).</s><s>Seeding in high density (HD: 100% confluence at treatment) significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in sensitive A-375, SK- <ref type="bibr">22,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 11%)</ref>, as well as in A-375-TS and SK-Mel-13-TS (19 and 12%; Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).</s><s>Of note, enhanced sensitivity clearly correlated with G1 cell cycle arrest and reduced cell numbers in G2 (Figure <ref type="figure">1b and c</ref>).</s></p><p><s>Only intrinsically resistant cells MeWo and Mel-2a were not sensitized by HD alone.</s><s>However, further strengthening the antiproliferative conditions by combination of HD and serum deprivation similarly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in these cells (14-16%).</s><s>Also in Mel-HO, strongest enhancement of apoptosis (23%) was seen by this combination (Figure <ref type="figure">1d</ref>).</s><s>Enhanced sensitivity again correlated with G1 cell cycle arrest (Figure <ref type="figure">1e and f</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proapoptotic activation of caspases, mitochondria, and Bax</head><p><s>For unravelling the pathways mediating enhanced TRAIL sensitivity, caspase activation was investigated by Western blotting.</s><s>In A-375, some activation (processing) of <ref type="bibr">43 kDa),</ref><ref type="bibr">37 kDa),</ref><ref type="bibr">17,</ref><ref type="bibr">20 kDa)</ref> was seen by TRAIL at LD conditions, which was lacking in A-375-TS.</s><s>Caspase processing was strongly enhanced at HD in both cell lines (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).</s><s>The role of caspases was proven by the pancaspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh, which completely prevented TRAIL-induced apoptosis at LD and HD in A-375 and in A-375-TS (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</s><s>To distinguish between initial and secondary effects in course of apoptosis, time kinetic analyses were performed.</s><s>Apoptosis induction by TRAIL started at 6-8 hours at HD and LD, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>), which came clearly after the effects shown in the following.</s></p><p><s>Indicative for proapoptotic mitochondrial pathways, Δψm was significantly decreased at HD in A-375, A-375-TS, Mel-HO, Mel-2a, and MeWo.</s><s>It further decreased at HD/ − FCS (fetal calf serum), in parallel with enhanced apoptosis (Figure <ref type="figure">2d and e</ref>).</s><s>Of note, this happened as a consequence of the antiproliferative conditions alone (without TRAIL-induced apoptosis).</s></p><p><s>Bax was shown previously to exert decisive roles in regulating TRAIL sensitivity of melanoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Quast et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s>Significant Bax activation, as determined by an N-terminus-specific antibody, was seen in A-375 and in A-375-TS at HD conditions, as well as in Mel-HO, Mel-2a, and MeWo at HD/-FCS conditions (Figure <ref type="figure">2f and g</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROS production</head><p><s>We previously demonstrated the role of ROS in apoptosis control of melanoma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Franke et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Quast et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s>ROS levels were clearly increased in A-375, A-375-TS, and Mel-HO in response to HD conditions.</s><s>In contrast, TRAIL largely remained without effect on ROS despite in A-375 at HD, when high ROS levels were further enhanced by TRAIL (1.4-fold).</s><s>ROS were also enhanced by serum deprivation in Mel-HO, and strongest effects were seen at HD/ − FCS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a and b</ref>).</s><s>Thus, ROS were produced in response to antiproliferative conditions.</s></p><p><s>The critical role of ROS was proven by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine.</s><s>Pretreatment for 2 hours with N-acetyl cysteine completely prevented ROS production at HD in A-375 and Mel-HO (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c and d</ref>) and reduced TRAILinduced apoptosis at HD by 5.1-fold in A-375 and by 2.8-fold in Mel-HO (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enhanced TRAIL sensitivity by CDK4/6 inhibition</head><p><s>The critical role of cell cycle inhibition for TRAIL sensitivity was further proven in A-375, A-375-TS, Mel-HO, Mel-2a, and MeWo by the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991.</s><s>Alone, it remained without effect on apoptosis at 24 hours but strongly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in A-375, Mel-HO, and A-375-TS <ref type="bibr">(43, 17 and 19%)</ref>.</s><s>Only in intrinsically resistant Mel-2a and MeWo, apoptosis induction by TRAIL/CDK-I remained moderate at +FCS (7% and 8%).</s></p><p><s>As serum starvation had enhanced cell cycle arrest by HD in parallel with TRAIL sensitivity, it was close to test whether lack of FCS could similarly support CDK inhibition.</s><s>Indeed, TRAIL sensitivity was significantly enhanced by CDK-I/ − FCS in <ref type="bibr">MeWo,</ref><ref type="bibr">16,</ref><ref type="bibr">and 32%;</ref><ref type="bibr">Figure</ref>  <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).</s><s>G1 cell cycle arrest seen in all cells already by CDK inhibition was even more pronounced after additional serum deprivation (Figure <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).</s><s>There was a significant correlation between cell cycle arrest and TRAIL sensitivity at different cell culture conditions (correlation coefficient for Mel-HO: 0.87; for MeWo: 0.77).</s></p><p><s>CDK inhibition resulted in similar effects as seen before for HD conditions.</s><s>Thus, Δψm was reduced, and Bax was significantly activated in A-375 also by PD-0332991 at 4 hours (without TRAIL; Figure <ref type="figure">4c and d</ref>).</s><s>Only production of G1 (68%) G1 (81%) ROS in response to PD-0332991 was less pronounced at 4 hours (Figure <ref type="figure">4e</ref>).</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">G1 (65%) G1 (77%) G1 (77%) G1 (68%) G1 (68%) G1 (59%) G1 (72%) G1 (78%) G1 (79%) G1 (89%) G1 (85%) G2 (23%) G2 (11%) G2 (9%) G2 (18%) G2 (14%) G2 (5%) G2 (5%) G2 (14%) G2 (19%) G2 (13%) G1 (68%) G1 (68%) G1 (59%) G1 (74%) G1 (83%) G1 (88%) G1 (85%) G1 (73%) G1 (77%) G2 (19%) G2 (15%) G2 (26%) G2 (14%) G2 (16%) G2 (9%) G2 (17%) G2 (9%) G2 (4%) G2 (15%) G2 (10%) G2 (18%) G2<label>(</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decisive roles of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1</head><p><s>The dominant role of Bcl-2 became evident by its ectopic overexpression.</s><s>Thus, TRAIL-induced apoptosis, seen in mock-transfected controls (A-375-pIRES) at LD and HD, was prevented in A-375-Bcl-2, stably transfected for Bcl-2 overexpression (Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).</s><s>Also, the G1 arrest induced by HD was diminished by Bcl-2 (Figure <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).</s><s>The inhibitory function of Mcl-1 was seen by Mcl-1 knockdown, which significantly increased TRAIL responsiveness in A-375 and A-375-TS both at LD and HD (Figure <ref type="figure">5c</ref>).</s><s>As parental cells, A-375-pIRES responded with significant loss of Δψm to different antiproliferative conditions, which was strongly diminished by Bcl-2 overexpression (Figure <ref type="figure">5d</ref> and f) underlining the role of mitochondrial activation for TRAIL sensitivity.</s><s>In clear contrast, ROS production in response to HD and HD/ − FCS was not prevented by Bcl-2, rather appeared as even enhanced (Figure <ref type="figure">5e and g</ref>).</s><s>This suggested two independent pathways.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Upregulation of small proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins</head><p><s>Mitochondrial proapoptotic activation was suggestive to search for changes at the expression level of pro-and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.</s><s>No changes were obtained by Western blotting for antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-x L or for proapoptotic multidomain proteins Bax and Bak, when comparing HD and LD conditions.</s><s>However, when considering small proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which may act as triggers in apoptosis control, significant changes became obvious.</s><s>Thus, the BH3-only protein Puma was significantly upregulated by HD conditions in A-375, A-375-TS, SK-Mel-13, SK-Mel-13-TS, and Mel-HO.</s><s>Also Bcl-x S , the proapoptotic splice variant of Bcl-x L , was upregulated in SK-Mel-13 and SK-Mel-13-TS by HD conditions, as well as in Mel-HO by HD/ − FCS conditions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6a</ref>).</s></p><p><s>The decisive role of Puma was proven by small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategies.</s><s>Thus, two distinct siRNA sequences revealed identical results, namely complete knockdown of Puma (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6b</ref>), as well as a significant reduction in TRAILinduced apoptosis at HD in A-375 and A-375-TS (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6c</ref>).</s><s>Downregulation of apoptosis was 1.9-to 4.9-fold, thus clearly underlining the role of Bcl-2 proteins in this response.</s></p></div>
