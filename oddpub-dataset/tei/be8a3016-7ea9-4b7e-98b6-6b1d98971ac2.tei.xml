<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Local drug delivery.</head><p><s>Performing a Zone of Inhibition test revealed that the AMP2 incorporated into the polymer-coating remained bioactive and inhibited the growth of S. aureus in a dose dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>).</s><s>The activity, however, was much lower compared to gentamicin, as also seen in the MIC/MIB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p><s>A severe complication in orthopedic surgery is the development of an implant associated infection, which is difficult to treat and in most cases the removal of the implant combined with a prolonged antimicrobial therapy is necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s>The ideal antimicrobial drug in this case will be active against different bacterial strains, bacteria in a biofilm or internalized in the eukaryotic cells of the host without harming them.</s><s>Cationic antimicrobial peptides seem to be a promising substance class due to their broad activity and function.</s><s>The present study investigated five cationic AMPs regarding their antimicrobial activity and effect on primary osteoblast-like cells.</s><s>In addition, the potency to kill bacteria in a biofilm, as a severe complication associated with materials/implants used in orthopedic surgery, was investigated.</s><s>The tested AMP modifications showed antimicrobial effectivity against all tested bacteria, including 2 clinical isolates.</s><s>The AMP2 was also growth inhibitory and bactericidal for a clinical MRSA isolate, which is a very important finding high lightening the potency of AMPs.</s><s>The efficacy varied between the used modifications and a higher concentration compared to gentamicin was necessary (except for the MRSA) to inhibit bacterial growth and kill Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, which was also shown for other AMPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s>Due to the nature of the cationic AMPs, ions in the broth might cause an inhibition of the AMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>Therefore, the concentration of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ was varied in the broth and the effect on the AMP activity was investigated.</s><s>In 80% of the experiments no or minor variations in the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were detected for the 5 tested AMPs and the different bacteria.</s><s>In 20% of the experiments the MIC or the MBC was 3 to 4 fold increased in the MH ++ bouillon compared to the MH − bouillon.</s><s>The main decrease of antimicrobial activity of gentamicin or the AMPs was seen for P. aeruginosa cultured in MH ++ .</s><s>This change in the MIC of gentamicin against P. aeruginosa due to the supplementation of the medium with cations was also seen in a previous study indicating the impact of cations on antimicrobial activity of substances <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s>A prerequisite for the characterization of an antimicrobial peptide is the activity of the AMP in the presence of cations, representing more physiological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s>This was demonstrated in particular for AMP2, which was active against all the tested strains including two clinical isolates in cation enriched conditions.</s></p><p><s>The used antimicrobial peptides are part of a larger optimized peptide library.</s><s>The five peptides were selected based on their good broad range activity and difference in structure.</s><s>They were only 9 amino acids long and only composed of inexpensive amino acids.</s><s>That would allow a cost effective large scale production and therefore low extra economic burden for the health care system in case a peptide would be used routinely to prevent or cure infection of the bone.</s><s>In a previous study 49 peptides of this library were used and the antimicrobial activity mainly against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s>Beside M. tuberculosis also other bacterial strains were analyzed and this and the present study showed that the optimized peptides inhibit and also kill Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.</s><s>The antimicrobial activity of the used peptides, however, was unexpectedly much higher than in the present study.</s><s>To confirm that not the peptide caused this difference, the MICs against the reported strains was tested again by using the same provider of Mueller-Hinton broth as described before.</s><s>We could verify the previously reported MICs and therefore exclude that peptides were the source of this difference in MICs.</s><s>Further studies showed that for all-L peptides indeed there can be a strong strain dependency, caused by the amount of proteases produced or changes in the envelopment of the bacteria.</s><s>All-D peptides that are very stable against proteases did not show these effects (unpublished results).</s><s>MH broth is also not a well-defined media and could cause the bacteria to produce more or less proteases.</s><s>In addition, the pre-cultivation, and the used cultivation method might have an influence.</s><s>For the AMP2 used in the detailed analysis of the present study, the MIC difference for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis was approximately two fold.</s><s>Whereas it was much higher for S. aureus or E. feacalis, respectively.</s><s>In a recent publication from Mikut at al. more than 3000 9mer peptides were investigated in order to find activity rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s>The data confirmed previous observation that simple physicochemical parameters are not good predictors, but the right balance between R, K and hydrophobic amino acids (I, V, F, Y, and W) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s>There is also no positional preference for any amino acid.</s><s>The current set of five peptides, however, is too small to correlate activity and sequence, especially given the photolytic effects described before.</s></p><p><s>Another substance that might have an influence on the antimicrobial activity of AMPs is serum and/or components of the serum.</s><s>Svenson et al. demonstrated that the presence of albumin induced a 10-fold increase of the minimal inhibitory concentration of lactoferricin-derivates for Staphylococcus aureus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</s><s>It is assumed that this decrease in activity is due to the 1:1 binding of the peptide and albumin.</s><s>In a further study the effect of serum on hexcameric AMPs was investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s>Depending on the modification of the peptide the antimicrobial activity or the protease resistance was increased.</s><s>Testing the antimicrobial activity after addition of serum, however, showed a negative effect on the activity independent of the modification.</s><s>Therefore, not only the degradation in the serum might impact the activity, but also the increased ionic-concentration and also binding with serum components might be responsible.</s><s>In the present study serum decreased dosage dependent the activity of the AMP and this shows the importance of testing more physiological conditions than rather optimized culture conditions.</s><s>Serum  concentration of 0.1 and 1% decreased slightly the activity, and allowed us to perform the cytotoxicity tests and the internalization studies with primary osteoblast.</s></p><p><s>The highest concentration of all tested AMPs inhibited significantly the viability of the osteoblast-like cells, whereas concentrations necessary for killing all the tested bacteria had no negative effect on primary human osteoblast-like cells (except for AMP5).</s><s>The most antimicrobial active and less harmful peptide -AMP2-was then used for further studies.</s><s>Concentrations killing the different bacteria had no negative effect on osteogenic differentiation of the osteoblast-like cells and their migratory activity.</s><s>This is an important aspect, because a bony ingrowth of the implant is a prerequisite for the successful healing and the prevention of an infection and this will only happen, if the host cells win the "race for the surface" <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s>If the local cells would be impaired by the antimicrobial therapy, this osteointegration would not occur increasing the risk of infections.</s></p><p><s>During the surgical debridement the infected periprosthetic tissue should be removed and antibiotic treatment should kill all persisting bacteria.</s><s>However, bacteria such as S. aureus and S. epidermidis can invade host cells and may be protected from the host immune system and antimicrobial therapy resulting in an infection at a later time point 3 .</s><s>To address this possible complication the effectivity of the AMP2 reading the killing of internalized bacteria was investigated.</s><s>The concentration necessary to kill the bacteria under standard conditions (67 µg/ ml) inhibited significantly the bacterial load in osteoblast-like cells after 4 hours and inhibited their growth over a time-period of 24 hours.</s><s>Due to the fact that this concentration had no negative effect on the cell viability and differentiation, it can be concluded that the mechanism of crossing mammalian membranes is non-damaging.</s><s>This was recently also reported for modifications of cell penetrating peptides and AMPs, highlighting the potency of these two groups for new treatment strategies of intracellular infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s><s>Substitution of lysine with arginine increased the uptake of penetratin into HeLa WT cells.</s><s>The substitution of arginine by lysine, however, had the opposite effect, high lightening the importance of both amino acids in this process.</s><s>The AMP modification tested in the present study contains three arginine and one lysine residues, which might be responsible for the effective cell penetration seen and killing of internalized bacteria without harming the host cells.</s><s>A comparison with the three other modified AMPs was not done but might show differences due to the differing ratios of arginine and lysine.</s><s>However, the cell penetrating mechanism of peptides is not fully understood and might occur by direct translocation, endocytotic uptake or the formation of inverted miscelles <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> .</s></p><p><s>A further severe problem of implant associated infections is the formation of a biofilm that protects the bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .</s><s>Penetration of antimicrobial active substances is affected by the biofilm and the altered susceptibility of the bacteria in the biofilm to antibiotics requires much higher dosages of substances to kill the bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> .</s><s>Two independent approaches were used to analyze the effect of the AMP2 on biofilm.</s><s>In the first approach bacteria and biofilm were visualized with a fluorescent probe directed against the ribosomal RNA that is specific for staphylococci <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> .</s><s>In the second approach the energy production of the bacteria in the biofilm was measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .</s><s>Both methods showed that the AMP2 disturbed the biofilm (FISH) and killed the bacteria in the biofilm (microcalorimetry).</s><s>The microcalorimentry data clearly showed that for eradication of the biofilm a much higher concentration was needed as for killing planktonic bacteria.</s><s>The differences in the concentrations showing an effect for FISH or calorimetry can be explained on the one hand by the sensitivity of the two strains: S. epidermidis for FISH and S. aureus for microcalorimety.</s><s>On the other hand by the different outcome measure: FISH visualizes the biofilm and detects changes in composition and cell count, whereas the calorimetry quantifies the heat development of cells as a measure for viability.</s><s>Therefore, smaller amounts of the AMP disturb the biofilm without killing all the bacteria.</s><s>For killing bacteria in a biofilm higher concentrations are needed.</s><s>The two strains were chosen because they are the most relevant pathogens causing orthopedic device infections and biofilm formation.</s><s>The seen differences might be caused by differences in the biofilm formation and structure between S. aureus and S. epidermidis.</s><s>For example, it was shown that poly-N-acetylglucosamine surface polysaccharide (PNAG or PIA) and extracellular DNA (ecDNA) have different structural roles in S. aureus and S. epidermidis leading to different effects of degrading enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</s><s>Similar effects to the present study were seen in a previous study using also both methods to analyze the effect of antibiotic-loaded microparticles on S. aureus and S. epidermidis biofilms <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</s><s>Both methods showed that S. aureus (MRSA) biofilm was inhibited by a lower Daptomycin concentration than S. epidermidis biofilm.</s><s>This underlines the differences of antimicrobial susceptibility of the two Staphylococci and also the differences in the method.</s></p><p><s>Due to the increasing development of bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics, new therapeutic approaches and alternatives to antibiotics are needed.</s><s>At the moment, 19 clinical trials (Phase 1-3) for new antimicrobials including antibodies, probiotics, bacteriophages and vaccines are running <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>How many will reach the registration and when, can only be estimated.</s><s>A promising class of antimicrobial active substances are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).</s><s>Two AMP-like structures are approved for human use (Polymixin, Daptomycin) to treat skin infections and as reserve antibiotics, but three further AMPs failed FDA approval <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</s><s>At the moment, for two AMPs clinical phase 1 or 2 studies are running <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s>Within the last years the US and European agencies (FDA and EMA) realized the urgent need for new antimicrobials and changed their guidelines to encourage the development and approval of new substances <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> .</s><s>Taking the results of the present study together, the investigated AMP modifications showed an antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria at concentrations that have no negative effect on viability, differentiation and migration of osteoblast-like cells.</s><s>Higher concentrations killed internalized bacteria and bacteria within a biofilm.</s><s>A preliminary release study proved the possibility to incorporate
