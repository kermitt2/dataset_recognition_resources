activity.</s><s>By doing so, it abstracts from the high dimensionality of information contained in raw imaging data and unifies relevant structural and dynamical information within a single brain model.</s><s>The unified theoretical framework provided by TVB together with the processing pipeline for multimodal empirical data opens up new avenues of collective neuroscience.</s><s>TVB empowers the community to conveniently construct biologically informed brain models, to perform in silico experiments that predict neuronal activity and to expose principles of computation across spatial and

provided by TVB.</s><s>These challenges range from storage requirements due to large amounts of data, interoperability and interfacing between different toolboxes and coordinate systems, fallacies of dwMRI tractography to outcome validation.</s><s>Each of the imaging modalities serves different purposes during model generation and optimization within TVB:</s></p><p><s>(i) High resolution T1-weighted MRI scans are used to obtain parcellations of cortical and subcortical white and gray matter (WM, GM) into subregions of interest based on anatomical landmarks and to construct anatomically constrained dipole source models for forward modeling and inverse source reconstruction of EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG).</s><s>Resulting lead-field matrices and inversion kernels are used to map cortical activity to scalp locations of (M)EEG sensors and vice versa.</s><s>Furthermore, high-resolution scalp/head, skull and cortex-surface triangulations are used for highly resolved surface simulations and output visualization.</s><s>(ii) fMRI volumes are parcellated according to the high-resolution atlases derived from T1-weighted data yielding region-wise aggregated BOLD time-series and FC matrices generated from these are used to fit model output by means of parameter tuning.</s><s>(iii) Diffusion-weighted MRI (dwMRI) data are parcellated according to the high-resolution atlases derived from T1-weighted data yielding estimated white matter fiber tracts and SC matrices.</s><s>The parcellations are used for defining seed-and stop-locations during tractography.</s><s>(iv) EEG data is projected to source space and used to optimize parameters of the brain model.</s></p><p><s>Pipeline results are provided in a format that can be directly imported to TVB and readily integrated into a single full-brain model.</s><s>As part of this pipeline a novel tractography-based connectome extraction approach is described.</s><s>The method introduces several concepts that facilitate the standardization of the BNM construction process.</s><s>Connectomes are embedded at the core of the generic BNM equation to define long-range information transmission thereby linking largescale network infrastructure with neural mass dynamics.</s><s>In this context, connectomes are based on a given parcellation of the brain and consist of two matrices that describe the strength and the time-delay of signal transmission between each pair of brain regions.</s><s>Coupling strengths and distances (that are turned into delays by dividing through transmission velocity) define the mutual interaction of nodes within the BNM equation, which states in its most general form that the evolution of activity of a certain node in the network is the sum of its intrinsic local dynamics (often described by a neural mass model), input from connected regions, external input, and a term that accounts for different types of noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sanz-Leon et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s>Long-range input for a given population is computed by summing the scaled and delayed activity of connected nodes according to such strengths and time-delay matrices.</s><s>BNMs are-similar to models used in dynamic causal modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Friston et al., 2003)</ref>-biophysical network models of coupled differential equations that describe the underlying neuronal dynamics of observed data.</s><s>In contrast to DCM where typically only few regions are used (to enable Bayesian model inversion), BNMs attempt to model a whole brain network.</s><s>Similar to DCM, the coupling parameters of BNMs that predict neural activity form a hypothesis about how one brain region exerts a directed influence upon another region, i.e. their effective connectivity.</s></p><p><s>An important criterion for the quality of extracted subject-specific models is the ability to infer physiologically relevant individual variation.</s><s>In other words, the inferred inter-individual differences should outweigh estimation bias.</s><s>One goal of connectome extraction is robustness, i.e., low intra-individual variability of structural connectomes extracted from different data sets of the same subject, while maintaining biological variability that gives rise to differential dynamics between different subjects.</s><s>Metrics that estimate the rescan-variability of the pipeline show very high robustness and almost identical connectomes extracted from different scans of the same subjects (average intrasubject correlation r = 0.98), while maintaining between-subject inter-individual variability at the same time (average inter-subject correlation r = 0.89).</s></p><p><s>Apart from computational modeling, SC matrices are also analyzed with methods from graph theory to study the organization of the brain network and associate it with function <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hagmann et al.,

orientation of fibers, they will also have a high anisotropy and vice versa, regardless of the number of axons.</s><s>While it is true that anisotropy is modulated by physiological aspects like the degree of myelination, fiber density and packing that certainly affect connectivity strength, it is, however, not possible to disentangle structural effects like incoherent axon orientations, which is the rationale for probabilistic tractography (i.e., spread diffusion profiles as an indicator of crossing fibers).</s></p><p><s>While hardly any ground truth data exists for coupling strength estimation, the accuracy of tractography algorithms to localize existing major white matter tracts can be verified with a certain amount of confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Although validation of the topology of extracted connectomes is an active area of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Seehaus et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schreiber et al., 2014)</ref>, there is no dataset or method that is able to directly estimate connection strengths between regions for an entire brain.</s><s>Specifically, the strength of transmission in the sense of a brain network model, as employed by TVB, cannot be directly measured.</s><s>Furthermore, a method to experimentally probe and disentangle the composite effects of the simultaneous inputs that a region receives does not exist.</s><s>Note that while increasing efforts investigate the relationship between microstructural properties like axon diameter distribution and diffusion signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Sherbondy et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Pestilli et al., 2014)</ref>, there is no established relationship between such features and their coupling strength, which is one reason for a strength estimation approach that takes tractography biases into account.</s></p><p><s>The situation is aggravated by the fact that such connection strengths are only defined in the context of a particular biophysical BNM and therefore no universal unit for strengths exists.</s><s>In the real scale-free system, connection strengths have a certain physical unit.</s><s>For example each axon is capable of inducing a certain PSP membrane voltage change in the postsynaptic neuron.</s><s>Hence candidates are, e.g., voltage change in postsynaptic membranes, mean-field amplitude change, postsynaptic spike-rate, or some quantity of information content.</s><s>Connection strengths in the present context are expressed as relative quantities that only become functionally interpretable with regard to a specific BNM that turns SC into EC.</s><s>Local population models like those provided within TVB turn SC into EC by embedding them via population activity models into the interaction infrastructure of a BNM equation that couples local intrinsic dynamics according to the estimated connection strengths.</s><s>A global coupling-scaling factor rescales the relative SC matrices and turns them into values that assign absolute changes to each simulated population for a unit mean-field change in a connected region.</s></p><p><s>In order to alleviate the aforementioned issues and to standardize subject-specific connectome extraction we propose several aspects to make the connectome extraction process robust and reliable.</s><s>Tractography shows good robustness in localizing tracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011)</ref> while, up to now, no dwMRI based metric has been found that allows the direct inference of transmission strengths of reconstructed pathways.</s><s>Therefore, we opt for uncoupling of strengths estimation from tract reconstruction and to divide connectome estimation into two parts: (i) identification of pathways and (ii) estimation of connection strength.</s><s>Thereby, we disentangle the quantification of connection strength from the tractography process, which is only used to infer the existence of connections between all GWI voxels without making any assumptions about their strength thus eliminating the multitude of biases arising from trackcount based strength estimation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Morphologically informed coupling strength quantification</head><p><s>In the proposed GWI area normalized approach, quantification of connection strength is based on the assumption that the size of a region (i.e., the number of neurons in a circuit) correlates with the number of outgoing axons.</s><s>This assumption rests on the notion of a highly conserved and generic cortical microcircuit and a relatively homogeneous connectivity throughout cortex: across many species and regions lamina-specific micro-connectivity structures were found to be variations of a common template <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Buxhoeveden and Casanova, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Casanova et al., 2009)</ref>.</s></p><p><s>Since we cannot measure the number of outgoing axons of a region, we take the surface area that is used to connect two regions as an indicator of the size of the neural population (and thus outgoing axons).</s><s>Considering the homogeneous structure of cortical microcircuits we conjecture that large populations have a higher coupling strength than small regions.</s><s>Furthermore, since each voxel of the WM/ GM border can only contain a finite amount of axons (i.e., it constitutes a bottleneck to the number of axons) the maximum coupling strength that can be mediated through a GWI voxel must be bounded from above.</s><s>For example, if a fiber bundle connects a single voxel from one region to another single voxel from a different region, there is more space for axons to connect these voxels compared to a situation in which the fiber bundle forks and connects to several different voxels.</s><s>A corollary from this statement is that asymmetric strength matrices are possible in this tractography setup since tracks that occupy a bigger surface area on the GWI of one region can have a greater impact on a connected region where a smaller GWI surface area is occupied.</s><s>Thus, quantification of connection strength is solely based on the relative surface areas that are occupied by the pathways connecting each region-pair.</s><s>Tractography is only used to infer the existence of connections, while the estimation of connection strengths depends on the relative surface areas of cortex that are connected.</s><s>All tracks that connect two given voxels multiple times are aggregated to a single 'unique track'.</s><s>Each unique track gets either uniform weight or is weighted according to the fraction of unique tracks that are emanating from the two involved voxels resulting in two flavors of connectivity matrices.</s></p><p><s>The question of whether and to which degree cortical microcircuit invariance exists is a matter of ongoing debate.</s><s>The notion of widespread existence and homogeneity of ensembles of pyramidal cells surrounded by groups of ~100-200 neurons as basic cortical building blocks, known as minicolumns, enjoys wide support across areas, individuals and species <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Silberberg et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Douglas and Martin, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Casanova et al., 2009)</ref>.</s><s>Nevertheless, the assumptions made in this model are simplifications that might not account for several computationally important aspects, even if homogeneous microcircuitry and bottleneck-like qualities of the GWI are valid approximations for constraining coupling strengths.</s><s>Neuronal elements that make up basic microcircuits are differentiated into subtypes that vary in occurrence and density in different cortical areas.</s><s>Variance in cellular and synaptic organization and receptor distribution lead to considerable functional differences that are not accounted for by the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(DeFelipe et al., 2002)</ref>.</s><s>The model also clearly underestimates the eminent importance of sparse modulatory projection systems (e.g., aminergic neurons) for neural computation and also the laminar specificity of long-range tracts (e.g.</s><s>tracts that target inhibitory interneurons), which will, however, be added in upcoming versions.</s></p><p><s>Interventional empiric testing allows the generation of effective connectivity maps between remote locations on the basis of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEP) in epileptic patients with subdural electrodes.</s><s>With this technique distant field potentials are evoked by brief single-pulse electrical stimulation and averaged to compute CCEP maps.</s><s>Initial results that compare CCEP mapping with anatomical connectivity derived from tractography show a significant positive correlation between the two, essentially showing that pathways with high coupling strengths are more capable of transmitting high amplitude signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Conner et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s>Since techniques for mapping EC on the basis of brain stimulation are relatively recent developments, no studies exist up to now that relate the size of the stimulation site with evoked potentials at the target site, which would constitute an empirical validation of the employed assumptions.</s><s>In the absence of such studies, converging evidence can be collected from modeling results that investigate the success of different connectome extraction approaches in predicting functional data in the context of BNM.</s><s>Correlation of connectomes with phenotypic or other traits can shed light on their biological plausibility, e.g., preliminary partial least square analyses of resulting connectomes showed significant age-depended modulations of several network features (e.g., density of individual axonal tracts (r = .82,</s><s>p b .01,</s><s>95% CI [0.77,

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homogeneous sampling from seeding locations</head><p><s>Another consideration to prevent tractography biases and to standardize tractography approaches is to use a fixed number of tracks that are to be generated instead of a fixed number of seeding attempts in order to ensure homogeneous sampling from seeding locations.</s><s>During the tractography process a considerable proportion of tracks are rejected due to the violation of tractography constraints.</s><s>The reasons for track rejection are highly dependent on the individual anatomy of a subject and can even vary within different acquisitions of the same subject due to several reasons like, e.g., scanner noise or partial volume effects.</s><s>By specifying the number of tracks that the algorithm has to generate it is ensured that an equivalent sampling of WM was attained during different tractography runs to get comparable track counts.</s><s>In order to make raw track counts comparable across subjects, strengths matrices can be normalized by the number of streamlines used, making connection values independent of the inter-individual differences in size of the GWI.</s></p><p><s>Another aspect of common tractography approaches that impairs standardized and comparable tractography results is the fact that during many tractography setups seeding masks are used as input that comprise several seeding voxels.</s><s>Some tractography algorithms will then initialize uniformly distributed seeding locations at subvoxel resolution for each seeding voxel.</s><s>However, not every seeding attempt will produce a valid track.</s><s>The number of tracks that are generated for a given amount of attempts varies from voxel to voxel and depends on local anatomical conditions, the form of the fODF and the random numbers that are drawn in each tractography step.</s><s>Therefore, it is likely that situations arise in which a subset of voxels produced a high number of valid tracks while the remaining voxels only produced intermediate or small numbers of tracks.</s><s>In order to ensure comparable sampling of seeding locations and to avoid overestimation of connections from a subset of voxels that are more likely to produce valid tracks than other voxel, it is necessary to ensure homogenous sampling from each seeding location.</s></p></div>
